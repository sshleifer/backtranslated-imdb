An interesting idea covering an alternative dimension in the hospital. He recalled - Stephen Kings "Langoliers", "Kingdom Hospital" and old episodes at dusk. The atmosphere was strong, the configuration was great. There were also very clever moments of the "time loop" that always attract attention. The story had many obscure references, which led me to believe that all the strange phenomena, such as slips / ghosts / bizarre winged bat demon and rather stupid ghoul with heavy metal, will be explained. And it was that Dark Floors seriously disappointed me. Based on my viewing, the movie does not give any explanations about the events. Although there is always some ambiguity expected in these kinds of films. The dark floors have made them reach a new level of ambiguity. I do not expect things packed into a beautiful ribbon, but I should not be feeling either. "Huh? .. This is it? ... Did I dose? Maybe by mistake I came across a chapter? " Dark Floors left me with a deeply unsatisfying suspicion that "It was all a dream", which is a shame because I was on board until the last drum and enjoyed the movie.
