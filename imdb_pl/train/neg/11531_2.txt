The plot is so manipulative that it is based entirely on the most unbelievable and unthinkable decisions of adults in every parental decision. Children are great when it comes to charm and line delivery, but as I say, the whole story depends on whether every adult person is a complete idiot, so in the case of TEGO, he has more sense in his actions (and at the same time is the only way to explain actions of boys with total distrust). Why should we take over cute boys taking their child off shore? How did the child reach the shore and at the same time consider it the LAST place to search? Why will not two boys NEVER be informed, and yet lack a child, that no one gives a figure, that they run with food and diapers with all this confusion and literally anywhere else that he has searched? There is no reason to ask the audience to believe it. A request to believe that this will happen, that the attempt (even informal surroundings) is too offensive to expose her.
