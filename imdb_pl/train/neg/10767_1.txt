Not only was this the most expensive Canadian film ever shot in BC, but it was certainly the worst, without seeing the light of day. The director is not even a Canadian, but a British, and the boy shows it. We were all created to be a band of abusing devils and morons. The spirit of what it means to be a Canadian is absent, and this is to be the reason why we finance this bed. Of course, the British character is normal. The rest is a collection of sitcom stereotypes - can you say "Norm !!"? Photos stretch from nice postcards to dark silhouettes in rooms. Actors always seem restless. Are they as bored as the spectators, is this the idea of ​​cinema directors? Avoid this mess and check out some Bruce McDonalds movies. A real Canadian boy with an original movie to say. You will not have to go to HIS movies after 10 minutes.
