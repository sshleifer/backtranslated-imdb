Regardless, it is an amateur, exhibitionist film - or an effort in one - which is as interesting and bold as a poet's moody high school student book. Of course, this will interfere with viewers who are determined to prevent them, but the success will be attributable to themselves, not the director. Real under the skin requires sensitivity, discipline, technique and talent, as well as the eye and ear. The film contains one suggestive image, shown as motionless (and also used in the case of video), but without a development leading to or from it. If the director had an eye, he would see it as a possible starting point for an interesting movie - a film.
