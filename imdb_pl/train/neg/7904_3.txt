Funny looking small boogers that spawn and reproduce. As for now, for the horrors that this movie has. All the rest of MUNCHIES is like a really late comedy, which is so stupid that after 15 minutes it will not be fun anymore. I can imagine small children cheering for these little boogers, but adults will only remain with these allegedly "intelligent" references to things on the screen, such as Captain Kirk's journal entries from STAR TREK, the most known ET scene flagging the statement of filmmakers "See! We make a living here on the success of GREMLINS! "And the cutout from Clint Eastwood's cardboard tells us ... what exactly about his western films? The latter was completely lost to me ... Oh yes, and removing chemical waste in caves seems to be a bad thing. I do not know where this idea came from. <br /> <br /> Not saying that MUNCHIES is the most unbearable movie that's about. It's really stupid. And if you manage to smash your smile while watching, you'll probably feel just as stupid that you did after the movie. <br /> <br /> Good evil? Yes, but only if "stupid", "delayed" and "funny" are the criteria you are looking for. 3/10 and, well, uhm, 6/10.
