Director F.W. Murnau wisely stuck in the silent film medium that he knew so well to discuss the history of the islanders' native life on the southern seas. The documentary style works very well in the first half of the movie. The landscapes are beautiful, and the everyday life of the islanders is interesting. The film, however, loses momentum when it begins to focus more on the narrative story of two doomed lovers. The plot is never so interesting, although Murnau does it well. He won an Oscar for the best shots, although the award should probably be the best in the scenery. You can not really admit DP for taking pictures in such a beautiful place.
