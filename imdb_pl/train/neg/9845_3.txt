!!!! POSSIBLE MILD SPOILER !!!!! <br /> <br /> When I watched the first half of the AS SIN GUILTY, I could not believe it was made in 1993 because it played like the JAGGED EDGE / Joe Eszterhas clone from the mid-'80s. It starts with murder, and the audience has the muse "Is he guilty or innocent and will he go to sleep with his lawyer?", But in the middle of the movie shows his origins from the 90s, turning into a "lawyer gets manipulated and persecuted by her film type a client who ends in an absurd way, and GUILTY AS SIN has an even more absurd ending in this regard. <br /> <br /> This is a very bad thriller, but the most unforgivable thing about it was directed by Sidney Lumet, the same man who brought us all the time a classic drama in the courtroom 12 ANGRY MEN
