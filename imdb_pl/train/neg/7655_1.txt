We should all congratulate Uwe Boll. He did what was unthinkable. He can be the only director who has two videos at the bottom 100 on IMDb! It's like a movie roach. No matter how little talent he has and no matter how bad the films are, he manages to create them. I know that he finances it himself by some bizarre German fund, but nevertheless his ability to make films despite absolute total failure is one of the great mysteries of the universe. <br /> <br /> It would not be so bad, except that video game developers still give the guy the best features. I really liked the Alone in the Dark series. Even the newest, New Nightmare, was good for a few hours of play. Edward Carnby's adventures made a good movie, but that's not it. Now Uwe Boll got his hands in Bloodrayne and Hunter: the Reckoning. What's next, Silent Hill? Moose? I can only imagine the swath that this guy will go through adapting the game to the movie if it is not stopped. Someone has to take his credit line, or those video game publishers have to be divorced and realize that when they make a bad movie from a game that kills a franchise, nobody is interested in that title anymore. > <br /> Think about whether House of the Dead or Alone in the Dark is the real title of the game? No way. The new game House of the Dead comes out on the X-Box and nobody cares. The title is dead, and all thanks to Uwe Bolla. So if any of you work for a game publisher or know a game publisher or have access to a game publisher ... please warn them. <br /> <br /> This movie is not even worth reviewing. I can not separate what I did not like in this pile of dung from the rest. Literally everything sucks in that. Writing, acting, music, CG effects, editing. I thought that if I waited for him to appear on a DVD and then rent him out with low expectations, I would not be disappointed. Boy, I was wrong. Never underestimate Uwe's ability to throw a large, steaming BOLL sh * t stack.
