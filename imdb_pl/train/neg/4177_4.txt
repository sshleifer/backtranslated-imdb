The second movie in the set. Originally titled Bloodsuckers, this movie was quite average. In some parts it is boring, but there are good gore effects, but they are not great. <br /> <br /> The movie takes place in 2210. Vampires have taken over the whole world. V-SAN (Vampire Sanitation) Squad, who has his own spaceship and is led by Churchill, who is captured by vampires, receives a message from Earth and the band, created by Quintana (played by very hot Natassia Malthe), novice Damian and rebels Rosa and Roman (Roman plays Aaron Pearl with Wrongfully Accused). V-SAN later meets the leader of the Muco vampires, played by Michael Ironside from Total Recall. There are no plans for a peaceful life with people because it is focused on world domination. <br /> <br /> Although this movie was not a waste of time, I doubt if I will return to the DVD player in the near future.
