December holiday promotions, such as the original Frosty, should be richly produced with high quality music and a healthy but light story. They should have a bit of the mystical magic of Christmas. Basically they should look, sound and feel ... well, "special" and should have a decent and appropriate December holiday subtext. <br /> <br /> So when I saw the TV list Legend of Frosty the Snowman auctions, I have my children (6 and 8) inflated to it, telling them the story of the original Frosty and telling passionately how much I liked the child. When my wife and kids were hugging the couch to watch the movie, the expectations were high, but 10 minutes ago my children were yawning, and I and I gave each other a "look" and rolled our eyes. After 35 minutes, my children really wanted to go to bed - I think they had enough of an insensitive language and senseless, disconnected segments. I was ashamed of their (and my) disappointment with this film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Legend of Frosty the Snowman is more like a bad episode of Fairly Odd Parents crossed with a worse than the normal episode of Sponge Bob than a classic holiday movie. Do not get me wrong ... these concerts are okay and I like them the same as the next guy, but when I watch Strange parents or SpongeBob, my low expectations (for average, colorless, no subtext, mind stretches) are always happy. <br /> <br /> We chose a few good books and spent the rest of the evening reading together. A much better choice than the embarrassingly evil Legend Frosty the Snowman.
