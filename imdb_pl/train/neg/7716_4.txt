I only saw the movie once when I was quite young, so most of the movie is indistinct, trying to remember it. However, I can say that it was not as fun as a movie called killer tomatoes, and the most memorable thing from this movie is a song and scene with an older couple talking about poor Timmy. In addition, the movie is really just scenes of small tomatoes and large tomatoes rolling around, and people behave horrified and terrifying as people should do in this type of film. However, having a very stupid assumption and a catchy theme song is not a good comedy. Granted that this movie is supposed to be a B movie, it should not be taken seriously, but you should still make jokes that are fun and not try to extend the gently funny idea of ​​a full-fledged movie. Perhaps a short one would be good, because the trailer showing the above-mentioned older pair and the man desperately trying to shoot down a larger tomato was actually quite good. The trailer itself looked like a trial trailer, but in reality they did not make a full movie and rather a weak one.
