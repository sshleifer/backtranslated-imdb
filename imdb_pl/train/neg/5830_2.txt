Drawing Restraint 9. dir: Matthew Barney. <br /> <br /> How do you know that you are in the middle of a pretentious artistic film? Are these just 8 lines of dialogue in 140 minutes of the movie? Is it when Bjork has something that looks like gigantic fur pita in a pseudo-Asian ritual? Maybe when the mums and spine columns are used in a whale fat experiment. Or, when are you ready to kill the composer for making the minimal and still annoying version of Philip Glass's score? In any case, Drawing Restraint 9 is one of the most pretentious films of contemporary art. After 135 minutes, it increases his grudges when he gets bored to start. I would call the use of a stunning color and interesting opening sequence, but the rest of the movie looked like it was shot for a Discovery Channel documentary. That is, until it looks like they tried to film their version of P-ss Christ, but it will appear later. <br /> <br /> Actually, the documentary parts were the best parts. A plot of land concerns a whaler, followed by a whaling fat ritual. Then there are guests in the form of Bjork and Matthew Barney, who are greeted on the ship by a ritual of humiliation, including shaving their heads (think of pranks), nicotine patches and huge fur pita hats. Then there is mutual evisceration, cannibalism and let us not forget about the gigantic task. <br /> <br /> Matthew Barney wrote that this is about the "relationship between self-imposed and creative resistance". It's almost like saying: "If you do not understand it, then you're not creative in interpretation, so do it off because I'm an artist." Oh, wait, this is a POST-modern interpretation of this sentence and what the film would be about if it was POST-modern. But this is to be modern art. What applies to the art itself. <br /> <br /> So let's start with this whole piece of interpretation, is not it? The next poems are only 3/4 serious and should not be considered as a realistic attempt to interpret the film. <br /> <br /> The first half hour concerns divers with pearls and the construction of a giant ramp. Of course, the ramp symbolizes the need to rise to all the standards that are dear to you, and pearl divers seek the pearls of wisdom. Then, on a whaler, they build a chest that looks as if it's in the raw whale shape. Of course, the raw element of the announcement. <br /> <br /> On the ship they make whale fat inside the shape of the whale and take out some of the fins. They replace it with the spine and later with a gigantic turd. These should be the states of the film itself. When his fat is funny, but bad for you. When it is the spine, its "important" parts of the film or the spine, so to speak. Then the gigantic turda is the entrails of the movie, or when the movie is nonsense. <br /> <br /> Bjork and Matthew Barney arrive on separate ships, are placed in strange humiliating outfits that CAN NOT BE EVEN OR SYMMETRIC, suspected that they ran out of money and Barney tried to quit smoking. Yes, they put patches on his head. They go through the ritual and learn about the ship from a Japanese sage who tells them that the ship is scarred when another ship hits it; breakdown or intersection if you like. This inspires Bj√∂rk and Barney, who are different on the outside, to start cutting off their legs and eating them so that they can become whales themselves and be the same person. They intersect. Oh, did I forget to mention that it was done in the Robbie Williams movie? Then the divers from pearls return with their mouths full of knowledge pearls that let you fall to make a stupid Venn diagram. Of course, Barney survived the geometry of the eighth grade. Or maybe at least some social research. <br /> <br /> Oh, and did I forget to eavesdrop on the ears of Bjork, whom I want to kill? Sometimes it's hypnotic, but in others you just want to kill her. <br /> <br /> A film about art is one thing, but when you just throw all kinds of symbolism in the hope of people's reaction, it becomes a self-destructive joke. When will you cross the line between a joke in terms of art? Dali and Bunuel often made surreal nonsense, but they were more coherent and / or funny than this piece of rubbish. Un Chien Andalou had the sensitivity to cramming as many symbolisms as possible in less than half an hour. <br /> <br /> So, can I recommend it? Only if you like boring HIGH ART movies with lots of symbolism and flat images. <br /> <br /> D +
