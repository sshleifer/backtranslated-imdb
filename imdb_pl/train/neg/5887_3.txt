Jane Russell turned out to be a stunning performer of the musical comedy in a similarly titled "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"? but unfortunately this movie will waste these skills. There is a budget and a nice Parisian photo, but the movie simply does not work. Mrs. Russell seems to play Marilyn Monroe. This does not leave anyone the right Jane Russell game. Some other players are SELLER from their item. <br /> <br /> There are some embarrassing scenes; First of all, warn: there is a musical number in which stupid African cannibals "cook" brunettes in a pot after Alan Young sings in a gorilla suit. <br /> <br /> This is interesting, sometimes embarrassing, waste of resources. <br /> <br /> *** Gentlemen Marry Brunettes (10/29/55) Richard Sale ~ Jane Russell, Jeanne Crain, Alan Young, Scott Brady
