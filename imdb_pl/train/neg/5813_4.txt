Tierney is an authentic tough guy, but this failed film from normally competent CPR undercuts his influence at every step. The script is as trustworthy as OJ Simpson at the dinner of the Ten Cmmandments. Just count the times when Tierney's amazing companions swallow one bad excuse for the other for his evasive and violent acts. The old stereotype that "only happens in movies" is applicable in spades. There is also a guy playing in the watchman, who apparently wandered from comedy WC Fields, ruining a dangerous mood. Static one-room sets also do not help, and the director Feist does not feel a clear lack of material sense. Then add the final chase behind the car that lacks both imagination and profitability, and the results are quite flat. In fact, the film only gathers in the station-station scenes, where hard-bitten cops discover the hidden powers of innocent-looking gas station employees. It is a pity that Tieney's career has never been really gelled. I understand that this was largely due to being a hard guy out of screen, as well as getting into one poor landing after the other. His ice-cold way and the brightness of emotions remind me sometimes of Lee Marvin's best with his tough guy. Anyway, this project could act as a radio game, but as a film with a promising noir title, it's a disappointment.
