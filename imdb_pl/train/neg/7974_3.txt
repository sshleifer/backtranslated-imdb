It's interesting at first. The naive guardian of the park (Colin Firth) marries a lovely, mysterious woman (Lisa Zane) whom she knows only for a short time. They seem to be happy and then disappear without warning. He is looking for her and after a few dead ends he encounters some of her abused childhood and a poor recent past that may involve criminal activity. And then it seems that the filmmakers did not know what to do with this story. The beginning, although not as uncertain as it seems, is at least observable. Then it ceases to be interesting and even makes sense. And the ending is so bad, so boring and so lacking in emotion and intelligence that screenwriters do not know what to do about it and get bored trying. What a pity to waste a good idea!
