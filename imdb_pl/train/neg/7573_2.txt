This film is a vehicle of the Schwarzenegger clone Alexander Nevsky. His charisma, however, is not enough to raise this film beyond the level of his poor script. He has little to add to his Arnie. <br /> <br /> Michael York is quite pathetic as a begging diplomat. Watching him return to his D'Artagnan act since he was a better actor made me feel uncomfortable. Come on, you can do better! <br /> <br /> The story is full of holes and unexplained relationships; the tip of this calculation is informer Vlad, who sounds like an American woman, but from the context it seems that he works for the Russian government department. <br /> <br /> Although the story takes place well after the end of the communist regime, all Russian characters are still very communist. In contrast, Vlad can drive a commercial vehicle as a police car. Action scenes are poorly shot and therefore they lack dynamics. <br /> <br /> You do not need to watch the movie ...
