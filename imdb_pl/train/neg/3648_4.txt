A childless couple (Brooke Adams, Jeff Hayenga) goes to the doctor (James Karen) to try to get pregnant. It works, but Adams slowly realizes that something is wrong with the child ... <br /> <br /> A pretty interesting idea has been carefully worked out by a bad script - the basic idea is OK, but it becomes blatantly predictable towards the end. I saw every upcoming "turn". The direction is weak - it seems that he has no idea how to perform the basic stage. Production values ​​are - to be nice - bad. Very dirty. And the blood scenes are too unpleasant (I almost turned them off when the pregnant woman started stabbing her stomach) with bad special effects. At the end of the movie, it's totally spinning when it becomes obvious that they had no idea HOW to end this movie. <br /> <br /> Some good acting make it a bit livable. Adams, Hayenga and Karen are good at their roles and they watched me, but that's all. This film was barely released in 1991 and remains unknown - it's easy to understand why. I give it 4.
