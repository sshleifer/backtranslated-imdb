This film is a promising start, and then becomes very confused and confusing. Kamal Hasan made every effort to make the period look good, it is a pity that he did not spend more time on the plot. Most of the small characters in the film appear for no particular reason. <br /> <br /> Generally very disappointing, I recommend avoiding this movie.
