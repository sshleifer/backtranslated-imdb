An absolutely terrifying Mexican movie based on a story by Edgar Allan Poe about a reporter who wants to go to a hideout in the woods to write a story about how it works, etc. When our hero, Gaston, is considering the big show of Dr. Maillard, head of asylum, we see all kinds of things that should be frightening, such as men long hanging in dungeons and comedies, as our hero joked by soldiers as he descends a ladder hanging from the side of the building. There is one more view that could be both: a man dressed as a chicken, yes, this is the chicken that peck the ground in search of chicken feed. The scene was supposed to be a comedy movie climax, but at least it was the climax of the film and really the most repulsive when you thought adult men and women think it could even be distracting. Ah! This is indeed the real horror of Dr. Tarr and his legion of name changes. And this leads me to this important fact about the film, which in most films is subject to multiple changes of titles, usually has a serious problem. Yes, it is obvious, but some of them have problems with distribution, and others, of which it is one, have many changes in titles, so that someone would not suspect anything more than once. It's definitely rubbish. It has very little. The only performer worth seeing is Claudio Brook as the head of the asylum. Is one big piece of ham that laughs maniacally, roars orders, sashays with a sword in hand and praises the chicken. I was so tired of hearing him talking about the "soothing system" as his treatment of the mentally ill. What a ludicrosity (Hey, a movie like this deserves that word). It will not take you long to find out what is happening in asylum, nor will it be more interesting. Cinematic scratching of the chicken!
