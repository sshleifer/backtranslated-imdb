Please! Do not waste your money on this movie. It's really nothing but boring German retort Blair Witch made by some high school kids. I could not finish it and I usually like to watch all kinds of B movies. How in the world could they find a distributor? !!! Funny: check Wikipedia for "dark area". The guy who wrote this post must be completely devoid of thought. Maybe he got a lot of money from the producers. Money that had to be spent on actors, camera and assembly. Even that would not help, because there is absolutely nothing interesting about this movie. Unfortunately, the "dark area" has already attracted too much attention. Please, the director, producer and author of this film, stop making such films ... you do not do yourself a favor. The world would be a better place without this movie.
