Iberia is nice to watch on TV. But why do you see it on the silver screen? A lot of dance and music. If you like classical music or modern dance, it can be your date movie. But otherwise, an hour and a half is too long. If you want to see a skillful dance on a silver screen, better see the Bollywood movie. They know how to combine a breathtaking dance with a long movie. Director Carlos Saura knows how to shoot from past experiences. And from time to time it looks really good. but when the movie is an hour, it should be at least the most interesting. There are many types of art, not everything is bigger than life, and this film is not too big.
