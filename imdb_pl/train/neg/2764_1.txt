First of all, I have no idea how this movie hit the big screen. This is not even a movie with a low SCI-Fi budget, it's just awful. Me and my friend who love action movies, Independence Day, Jurassic Park, WP, etc. We went to see this movie expecting this movie for me Transformers with dragons, thoughtless entertainment. We only have a mindless hour and a half. CG was not as bad as I expected, but the plot is as awful as acting, it made up for it. It's basically a Chinese dragon with dragons returning every 500 years ... Sounds like a good Rain of Fire remake? No, the plot tries to be deeper than it should leave not only holes in the storyline, but thanks to magic and a very small real war between dragons (rather large snakes) is just ridiculous. The director tried to add some humor to the film that did not work. Me and my friend laughed at all this (along with all five of the audience) and I could not believe that we spent the money on it. A short trailer on television compensates for most of the action, while the rest is nonsense. I've seen a lot of B movies like Reptilian, The Cave, Spider and others, but I have to say that if you want to keep laughing for an hour, look at it. <br /> <br /> History: 1/10 CG: 5/10 Acting: 3/10 <br /> <br /> I do not drink ... but it would help before watching this movie
