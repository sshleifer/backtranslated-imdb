First of all, before you start reading further, you have to understand that I'm not a neo-Nazi, I'm just trying to understand Hitler well to make sure no one like him takes over. <br /> <br /> I saw this series and found it terrible. I mean, OK, that's interesting, but is it true? I was looking for answers and found one thing: absolutely not. First of all, Hitler was not bad all his life, the series shows a furious Hitler, even when he is a child. Secondly, Hitler never wanted to abuse his daughter, in fact it is highly likely that Hitler was in fact gay and all his life he fought to strangle the secret. Third, people will hate me, but it's true: Hitler was charming. How do you think he managed to gain power if he was so hateful and ugly? Because he was charming. This is a common point that I found in interviews with people who live close to him or far away from him (of course, not from Jews). <br /> <br /> This series was awful because if you think that Hitler was just an angry bastard, ugly and of course not charming, you are wrong. If you think so, you will let people like him take over in countries, and you do not want to. If you really understand how Hitler managed to get power and stop thinking that he's just awful, you'll be able to find dangerous politicians like him (of course, remember that he was chosen) and stop the topic before it's too late. /> <br /> Life is important to protect, this series is simply awful to show us the truth, if we continue to see Hitler in this way, the next one will take place exactly the same as the first.
