Judging by the buzz and other opinions on this site, I was ready for an amazing horror, focusing on the junkies. I got complete nonsense focusing on junkies. I wonder if there is another movie called "Cookers" that people have reviewed? There are only 3 main characters, and none of them hit me so well written or well made. Essentially, the whole movie I just spent shaking my head and admiring the stupidity of these addicts. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. Do not rent this movie. Rent "Cabin Fever" or other decent horror movie. Hell, rent "Mary Poppins"! Animated penguins are more frightening and convincing than anything you find in "Stoves".
