"Trigger Man" is by far the most boring and stupidest movie I've ever seen in my life. My aunt's summer movies are more fascinating. <br /> <br /> It seems that the actors have been employed at uglypeople.com. They do not have the talent to act convincingly. <br /> <br /> They walk, walk and walk in the woods. There are more common walks than in all three parts of The Lord of the Rings. After the first hour, I started reading the Porsche brochure while watching "Trigger Man" along the way. Terrible. <br /> <br /> A total waste of time and money. I would give this film 0 stars out of 10, because it is not possible, I have to give 1 star.
