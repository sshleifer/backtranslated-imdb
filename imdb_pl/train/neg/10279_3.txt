This movie was so scary that it was almost good ... almost. We love musicals, but not this one. Even with terrible sound quality, poor cinematography and many actors who can not sing or dance, Anthony Rapp actually managed to give a good performance (especially at the end). Marjorie's character, a drunken lady, was also pleasant to watch. <br /> <br /> The plot is very unexpected and could be fun without horrible singing and light piano music. It is true that some songs (fantabulous) are quite catchy (but not in a good way). <br /> <br /> Open House is a fun movie to watch because it's awful! We think it can be a good stage musical (with excellent actors).
