The next American Pie movie was pushed into our throats and this one is the worst of all. He does not deserve the name American Pie. They should have stayed at The Wedding. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be just a stupid porn movie that hit the title of American Pie. When I watched it, I felt that I was watching a different series. It did not drop like an American cake. He has a different mood and is much more rude and has many more sex scenes than other American Pie movies. <br /> <br /> I never recommend it. Actually, I do not recommend any of the American Pie Presents movies. Stick to the nice original trilogy. <br /> <br /> 2/10
