A really unpleasant movie. While Rick Baker's special effects are quite impressive (if they rotate in the stomach), he has no other advantages. Like many movies from the 70s, it leaves you feeling like you need to take a long shower and wipe the slime out of yourself. Characters are equally unpleasant, and the plot does not make sense.
