A typical gothic chick (Rainbow Harvest looking like the cross between Winony Ryder in Beetlejuice and Boy George) gets even to people who feel that they hurt her with the help of an old haunted mirror, which she finds in her new home she and her mother (horror mainstay, Karen Black , the only good thing in this parody) buy. Acting is quite fun (especially when Rainbow interacts with the above-mentioned mirror) and has no fears or tensions. This film inexplicably was born in 3 sequels, each of which was slightly more horrible than the previous one. People looking for a similar subject, but a much better cinematography, would be good to look for the episode of "Friday the 13th: the Series", in which a scientist girl finds an old cursed compact mirror. This gives you a lot more chills in 40 minutes than the entire franchise is available in 4 movies. <br /> <br /> My class: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Charlie Spradling provides mandatory T & A
