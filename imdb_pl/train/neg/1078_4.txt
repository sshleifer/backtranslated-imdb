One evening a divorced lawyer Rick Magruder (Branagh) stumbles from an event organized by his company and has an accidental meeting with a woman named Mallory Doss (Davidtz) who was a waitress at a party and apparently lost her car. Rick drives the woman home and finds out that her car has already been parked there, apparently by her father, Dixon Doss (Duvall). Rick and Mallory enter the house, arguing about the situation when Mallory undresses in front of Rick carelessly, and then spends the night with her. <br /> <br /> Rick wakes up in the morning and Mallory meets him later in the day, asking him to file a suit against his father because of his dangerous behavior. Rick, now obsessed with Mallory and ready to do anything for her, successfully puts Dixon in court and sends him to prison, but when he is freed by local friends, Rick finds himself in trouble trying to protect himself and his children from danger which he unconsciously brought to life.
