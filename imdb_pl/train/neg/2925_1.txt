After reading some good reviews and also hearing nice words about it, I decided to rent Come Undone. I must say that I was rather disappointed. The story has been difficult to track because the film is set up as a series of flashbacks between the present and the recent past, which are very poorly made. The heroes, despite the best efforts of the actors, are flat and uninteresting. Sex and nakedness are clearer than they must be. I have never seen a movie in which they would seem unnecessary to the story. The ending is very anti-climatic and leaves many unanswered questions to the plot, which was not well explained. In my opinion, a waste of time.
