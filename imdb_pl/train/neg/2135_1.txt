Just throw the trash. I am a big fan of Cusacks, because this is the only reason I watched this movie, but the only reason I can see them is repression, in full and deeper lower quality, their exact roles from Grosse Point Blanc. In addition, the role of films as political satire is not pathetic as too obvious that even the most cretins could serve a purpose. And it would simply be insulting even to chimps to make it look like satirical satire. Imitation is clearly the highest form of flattery, but seeing that there is nothing near Grosse Point Blanc and in the same league as Spartans (see if you're a moron) when it comes to political satire, let's leave it well enough and let it disappear in the dark which he absolutely deserves.
