Oh, what a condescending movie! This film, set in Los Angeles, the center of the POV universe of Hollywood filmmakers, strives to be a deep social commentary on contemporary American anxiety. <br /> <br /> Stereotypical, smarmy characters with a very diverse socio-economic background cross paths in their everyday, grim life. The conspiracy is chaotic and chaotic. Numerous incomprehensible plot conspiracies make the film go round like: shooting from a ride, an abandoned child left in weeds, a gang of bandits intimidating a lawyer, a guy flying through the night sky over the city, a kid in a summer camp. <br /> <br /> And through all these events, the only constant is the generous help of the sociological "insight" conveyed through dialogue, as the characters compare their remarks about their life experiences. One character tells another: "When you sit on the edge of this thing (the Grand Canyon), you realize how joking are we humans ... these rocks laugh at me, I can say, I and my worries; real humorous for this Grand Canyon. " <br /> <br /> And one more character proclaims the meaning of all this: "There is a chasm in this country, an ever-widening gulf between people who have things and people who do not have ... it's like this great the hole opened in the ground, as big as ... the Grand Canyon, and what spills out ... is an outburst of rage, and rage creates violence ... ". <br /> <br /> In addition to the terribly unnatural and forced dialogue, in addition to shallow, slender characters, in addition to stupid thread, the tempo of the plot is painfully slow. The action is uninspiring and cursory. The tone of the film is happy with itself, in the scenario of contempt for viewers. <br /> <br /> It was a movie project approved by Hollywood suits that like themselves as omnipotent gurus, looking down from above. They think that their film will be a surprising revelation for us, modest, unaware film viewers who want to know the true meaning of American social change.
