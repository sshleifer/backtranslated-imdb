The comparison is perhaps unfair but unavoidable. Those who are attracted to the intimacy and depth of Umbrellas will be somewhat scared by the discovery of a musical in the American style - a clumsy, slim dialogue with inexplicable song and dance numbers. The French accent of Gene Kelly was apparently so poor that he replaced the terrifying task of dubbing (as you will remember, dubbing was almost perfectly removed in umbrellas). French translation (also for the version with subtitles) leaves a lot to be desired, although it can not be attributed to Demy. The film also has several self-aware moments that arouse anxiety, such as references to songs to LeGrand itself. And the costumes - well, the combination of tight trousers / white shoes and bizarrely unnatural colors, resemble one of the Austin Powers movies. . . <br /> <br /> But Demy rewards the viewer with allusions to the Umbrella; note, for example, the suitcase carried by Maxence in his departure from Rochefort - this is the same suitcase that Guy carried from Cherbourg. Also pay attention to "Convenient Brunette of Resolution" - Madeleine in umbrellas and Josette in Young Girls. <br /> <br /> In general, those who expect the natural appearance of umbrellas (with the exception of a floating bicycle scene) or looking for similar deeper questions and ambiguous endings, as in the Umbrella script, should probably convey this question. Those who are looking for a French version of an American musical from the 1960s will be very happy.
