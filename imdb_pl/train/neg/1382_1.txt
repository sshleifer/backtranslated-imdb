The film was terrible. The theater was dead in silence because everyone was ashamed to see it there. I think someone gave Jet Li a lobotomy and told him to do a script with a dialogue written by a five-year-old. Martial arts are "okay", but when placed next to Jackie Khan's and "Matrix's" movies, it's better to see one of them.
