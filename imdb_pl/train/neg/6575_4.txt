An interesting film about a real event that took place during the Vermont Civil War. It caught my attention to the end and I do not regret it. I have never read about this incident, so I wondered if the rebels had pushed him away. I like historical films from that era. <br /> <br /> My main complaint concerns Confederate uniforms. They look too good !!! Acting was sometimes a bit stiff. I like an old man eating mashed potatoes because he did not have any teeth. An injured soldier playing with a dog's tail was a bit strange. Generally, it was a descent movie.
