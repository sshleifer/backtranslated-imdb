This is definitely not one of Lucio Fulci's better films from every episode of imagination. The plot is very bad, the millionaire is murdered, and his cigar calls his daughter to find out who did it. But the biggest problem I have with this (except that I know who killed him within 10 minutes of watching the movie) was wondering why someone should care about it? My father leaves as a really big jerk for everyone he met (including his daughter, which he asks to help him), which meant that no one cared who killed him. But no one really looks at the Fulci movie for a good story, it would be like watching porn for amazing scriptwriting and acting. Usually, his films try to compensate for it by adding excessive gore scenes, but even this is missing in this film. If you're looking for a good Fulci flute, check out The Beyond.
