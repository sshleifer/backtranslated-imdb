The story of an incredible lack of interest kills The Psychic over and over again. The characters and the plot are completely uninteresting (as does the crazy work of Fulci, which is usually the deciding factor in his films), and nowhere is the uncertainty to be found. It is padded in an unbearable degree - until the end you will not be bursting with excitement, but you will be bored (and like me, maybe an uncontrollable desire to fall asleep). Jennifer O'Neill's performance deserves to be a better movie. Gorehounds Fulci beware - not much happens in "The Psychic". <br /> <br /> 3/10
