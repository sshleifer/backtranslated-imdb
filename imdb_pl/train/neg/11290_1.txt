By far the worst movie of all time. Even Yaphet Kotto could not save this turkey. I heard that the movie originally was to be titled "The Treasure", but it was changed to "Sharks' Treasure" to use the emotions created by "JAWS". I think sharks were in one scene of this movie; the fact that they were in this "thriller" had to sell tickets. Did not work. Whenever something "good" happens in the film, the ship's crew makes a toast for themselves with some type of beer that was just introduced at the time the film was made. Dear, do you think that beer could have been a sponsor? Could they make it more obvious? The only time someone should break a beer is that they will survive it. That's enough to celebrate.
