I could not resist thinking about the mask: the creation of leslie vernon (a much more amazing movie) while watching this because of the realistic impression, as well as a great innovative idea. it could be a GREAT movie. acting is ... alright from some actors. from others ... it's just awful. <br /> <br /> that the idea is great and the format is great. the story is also quite good, though it often suffers from great blows in the logical mind. <br /> <br /> do not think about it, right? it IS a horror after all. <br /> <br /> I really want to make it up ... I really want it to be a fantastic movie that wants to be. <br /> <br /> however (and you can not really blame the minds of this movie), this is of course budget-built shoe string. and fx really hurt the movie. <br /> <br /> great movie. ... if you exchanged for a better game and slightly better fx. <br /> <br /> whoever wrote it should go here, great idea.
