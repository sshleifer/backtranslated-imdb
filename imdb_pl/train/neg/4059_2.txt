It is rare that such an amazing cast was so wasted. Griffin Dunne, Rosanna Arquette, Illeana Douglas, Ethan Hawke, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken and John Turturro, all jumped aboard to be torpedoed by a script that seems nothing more than Hollywood in jokes. Joining the name of Martin Scorsese was probably a draw, but the end result is much smaller than the sum of its parts. Recalling a nightmarish nightmare, each scene seems more imaginary than the next. "Search and Destroy" is nothing but abstract, stylish, indulgent nonsense, and the whole movie is definitely boring .......... MERK
