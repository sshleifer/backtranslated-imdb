I consider this movie to be one of the worst in the Nightmare series. It was so boring that I could not remember anything 20 minutes after the end of the movie, even forcing me to write a review. <br /> <br /> Okay, # 4 was a joke, and Freddy was a joker. # 5 tried to return to the roots of the series. It was darker and more atmospheric than Nightmare 4, which is basically good. They tried to make a horror movie instead of a comedy. Unfortunately, they forgot to add tension and fear. Because of this, Nightmare 5: The Dream Child is neither funny nor frightening. What we really get is a boring movie with ordinary bad actors (except maybe Lisa Wilcox). <br /> <br /> The plot (Freddy kills Lisa's friends with the dream of Lisa's unborn child) has a good base, but that's not enough for 90 minutes of the movie. Sometimes the story becomes very misleading (maybe because it does not exist) and you can not stop wondering what the filmmakers were going for. The script had to have more holes than the Swiss Cheese, which is why the film was very tacky (let's say I do not like cheese, even if I come from Switzerland). Even the special effects were not as good as, for example, in part 4. <br /> <br /> Do not bother to rent / buy this movie, if not for completeness, it's quite a mess. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10 (get used to it, # 6 is also a mess ...)
