Honestly, my expectations for Little Bush were low. I was expecting a small series of cartoons with lots of fun (but I exaggerated and exaggerated) Bush jokes. Apparently, I should even lower my expectations. <br /> <br /> Writing was absolutely pathetic. In addition to chewing Cheney-Chicken-Eating and some giggles, it was really boring and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> The animation was as sophisticated as the thirteen-year-old Flash Project. It is shameful that they have used the Macromedia product for this because it is capable of much more. <br /> <br /> I do not like Bush so much, and I like Bush's joke as much as the next guy, but it was just a half an hour of waving at the president with some painfully hilarious moments. Trey Parker and Matt Stone have done a lot more with It's My Bush. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, skip Lil 'Bush, and go buy a copy of the short comedy "That's My Bush". You thank me
