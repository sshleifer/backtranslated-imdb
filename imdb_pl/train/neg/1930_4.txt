Some praised Atlantis: _The_Lost_Empire_ as Disney's adventure for adults. I do not think - at least not for adult adults. <br /> <br /> This scenario suggests the beginning of a movie in action that hit someone as a type of shit that can no longer be sold to adults. "Crack staff" of many older adventure films has been done before, (think "The Dirty Dozen"), but "Atlantis" represents one of the worst films in this theme. Characters are weak. Even the background from which each member comes from seems to be awkward at best. MD / Medicine Man, a mechanic dealing with the tombs, whose father always wanted to have sons, if we did not see them at least before, we've seen mix-and-match quarrels before. The story of how one companion, Vinny played by Don Novello (father Guido Sarducci), went completely unconvincing from the florist to demolition. <br /> <br /> Only the main character, Milo Thatch, a young scientist obsessed with Atlantis by Michael J. Fox, has any depth for him. The search for Atlantis by Milo is continued by his grandfather, who brought him up. The opening scene shows much younger Milo, who is ashamed sitting on his knee and his grandfather puts his helmet on his head. <br /> <br /> And although the heroes were slim at best, the best thing about _Atlantis_ was the voice of talent. Perhaps the depth of Milo is not thicker than Fox's charm. Commander Rourke does not lose anything when James Garner preached. Although Rourke is quite a typical military type, Garner shows his ability to inhale life in the form simply by providing it. Garner's vocals are the most important. I'm sorry to say, Dying King Leonard Nimoy is nothing more than an obligatory one. In addition, Don Novello as a demolition expert, Vinny Santorini, was also known for one or two well-made, fun lines - but I always liked Father Guido Sarducci. <br /> <br /> Computer animation was also done well. BACKGROUND animation. The character animation has not been so bad for Disney since the minimalism that pushed Don Bluth out the door. The character's animation does nothing if it does not make the flat characters seem even flatter. In addition to landscapes, buildings and vehicles, there is not much to impress. <br /> <br /> The plot was the worst. Some say hackneyed or trite. I'm not so sure. Any useful plot can be transformed into something new with proper treatment. Shakespeare often began with a known story and story and was famous only for applying new paint. So treatment is a thing. And _Atlantis_ of course it is not. <br /> <br /> I can not go to all logical gaps without the spoiler section. The plot was bad. The plot bridges latch like a string, and the end does not make sense. In addition, the script and animation are filled with annoying sloppiness. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> 1. At the very beginning, when Milo reveals that the rune or Celtic symbols have been incorrectly translated, and the "Irish Coast" should read " The coast of Iceland ", we begin to have problems. The authors of the scenario would have to know the British as Eire or Eireann as "Ireland" and completely ignore the older, Latin term Hibernia. What's more, they must know about the Vikings' plot to name the green island of Iceland and the ice island of Greenland. <br /> <br /> By making this a matter of a mistranslated "letter", the authors condemned the requirement of a runic version of English and post-Roman date on the script. Because it lasts long after Atlantis was about to sink in its undersea cave. And without any visible tips and less technology than Milo made the lettering much less credible. <br /> <br /> 2. Shepard's diary could not have been written before the sinking of Atlantis, otherwise he would have known nothing of the cave or crystal lying "in the eyes of the king." It must have been written after the sinking, but even without the technology that the Milo expedition had, what the hell someone had fallen into Lewiatan's hands. So how could he learn more about it? And why would it be written in Atlantian? <br /> <br /> Automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain these things. However, clairvoyance and astral travel do not require a shepard to write in Atlantis. So it must be some kind of automatic writing. Since no one in Atlantis can read, the spirits of crystal, radiant messages must be on the surface. It would make more sense. But it could be explained in the film: Milo could have discovered that this power called him all his life - appeared in dreams, etc. She had to be examined in the film. <br /> <br /> 3. Atlantis should not just understand modern languages. No one expects that the original Indo-Europeans would be able to talk in Europe, just as the Romans would not understand that the hard "c" or their day became the French "ch" (pronounced as "sh" s, nie mniej!) <Br / > <br /> 4. The present Atlantis lived before the cataclysm - when apparently * they could * read *, and now they are unable to read what they once did, or operate similar machines. <br /> <br /> 5. Mass Illiteracy points to a key drawback of the film. NOTHING has happened in this culture. It seems to be suspended in the air until Milo can save him. Even if it seems that life is not a constant struggle for survival, no one wants to compose poetry or write novels and maybe it is a combination of Atlantic school systems that go down in the end and lack of good fiction that caused Atlantis to fall into illiteracy. <br /> <br /> 5. Kida can be justified for not knowing how to read or operate the machine if she was so young when the Catastrophe of Stupidity started - but EVERYONE WITH THESE ** HARDS ** qualifies her father for Deification !! Kashakima's stupidity almost wiped his people out of existence. They killed the group in a cataclysm, they were stuck in a dead end (not much died here, but they supervised mass slippage in culture and progress) until someone could take the crystal to kill everyone if they were not cooked in a lava because the Giant Robots were not there there to protect them. <br /> <br /> The pin of blue electricity should break the similarity of Kashakim when Kida tried to combine her father's image with the GREAT King of Atlantis! <br /> <br /> 6. Though Milo was the only one who could read Atlantis, Rourke and others knew that it was enough to look through the book of babble and find a page on the crystal - which he knew was crystal, not some stylized astrological or "sun phase" diagram. <br /> <br /> 7. If grandfather Milo told Rourke about it, he still does not explain how Rourke would suffer from Milo reading it as part of a book. which was ridiculed in Rourke's hands, although Milo apparently did not find any torn page in the book - it was only to show the viewer that "something was wrong." Until the word "crystal" did not trigger an alarm in Milo's head, if someone tries to steal it, Milo would not suspect anything, it's just a big head. <br /> <br /> 8. The "double cross" of the crew was not a change of character. We learned that Vinny, Sweet, Audrey and Cookie rode raze m with Rourke from the very beginning, but the "change of heart" is falling, it was a change and it had to be better motivated. It's difficult to do it with characters who have not been given anything to start with. <br /> <br /> 9. It's a bit of a spin that lava floats above the dome, instead of filling the rest of the area from which we view the sequence. It's liquid; it will not flow through the protective dome until it fills all the lower areas. <br /> <br /> 10. Final SORTING! - and it makes no sense except to calm down political correctness. When the power source is restored, Atlantis is no longer a weak power, requiring coddling. Giant robot guards and aerial cycles firing blue lightning suggest that they have less to fear than they can. The technology is better than ours, and certainly to the beginning of the 20th century. In the end, Milo must teach Atlantis, why read? The whole idea is to leave your quiet, contrite culture in peace, and not send it to the hyperdrive. <br /> <br /> ** FINAL SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Perhaps the plot of Lost World and setting the turn of the centuries should give me an indication that this is more a tribute to the pulp. The mistakes that I found in the film agree with this idea. But I do not understand why I should pay to see thin characters and create holes, because many of the dime novels also had them. Anyway, tales about pulp are part of "shit they can not sell to adults anymore." We have become a bit more sophisticated, and our pulp must also grow. The seekers of the lost Ark have not lost anything of their pulp and have avoided so much anger. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 - the movie is nice, but as I think about the story, it's getting smaller.
