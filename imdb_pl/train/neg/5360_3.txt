"Nada" was the most inadequate continuation of "Les NOces Rouges", which in retrospect now appears as the last good movie about the golden age of Chabrol (1967-1973) "Nada" is the first real Chabrol test in a completely political film, his previous work " les Noces Rouges "also had political elements, but it was more of a psychological thriller with a typical view of society in the French provinces. "Nada" includes terrorists, ambassadors, taking hostages, lots of blood, and not really Chabrola. The heterogeneous cast gives the film a coup de grâce: only Duchaussoy, who has already played with the director, and Maurice Garrel are scratched. Viviane Romance, one of Duvivier actresses ("la Belle Equipe" "Panique"), is wasted as madam (Gabrielle). Italian actors (Fabio Testi, Lou Castel) are terrible. <br /> <br /> With "Nada" is the second period of sterile inspiration for Chabrol. It would be "Violette Nozières" before he was again at the top of his game.
