After watching the poster from the film Smother, I knew that I was going to experience one of those unbearable film experiences that make me want to tear my eyes away. However, I felt a slight optimism because the film had a solid cast that I thought about. he was going to save the movie. Unfortunately, it did not happen. The mother is a horrible movie, but it is not uncomfortable. That's the best I can say about it. <br /> <br /> The script from Smother (written by the same guys from License to Wed, something that explains that they do not have the talent to write movies) is full of cheap and predictable humor. Seriously, I did not even laugh at watching this movie. In addition, the solid cast I mentioned was absolutely After a lot of trash in which she was involved (like monumentally horrible and criminal because I said yes), some people may think that Diane Keaton's career expires. However, I can not forget about the excellent performances she has introduced previo for decades, in movies such as Annie Hall or Baby Boom. On Smother, she makes every effort to make her performance, but her character is so terribly written that she can not do anything with her. performances in Baby Mama and Idiocracy films. However, she does what she can with her character. Mike White also makes a good effort, but does not get too far. He is a very talented screenwriter (as shown in movies like The Good Girl and School of Rock), so I would like to see that he was one of the screenwriters of this film, and not only acted on it. Liv Tyler suffers from the same situation of all the previously mentioned actors: wasting. <br /> <br /> The worst defeat Smother is absolutely boring and non-functional. His script is nothing more than a set of forced scenes and situations that we've seen on sit-coms. Stay away from this bad comedy.
