First of all, it's not easy to scare me ... Anything but my few phobias, but this movie is absolutely frightening. This is not suitable for children! I had open mouths that shocked me all the time. It's just not necessary to be so scary and to be assessed G. I recommend that you have it over 8 years. But do not get me wrong, it was probably a good movie if I was not mentally scarred as a child. I can not believe that a parent would let, say, a four-year-old child watch it. It's intense and complicated, not forgetting the bloody ones, for young children. I am scared over 4 and I was shocked by violence. I do not recommend
