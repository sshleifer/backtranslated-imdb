After leaving the popular television program "The Andy Griffith Show," Don Knotts gave the film glory a valiant attempt with a series of mindless but eye-catching comedy cars. Unfortunately, "The Reluctant Astronaut", filmed cheaply (like most Knotts films), is much worse than its other. Don plays a small string in a town that is admitted to the Astronaut Training camp ... but not as a candidate for space travel - they want it as their new janitor! Some may say that a weak satire exploits a new American fever for a new era of technology, but the movement is really a dark pretext to stop the restless children. It starts with a good set-up and nostalgic locations, but becomes more and more soulless and idiotic. * with ****
