Oh my God. oh my God, I can not go around this movie. That was awful. terrible, terrible! Do not even waste money to buy them in a 99 cents container. No, avoid him at all costs. I warn you! <br /> <br /> It was the worst movie I've ever seen. In my life. In my life !! <br /> <br /> First of all, G-girl? Are you joking. It really sounds like a new Barbie doll. Super women? Are you joking. It was so false false false. Residents of the city did not even seem to care that the flying blonde is just approaching the city, saving the fire ... Ohh big! <br /> <br /> Jesus, is it just me, did I make the film offensive? I guess you must be a super hero is a pair of double D, blonde hair, no glasses and a leather suit ?! <br /> <br /> If he tried to be romantic ... than ... God, I do not know. It was horrible if love meant taking someone to play and having sex in bed and in the air ... than they totally loved! <br /> <br /> It was pathetic, everything went too fast. The first guy was lonely than he was dating a G-girl ... than they broke up than he was dating this girl Hannah ... and ... it just lasts. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this movie made me wonder .. How the hell did they get it in cinemas? !! <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs.
