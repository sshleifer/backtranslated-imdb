To say Funky Forest: The First Contact is a bad movie, it's understated the incredible size. I can really get to a good movie in an artistic home, even surreal and twisted, such as El Topo, Naked Lunch and Survive Style 5+, because these films have something to talk about when the subtitles start to take off. <br /> <br /> FFFC tries to make every path so deep and intellectual, in principle there is no content in this film. This film is badly made, the visuals in this film are not inspirational, the dialogue is worse, the music numbers destroy this movie .. I chuckled at GITAR BROTHERS, but it was immediately erased by something completely unnecessary and meaningless. It seems to me that he tried to be deep and meaningful, but it was only pretentious disoriented nonsense. Film students from Freshman without a camera could create something more interesting. <br /> <br /> Guitar brothers and routines between skits get 1 point, everything else is just bad, pseudo-creative, trying to be as good as films of other real directors, such as Sogo Ishii, David Lynch and Jodoworsky . Give me a break. I am convinced that people who are fascinated by the FFFC are doing this because they have no idea what they saw because it was just a mild appropriate statement here and there mixed up with stupidity and mixed up until you vomit your own shoes. <br /> <br /> This movie was an amazing disappointment, coming from the highest level of Survive Style 5+, a movie that really matters, combined with great use of scenery, cinematography, catchy dialog, fun moments, good soundtrack, excellent performances, fantastic stimulation and flow. FFFC has exactly the opposite in all respects boring landscapes (20 minutes of staring at a colorless beach at night?) A completely white scene? Alien balls floating in white space? A tired school corridor, and then ... a school corridor?), Horrible cinematography, forget-me-not dialog, nothing funny or humorous, except for the fact that you wasted your life for two hours, the soundtrack ?, amateur performances, uneven, chaotic and often flat drag, zero flow at all. <br /> <br /> There are those who say that this is what makes FFFC a great movie, that it's so unconventional at every turn that it's pure genius. It seems to be just a way to deepen one's ego, because "unpredictable" can be a good quality for a movie if it is not connected to "boring", "inner" and "horrible". I personally talked to two people who admitted that the FFFC was awful when they left the theater, but the overwhelming enthusiasm of the art-house elitist made them watch the movie again, and then they came back to me with ... "Hey, it was pretty I liked it very well. "<br /> <br /> I'm going to resist, this movie is a slop, I do not care if Roger Ebert says that this movie is the best thing he has ever seen since he lost his virginity. "The new coat of the emperor" I say ... this film is in no way indicative of other psychedelic / trippy films that have come from Japan over the last 10 years. Taste of Tea, Party 7 and Kamikaze Girls are much better films (even with a low budget) and no one can honestly compare them with Survive Style 5+. Watch FFFC only when you are interested in creating a pretentious stack of anything on a modest budget.
