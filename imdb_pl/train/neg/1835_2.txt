Start with the script. I've seen cartoons with more depth than "Envy." Every time the characters repeat what you have seen and it was not fun the first time, the movie is in serious trouble, which is certainly "Envy". The movie, which is based on one joke, should have it somewhere. Here we have a movie that does not go anywhere. Christopher Walken would particularly like to forget about this bomb because his character is so weak. Ben Stiller appeared in pretty good black comedies "Flirting With Disaster" and "Duplex" that immediately come to mind. Rest assured that "Envy" is not a black comedy. There are no double meanings, only total nonsense. "Jealousy" deserves a low rating because, like an object, it stinks. - MERK
