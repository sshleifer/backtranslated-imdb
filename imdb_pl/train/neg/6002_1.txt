"Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat" is nonsense. Acting is terrible, the atmosphere does not exist, and the characters are uninteresting. The only scary thing about this piece of scum is that most IMDb users have given it 10. It's really scary. There is no gore, no tension, no violence, nothing. Bruce Cambell ("The Evil Dead", "Intruder") is completely wasted, the auxiliary cast is also horrible. Yes, some people may like this photo, especially mainstream society, but hardcore horror fans or gore-hounds will not enjoy this piece. Personally, I hate horror movies, I prefer serious horror movies like "Cannibal Holocaust" or "Last House on the Left". opinion, a real horror is to be frightening, excessively bloody and disturbing, without silly humor, which usually spoils the whole concept. This one is not terrifying, it's not bloody, it's not even funny like a comedy, so do not waste your precious time.
