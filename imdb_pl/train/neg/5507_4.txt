This was another big screen show of an American television series from the sixties. It is quite funny, but it was very similar to the formula. Intelligent Martian lands on Earth and meets not very astute man, in his opinion. <br /> <br /> Ordinary instability results from a man, Bridges, ultimately associated with him and helps him return home. On the way, he also gets a girl, Hannah. <br /> <br /> This is a nice way out for nice Hollywood stars that I have not seen in a while. <br /> <br /> It's nice to have some free time if you have nothing better to look at.
