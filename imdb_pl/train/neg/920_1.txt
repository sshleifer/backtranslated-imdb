Seriously. I just finished my first watching Demonicus and the words failed me. <br /> <br /> I remember the time when I saw the name of Charles Band on the film and my heart raced. He was never Wes Craven or John Carpenter. He was a bastion of hope for a small man. The guy whose films reached the video store instead of the multiplex, but they were still rocking harder than most of the junk that we had to endure. <br /> <br /> And now ... this. <br /> The painfully obvious Californian walking trail doubles for the Alps, and the abandoned railway tunnel is supposed to be an "ancient cave". I mean, they did not even try to put on moss or film in a way that might suggest that it's different to the old railway tunnel! Ugh! Instead of a terrifying demonic gladiator, as the cover suggests, we treat the guy in the latest Wal-Mart Halloween costume. There is a pretty-looking corpse that occasionally comes to life to burp and move your fingers, but it will not even learn to stand up to the last five minutes. Why could not he be a villain? Instead, we have a boy with brother Joe with a plastic sword. Ouch. <br /> <br /> Charles Band ... you should be ashamed that your name is attached to such guts. I love movies that are so bad that they are good. Hell, from time to time I'm happy that the movie is so bad it's just bad. This one can not be seen. A great example of making money instead of making a good movie.
