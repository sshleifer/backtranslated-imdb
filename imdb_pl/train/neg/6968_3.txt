An elderly man touches a flower in his wife's greenhouse, which seems to wither. He gets punctured or bitten by something on him. He quickly becomes ill, and in the hospital he spits out a large meaty white larva. A later attempt to resuscitate him with a paddle results in a blood splatter. <br /> <br /> The policeman is in the hospital because his partner was seriously injured in the shooting. Somehow the policeman is paired with one of the doctors, and also with the entomologist who was brought. There are a few small children circling around the hospital, which I suppose we should find charming, but which are very annoying brats. It happens that they go to the room where the specimen is stored, and they happen to dump the growth hormone on it. The horror logic says they deserve to die for it, but they are never even in danger. <br /> <br /> The pig grows and begins to grow. People are running away from him and sometimes for some reason. The hospital is surrounded by the army, which is ready to destroy everything if the need arises. <br /> <br /> There are no really attractive characters in the film, and most of the time it seems that people are looking for a monster. It was quite boring. Apparently, he owes something to Alien movies, and the monster is born in a human being and has several stages of development. There is also a character named Bishop, and the main actress has Sigourney Weaver's hair.
