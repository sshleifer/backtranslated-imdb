A highly unbelievable, unbelievable and inconsistent Spanish production of ... well, let me see how close I can get to it. The film is opened by a woman in which one of the kittens is killed by a young girl. Then he begs a lover to take her somewhere on vacation. He calls a job and demands that he lose his holiday and she says he will pay for it. What does it mean to guess at the end of the movie, because a guy, a swarthy photographer, spies on beautiful Patty Shepard, the queen of Spanish horror movies, it seems, taking her bikini for a moment so he can take a picture, ask for lunch and then for his assignment on The Witches' Mountain - for reasons we are never in the know again. Before they go, Patty must stop at the house and loud, "amazing" echo songs in the ears of our hero. Again this has never been explained. The film lasts when the two stop at the inn, go upstairs and finally realize why the mountain is called the Witch Mountain. You know, there are several aspects of this movie that make it better than a bad movie. It has a bit of atmosphere, some actors are really quite good (especially the deaf innkeeper and the old man), the lead is at least adequate, and the culmination - though absolutely pointless - is well directed (literally) with witches in white bras and long black hair. But it just does not make sense and it is a huge problem for me. I could watch the movie ten more times and still do not know more than after the first watch. This is a serious problem. The Witch Mountain is an interesting film from a long line of cheap, climatic European horrors that covered this decade. If you can get more out of it than I do, better power for you.
