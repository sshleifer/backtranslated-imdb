OK - I WILL RECEIVE this film ... I will award this film - myself - for making me such a passionate fanatic of horror. I could never watch this movie alone. I also heard a lot of stories about the effects he had in his original release in cinemas and his viewers. An amazing masterpiece .... Horrible, psychological things keep me from trousers. Bless their hearts, whoever made this amazing movie. I love it. I thought the whole movie was decent and interesting. This movie is so frightening - it's the scariest movie I've ever seen in my life! Not what's happening in the film and the idea of ​​the movie are not scary enough, but what always attracts me - it was Brendan's fantastic action. The best horror EVER. Nothing can be so scary anymore. Watching Halloween at its worst.
