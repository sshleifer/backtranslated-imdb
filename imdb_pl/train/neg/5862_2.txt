It's good to answer one person's question: "why no one remembers this movie?" This is because not really so many people have seen it in 1978 and since then there has not been much shown on television. (If it's a film that would be a novelty for me!) Even in times of sometimes thoughtless comedies that took place in the '70s, movie viewers were smart enough to avoid the movie. Unless they love Billy Crytal, Paul Lynde or Joan Rivers very much! <br /> <br /> Paul Lynde was more fun in "Bewitched" or "Hollywood Squares" than here. Joan Rivers at the moment in her career began to laugh making cruel jokes about the lack of weight of singer Karen Carpenter! Har-har Joan! It also seems that every "somewhat" famous name from the era is in the cast. (The most surprising thing is that Doris Roberts later with "Everybody Loves Raymond".) In any case, a good idea for a story, a man who gets pregnant instead of a woman, is wasted here. With the help of a male friend Crystal is set up with a whore to finally lose her virginity, but because she was "at the top" instead of him, he will get pregnant! (Comment on women in positions away from men). <br /> <br /> Crystal's stomach is growing, going through all the female emotions and feelings associated with them. Unfortunately, he is now a socially misunderstood outcast! He is attacked by a crowd who wants to wipe him (I think). <br /> <br /> He is forced to go into seclusion to have his child ... in the barn. Or, if you want, manger (God only knows where he could leave! Ewwww!) It turns out (without shocking here) to be a girl! <br /> <br /> Everything else in this movie is worthless and unforgettable, humor is high school level or less. <br /> <br /> 2 stars for a good idea and some good emotions and important moments w / Billy Crystal. Ignore the rest of the Rabitt Test, it does not make sense! <br /> <br /> I can not believe that Roddy McDowell signed too! (END)
