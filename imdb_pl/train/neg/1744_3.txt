I watched the Malayalam film "Boeing Boeing" from 1985 (which in turn is probably inspired by the English movie of the same title) a long time ago. The basic story of garam masala is the same - but it's pathetic to say that classic jokes have been replaced by routine jokes that can be found in normal Hindi movies (probably the director did it to satisfy the taste of the Hindu audience) ... <br /> < br /> I did not see the English original. But I really liked the Malayalam movie (by Priyadarshan himself), which was then a dividing comedy. Of course, the acting of Mohanlal, Mukesh and Sukumari (who served as the cook) was so natural and spontaneous. <br /> <br /> I am probably too impressed with the Malayalam movie that I can not stand even the smaller flaws of his Hindi remake. But I still feel that Akshay Kumar and John Abraham have abused. Paresh Rawal did a decent job - but he does not reach any place near Sukumari. <br /> <br /> But all in all it's OK if you compare it to other recent comedy movies in Hindi.
