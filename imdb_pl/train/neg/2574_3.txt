I know movies do not necessarily reflect reality, but this one has my nerves. It assures unconscious stereotypes about "psychological trauma" and mental illness. The "psycho mom" case was done too many times before (and usually it did better), and most of the story is also tricky. Acting was not terrible, but nothing to rave about. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: I am a longtime General Hospital fan and it was a journey to see one of the roles played by former regular GH, Jon Lindstrom. <br /> <br /> In any case, if you can overlook a false psychoanalytic part of it, in the same way that a person has to suspend reality / judgment while watching many movies, then this movie can be tolerable. If you have nothing better to do and quite low standards. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry that I spent time watching.
