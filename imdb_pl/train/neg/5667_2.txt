If I checked IMDb BEFORE renting this DVD from Netflix, I would have several hours to live. I honestly suspect that I see that the film director also wrote it. In this case, according to the subtitles, the same guy was a "writer and director" - unfortunately, an indication of the overall quality of this production. There were some interesting moments (eg Judy Tenuta's scene reminded her of the early comedy routines advertising Judy-ism) that prompted me to evaluate these two stars instead of one. But these moments were few and I could hardly see them, because the opening sequence was almost incomprehensible to me, not to mention the reproach in her violence. I admit that I went back to see this part to see if I noticed something that would help me understand it when I saw it all. No, although at least I recognized who the characters are, which later will turn out to be important. The "rotating camera" technique was overused and essentially pointless. I talked to the television screen: "What?!?" Or "For God's sake, join in with this!" Not recommended.
