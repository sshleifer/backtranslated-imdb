A worn out conspiracy of a man who raps a woman in a murder case + an equally exploited outsider plot in the middle that eventually turns off. <br /> <br /> With such an outstanding one it is supposed that the film will rise above its hacked origin. But the scene behind the stage of drone without changing the intensity, without the arcs of the figure and inexplicable behavior. <br /> <br /> The topic of homosexuality was completely unnecessary - or completely unexplored on the other hand. It seemed that he was only attached to the excitement of viewers. When will Hollywood learn that having homosexual characters does not automatically make a more attractive picture? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, a scary movie. When will Lauren Bacall choose a good one? I expected her better and Kristin Scott Thomas. This one is definitely one to miss.
