I've always liked Fred MacMurray, and although her career was tragically interrupted, I think Carole Lombard is cool to watch. Combine these two main and attractive stars, add the best supporting players, such as Jean Dixon, Anthony Quinn, Dorothy Lamour and Charles Butterworth, give them a romantic script, combine them with the famous director Mitchell Leisene and get the average film experience. br /> <br /> Skid Johnson (Fred) and Maggie (Carole) "meet sweet" during their visit to the Panama Canal and spend the next few weeks falling in love. Skid is a great trumpeter, so he sets out on a musical career that, as you can expect, grows rapidly and falls. While climbing the music star neglects Maggie, who later inspires him to start after he has reached the lowest level. Ah, yes, it's a real Hollywood ending that does not come too fast. <br /> <br /> The stars and director of this caliber should guarantee success, but this film is so predictable and slow that it is sometimes difficult to watch. The early scenes taking place in Panama are so addictive that they seem to last forever, and later the alcoholic Skid goes endlessly in New York. Fred and Carole are trying their best, but the tired scenario and direction of S-L-O-W do not give them a chance. Even the last scene in which Maggie encourages Skida to rise from the ashes and disappointment is simply not true. <br /> <br /> This movie should be watched once to watch the early appearances of the stars from MacMurray and Lombard. I guarantee, however, that it will take about 48 hours to view it.
