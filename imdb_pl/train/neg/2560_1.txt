Well, I watched this yesterday night and the only thing that did not make it terrible was that it was simple. There was no beating in the bush that this kid was an antichrist. However, the movie was simply badly written. For example, they never explained how they made the incident with the dentist an "accident", and finally, like a policeman, he just came home wonderfully in time to save a child without calling the police. The death scenes were just bad and not fun at all. The kid they chose to play Antichrist was boring and they could really choose a better child. Do not waste time watching this.
