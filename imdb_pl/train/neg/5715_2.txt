"Say yes" is one of those movies that are still hoping for improvement, but it never is. This is a kind of "hopeless psychopath who decides to threaten an innocent couple," loved directly by filmmakers. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is clumsy and translated in a few places. Acting is equally poor, especially on the part of the villain played by Joong-Hoon Park. It seems that he thinks that without blinking and trying to speak in a deep voice, he makes his character seem threatening when everything he really does makes it seem a bit simple. <br /> <br /> The story deserves special attention, as it is idiotic beyond all faith. The "heroes" do not consider it too strange that their hitchhiker threatens to kill them. The "heroine" twice misses seeing a villain when there is not more than one foot from her. A black character passes a police checkpoint (in a blood-covered shirt and a bloodied bandage), showing the burned corpses to the cops in the passenger seat of the car he is driving. The villain is hit, dipped by a shovel, and stuck in the forks, but he never seems to be bothered by these rather serious injuries. And do not even start this terrible ending of the "twist". Sheesh. <br /> <br /> The only advantage of this film is Sang Mi Chu. Who is very pretty, but really is not an ordinary actress. <br /> <br /> Generally, this movie looks like a badly written, tattered and shockingly targeted attempt to copy "The Hitcher" and "Spoorloos", but it fails at every step because of the lack of talent in everyone involved.
