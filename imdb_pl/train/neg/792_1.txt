Thanks to the BBC for this program. I used to suffer from an inferiority complex, I hated leaving my home, talking to new people, and had an overwhelming sense that people hated me. However, after watching one episode 4 Non Blondes, my fortunes began to change. After episode 2, I started applying for new jobs, dressed in fashionable clothes and I felt really talented. After the series ended, I ran a sales department at work, hitting a lot of women and often won a local karaoke competition. If you ever have a crisis of confidence and do not know where to turn, go on a trip to Poundland and take the DVD, which costs only 99 pence.
