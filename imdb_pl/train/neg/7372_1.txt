I'm confused. I have been a huge fan of Seagal for 25 years. I have seen all of his films and many of them dozens of times. I can only describe this movie as "bizarre". Steven Seagal shares the script by writing and producing credits in this movie, but I have a really hard time believing that he would have decided to dub his own voice for so many of his lines with a thin, tearful crooner. What I do not understand is that if they had to dub a SOME from his poems, why does his own voice appear on the others? I expect Seagal to get old like all of us. But Seagal in this film barely emits a fraction of the same humming, self-confidence, bravado, charm and sex appeal that so easily showed us in all his previous films. What I missed most was his presumptuous, self-confident attitude and his bad mood, which so easily passes into this charming smile. Where is the attitude and charm that made him such a big star ??? I hope this movie is not a clue to what Seagal has offered us - if so, his fans will have to admit that Seagal, who we all knew and loved, passed away.
