It's the worst movie I've ever seen in my whole life. The plot and message are terrible. There are too many mistakes in this movie that you can not keep up. I do not even understand how this movie can receive any nomination, let alone 2. Here's why: 1) Sam Lee presents the evil / irrational detective who was caused by his father's disappointment. Pros: it's bad all right. Cons: As for the explanatory scene, he can not express the sadness / disappointment he has in his father. The crying scene was too false and it looks like it literally squeezes tears from the corner of the eyes. <br /> <br /> 2) To combine the movie with the title, during the fight scene and the scene of the rape, which is completely irrelevant and confusing to the viewer. I understand that it has to be a metaphor and what not ... but it's so stupid! 3) WHY A RAIL DOES NO RELIEF FOLLOW UP? What the hell is wrong with this movie. When the killer began stabbing the officer, he SHOOTED him. He is dead! What the hell? The murderer had many opportunities, but I do not know why he was not! 4) During the scene in which her foot hurts. In the scene it was very clear that the left foot of the girls was hurt, so how the hell in the next scene lends all its weight to the left foot? And this is the actress nominated for the best new artist? WTF? 5) The sounds in the movie are synchronized. <br /> <br /> 6) I'm guessing that this movie is trying to make violence and violence among children in Southeast Asia so why is this bad guy wins, and then the cop joins the fight? 7) This movie is too brutal without purpose. The police beat you to a pulp, and if they cooperate, give them marihuana and coca? This is the worst movie. I really feel that the person who wrote this movie is a sadist and a sick person. I've never seen a more disgusting movie in my whole life. The worst movie EVER!
