Do you want to know the secret of creating a movie in a fitness center? Just make a movie with charming ladies in super tight training clothes and make them hit and grind the floor like in a gentleman's club. That's what the creators of this horrible movie did, and this little trick made me look to the very end. This is the worst slasher movie I've ever seen, but every time I was ready to change the channel, they added another scene with the training girls and I would stay in place. In a film of smaller sizes, Killer Workout fails in any category that I can think of. As a showcase of beautiful girls, this is a success. Strong recommendation to avoid this, unless the thought of half of the movie being a big T & A show appeals to you.
