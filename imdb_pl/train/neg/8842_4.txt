It's a bit saying that most of the great movie reviews on IMDb come from people who have just reviewed one movie in their entire IMDb career and, as you guessed, this movie is "Parasomnia." I have often suspected good reviews about IMDb for what turns out to be not only a good movie but also a tricky marketing, but in this case it seems quite transparent. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that Parasomnia is terrible, but it stops being a good or great movie that can be. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, he has a great evil in Patrick Kilpatrick, who does a great job designing the threat and evil, I could easily see that he has what it takes to play a truly unforgettable evil spirit on a par with Hannibal Lecter. In dream sequences there are beautiful visualizations, in fact, if the movie decided to explore this area more, it could have been something better. The actual concept of cunning misuse of hypnosis is also great. <br /> <br /> Although I understand that suspending disbelief is necessary to immerse yourself in any good story, it is a sign of good history that allows you to do so. If you feel annoyed by what you think is illogical or just stupid, then the story loses you and that's what's happening to me in this movie. Other reviewers have mentioned this here and I do not want to enter the spoiler area, but I will say that the configuration at the end was particularly absurd and disappointing, not to mention the different mental age of the character who only had to experience a few years of life. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, there is a diabolical overused hypnosis, but unfortunately this movie is unaware of it.
