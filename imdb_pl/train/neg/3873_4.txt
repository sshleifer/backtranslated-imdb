Alicia Silverstone (formerly "Clueless") plays a modern teenager with a criminal obsession, trying to solve the brutal murder of a local girl. Pat Verducci wrote and directed this B-flick, which is not particularly well made, but is surprisingly serious in relation to his main character. Silverstone is attractive and successful in forging an interesting young woman, despite the kitsch undermining. The support cast (including Kevin Dillon and Michael Bowen) is not bad, although violence in the last act is exaggerating. It is not a cheesy camp festival, but also unforgettably unforgettable. * 1/2 of ****
