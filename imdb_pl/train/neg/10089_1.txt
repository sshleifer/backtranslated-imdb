German filmmaker Ulli Lommel coped with the task that many horror fans thought impossible: he revealed his colleague Teon Bolton as the crown of the worst horror ever made. <br/> <br /> Lommel is really the new millennium for Ed Wood. This movie is as tacky and funny as the worst EW. I am both proud and ashamed when I say that I watched it in toto, morbidly fascinated to see only the low bar that can be set. The answer is: underground; Lommel dug a hole and buried it. <br /> <br /> The game starts with the cast of international Nobics. Only someone who lived in Los Angeles, where every car mechanic, physician and postman is an actor or writer waiting to be discovered, could easily understand how Lommel managed to find so many would-be actors who want to spit out his absurd dialogue with the straight face. <br /> <br /> The main character, a rascal policeman, plays a German actor with a thick German accent. Besides being a serial killer, he is also the oldest policeman in LA. Despite the fact that he stops the innocent women and takes them to custody, he drags them into his home (which inexplicably is the top floor of the furniture store) and does it all in front of his new partners, LAPD refuses to investigate, going so far that physically he will attack one of his prosecutors in a ninja raid on his apartment. <br /> <br /> The sets are terribly bad. The designer's budget apparently contained enough money for a can of paint; just paint "Precinct 707" on a cardboard wall. <br /> <br /> Because the actors were, of course, unprofessional free - a sad assortment of European expatriates (perhaps deported if they were active in their home countries), bimbos, mimbos and desperate middle-aged women - and since little money was spent on sets , special efx, locations or other production values, it can be rightly mentioned that they have jumped into several authentic police uniforms. Unfortunately, they can not afford a police car; uniformed cops roam the streets in the new, shiny Mercury rental. <br /> <br /> Over half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our mad German LAPD officer and the futile efforts of two young debutants who stopped him. One of these young actors is particularly pathetic, because he is the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot in a real career in movies. Others fit perfectly, with a rockabilly hairstyle and tortured Brando that must be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> The second part of the movie is the place where the title gets its zombie, as the victim of our killer is resurrected after murdering a girl who has just visited some voodoo priestess to put a protective spell on her. Do not ask why a Romanian girl is resorting to voodooism in anticipation of murder, just accept Lommel's logic and enjoy absurd driving. <br /> <br /> After long-lasting wiping of hands from straw roadside graves, zombie girls manage to appear. They look exactly like before death, maybe even nicer, with black glamor makeup lavishly cleansed around the eyes. They do not look like zombies, they look more like fashionable models ready for the runway. <br /> <br /> At this point, the film Lommel borrows a creative note from his acclaimed compatriot Bolla and injects large doses of trashy techno trash into the soundtrack. We're talking about the prehistoric hum of an electronic bumblebee. Things that they could play at the disco in Ibiza, when Lommel was still young enough to shake his prey. <br /> <br /> Unlike other zombies, Lommel girls speak and function normally ... ee, just like they do before they become zombified. It gives our authors many opportunities to take into account his golden dialogue. Yes, the golden rain is. <br /> <br /> I will not mess up anything, revealing the end of the shock. All I can say is that it fits perfectly with the rest of this masterpiece. Ed Wood's ghost is alive ... should I tell his geographer?
