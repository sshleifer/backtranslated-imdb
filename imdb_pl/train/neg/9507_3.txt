I am always frustrated with films that were written by one gender. Especially when they apparently do not do enough research to find out when something will not just call, but will call grossly false. <br /> <br /> The scene I remember is the one in the bathroom where his football teammates tell Jack that Diane was pregnant. In any way, the shape and character of the guy would never cheer another man in pregnancy in high school. They can cheer on a guy having sex with a hot cheerleader, but I can also guarantee that the first football team she's heard of will not be in the urinal. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that this movie did not do it. Take it so seriously, and it was not terribly bad, but give it a rest!
