Drones, ethnic drumming, wrong synth loop, children's singing. The most condescending "music of the world" imaginable. It's a tourist movie and bad. What he really kills is incoherent sequences. India, Egypt, South America, Africa, etc., etc. Without transitions, without a visual explanation of why we suddenly have ten thousand miles away, no ideas expressed in pictures. Several recordings from the third world with "baskets on their heads", as another reviewer said. Going endlessly, as if it had some deep meaning. If these guys wanted to make a music video for the third world, all they had to do was go a few hundred miles south of the place where the best parts of Koya were shot and shoot in Mexico. It would be a much better setting for "life in transformation". <br /> <br /> But no. They decided on a muddy tourist route covering half the globe and deadly exaggerated filter shots. The only thing I can recommend to this movie is that it is not as much sucked as Naqoyqatsi. <br /> <br /> RstJ
