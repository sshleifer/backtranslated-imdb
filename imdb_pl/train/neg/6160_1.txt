I would not say it's a * bad * movie. Unfortunately, for me, I have the impression that the more you know about fencing, the worse it is simply because it becomes completely unrealistic. I've been fencing since I was 14 years old, and this film shows it very poorly. F. Murray Abraham is good (and he seems to have some fencing background), but most other actors - especially students - seem lost.
