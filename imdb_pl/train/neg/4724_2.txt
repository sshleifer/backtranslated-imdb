This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I saw it at the premiere at SXSW and I was very disappointed. The director did not know much about John Lennon, and even said so much at the premiere. It's a drama, but people laughed at how bad the movie was. This is never a good sign. The only saving graces were Dominic Monaghan and Jason Leonard as co-owners / colleagues from the Livien band. They were funny, while the rest of the movie was too serious. The shoddy dropping of the Beatles' texts was simply absurd. The soundtrack, however, was excellent and was probably the best part of the movie. If you're not one of those mad, crazy Dominica Monaghan fans, do not worry about it.
