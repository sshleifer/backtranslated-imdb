It's really a stupid movie. It can be fun with cool looking aliens and rural surroundings, but it just is not. <br /> <br /> Some aliens hear the broadcast of the World War, when a small national radio station plays it for Halloween. They come to Earth to kill people, but instead of killing, they make people slaves and act foolishly. The front cover of the film shows these aliens riding on surfboards in space ... not really what they are doing. They are not aliens, they are stupid cartoon idiots with annoying high modulated voices. The alien with the most livable voice turns out to be the alien Jack Nicholson, who always wears sunglasses. Outside of strangers, acting is terrible. Writing is of course intended for children, because each character is written like a child. <br /> <br /> It's a stupid movie that only children can appreciate. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 100 minutes. PG for a mild language.
