Poor Bobby "Pineapple Salsa" Flay and Mario Batali are down. <br /> <br /> Flay is the worst. Definitely one trick pony, I think they could get other American chefs to come to the table as Iron Chefs. The types of dishes that this duo really came up with ... do not reflect on the creativity of the original Iron Chef series. I do not think that Batali even went to a cooking school. There are many great chefs in America. I'm just wondering why they do not appear on the Food Network. <br /> <br /> It would also help to have more regional ingredients and possibly co-hosts who can cope with pressure. I like Altona Brown, but for this role is a little too nonchalant / funny.
