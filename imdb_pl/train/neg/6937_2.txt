The theme that this last adman, who went on stage, tries to solve in his debut venture, is the eternal topic of discussion of almost every cultural standard - a timeless romance (intended pun). <br /> <br /> However, exploration (and use for Desi auds) is pitifully short, because the usual inclinations to "pepper, spice and sugar" to the usual mix of scores b / g, dialogues, dance, drama, etc. They create a nice looking package with little inside. <br /> <br /> In the first 40 minutes of the film the kitchen scene was repeated at least 8-9 times. Subsequent repetitions follow the film (in the end the main character is a cook). But this is the problem - no history! Hah, no wonder. Someone forgot to write a script. <br /> <br /> Amitabh places Cheeni Jyada (more) from excessive action. Really, when will this guy ever stop? How many 60-year-olds do it that way, even if the 30-year-old nubile teases them ??? A timeless mind, yes, but for sure what about a not-too-eternal body? And the sole? Excuse me, soul ?! The wisely good actor Paresh Rawal, who has the only meaningful role in the film. The director lacks the sense of realism that would fall into his new discovery of a new, hot idea. Nowhere are we presented any problems with everyday life or problems that such a couple may encounter, apart from the actual marriage, which is only an initial obstacle. Sub-theme of a small child with cancer (first bachelor's love) is nowhere to go, and any bit of emotion that this otherwise insipid presentation could cause, quickly dies along with the character of the girl. <br /> <br /> Anyway, nice attempt, but not yet.
