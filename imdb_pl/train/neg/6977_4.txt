I have read all the enthusiastic reviews here and I am impressed by the imagination of those who loved this movie. I can not say that I found a lot to recommend. The soundtrack of Leonard Cohen is not only excessively heavy, but also gloomy. The film looks quite authentic, but something must happen to make it work, and nothing else: a cursory plot (this is not a real problem for me), little character development, nothing thematic. It just breaks down. The fault is that "Heaven's Gate" Cimino has a few moments of a real miracle and this is a movie that I will look at earlier. For the brilliant image of the West, "Deadwood" HBO is much better than "McCabe".
