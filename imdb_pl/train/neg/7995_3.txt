I remember watching this movie when I was young, but I could not remember the title of the movie, and then I was looking through the horrors that I find and I think, "this is the title?". This movie is a combination of a catastrophic / insect attack movie with fewer significant stars. It is also a bit boring, because it has a television atmosphere in which you can see how the movie disappears in commercials. The plot has this kind of resort invaded by ants. I think they were a bit worried about the construction or something that was going on nearby, but do not quote me about it. The most memorable attack of ants for me in the whole fast movement was the first attack with a kid who fell into the pool after he was infected and of course Summers also attacked the scene. What still stands out against this background is the very stupid end in which the survivors use cardboard tubes to breathe. After all, like most TV movies, this movie is very tame and not too scary, unless you panic at the sight of the ants.
