The female was a terrible actress who made the whole movie average. She was smiling too much when she first stood in front of the cameras to talk about her daughter. This should make the police suspect her. I would be disconsolate in an identical situation. She seemed calm to her mother, who could not find her daughter. It's like she does not even want to be in the movie. Jennifer Aniston would play this role better. And it would earn much more money on such a controversial, important topic. Everyone else was perfect. I do not know where the main actress is, but I hope she got acting lessons.
