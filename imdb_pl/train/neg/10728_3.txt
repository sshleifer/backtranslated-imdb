The worst movie I've seen in a long time. Interesting first half with interesting, concise dialogue between suspicious characters in the night bar. The film then turns into a shapeless sequence of scenes aimed at a visual shock (reading off disgust) without redemptive observation or lesson in humanity or anything else. <br /> <br /> I wanted to leave, but the director was present at this show and my kindness makes it impossible for me to show him disrespect. Still, time is precious (as the director himself pointed out in his introduction) and I really regret that I lost time to the other half of it. <br /> <br /> Saving favors were the three main characters in the first half of the film, especially the female one.
