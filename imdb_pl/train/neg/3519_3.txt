There are several Stallone movies that I like, but this movie did not meet my low expectations. It's hard for me to believe in this movie. For example, a group of terrorists who break up the land in the desert is ready to survive for at least two days. In addition, throughout this wilderness Stallone and the company run across bridges and ladders that provide convenient shortcuts or plot devices. In addition, the cops do not coordinate anything with local rescuers. Besides, bad guys who could not hit the barn with really technologically advanced automatic weapons. <br /> <br /> Initially I liked the villain of John Lithgow, but the character is such a complete psychopath that he does not care about any of his bad guys, or all of them killed. In the end, I could not believe this character anymore. <br /> <br /> Not worth the rental price, it's not even worth spending time watching.
