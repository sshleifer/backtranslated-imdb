As we all love Al Pacino, it was painful to see him in this film. Hacking the ad in the dirty end of what once seemed to be an outstanding and idealistic career Pacino plays his role, looking like an unconfirmed bed and attacking everyone with a completely false and inconsistent southern accent. it spools in this way with so many loose ends and improbabilities that the mind spins (and then retreats). <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger is there, he does not do much. Her scenes with Pacino are flat and unconvincing. It is hard to believe that they meant a lot to each other. There is no energy there. <br /> <br /> Leone's tea lights up the screen. It was electric, and her scenes with Pacino were definitely the most interesting in the film, but not enough to save Al from embarrassment.
