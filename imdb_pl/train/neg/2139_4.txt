I really wanted to like it, but in the end it's a poorly made movie with too little laughter. <br /> <br /> Politics are in place, insults the Republicans, but that's what it's aimed at. That alone gives me a reason to giggle. <br /> <br /> The problem is that it looks like it was made in a REAL rush (eg About a week). And it contains a stupid thread about some bimbo singer who seems to be completely out of the topic. <br /> <br /> Turiqistan is of course Iraq, or Afghanistan, or any other number of countries with which the US works in the 1950s. Humor is a bit dark (amputated dancing with prosthetic legs made by Tamerlane corporation), but it IS a sign, especially when corporations earn a reconstruction ("democracy lite"!) <br /> <br /> a lot of satire criticizing the US, it seems terribly heavy and heavy. I think that this is contrary to such a large propaganda of bs, so you have to crush people to say something. Who knows. I prefer to poke more, blink - a bit of subtlety. But that's just me. <br /> <br /> In any case, I can see it again, maybe I missed something. <br /> <br /> I hope "W" is more significant.
