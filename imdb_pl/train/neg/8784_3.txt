The idea was amazing, the actors were amazing, the story could be very scary, but the writing was weak and there was no depth. I could not really enter this movie. I could not feel the heroes, there were many dangers, and the film ends very strangely. Was this a happy ending? I do not know. Was it a sad ending? I do not know again. You leave the theater unhappy. The movie had so much to offer, but he could not. Just because you can edit, does not mean that you should, right? I really would not recommend this movie because it's just not possible to say that you left the movie as if it were finished. You will just be confused. Trust me, you'll probably thank me if you do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
