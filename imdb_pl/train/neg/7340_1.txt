Impressed! This is the worst SRK movie and one of the worst Bollywood movies I've ever seen! I did not like this novel, but this movie has made matters worse! Very bad music, even worse actors (except of course SRK, though even he is not able to save the movie) and it does not make much sense. The director makes everything look very confused, God knows why ... Maybe because he tries to make everything look very surreal and yet credible. Well, he does not manage. <br /> <br /> Even if you have a few hours to lose, do not watch this movie, please! (Saying this for your own good!) Look further, you will find something different to watch!
