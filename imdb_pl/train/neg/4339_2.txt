this movie was not what I expected. <br /> <br /> if this movie was named something else, no one would even notice the difference between them. <br /> <br /> it's really weird because I do not see the point. Prequel and sequel just let you say that it does not make sense, does not even fit. maybe I'm naive, but I'm not able to match vol 1 and vol 2. <br /> <br /> carlito was in prison in the first and dies in the original, and in the prequel lives and does not go to prison. <br /> <br /> the plot was fine, but they should have changed some of the actors and part of the story and the name of the movie and it would have been a good movie. I really expected it to end, how the second one began. <br /> <br /> if anyone has an opinion on this post, please.
