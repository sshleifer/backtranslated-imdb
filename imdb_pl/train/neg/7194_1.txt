According to the well-known practice of the theft of Disney ... I mean ... buying out familiar properties and their bastards, this version of the venerable cartoon classics live has to be one of the worst remakes in the bad year of reworking. I was raised on the original cartoon television series. Each episode of the original cartoon series will give you more laughter than the whole movie. There's no nice Penny computer book here. There is also no gag with self-destructive orders that always end with the detonation of the leader. A new feature is the smoothly replaceable gadget Gadget (the original drawing had a cooler vehicle that could turn into a van or a car) and an element of a typical, unrealistic Hollywood romance. Do not fill the cash register to pay for the Disney management, and even their _ex_executives - you do not see this movie. <br /> <br />
