The latest rumors are that Vh1 is starting to cast I Love New York 3 in mid-2008. Does this mean that Budah or Tailor did an abandoned New York, or does it mean that New York threw the winner? <br /> <br /> I know that Flavor of Love is approaching the third season, so now with Flavor of Love 3 and I love New York 3 ..... will there ever be a real winner ??? <br /> <br /> I also heard some rumors that Chance will be reinstated for the third season of I Love New York !!!! I have also heard rumors that New York will be specially presented in Flavor of Love 3. <br /> <br /> I hope it was not a big spoiler at the end of I Love New York 2 .... I'm just giving the latest rumors.
