Somewhere on this site, someone wrote that to get the best version of Jane Austen's works, simply read them. I agree with it. However, we love the adaptations of great literature, and the writers' current strike is reminiscent of the fact that without good writers it is difficult for actors to revive their roles. The current version of PERSUASJI Jane Austen shows us what is happening when there is no good basis for a well-written adaptation. This version is not comparable with the version from 1995 with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, which was well-preserved and preserved the essence of the era and limitations of heroes (except the bizarre parade and kissing on the street in Bath). Version from 2007 Shows naughty Anne who seems disturbed. Other characters were not very developed, which is a crime, considering how Austen could paint such wonderful characters with carefully selected unsaid words. The sequence of events that made sense in the novel was completely thrown, and Mrs. Smith, bedridden and impoverished, her schoolmate, Anne, goes to Bath - bouncing how many characters seemed to be doing. The strength of character and the intelligence of Captain Wentworth, which made Anne love him, apparently has not been signed into Wentworth Rupert Penry-Jones. Ciaran Hinds had more substance and was able to give much more with the appearance than P-J could do with his poses. In conclusion, the 2007 version was a disappointment. It seemed that this novel had been twisted into a melodrama of discreet value. If they wanted to transfer our modern extravagant emotions to Austen's work, they should have done what they did with Shakespeare's adaptations: adjust it to the present. At least "Bride & Prejudice" has been removed from the historical and location settings and it was nice to watch, just like "Clueless". It was not PERSUZA, but they did not know what to call it.
