I can start by saying that Casey Affleck is a very talented actor and I respect his work very much. I would like him to be in more films that would show his talent. That said, Soul Survivors was a very, very bad movie. Very bad. <br /> <br /> I must say that I attribute all blame to almost everything. Affleck is a very talented actress, Wes Bentley had great performances at American Beauty, Melissa Sagemiller did a good job, and Eliza Dushku is now a girl in Hollywood. I do not think one of the actors really came up with the script and I understand why. To say that this movie belongs to the genre of horror movies is an exaggeration. She had bends and turns that one would expect, but they just did not lead anywhere ... except for more confusion. I just think that the ending is very anti-climatic because it just did not make sense or match any of the questions I had about the plot. <br /> <br /> I would like to be able to give this movie a good review, but I can not. Honestly, the only thing that seems terrifying to me is that you have paid for this movie.
