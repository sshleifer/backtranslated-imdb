Jane Eyre_ is one of the greatest novels in English, and the screenwriter should read it. I hate it when writers use Spark notes for the novel. This movie is unbearable if you read a book. <br /> <br /> The whole "red room" is so played that I wonder why they even try to put it. In the book "Red Room", it is the foretaste of the history of the WHOLE and the rest of Jane's life. Helen Burns is so badly treated in the movie I'm sure she was happy to die and leave early. The book is one of the most attractive characters, and it was not a red head. In her life and the rest of the film, the entire Christian theme is missing. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and miss this movie and read the story, as Charlotte Bronte said in a masterly way.
