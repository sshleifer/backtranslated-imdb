Disney did it again. The company that created "Mr. Magoo "and" George of the Jungle ", made another movie that barely resembles the cartoon it is based on, and does not retain anything of the spirit of the original. <br /> <br /> "Inspector Gadget" was one of my favorite cartoons when I was young, and a movie that could have existed could be a dream come true. Now that this movie exists, I was very disappointed and even indignant. <br /> <br /> We have characters first. <br /> <br /> The gadget itself has gadgets that have made it such a funny figure original (with the accompanying special effects), and even have a bit of naivete the original gadget, but is now more knowledgeable and is expected to solve the crime itself while Penny and Brain are just watching. /> <br /> Penny has little to do; while she played a central role in the cartoon, uncovering the crime and stopping it, and occasionally being captured by MAD agents, it is now simply introduced and then forgotten, although at least it sneaks into the Claw base. br /> Claw is the movie version of Dr. Claw, who was a rather sinister, hoarse voice who wore metal gloves and sat in a chair, his face hidden from his eyes as he stroked his cat and supervised various crimes. Now he is simply a man with a claw by the hand, no secret for the character. <br /> <br /> Brain and Mad Cat exist in the film, but they are rather irrelevant to it. <br /> <br /> Even small parts of the cartoon are not saved in this butchering. The famous phrase "Wowsers!" Has been mysteriously changed to "Wowser", and the gadget Gadget's Gadgetmobile now looks different and says. <br /> <br /> There are even product annotations everywhere. Why "Yahoo!" advertised on the sign? Why does Gadgetmobile have buttons for M & M's or Skittles? <br /> <br /> Cartoon fans will hate him, others can probably find a movie below the norm, and when everything is said and done, this movie is another attempt to make quick money from another old program.
