A scary movie containing a group of Canadian actors from the D-list, who seem so aware of the fact that they are in the camera, that their performances are too melodramatic and completely forgotten. <br /> <br /> This movie is badly written, badly edited and badly targeted. It is chaotic, unintelligible and bizarre - but not in a good way. McDowell does well with what's given to him, but he's the only one who will do it - he really has a bad story and a work scenario. It's not even camp enough to be fun. <br /> <br /> I have not seen Van Pelleske in a credible way, and even characters like Eisen (with his nasal, tearful voice) confirm that we are a lot in Toronto, not on a barge outside of Africa. <br /> <br /> Did not the director see that the "creature" looks like a jazz dancer in strange clothes? The fight between the blue thunderbolts and the orange "magic" pelleske'm (with the lack of a better word) is, of course, the result of bad actors, without choreographers, completely covered by derivative special effects. Was there even a director on the set or editing of this catastrophic movie (not good)? <br /> <br /> Learn from the mistakes of others ... do not waste time on it, you will regret it, just like me. I have nothing more to say about this celluloid waste.
