Let's say I had to suspend my disbelief less for Spiderman than for Hooligans. That means I have fewer problems with the belief that Toby McGuire can stick to buildings than me, Elia Wood, throwing herself with the hard at Manchester. I will not go into details because I do not want to write a spoiler, but the idea of ​​adults, British men who fall into pieces of death every weekend is ... funny. And this movie is not. Fighting, the idea of ​​fighting, is taken too seriously. Gravity of pugilism, the respect with which an object is treated, becomes irritating because it does not establish or resolve a conflict. It seems that the plot, with holes large enough to push a Guinness truck, has been slapped along with the invented motif of "fish out of water" so that viewers can stare at Woods tearing eyes when learning how to become a man, i.e. hitting other young men with the opposite football tastes dull items and then escapes as soon as possible. The characters are cartoons, especially the Americans at Harvard. Character development and story are sent to the viewer throughout the picture. Unfortunately, the absurdity of the film does not reach its level until the end, which by this time you will spend almost two hours of your life, you will never come back. Pick up the "Football Factory" or "Fight Club" instead of this bizarre and disappointing dud. He does not waste time with an empty melodrama, tired of the old "Yankee in King Aurthur's Court" or crying, parables about the maturation of nonsense. They are simply pure, dark and clever; the way violence should be.
