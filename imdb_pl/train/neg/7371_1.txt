Steven Seagal .... how could you be part of such a horrible movie? I rented this movie because your movies were usually quite clean. I've lost a lot of respect for being in a terrible movie like this one. Very, very poor taste! I'm embarrassed that I even rented this movie. Steven, if you play in movies like this, I believe your career is over. My husband and I liked to watch many of your movies because you can always "catch the wrong" with a few maneuvers and make it clean ... and the language is quite clean in your movies ... but this is something different. I will think twice before I rent your next movie.
