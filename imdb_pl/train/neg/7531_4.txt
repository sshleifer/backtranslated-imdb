This is allegedly a film about multiple sadness. As such, he should move viewers and make them feel empathetic about the difficult situation of the main characters. However, his annoying postmodern style makes him almost incomprehensible. The camera constantly switches from one scene to another, from one personal crisis to the next, creating a restless, chaotic effect. Most characters seem to live a pointless, unstructured life related to their professional commitments. (It also extends to the credibility that a man who has just been given what is likely a death sentence would happily give up on sex with a woman he has just met). The plot (if there is a plot) is difficult to follow. In conclusion, the overall effect is rather disappointing. After all, the game is generally good, and some scenes are quite powerful.
