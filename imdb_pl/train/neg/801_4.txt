Despite the stereotypes, practically "no-name" and of course a low budget, I thought that this movie is fine; much better than I expected. At first I was skeptical - the idea of ​​a computer virus that could infect people seemed a bit preposterous to me. But in the end I thought that the film coped well with this concept (even if some of the scenes were a bit trivial). <br /> <br /> The cast was pretty good, and the two leaders seemed to take their roles very seriously. I could not stop thinking that Janine Turner is a bit like Geena Davis. Maybe it's just her face, the make-up, the hair and the clothes she had in this movie, but it kept tormenting me in my mind. <br /> <br /> Although it is not a "must see" or a great movie by any standard, "Fatal Error" is a funny movie that will watch you to the end.
