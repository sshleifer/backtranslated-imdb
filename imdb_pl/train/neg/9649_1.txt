Who were they kidding with? There was too much in this movie that was difficult to digest. From the moment that Arjun (Ajay Devgan) unknowingly wishes his father's death when he comes to London with his uncle (played by Om Puri) to abandon him a few minutes later. The only problem with this theory is that anyone who has ever gone through London Heathrow knows that such a feast would be impossible, especially by an Indian. But the film problems do not end there, there is the question of two main characters (Salman Khan and Ajay Devgan), who as rock stars have a chance to achieve their dreams. I mean, we saw the success of Susan Boyle (a woman in the UK reaching her dreams after the age of 50), but this was a rare case. It was really hard for me to suspend my disbelief, because I felt that filling Salman and Ajay was simply misguided. They would never throw Madhuri Dixit and Sridevi to play the same roles, so why should we be forced to watch Ajay Devgan and Salman Khan (men in their forties) desperately trying to maintain their 20 years? Let's not even talk about the most conscious actress on the screen, Asin. It's her second movie (which I've seen), and she's just hopeless as an actress, so aware of her appearance that she's only interested in looking good and fashionable, instead of giving a good performance. It is hard to believe that she rejected all other film roles to play in this fluff, and then she was as fluffy as an actress, which is nothing to write about. And to top it all, the movie was boring. There is nothing special about it, trust that you anticipate every clich√© that will happen in it.
