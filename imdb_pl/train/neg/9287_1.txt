WOW! Why would someone have to make a sequel of a rancid film? Half Past Dead was a bad movie, but at least he had an idea of ​​what he wanted to be. HPD2 has no idea who he wants to be. It simply exists on the screen for reasons I can not explain. Spoiler: The whole movie is this: Twitch (played by Kurupta with Tha Dogg Pound) is moved to another prison, where there can be a chest filled with gold bricks. In prison, riots between rivals break out, one of them is shot by a guy named Cortez, and Cortez plans to escape. During the marriage visit Twitch's bride and daughter Burke (played by Bill Goldberg) are kidnapped by Cortez and held in the execution room. Burke reluctantly befriends Twitch and eventually gets into trouble with idiotic prisoners when they find out that Cortez has relatives. <br /> <br /> Opinion: This is the most unnecessary continuation from Universal Soldier: The Return. The script is awful, acting is frightening, dialogue is a joke and everyone in this movie is a caricature. Look, I know it was a low-budget movie, but it's not an excuse for these guys not to put effort into what they're doing. Nobody in this "film" believes in the character that plays. No one in this "film can be taken seriously as an actor. Kurupt should be ashamed. His character "Twitch" is almost a shapeless puppet of a minstrel who spends most of his time getting to know each other when he is attacked by Burke or other prisoners. Bill Goldberg spends most of his time sulking throughout the movie, as if he had to take a PHD (quite a huge dump). The battle scenes are poorly choreographed and pathetic, and the HPD2 action film is quite boring, even when the action happens! Let somebody tell you that this movie is decent, it stinks and is the main reason folks despise Follywood.
