One of the documentary films "Thank God-I'm not alive." This is about two fighting factions in Colombia, partisans and paramilitary forces, and the surrounding Medellin peoples. <br /> <br /> Guns, drugs and death are going crazy. Men who are not more than 22 years old and are not in combat are in prison. Girls ?? no women, girls? always react the same when one of them is killed, with tears and screams. You scratch your head; what did they really expect? I do not know what is more disturbing: nighttime shootings and social unrest, or that everyone just seems to passively accept things as they are. Or, seeing this boy drinking what is obviously not his first beer, being all that 10? If you took these young men from their situation and put them in a place where they could do more or more, how many of them would decide not to stay? <br /> <br /> Based on this document, I'm afraid.
