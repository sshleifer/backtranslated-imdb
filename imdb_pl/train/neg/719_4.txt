This film, although seemingly a comedy, is deadly serious. His theme is imperialism (with a significant I): how Great Britain, stupidly, humiliatingly, tries to convince himself that after the Second World War he is still a great power. In the Empire's home, it is led by friendly dolby, benevolent Tories who are so raised that they can not distinguish close relatives; Government offices consist of long-forgotten archives (excavations in Orwellian paranoia?), Inhabited by lazy rats, and hallways in which the living room got bored with synagogues, reading popular novels. <br /> <br /> Abroad, the United Kingdom is holding up an old pump; but the pump from the context looks banal and stupid, especially when it is embodied in clumsy twos. Carlton-Browne is an unrealistic image of the fall, with no tear of decay that allegedly harassed the anti-imperialist Jewel in the Crown. <br /> <br /> The film also talks about the Cold War, bravely admitting that it is a dangerous farce, whose participants deserve mockery and contempt, not fear and respect. The point is how colonialism, characterized more by neglect than tyranny, destroys colonies that desert, depriving them of facilities, power and, most importantly, self-respect, leaving them vulnerable to the machinations of dangerous cowboys. <br /> <br /> Of course, it kills the seriousness. This does not mean that heavy subjects can not be treated in a comedy - everyone has proved it - The Miracle of Morgan's Creek, Dr. Strangelove and The Life Of Brian. Indeed, it could be suggested that serious topics should be treated only by comedy - this allows a more transparent picture. <br /> <br /> The problem with Carlton-Browne is that every situation must have a meaning that goes beyond ordinary comics, so that it becomes heavy and cumbersome. In the three films mentioned above, a significant part of the comedy results from the character's reaction to the extreme situation, not the extreme situation itself. The scenario here is too poor to sustain the rich comic character, and some of the greatest comedy talents ever collected - Peter Sellers, Terry-Thomas, Raymond Huntley and John le Mesurier - are wasted by criminals. <br /> <br /> Terry-Thomas, so often sublimated, shows that he could not handle the main parties and that he had to play sneering, arrogant boundaries, and not brainless. The music is made to carry a large part of the comedy, but its heavy irony only draws attention to the lack of fun on the screen. (To be honest, unlike most British comedies from that period that were staggering and under-produced, Boultings often try to get points through the film itself, editing and composition) Only Huntley manages to raise real laughter, thanks to an essay, which he could play in his dream. <br /> <br /> None of the Boultings fars was good - they are never thought out enough. Although Carlton-Browne revels in the fall of the Empire, it seems to be anti-democratic and militaristic. I'm sure it was not intentional, but these mistakes will have to happen if you allow decent intentions to take precedence over comic intelligence and film form.
