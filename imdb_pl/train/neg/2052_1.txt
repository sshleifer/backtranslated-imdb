This waste of time is a completely unnecessary remake of a great movie. Nothing new or original is added other than Perry's backs, which are marginal. He lacks the documentary of the first film and the harsh diligence that made it so effective. The sharp soundtrack of Quincy Jones, which added a lot to the original film, is also very painfully lacking. I do not understand any high grades at all. It is quite bad. Why is someone wasting time or money doing such nonsense and why I was wasting time watching this?
