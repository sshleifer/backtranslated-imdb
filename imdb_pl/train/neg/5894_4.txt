How many centuries will pass before the Japanese-Asian horror films leave the long-haired bird-woman? It must be admitted that they managed to break the Ring a million times and often it worked well - which just shows that originality is not so much a requirement in the horror genre (or that I am very uncritical and easy to please?). However, this time I was a little restless, a bit bored. This is not a bad movie, but at least half an hour longer than it should, with an absurd 110 minute time. Compared to many other Japanese horror movies, OMC has no atmosphere and emotions. In addition, the ending is misleading: it makes no sense at all. Regarding the bell: Miike could come up with a melody that is more effective than this forgetful thing. Even if I played a dozen times, I do not even remember it - it was terrible. Speaking of Miike, it's a commercial venture for him, so if someone thinks he can be distorted like "Bijita Q" or "Audition", he's wasting his time.
