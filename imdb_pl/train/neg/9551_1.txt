This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life. I would like to be able to go back in time and do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Find out where the movie "War Games - The Dead Code" was made 2) Watch the original WAR GAMES with my current computer knowledge AND preteen eyes from 1983. 3) Hack into the Pentagon in the 80's thanks to the knowledge and perspective learned and remembered. 4) Reprogramme WHOPPER on NUKE location of the DEAD CODE a few minutes before the first day of turning 5) Return to the present, drink a beer, and Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones will "shine" my empty memory of the whole event, especially my original watching "The Dead Code" 6) Make another beer and watch WARS GAMES 7) Be happy until the next bad remake of the movie THE GOOD 80s. <br /> <br /> 8) Have you forgotten to kill Jar Jar. I am not sure if I would have to travel to the future to this end. Maybe I need access to the wormhole.
