This comedy Hal Roach, A Tough Winter, is the ninety-ninth in the series "Our Gang / Little Rascals" and the eleventh talkie. Basically, the presentation of the black comic Stepin Fetchit, who makes special bills here, we see him going to his hut where the gang disconnects. Farina gets a love letter from him and Stepin tells him to read it because he can not read it during the day when he goes to NIGHT. It happens that he comes from his beloved in Tennesse, so Farina must have cotton-filled ears because she's too hot to hear her! In another room, Weezer tells Mary Ann how to make toffee from the radio, but because she runs back and forth to the kitchen, she misses the mistress and rice tamper segment of the Spanish tamale Mary Ann with the Tabasco and Lux ​​additions! After the mixture, Jackie and the rest of the gang help themselves with a horrible, but very sticky substance, and as a result everyone is stuck on the walls. When everyone is trying to clean up the mess, Stepin works in the basement on various pipes and electrical outlets that combine the functions of various devices, such as the phone that vacuum cleaners, the vacuum rings and the fridge that plays music! End. What I just described heralds the meandering nature of this short film "Our gang", which served as a pilot for the short series of films by Stepin Fetchit. It's good that it never happened, because the characteristics of the lazy Negroes by Fetchit were fun only in small doses and would be considered highly offensive today. Many of the scenes I just described are good for some laughter, although the last sequence was so tangled that the results were too thick for me. In summary, A Tough Winter is a curio that is worth seeing at least once. By the way, Stepin's real name was Lincoln Theodore Perry.
