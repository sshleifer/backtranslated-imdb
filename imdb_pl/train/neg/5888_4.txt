I saw it recently on a faded old VHS tape and I remembered it faintly. Looking at it now, it seems charming. <br /> <br /> When it was first released, it was considered by most to be a trick of revealing itself as a gay teenager. To jump home, my mother reads a paperback book "1 teenager in 10", the most popular book from that time. David Warner considers this to be a persecutor of a vampire hunter [= an evangelist who hates gays], which is of course a disgust to himself. A list of eye gags and jokes that have been included to ensure that no one would overlook the point would be too long to enter. The producers had a lot of fun and were hoping, without a doubt, for brightening and enlightenment. <br /> <br /> But I have no idea how a teenage audience will look at this movie, now. In some places where there is education and culture, the horrific attempts that teenagers have to undergo belong to the past. But I'm sure there are a lot of dark, nasty corners of our continent, where it's just as bad as ever.
