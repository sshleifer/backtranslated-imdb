I could not give this film a bad review or bad review for two reasons: Robin Williams and Toni Collete. The film has the potential to be a thriller and there are some minor disturbing elements that rely on psychology, which was something the film could focus on. Robin Williams plays Gabriela Noon, a storyteller of night stories who is experiencing personal problems: his lover moves out, and Gabriel has something that seems to be a storytelling block. One day he receives and reads a story written by a dying 14-year-old boy named Pete Boland (Rory Culkin). Pete talks about his life and the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents. He lives with his adopted mother and social worker, Donna Boland (Toni Collette). Gabriel is fascinated and starts a friendship with Pete, but things seem strange when Gabriel tries to meet him and discovers that Pete Boland may not even exist. I will not go into details because I do not want to spoil the movie, but let me tell you this: it's quite predictable. Fascinating atmosphere for telling stories and good performances of Robin Williams and Toni Collette, about which I thought he was a key figure in the movie. Collette is undoubtedly one of the most talented and most beautiful actresses. Her ability to reach the psyche and personality of the heroes she portrays is very amazing and I hope to see her win the Oscar (hell, I think she could win the award for the best supporting actress if the scenario was a bit better). The film begins as a psychological thriller, but it is predictable. If you would like to know the ending of the movie and its phrases, then see the movie, otherwise I would rent another predictable thriller, "Hide."
