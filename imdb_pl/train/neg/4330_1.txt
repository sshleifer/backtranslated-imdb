Last night I decided to watch the prequel, or I will say the so-called prequel to Carlito's Way - "Carlito's Way: Rise to Power (2005)", which went straight to DVD ... no wonder ... completely .... And I mean completely S% and KS! !! Watch time and I think it would be a pure passion of time to write about it ... I do not understand how De Palma agreed to produce this sh-t-fest movie .... except only one fact that I'm tipping my hat. .. Jay Hernandez, who plays the young Brigante .... reminded me of how De Niro fell into Brando's shoes to introduce the young Don Corleone in Godfather II ... but the difference De Niro was amazing, and even got an Oscar for that! !! Jay Hernandez has the courage to try to be a young Pacino .... it's a pity for him I do not think he's going to be in the movie anymore, and by the way, after watching this movie, I was sitting down and watching the original way of Carlitos remove the bad taste from my mouth.
