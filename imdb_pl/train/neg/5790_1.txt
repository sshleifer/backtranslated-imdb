This movie is funny. Everyone who says that the game is great, and the casting is great, has never even seen the average cinema. Acting is obviously awful in the first 5 characters you meet. Lame. I feel that all other "violent" comments had to be made by people associated with filmmakers. The plot did not impress me much, but I just wanted to see some beautiful rural scenery in Oregon and there was some decent cinematography - but the casting was something inspired. I think that this film mocks the general noble suggestion that something deep in the Indian culture has been ignored and perhaps lost, and that it is profitable and possible to revive it. He places jokes in the wrong and too obvious places and makes me think that they were written by the State Department or something like that. Return to the drawing board. Even suggesting that this movie deserves a place in the same area of ​​classics as Harold and Maude, it is absolutely delayed and on the same line of pleading and grudging and "joking" as is the case in this film.
