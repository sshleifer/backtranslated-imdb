9, a movie that I could not wait for months ... was rather a disappointment. <br /> <br /> I was deeply surprised by the lack of history and the strange development of the character. All amazing action sequences in the world do not make up for one unpleasant character. <br /> <br /> Strange, almost thrown into occult sequences were not only out of place, they were annoying. The story tells about robots and scientists ... why does it suddenly turn into a horroness necronomicon, which has mystical symbols and green lines of magical spirits, instead of giving an answer to what could be perfectly terrifying storytelling devices ??? > How, what, when, why ... questions that would spell only when you care about it and it becomes less and less likely that you will leave the theater. <br /> <br /> This kind of movie is frustrating because of the lack of depth ... If I was good, I would watch this movie in a crayon. But the filmmakers relied on the CGI wizardry and called Tim Burton to draw the crowd. What ... attracted me, but I could not get respect. <br /> <br /> 9 could have been amazing ... with some additional modifications and a little more respect from its own creators.
