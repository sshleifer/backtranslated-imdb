The weak link between this film and the first Grease was made at the very beginning of the film, when Didi Conn, one of the four cast members, repeats his roles, approaches the young Maxwell Caulfield, who is a British exchange student. Although in the previous movie the speech pattern Olivia Newton St. John has not been explained, it is explained here that Caulfield is her cousin. What is Conn still doing at school? I think she just enjoys spending time at Rydell High, although now she is a beautician. <br /> <br /> Caulfield is a smart kid, so of course the hood types led by Adrian Zmed are marked as a gull. And this is particularly bad when a friend of Zmeda decides he likes Caulfield. But being a loser will not stop him. <br /> <br /> Then Caulfield decides to start a modern Zorro act. He gets a broken bike and folds it back and teaches him how to ride. He gets a biker's outfit made of leather with a set of goggles to hide his face. If the capture of Michelle Pheiffer is not on the cards, Caulfield will have no problems with making friends with any homosexual male leather belt in the way it is equipped. both career paths have been successful. If you've seen the first Grease movie, a much better movie, then you definitely have an idea of ​​how this movie will turn out. <br /> <br /> In addition to Conn, Eve Arden, Sid Caesar and Dody Goodman, all the faculty members from the original Grease are back in their roles. The musical score is not as good as the songs from the original. <br /> <br /> It's not that Grease 2 is bad, but it's not that great.
