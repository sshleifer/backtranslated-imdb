I did not expect too much, but I was still disappointed. This was my least favorite production of Halestorm, which I saw. I thought it was supposed to be a comedy, but I just snorted at 3 or 4 jokes. Is it really a funny gag to see a fat guy eating donuts and falling in circles? What was with the caretaker on the Sky scene? Fred Willard was entertaining with some of his coworkers from Christopher Guest, but that did not work. They had to spend the entire budget on the appearance of "known" actors, because there was no budget for lighting. It looked like it was shot with a video camera, and most of the scenes were very dark. Does it really take up so much of the movie to show that someone is spinning and doing a basket, as opposed to cutting and editing a bullet that breaks through the basket? I'm trying not to be too critical about low-budget comedies, but if you want to see something funny, go to the real church basketball game instead of the movie.
