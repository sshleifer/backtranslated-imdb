Hoo, boy, it was a real attempt to get through. There's a Tom Hanks mug on the DVD box and that's the only reason someone will buy it. It looks like forty on a box, but the movie was made in 1982, so it still has its Bumich Pals and of course it's lighter by about forty pounds. The plot is about Dungeons and Dragons, like Hanks and his three friends, and Hanks thinks the whole thing is real. Chris Makepeace is the genius of a boy named Jay Jay, and the best thing about the movie is that he wears a lot of funny hats. Ooh, look, he's wearing a yellow tuxedo helmet! Now he is dressed like a pilot from World War I! It was a really awful movie, but in a bad way. The group of veterinarians appears mainly as children's parents. It's Anne (I'm Honey West, damn it!) Francis and Louise Sorel, who really look hot. Murray Hamilton, the mayor of Jaws, has the thankless role of a cop. Wendy Crewson, it's love for Hanks and some blonde I've never seen before. Here and there is some syrupy music and absolutely no tension, sense of danger or excitement. There's a monster that only Hanks can see because he, you know, nuts. Monster plays late, great Kevin Peter Hall, he from the fame of Predator. My friend took it out of the mall basket at MallWart and advised me to throw it in the basket without even looking at it, so naturally I had to check if it was so bad. It was. I watched Apollo 13 the night before, so this movie was a bit shocking. Do yourself a favor and leave it in the basket. Oh yes, after Hanks almost jumps from one of the World Trade Center towers because of his illusions, he returns home to regain his strength and is visited by his friends. Hanky's mother, drunk Vera Miles, says she's nice now, but when they go down to the lake to visit him in his tennis outfit, he's more crazy than ever. End
