Bela Lugosi plays a doctor who will do everything to make his wife look young and beautiful. To this end, he takes brides at wedding ceremonies to make them look dead, so that he can steal their bodies. I'm not quite sure what he's doing to the bodies. I do not remember ever being fully explained. All I know is that he takes something out of them and injects them to his wife. (I just guess it's spinal fluid.) Core fluid was the madness of crazy scientists in the 1940s.) You can guess the rest from here. <br /> <br /> There is a pair (well, really more than a couple, but I'm just writing about two) problems that I have with this movie. One of them is the method of using Bela. Sure, he's doing quite a decent job in his own, moving way (BTW, the rest of the cast is just terrible). But to hide him in a caravan or slip into the bedroom of a reporter to do nothing, it's just stupid. Also, why did he beat and / or kill every support he has? Is this supposed to make him look bad? Well, someone who kidnaps fiancés in a coma does not have to be forced to look bad. <br /> <br /> The second problem I have is the idea of ​​the drug of brides. Why brides? Would not a woman under 20 have done it? Watching Bela go through these turmoil to get his victims, I remembered the idiotic Fisherman in I Still Know What You Did Last. In any case, there seems to be an easier way to achieve the goal than using a seemingly impossible plan that depends largely on circumstances beyond your control. (BTW, the alternative title for this movie is The Case of the Missing Brides. I think it partly explains the need for a "bride").
