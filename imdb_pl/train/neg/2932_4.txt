Not that he cared, but I'm not one of Simon Pegg's friends. If I was, there is a good chance that we will drop out if it continues to make slag in this way. The problem is that Shawn of the Dead has a successful pattern as an inept, plain guy from the neighborhood, Run Fat Boy Run, etc., but he starts to dress. Here his character has no discernible features, is rude and unbearable, and thinks he is funny when he is honestly not. After moving to New York from London (and I suppose that this link is to appeal to viewers on both sides of the Atlantic), it turns out to be equally out of place with his new colleagues. Is it however strange that, among his merry Japanese girls, he hires a transvestite stripper to appear at an editorial meeting as an act of revenge for his boss. However, somehow Kirsten Dunst begins to warm up to him, even though he did not do anything nice. Oh, and because he's a superficial man, he falls on Megan Fox at first sight, perhaps because her character is as shallow as his. All this allows for predictable ending of the movie, although I do not see any viewer expressing how it reflected their lives. It is a pity that the paper is supposedly worth watching. Pegg plays, however, Kirsten Dunst seems to simply move, without creating chemistry on the screen, and Megan Fox is not stretched at all. A huge plus is Miriam Margolyes, as the owner of Pegg in New York - now, if she was longer on screen .....
