From the point of view of the plot and the movement, this movie was terrible. I discovered that I look at the clock in the theater, hoping that it will end and relief after 80 minutes, which he has mercifully done. Basically in the film there are five characters: Son and father, a friend of a son, and two male characters in the age of a son who appear and then disappear without any context or explanation. The film and the scenes seemed to suggest homo-eroticism, but nothing really revealed it in one way or another. There were some great scenes. At the beginning of the film, her son's friend appears in the window in front of his room and engages in a strange conversation. Photography and acting gave the incredible seduction of interaction between them, ending with the fact that she admitted to having another man who was "older". The end of this story.
