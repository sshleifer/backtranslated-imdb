American Pie has come a long way from the first. At the beginning, I think that the actors have no idea what they are doing, and instead it is just a remake of some school party. The story is presented as two boys from the first year of studies (with a young spirit), who present dreams of going to college to experience evening parties, sex and of course alcohol. The story is stupid and goes away from the original cake. In fact, once again, there is no apple pie in the film. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I work in a video store and I can rent it for free. But remember, it's a waste of time, unless you like brainless erotic movies with absolute nudity and crazy drinking. I am a teenager myself and I believe that even Evan the Almighty would be a better choice.
