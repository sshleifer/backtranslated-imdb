This was introduced to the DVD market by Alpha, and only for die-hard fans of Boris Karloff (like me). This is not a horror film, but a drama in which Boris is a difficult scientist who agrees to kill a rich woman's husband to get the fortune needed to continue working. But when a dying victim changes his will and leaves nothing to his spouse, hell breaks loose. <br /> <br /> It is nice enough to see Karloff as another egoistic ominous type, and some of the acting are involuntarily funny (especially with the leading lady Mona Goya, who is an absolutely laughing riot as a double-crossed wife). <br /> <br /> But be very careful.
