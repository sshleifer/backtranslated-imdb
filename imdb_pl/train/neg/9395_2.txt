This series is interesting as an MST3K function, but for today's audience it's all. I was really surprised to see the year in which 1952 was born. Considering that this fact alone makes it a solid (low?) 2 in my book. Used cars do not even look contemporary, they look like things from the 30's. It's basically Cody (salvation of the lonely world? Sheesh speaks of insult to everyone else, like the army), anyway Cody in her costume flying on the nipple against Graber and the two stupid mammal sergeant who grows pistols and the sporadic gun pretty bad, be happy. If you want to watch a really good series, see Flash Gordan, full of rockets that attack each other and good bad nemesis, as well as good-looking women, that's NO. And Flash was made 15 years before this shit, so you can give him some slack. Something that was done in 1952, so bad, deserves 2. Nuff said. give him 6, if you watch him as an episode of MST3K, these guys have fun with him; a pinch of nipples here, an improvement there, and I'm flying! And now, as an added bonus, I bring you the theme song of Commodore Cody, as originally sung by Joel and his two characters, bots Tom Servo and Crow aboard the love episode episode The Enemy Planet: <br /> <br /> (Singing at the beginning of the subtitles); <br /> <br /> (TOM SERVO SINGING) YOUR WATCH TIME DODODZONY CODY .... IS A NEW CHARACTER WITH THE REPUBLIC, <br /> <br /> EVERY WEEK FOR A WEEK ... BUT WAS SAVED BY EDYCJĘ, <br / > <br /> JUST TWEAK YOUR NINES ... EXPAND ITS HOSE, <br /> <br /> PUMP HEAD AND ROCKET PACKAGE. .. ZAPISUJE DZIEŃ, <br /> <br /> (JOEL SINGING) HIS LABRATORIUM IS A BOXING RING ... WHEN THE BAD GUESTS ARE COMING, <br /> <br /> EACH ALWAYS RECEIVES. .. I CODY MUSI ZWIĘKSZYĆ SIĘ, <br /> <br /> HE REPAIRS YOUR TEA IN CAFE CAFE ... AND COATS DOWN ON THE CABLE, <br /> <br /> HITS THE CROSS AND BOARDS WITH HOOKS .. I REMOVE FOREST LEATHERS <br /> <br /> (STOP YOU) <br /> <br /> THE BAD MEN ARE CARING ... THE BODY IS, <br /> <br /> YOU HOW HIS HAIR IS HER HIS HELMUT ... AND BECAUSE WE DO NOT THINK ABOUT GOOD RYM, <br /> <br /> IT IS TO END THE SOUND DAILY THEME ... SO SIT BACK WITH WOLA GRANITU, <br /> <br /> AND SEE CHAPTER 8, REALLY, THAT IS A PLANET ENEMY
