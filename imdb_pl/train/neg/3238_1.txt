Devil's Experiment: 1/10: Hardcore porn videos are divided into two categories that have a semblance of story (Gee is one happy pizza boy) and those without (Anal Amateurs 36). Devil's Experiment enters this last category. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a horror version of hardcore porn. Almost completely conspiracy less a 43-minute wait for money. Filmed on video in 1985, it consists of three relatively unspecified Japanese boys torturing quite unattractive Japanese. Torture ranges from trivial (patting her 50 times, kicking her a hundred), stupid (tying her to an office chair and spinning her around), fear factor (bath of worms and sheep's entrails) and finally money. (Well made eyeball piercing). <br /> <br /> That's all, no story, no motive, only Blair Witch Tree shots and torture. The girl looks bored and, except for the shout "nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition" during the scene on the office chair, I was bored stupid. Staring at the screen, he stared stupidly, waiting for the money. Like hardcore porn.
