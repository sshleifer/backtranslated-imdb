The main reasons why you should see "Red Eye" are Rachel McAdams, who provides a great performance, and Jayma Mays, who is a great Assistant to the hotel. On the other hand, Cillian Murphy is so worried about becoming cartoonish. The rest of the movie is steeped in feature holes on which I will develop. <br /> <br /> Do not read on if you do not want to know what's going on! <br /> <br /> Here is a summary of the story. Character Rachel McAdams (Lisa) manages a hotel where the new hard director of Homeland Security plans to stay that night. Rachel returns to Miami from the funeral, but calls the assistant until the plane leaves. In the meantime, someone is stationed in front of his father's house, Joe (played by Brian Cox), ready to kill him if Cillian Murphy (Jackson) calls. All that Lisa needs to do is call the hotel and move the director's apartment to the place where Jackson's cohorts plan to launch a guided missile (from a fishing boat) to kill the director and his family. <br /> <br /> Well, here are some of the role-playing holes or absurd coincidences: <br /> <br /> 1. Jackson finally convinces Lisa to call, and in the middle of the phone on the plane lose their connection. Lisa tries to fake that she's calling, but by chance the guy on the other side of the Jackson passage is also ringing and starts banging on the phone to signal that he's dead. Jackson catches and grabs the phone from Lisa. <br /> <br /> 2. At some point Jackson tumbles Lisa, and she obviously gets knocked out ... but only for 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> 3. Jackson catches Lisa by writing a note on the mirror in an (extremely large) toilet, and he hits her a little. Wonderfully, the only one who hears everything is an 11-year-old girl whose word, of course, is discounted. <br /> <br /> 4. Lisa stabs Jackson with a feather in the throat as the plane lands, steals his cell phone and goes crazy to the exit, adjusting to the passage between the seats and 18 rows of standing passengers. Despite the knowledge that there is a passenger with a pen in his throat, flight attendants oblige Lisa by opening the door to the jet. <br /> <br /> 5. OK, all of these are reasonable (if not very unlikely). But here is really stupid. Lisa gets into the terminal at the airport in Miami and there is no signal from the mobile phone (every major airport in America has a great reception of a mobile phone). <br /> <br /> 6. He runs through the airport with Jackson in pursuit, and no security officer delays them. <br /> <br /> 7. Jackson, who lost Lisa at the airport when the train from the gates drove to the terminal, lost some of the voice from the pen in his throat, but you can still understand it. However, he does not bother to call his man outside Joe's house. (PS: There is no train at the Miami airport, but the one they showed looked very much like the Orlando airport). <br /> <br /> 8. Lisa steals a car and drives away. Of course, this time, when he goes to the phone, the mobile phone says "low battery" and soon turns off (when will it stop using this hopeless feature device?). <br /> <br /> 9. When the phone still spoke "low battery", Lisa reached her assistant just in time to save the director and his family from a projectile directed by a fishing boat to the window of a room on the 40th floor, to which he was the director he moved. Of course, they expect that we will not notice that the hotel is surrounded on three sides by the ocean, so the missile could probably have been fired in the first apartment, thereby negating the need for the entire Lisy-Jackson action. What's the story? Was the original director's room on the 38th floor one of the few rooms in the hotel with a poor view? Nevertheless, all get off just before the projectile hits. <br /> <br /> 10. Lisa goes home to Joe, to save his father, to see the murderer outside. Although he knocks him over (as he shoots at her), smashing her Jeep into the house, no one in the area seems to notice or disturb. <br /> <br /> 11. Jackson comes to Joe's house and knocks him down (we do not see how ... maybe another butt of the head). Then he explains to Lisa that he has not killed my father yet, because he wanted Dad to see that Lisa is dying first (Give me a break.) What is this? Saturday's cartoon?). <br /> <br /> 12. For the rest of the movie (about 20 minutes) Jackson chases Lisa around the house and she deftly fights him. Of course, a real killer (ie One can be played by Jason Statham) would eliminate Lisa (or someone who is not a trained killer) in the first 30 seconds. During this chase, Jackson passes over Joe at least once, not caring about killing him. <br /> <br /> 13. Finally Jackson wins and is about to kill Lisa when (you guessed it) he was shot by Joe. <br /> <br /> So here's my suggestion ... tell Wes Craven to stay awake. Or maybe he should meet with Michael Bay (who directed the equally stupid "Island") and do "Red Island".
