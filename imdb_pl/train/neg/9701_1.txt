A really bad sequel. Part 1 had many funny moments - part 2 is just bad (in a boring way) and apparently it was created to squeeze money from the fans. <br /> <br /> Shame, Otto Waalkes! <br /> The only fun moment in the film is Helge Schneider, who apparently seems to be written about other characters. It is easy to identify with him ... <br /> <br /> The script is sloppy / non-existent. The director should do everyone a favor and immediately quit the job. Acting is worse than playing in a second-grade school. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, the movie is awful, but who can blame the operators / sound engineers who had to work with such a talented director?
