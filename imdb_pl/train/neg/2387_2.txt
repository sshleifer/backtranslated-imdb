I could not believe how bad and meaningless it was. Basically, there's nothing to laugh about in the movie, almost no scenes that will interest you in the rest of the movie. This movie attracted huge stars, but in my opinion they were all wasted. I think Keanu Reeves had to take some acting lessons a few years after this movie before he looked at the Matrix. Uma Thurman looked very simple and humble. Fortunately, I have this movie for a very low price, because it is certainly not a movie to remember for good reasons. I will not write anything about the history of the film, but how should you know, she is supposed to be the most famous hitchhiker in all of America because of her huge thumb. I would like to give this film 2/10. Before I watched this movie, I was wondering why this movie only has 4.0 / 10, and now I know why. A very disappointing movie. Do not buy it, even if you see it for less than $ 5.
