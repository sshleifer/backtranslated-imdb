I had high hopes for this movie because I loved the original so much. It seems, however, that Disney is trying to improve the art of nonsense DVD sequels. They deserve razza. In fact a few. I thought the idea was worth it, but the music was absolutely horrible, and the story was not much better. What happened to the great music that Disney had in his films. Mary Poppins, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King ... even Hercules and the Hunchback from Notre Dame. They've made so many great films over the years that it's really sad they've sunk into making sequels that are not even good enough to put them in cinemas. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie is not pointing to things that will happen at Walt Disney Corporation.
