In this movie, there was no characteristic and it really shows how much this talentless hack who managed it has to learn its craft. All his characters in this movie were so unbelievable and I did not care less. The best point in this film were the closing credits and an hour-long shower after this event. I felt so fucking dirty that I was wasting my money on this smelly load. Hey genius ... triads and yakuza are from two different places, learn about Asian culture. The scene with the dogs was so useless at this point. This DVD turns out to be useful. I love my new coaster. <br /> <br /> So instead, kids do not waste cash on this hostel.
