This film is about a family trying to reconcile with the death of their mother / wife, moving to Genoa in Italy. <br /> <br /> The plot of "Genova" sounds promising, but unfortunately it is empty and without focus. The film consists of a set of scenes depicting the everyday life of the family, such as swimming, piano lessons or cooking eggs. Most of these scenes are unnecessary and tiring, completely not involving the viewers emotionally. The ending is very disappointing because it is not spectacular, moving or emotional. I can honestly say that "Genova" disappoints me and bores me. The only good thing about the film is the sunny weather and beauty of Genoa. "Genova" can serve as an extensive tourist advertisement for the city, but not as a movie that you can enjoy.
