When I learned that it was a movie that included both my favorite actresses Meryl Streep and Wynon Ryder, I went through the roof, but I had a heavy fall after watching this lame movie and I still have a bruise. Jeremy Irons (an actor I admire even after this disappointment) was just awful. He treated his family like shit, especially his sister, played by Glenn Close. I could not get close to or sympathize with any of the characters, and I'm not prudish, but the sex scenes were really unnecessary or could be toned down. The characters of Wynona and Antonio could have been much more developed, and their romance could have been more passionate. And what about the character Meryl and her "mystical powers"? Why did not they go for it anymore? This movie had a lot of dead ends, and the most important thing is that it is a really bad movie and there was a lot of wasted talent here.
