I could not stand this whole movie. Do such families really exist somewhere? There were many comments describing this family as similar to LLBean and such, and I think it's a great description of how they behaved. <br /> <br /> More absurdly unbelievable writing / acting occurs when we meet a character called High School as "pigface", which, of course, has grown into a dead, great 20-year-old plastic surgeon with Harvard education (but only for that to do well in the world - not for money), and she puts Steve Carrel on the first date. Then I stopped watching ... <br /> <br /> If you can completely suspend your disbelief for two hours, you may like this sentimental, indulgent waste of time.
