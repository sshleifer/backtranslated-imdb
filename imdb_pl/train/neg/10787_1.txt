I will put it differently: balls. Or maybe bollo * ks. It is really terrible, more embarrassing than those who try to satire. Julia Roberts is a qualified actress and her work is usually at the highest level. This film is so devoid of direction that even she tries to look efficient. She is usually a seasoned professional, but I swear that there were signs of stupefaction and despair in her eyes. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could have saved this move was the idea of ​​the director (Chris Walken) transforming the film into a secret documentary about actors. Unfortunately, this topic has not been fully used. Not enough, too late. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones was wooden, Cusack was Cusack, and Crystal should stick. Two talented former Buffy stars had different experiences - green hopelessly planted, and Balfour insufficiently used. Well done to Julia for stopping it from being the worst movie ever made.
