I'm not going to criticize the movie. There is nothing to talk about. He has good animal action scenes that were probably quite surprising then. Clyde Beatty is not an idol of matin√©e. He is a bit small and not very handsome. But it's good. He is a man in this cage for lions. We know that when he can not break away from the lions to take care of his girlfriend, he will land with her on the island and he will have to save the day. Someone said earlier that this is a history lesson. Scenes in the circus are different, especially kids who are spinning. I did not realize that in the 1930s, they were sailing three masts of a schooner. It looked like something from 1860. I think it was the footage that they had. No wonder this thing was destroyed. They always talk about repairing her. There is even an airship. He tells us a bit about male relationships at the time, about giggling stupidity. But if you do not take it too seriously, you can have fun watching it.
