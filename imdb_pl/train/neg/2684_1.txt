I found a film offensive for Americans who lost someone in towers, generally for Americans. Pretending to be a tribute to terrible facts has happened in recent years, every director uses the opportunity to argue with old facts (which have nothing to do with a terrorist attack), or criticize American political behavior, or compare the other political situation they have in your own country that has nothing to do with the cruelty of September 11th. Shame.
