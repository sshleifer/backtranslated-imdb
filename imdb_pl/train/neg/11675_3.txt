Yes, I know that "talkies" was just invented for the cinema two years earlier, when it was produced in 1929, but this movie showed that much had to be learned about the art of film production. the actors melodramatically say their poems, roll their eyes, use too many pregnancy pauses and use gestures more appropriate to silent movies, which I suppose was normal during the process of teaching them to look more naturalistically on the screen. Gaps between the spoken lines should have been sharpened during assembly, because it slows down the movie significantly. Currently, he is only interested in lovers of the Titanic who want to see an early example of this maritime accident on film. In the next chronological order, they could see "Titanic" (1953) A Night to Remember (1958) "Titanic (1997) to see how the evolution of cinema presented this tragedy over the years. A lot of documentary and television films were made, including the terrible "SOS Titanic" (1979) on which the DVD is located, David McCallum introduces the introduction. It was he who played the younger wireless operator Harold Marconi in "A Night to Remember" (still the best feature film - read my comments "Tribute to Walter" about IMDb under Howard) Morley.demon.co.uk) and commented on the series 4 films entitled "End of a Dream", so he was well prepared to issue a narrative. I found more interest in the recording, which was accompanied by real photos from the 1912 Hearing of the US Senate, which is also on DVD. Actors speak real words spoken by second Lightoller officer, J Bruce Ismay, managing director of White Star, Harold Bride and others, including Gloria Stewart (The Old Rose in Titanic 1997), whose voice is used for one of the first-class survivors .
