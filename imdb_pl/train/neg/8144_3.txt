That's what I saw at the international film festival in Vancouver in 2006. The summary in the festival guide sounded pretty good, so we decided to check it out. I'm sorry to say, I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Besides being badly written, he was boring. I will not take the actors because they can do little about this bad script. <br /> <br /> The first bite was banal, not being ironic, over the utmost seriousness, without being funny. The film would have been better if Hunt Hoe had gone with a sense of horror. Instead, he took it seriously, which resulted in a boring movie. I can not recommend this movie. It was too long and generally just poor.
