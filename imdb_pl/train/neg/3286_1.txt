I do not understand why making modifications has become a trend. Every remake I've ever seen is terrible, and that's no exception. If any of you saw a quote from Ben Jones that this is a "bad" piece of rubbish, he's right. Why would they take a great TV show that I loved, they never left the episode and their own seasons 1-4 on DVD and will ruin it, I will never find out. The television program was a family show, and although Daisy has a body, it was really raised and even moved on the show, keeping the costumes. The family show has been changed to a dirty piece of rubbish and I do not recommend seeing it to anyone. Another thing that I did not like was that John Schneider and Tom Wopat are excellent actors (along with the rest of the original cast), and they are extremely sweet. New Bo and Luke are not even a bit sweet. It was one of the display drawers. The cast is terrible. They could at least get a brunette for Daisy. I do not think that Burt Reynolds would be a qualified boss Hogg. Any other role he has ever played is completely against this role. The only role they played half-decent was Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse, but he still has no comparison. Denver Pyle is his own actor, which makes him perfect for this role. I think the cast is horrible, the story is awful, and in total it ruined a great show and transformed it into a dirty, horrible movie. I do not recommend seeing it to anyone. I only saw it out of curiosity, plus there was a free DVD ticket for the season 4. I would never pay for watching this movie, but it was free. DO NOT PAY TO SEE THIS FILM.
