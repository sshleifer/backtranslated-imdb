As a "fallen Catholic" who was 11 years old in a Catholic school, but was not at Mass during 35 years, except for weddings and funerals, I thought I would leave. And I did. . . for the first two-thirds of the movie. It was all standard - strict teaching in parish schools, suppressed sexuality, etc. But suddenly the movie changed. Real meaning. Now remember, I saw it before the impact of pedophile scandals. . . and maybe I would not be so offended by such nasty, hateful copies in the Catholic Church if I knew about these abominations (such a Catholic term!) and covers. <br /> <br /> It has been several years since I borrowed the movie, and I will not be back to rent it again with a new perspective. He just left in his mouth a dirty, nasty, ugly taste. . . I wonder what experience all the actors had with the church, because they * really * hate it, or they fought for the payment themselves. It is an extremely anti-Catholic movie, offensive to anyone who has the glow of a flash of respect for Catholic education. What I still do, because there were no better teachers in the 1950s. Whatever the nuns did, they forced me to learn to read and write in English. They told us to remember. (How many children can perform simple arithmetic in their heads today?) The truth is that there is nothing more important for success in America. Can you read? Can you add / remove / multiply / divide? Great. You can get any advanced degree you want. And the discipline of Catholic education will be in a good position, not only as you continue your studies, but also for the rest of your life, no matter what you think about the Catholic "mythology" that we all had to learn. > <br /> Such a great cast, such a bad, broken scenario. I really feel bad (and no, it's not "bad" - trust me, nuns taught me better) for writer and director. <br /> <br /> I thought I had mixed emotions about the Catholic school. But the participants of this project had to be those bad (ie stupid) kids who sat at the back of the room if they were willingly involved in making this movie.
