This is a kind of movie in which everyone involved should be ashamed. Poor directing, above the best acting and conspiracy that makes no sense except to show violence. I thought that when I saw it for the first time, it could be a media satire and it shows violence, but it is not. I do not know what makes the movie worse. Oliver Stone is making his worst directing in history. From the scenes in which Woody Harrelson's face changes without a reason or a terrible performance by Robert Downey Jr. as Wayne Gale, who is a reporter who seems totally crazed, this movie is just a mess.
