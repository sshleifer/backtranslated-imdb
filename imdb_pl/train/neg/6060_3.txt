There is this girl and she runs in the woods, but she goes to the woman's clinic and wants an abortion. Her dad is out in the van and he's mad at it. The entire episode takes place in this abortion clinic and beyond. I'm not really a pro-choice, but I wanted to choose to kill this episode. I was laughing when I saw the child come out and enter the corner. The part in which they made ultra sound was also quite funny. I was really sorry about my poor father in this episode. He just wanted to protect his daughter, and I could not blame him for what he did. I do not know what happened to him at the end or what happened to the other father and daughter in the waiting room. I just laughed too much and suggested watching "Pick me up" instead of this episode. It was not the worst episode, but it was not that great.
