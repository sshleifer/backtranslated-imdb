I saw Arthur (TV series and books) years ago and I never liked the show (if you're a fan of this comic, I'm sorry I spoil you, but that's what I think). A lot of people liked it, but I did not. <br /> <br /> School characters seemed to fight all the time (especially Arther and DW), they were often nice to each other, but gradually Artur got bored with complaining about everyone and his sister DW (however the name was spelled), and DW was ADHD (or ADD) similar to Arthur's 4-year-old sister who sometimes demanded (which may be the reason why Arthur, irritated by what her routines looked like her imaginary friend and stuffed animal collection, etc., Arthur's friends behaved like teenagers, not like in Arthur's books, and parents, well, they did not care too much. <br /> <br /> The biggest cartoon was Modern Life Rocko, not Arthur (no offense).
