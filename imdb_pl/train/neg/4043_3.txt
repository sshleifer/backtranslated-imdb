The film begins with a promise, but it takes too long in the sepia of the world of distance and alienation. We remain suspended, but with no more we save slow shots of men and grave faces to enjoy. Certainly there is no rope on the wall to help us climb. It is a pity, because the concept is not without advantages. <br /> <br /> It remains to us to wonder why a loving couple - father and son no less - should be so detached from the real world that their own world is better when it is claustrophobic beyond all imagination. This loss of presence in the real world is rather too obvious and unnecessary in comparison with the son who enlisted in the armed forces. Why not a circus, so we can at least appreciate some color? We are left with a disturbing sense of loss, but unfortunately there is no enlightenment that is stunning, considering that the film apparently concerns some form of achievement that is not available to us all.
