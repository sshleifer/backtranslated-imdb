costumes, dialogue, historical accuracy are terrible. For example - Stacey Dash and the scene for hanging. The loop was accurate (as I could say), but this kind of loop broke the neck of the person. Mrs. Dash is suspended at the end of the rope without any ill effects until the rope is shot. This type did not strangle the person, he killed her at the end of the fall. <br /> <br /> And before they came in to rob the bank (in retrospect), they stop in the street for a group hug - with their bandana hiding faces - it would be obvious to people on the street. <br /> <br /> Poor edition - a battery pack under this shirt and it is obvious that the clip from "long ride" shows how they drive, and then turns the film over. <br /> <br /> I liked the fact that they were holding a stage with a talking horse - it seemed symbolic. The whole movie was nonsense.
