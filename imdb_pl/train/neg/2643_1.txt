It is because of the lack of a better term the film is poor. Gdzie zaczynam ...... <br /> <br /> Cinematography - This is probably the worst I have seen this year. It looked like the camera was being tossed from the camera onto a man from the camera. Maybe they only had one camera. It gives you the feeling of being a volleyball player. <br /> <br /> There are several scenes, accidentally, thrown in without continuity. When they made a "split screen", it was absurd. Everything was flattened, it looked ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The shades of color were far away. These people have to learn how to balance the camera. This "film" is badly made and badly made. <br /> <br /> Plot - You're kidding. If I was an SS agent, I would sue the producers. he looked like the Marx Brothers with radios and weapons. Sutherland was in "24" mode - I see it for free. Eva Longoria would be better with slightly less and much more shows. As a bimbo, the action was not great. <br /> <br /> I did not see a real conspiracy other than Douglas who woke up the president's wife. I never said why the mercenaries tried to kill pres. I just can not see the president of the United States escaping to life in utility tunnels, like a rat in a maze. p-l-e-s-a-e. <br /> <br /> Hollywood is dead. This film is proof. I like the "big screen". Ever since I was a kid. Many other "movies" in this style and resign. What's Hollywood, so many chick videos, how to forget how to make a real movie? If I was the owner of the theater, I will start to make old films. The one with real actors, a good story - and good cinematography. <br /> <br /> This "movie" is a dog. Do not waste time or money on it. I rate this film as zero! Douglas is not suitable for this role. I can look at his age, but his destiny is a lot to mollusks.
