Someone should tell Goldie Hawn that her career as a teenage gamina ended thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst films released for years, a clear disaster in which both guides indulge in a crazy exposure of their characteristic tics in order to catch up on the bad managerial scenario. This thing should have been depressed at birth. <br /> <br /> I hope John Cleese got a lot of pay for joining this catastrophe. He is the only performer who has gone through this smelly mess more or less unscathed, and his only drawback is the misunderstanding that the rest of the cast will sink the picture.
