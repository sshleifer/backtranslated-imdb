it's just ordinary Indian trash, which turned out to be a cinema, as Indians we can boast that we have the largest cinema industry, but also the worst. <br /> <br /> how other poor countries can have movies with real characters that undermine the views of their societies and just keep throwing away trash. look at Russia, Iran, China and Latin America, look at the great films they have and we'll get nonsense like Kisna !! <br /> <br /> Get real people, no wonder the international community laughs at Indian cinema in general.
