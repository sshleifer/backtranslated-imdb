This is the worst movie I've ever seen, but with all honesty it is watched and rather entertaining. I do not think the filmmakers want it to be your typical Hollywood hit. It's just a stupid movie about a serial killer who gets dumped with toxic waste, causing a reaction with him and snow (as it is in the middle of winter). Then turns into a snowman killer, which is enough to make you laugh yourself. This movie is really stupid, but funny. Murders are fun. I would not advise you to go and buy (as I did - the cover looked good!), But if it happens that one evening you will be on TV and laugh, stick it.
