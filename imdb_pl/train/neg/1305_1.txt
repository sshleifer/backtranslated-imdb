"Demons III: The Ogre" is not related to the pre-sequel on "The Demons", and "The Demons 2 is a cool hip-hop classic from 1980." Demons III: The Ogre "is a very stupid, bored, cheap monster . misleading is the writer "Demons III: The Ogre" (Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are poor writers and fools who bored the spirit of William Shakespeare or the demon egg from the spider's network or what Huhuhuhuhu make the girl's dream). very very boring movie I bought a special DVD box called "Demons" on 3 different movies called "Demons III: The Ogre", "The Other Hell" and "Black Demons" has no closed captions and subtitles costs $ 14.99 from the store Best Buy in City of Downey Why Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are a bad writer who makes this stupid movie almost like "Halloween III" does not have the monster of Michael Myer, but people wear Halloween. I'm very confused, I really love "The Demons" and "The Demons 2 is a better boring stupid" D emons III: The Ogre "is not part of" The Demons ", and" The Demons 2 "are the same demons. <br /> <br /> Thank you Juan Antonio De La Torre
