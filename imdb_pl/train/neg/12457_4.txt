It seems that Salvatores could not decide what to do with this film: some of them are very weak thriller (and I am talking very, very weak), some of them are an attempt to investigate the relationship between the main characters. Both have been tried in the psychological thriller, but in this case, the film can not accommodate things because of poor, superficial scenarios, bad acting and too dark, too boring photos. I would say that Salvatores did his best in different genres and environments, where he could freely look at heroes without having to think about the story. In general, film B, not worth the price ... Vote: 4/10
