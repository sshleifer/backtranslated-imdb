Oh, wow, this movie ever bites you! If you've ever been afraid to refresh the slasher genre, made as cheap as possible and simultaneously cautious (computer-friendly, means no nakedness, classic slasher element), Cut it just that. Each cliche is retreaded without a trace of self-awareness and action. Oh, acting is redefining horror. I should have known better, because direct translation of this title into Dutch would be a clue to me.
