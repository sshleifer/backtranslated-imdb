I tried to finish this movie three times, but it's awful. Example: mother and daughter come to bed and breakfast, mom stops for gas, crazy bizarre at the gas station raged at her hubby, whose running B & B tries to rape her. He escapes, goes to a B & B and instead of ballistic hubby, and she wants to call the police, the story simply continues the summer behavior on both sides. Wow. <br /> <br /> Other deficits of action logic abound. The operation is also summer, and the neighbor's warning in the neighboring door is issued in a really dingy, badly preserved moment. <br /> <br /> Moments of intense bloody death / unevenly intertwined with summer scenes of filling in time between characters. br /> <br /> Less concentration on the mountain, more focus on the mood and stories would be appreciated.
