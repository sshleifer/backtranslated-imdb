"Giant" is one of the most boring, too long Hollywood devices ever. Many scenes seem completely false and devoid of energy. Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean are wasted in this great production in Hollywood. The main idea of ​​this movie that a rancher would ever resist drilling for oil on his land is absurd and I know it because I'm from Houston. Several scenes, especially Dean serving Taylor coffee, make use of this boring movie. For a more accurate and interesting description of how modernism has changed the ranch in Texas, see "Hud" (one of Paul Newman's great performances) or "The Last Picture Show."
