After the promising first 25 minutes that make you feel warm inside, you are convinced that it will be a great romantic comedy. Then the movie changes for the worse. <br /> <br /> A warm feeling can still be present, but as others have said: The plot becomes so incredible and artificial that watching it is almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> The movie is accelerated, and you have the impression that you are quickly scrolling through it, or that the producers decided to adjust it in less than 1h40m and had to cut many scenes. <br /> <br /> Realism is not an end in itself, but as a spectator I am convinced that this comedy is not deliberately unrealistic, it just happens. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, this movie has a few nice interiors and despite the bad scenario, I think that the performances of the actors are mainly good. If I could only rate the first 25 minutes, I would probably give him eight. Like now, he gets four. ... And that's nice! <br /> <br /> If you're a sucker of romantic comedies, you'll have a great time anyway. If not, I advise you to look at something else.
