Man, that was fun. He should be under COMEDY. Or STUPID. She would realize what it was about to buy a stinky one. Seriously? I want someone connected to this movie to be connected, effective immediately. For anyone who thinks about watching this "movie", let's go to a few feature points. Wait. There are not any. There is literally no conspiracy. I think Casper Van Dien was bored and decided to film something with random people and a miracle, somehow he managed to record on a video tape. This movie is literally the worst movie of all time. Do not believe me? Go watch it. Do it, man. I dare you. But be ready to pick your eyes. If you can sit there without blowing a cow, you are very strong and brave.
