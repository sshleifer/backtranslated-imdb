I admire "Kissing on the Mouth" for his honesty? haircut and masturbation, especially from the main director / Joe Swanberg. They were not afraid to show the truth of everyday "private" events. Unfortunately, the film is located in the kingdom of "Brown Bunny", although with a slightly more developed plot of jealousy. Yes, it reflects the "Bunny" with a lot of nothing going on or too many cinematographies focused (or honestly out of focus) on absolutely nothing ?? feet, hands or genitals. Again, unfortunately, I can see why this movie was released and why people rent: real sex scenes and full nakedness (both male and female). Besides, it was a complete waste of time. We quickly learn about a pair of college and male roommates, in which a man has obvious feelings for a woman who sees him as a friend, while having sex with an ex-boyfriend. In addition, we submit to the everyday events of their boring life: work for parents; I'm working on a very uninteresting sexual awareness project on my computer. For everything to work, dialogue must be interesting and acting real. Not a job, nor as boring as watching someone drive for an hour, i.e. "Brown Rabbit". The only distinguished actor is Kate Winterich, and even she does some dubious acting. (The extra DVD with it in front of the microphone is really worth watching / listening.) I again admire the filmmakers, especially Swanberg, for exposing everything and not being afraid to reveal themselves or the shower habits, but overall the film falls flat. It has narrations that do not fit the scenes, too many boring everyday events and unconvincing acting that you are wondering, apart from the soft porn factor, why you hired it.
