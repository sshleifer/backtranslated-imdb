I wonder what is the purpose of creating such films? profit? and who is the intelligence that must use your brain to see something like this crap? This video is watched by children under the age of 3, if you are an adult, do not try to watch it. This is the reason why Hollywood began to use cartoons with movies like actors like you, you have to forget about the art of cinema, make sure you have plenty of pop corn to eat in time for this movie to end. this phone can easily be used in a restaurant, but certainly not in the theater, my dog, who is always next to my family while watching the movie, left the building. Surely this movie refers to people without what you can use in this movie, it's watching it while shopping at the supermarket. I give 2 stars for cinema support in India, but for nothing more or less ..
