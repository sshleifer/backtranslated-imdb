What exactly happened during World War II in New Zealand when American forces were there? <br /> <br /> This horrible story of 4 sisters was really pathetic. Can you imagine that you will throw Joan Fontaine on your older sister, Sandra Dee? Fontaine looked more like her mother. Even more fun was that Fontaine would get pregnant in the movie. <br /> <br /> Piper Laurie and Paul Newman, who showed such great screen chemistry 4 years later in "The Hustler", do not have scenes in this film. Laurie plays another sister who goes to Wellington to hang out, even though he is married. Woe to her when her husband returns from the war. <br /> <br /> Jean Simmons is widowed and finds an affair with a much-tamed Paul Newman. There's even an affair for young Miss Dee. <br /> <br /> The image has little meaning. Are they trying to say that everything is fair in love and war? If so, they did a poor job selling it. <br /> <br /> The conflict of interests with Newman and Simmons is quickly removed. This should be quickly done in this terribly disappointing 1957 film.
