It is difficult to describe this movie and I want to try not to reject it too soon, because you have the impression that it can be a perfect movie for a 12-year-old girl ... <br /> <br /> This movie has a nice concept - a modern version Sleeping Beauty with a surprise. He has some drowsy shots and some interesting sketches on the subject of a young boy's relationship with his single mother and school friend ... a nice beginning that can be said, but then he became a bit greedy, very greedy, he tries to be a science fiction, drama, thriller, possible romantic love story, fairy tale, comedy and everything under the sun. The result simply made the audience feel rather inadequate. For example, a scene in which a girl (played by Risa Goto) finally awakened by his (Yuki Kohara) kiss, instead of being romantic, tries to be frightening, then to make us laugh ... a cheap trick, because it ruins all predictions and emotions that she tried to build for the better half of the movie. <br /> <br /> I have not read the original story on which the movie is based (it is a well-known comic book artist Osamu Tezuka is famous for its intriguing and intricate stories) I wonder if all problems occur in the original story, or whether they appeared in adaptation? It is rather illogical even for someone who is accustomed to the "picky logic" of these Japanese comics. For example, how did the character of Yuki Kohara manage to get to the hospital in an instant (when is it going to be a long bus ride) to escape Risa Goto's characters in front of the television cameras after he saw her live television interview? <br /> <br /> There are also scenes that are directly copied (very uninteresting!) from other movies and all seem rather senselessly annoying, i.e. the famous "Lion's mouth has my hand" scene from the "Roman holiday" <br /> <br /> The movie tries to be everything, but it ends in nothing ... it's not a fairy tale and it did not have enough jokes to be a comedy ... and it's strange that there are some scenes that even seem unintentional movie about "ghosts", but it must be admitted that he managed to get some of the Japanese teenager's sentiment. <br /> <br /> It is watching this movie, I have the impression that there may be films that should bear a warning label with the words "this movie may be suitable only for people under 18", definitely would be on the poster of this movie . <br /> <br />
