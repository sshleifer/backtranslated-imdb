The only thing that often appears in my head when I write this review is that I will never get that hour and a half !!! to indicate that I am not just blowing air, I compare the movie to other trilogy cube videos (cube and hypercube)! the ankle was not great, but it was original and made up for some technical defects! as a sequel it lost the advantage of originality, but it turned out to be quite sharp, and I liked it more than the cube (the story was better)! but zero cubes compared to predecessors is really not worth sh * t! total lack of good fx, very f * ck * d up script and just old bad action does not connect well! example: all the time during the movie I thought it would be incredibly stupid if ... it should happen and then it will happen, so it's not too original! my advice: do not waste this hour and a half I lost !!!!!!!! oh and I hope this movie will break and burn !!!!!!!
