They screwed up this story! In the end, Nell is all heroic and requires the team to save all of their Hill House butt and a few nonsense! They added chopped heads, cutting faces of people, and the ceiling turned into a gigantic hand! What the hell is this about? I am the owner and I love the original film, I read a book and I love it! The reason the original movie and the book are so great is because it scares you so much without even showing your spirit. There is no blood. There is no hand on the ceiling. Just a spiritual ad about how ghosts can really kill a human being. They can not kill us, they can not throw us into the room or put a knife on the head. No. They can only drive us crazy. Taking all the senses of security. Nell was a selfish woman. She just wanted good things for herself. Yes, she cared little about others, but not too much. David Self and Jan de Bont took nonsense in this great story! I hate this damned remake!
