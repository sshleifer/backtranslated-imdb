As usual, I went to watch this movie for A.R.Rahman. Otherwise, the movie is not good. Rajni wanted to end his film career with this film if he was successful. But fortunately or unfortunately the movie was a failure. After that he released a hit from Chandramukhi. I am looking forward to his upcoming Shivaji. <br /> <br /> I have read the second user's commentary on Rajnia. I find this interesting because the user is also from TN. Rajni is one actor who, I think, works from his heart, not from his mind. He is not an actor like Kamal Hasan. I think we should appreciate Raj for his strong life in his age. <br /> <br /> In any case, I have to fill in 10 lines of this comment ... so I wish Rajnia good luck ...... .....
