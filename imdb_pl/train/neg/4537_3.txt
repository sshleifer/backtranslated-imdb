I did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw him in the camp and we did not rave about it, we laughed at it. Sure, some parts are touching, but the game is awful, the effects are horrible, and the whole general idea of ​​the movie is horrible (now I know it was based on a book I have not read, but I hope the book was better than this because I honestly thought that this movie was very bad and boring). Like I said, I went to him with a group of people from the camp, and we were excited to be there, and also got a caffeine drink, but I could not sleep anyway. The only thing that kept me back (except that I was afraid that I would be ashamed when I woke up) were shots that were also completely useless. I just really did not like it.
