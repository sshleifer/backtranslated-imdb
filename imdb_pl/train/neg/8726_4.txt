First of all, I want to say that this movie is worth more than the four stars I rated. I gave him four stars because for me this 86-minute movie always seems to be 2 and a half hours and is not addictive enough to sit it all. However, "The Big Alligator River" (the title that my DVD called) is better than the average nature that hits the movie. <br /> <br /> A tourist center in the jungles of Southeast Asia is opening and employing natives while trying to manipulate wild nature. Mother Nature, seeking revenge, has the form of god Kroona, a giant alligator. But the creature is not the only thing that tourists and main heroes need to worry about (photographer and resort staff), the natives are also rubbed in the wrong way. <br /> <br /> This movie is quite well made adventure / horror with good result and direction. But the alligator, the main attraction of the film, is of course false. Some jaws are good, but that's all we have to see. Some of the underwater deep shots make it painfully obvious that we are dealing with a squeaky alligator toy, which you can probably get in a souvenir shop at the zoo. But the natives are credible, if not authentic. <br /> <br /> This is probably not a movie that will provide you with constant emotions, if at all, but filmed and produced well enough that it can be well mentioned. And like many films about creatures, this one ends with an unusually high number of bodies. It also has a lot of good jungle scenery. However, the action is below the norm, but who expected it to be better? <br /> <br /> Much, much better than its newest American counterpart, "Primeival", but it can not be compared with "JAWS". But remember that it may not be in several points.
