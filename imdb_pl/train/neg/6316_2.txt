A film like Amazing Grace and Chuck is a great example of how the left in this country simply does not understand it. They never did. And liberalism is still plunged into political oblivion. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a small baseball league that decides to stop playing football in protest against the existence of nuclear weapons. It is understandable that the boy is ridiculed until his team is joined by a group of professional athletes, including the former NBA star Alex Alex. Not only a few of them join the case. Before his movement reaches the zenith, entire leagues of professional and university sport must cancel their seasons, because no one will play anymore. To move this review together, I am willing to admit this assumption. Even if it never happens in a million years, I imagine that maybe, and then there. <br /> <br /> I do not remember how, but some kind of agreement was reached and the boy decides to return to the game, which he loves in an incredibly juicy and absurd scene. <br /> <br /> Before I criticize the message of this film, I will only say that this movie is badly written, played and directed. Even if someone agrees with the boy's position, it would be impossible to overcome how poorly constructed the movie. It's a pity, because there are many good actors who are wasting themselves. (Peck, Curtis, Petersen). Alex English does as well as he could with his character, and I would like him to try to play more films. Unfortunately, it is probably easier to find a job in the world of NBA coaching. One would like the English gentleman to teach more of these typical NBAs today, how to shoot rocks a little better. Alex certainly knew how to put the ball in the hoop. <br /> <br /> When it comes to sending a movie, it's just wrong. Plain and simple. All of these nuclear warheads hidden in these missile silos in the west have WORNED WAR !!!! One thing for this boy and his pack would be to protest against the actual war or use of nuclear weapons. Such weapons were never used, and this was the genius of their existence. None of the parties during the Cold War was crazy enough to launch a single missile. Without these weapons, who knows what could have happened between the US and the USSR. <br /> <br /> The creators of this movie apparently wanted the children in America to take their case and follow Chuck. Children in America, however, are more intelligent than the left wing, which created this thrill. <br /> <br /> The movie is worth only 2 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a great movie about the dangers of nuclear war, stick to Dr. Strangelove. br /> <br /> Mr. Newell, you're not Frank Capra!
