Crater Lake Monster is certainly one of the scariest, amateur films I've ever seen - the Manos ranking, Hands of Fate in terms of poor performance, useless direction and production value at the kindergarten level. In this movie, a silly-looking animated dinosaur wakes up after hitting a meteor in a lake in Bumblebum, California and starts eating local hay. In an exciting climax, a being described by one of the locals as a "giant alligator with fins" pulls a heavy mass behind him to pursue his would-be lunch before the bulldozer hits him a few times and is bored of boredom. Every character in this moovie is a complete moron. One pointless subtle thread shows hicka and goes to a liquor store to buy a Ripple pint for $ 4.75; instead of just buying a bottle, the idiot shoots at the cashier, another observer, shoots the cop, chases the lake, all so that the monster can eat them. The unfortunate close-ups of the monster reveal that this is just a piece of Styrofoam. There is a fake magician fighting against a fake British accent (to make him look more legally), two excessively muddy boat mercenaries, a somewhat tacky "prehistoric cave art" made in a crayon and an annoying banjo mask. In one painful scene, the fake magician and his stupid wife / girlfriend / partner manage to shoot the movie for an additional 4 minutes, trying to find out how the stars can see in the night sky, even though apparently there is still a day. Even when you are constantly scrolling forward, this movie hurts and hurts badly. MooCow says that call the fumigators, because this cow really stinks! : = 8P
