This is a movie that had a lot to do. in the year of the premiere, the legendary film critic Barry Norman considered this to be the worst film of the year and I heard only bad things about him, especially the plot that was criticized for being too complicated <br /> <br /> To be honest the plot is something like red herring, and the film suffers even more when the word "plot" is used because, as far as I can see, there is no plot as such. There is something about Russian gangsters, a character named Pete Thompson, who is trying to bring his wife Sara to pregnancy, and an Irish guy named Sean. As they all fit into what is called "story", I'm not sure. It's difficult to explain Guy Ritchie's stories, but if you watch one of his films, I'm sure we can all agree that everyone has one, no matter how complicated they may seem at first watching. Similarly, the movie about James Bond, although the plot is stretched on the action scene. You will have a serious problem, because RANCID ALUMINUM has any type of central plot that can be explained in a clear way <br /> <br /> A look at the list of casts will ring as many warning tones as to the type of movie you will be watching. Sadie Frost has appeared in the worst British films of the last 15 years and does nothing to become inconsistent. Steven Berkoff gives the actor a bad name (and plays a character called Kant, which sums up the prank of the movie), while one of the characters supporting the game is probably a TV presenter, because no serious actress would be seen dead in that <br /> <br /> Only the good thing I can say about this movie is that it is completely forgotten. I saw it a few days ago and immediately after watching I was going to write a very long critical review, warning people what they let in, watching, but now I mainly forgot why. But that does not change the fact that I remember that I did not like that piece of shit immensely
