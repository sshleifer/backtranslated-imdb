It could have been quite an entertaining movie, but instead it falls into other misfits, such as Leeches and Pieces at the bottom of the cinematographic food chain. If they played this fast language, it would be a very entertaining movie, such as Re-Animator or Dead ALive, but Juan Piquor Simon plays it with a grain of salt, but more often straight. <br /> <br /> The premise of this movie is a small community that is besieged by mutated snails. Near the sewage line is an abandoned toxic waste dump, which causes mutations of snails into aggressive, meat-eating monsters - although the monsters move slowly and can be crushed under the shoe. Health inspector Michael Garfiled and two partners are the only people who seem ready to fight snails, while the sheriff and mayor think they are crazy. The highlight is laughter - unintentional - which makes you scratch your head, how stupid (actors and screenwriters) is the scenario of destroying snails. <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ (without a new terrain Simon looks like it's up, but the dialogue is simple: if Simon worked with a clever scenario - one with lots of one-liners and eccentric characters, he could be a cult movie). br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$ (You will not be disappointed here, we get a lot of exploding scenes of the chest cavity, as well as a huge explosion of the head inside a magnificent Italian restaurant. Blood and guts, many people who like to watch horror movies, are here in full progress. There were also corpses of people who were chosen for cleaning by snails and a lot of slug smashing scenes). <br /> <br /> ACTION: $ (Wow! Michael, Garfield knows that this scenario is smelly, and he gives his lines with a face expression that suggests he knows how ridiculous this movie e ndeavor is. Kim Terry, as his wife, does the right job, even though he does not do much except the "keep face" bit. "Teenagers" were terrible actors - no exceptions. Man, this movie could have used Bruce Dern or Jeffrey Combs! ) <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $$ (Two teenagers get naughty in bed before being sent - in a badly made scene - through a horde of snails that I've crawled into the girl's bedroom, here the male and female nudity).
