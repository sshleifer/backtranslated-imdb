Mann photographs the Alberta Rocky Mountains in a great way, and Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan give nice performances as always. <br /> <br /> But come to Hollywood - Mountie, who tells the inhabitants of Dawson City, Yukon, that they choose a marshal (Marshal!) and enforce the law themselves, and then the shooters fight on the streets for control of the city? <br /> <br /> Nothing even resembles what happened on the Canadian side of the border during the Klondike gold rush. It seems that Mr. Mann and his company confused Dawson City with Deadwood, the Canadian North with the American Wild West. <br /> <br /> The Canadian viewers were prepared for the joyful howl of this funny conspiracy or, shake their heads in disgust.
