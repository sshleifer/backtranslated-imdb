I was forced to watch this whole series of films as a small child and I was told that they are REAL! Talk about using children. I would be less terrified of Dracula or Frankenstein. This series is only good for people who believe in this ridiculousness and want to indoctrinate their children to believe in the same. In addition to the obvious problems associated with brainwashing and indoctrination, there are also bad acting, bad writing and BAD "special effects". They are just awful, horrible movies. Yes, reliable (and scary) for a kid, but I can not imagine an adult buyer in this shlock. Although I must say that I would be interested in them today as an adult. They can feel a certain movie about midnight / worship for them.
