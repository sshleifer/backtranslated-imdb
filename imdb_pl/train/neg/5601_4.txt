I just watched it because it was directed by Lucio Fulci and introduced by Claudio Cassinelli, an actor who I like. I was certainly disappointed. <br /> <br /> The idea that condemned prisoners would fight to death for TV ratings was exaggerated in Rollerball, Logan's Run, Blade Runner and the new movie Death Race, which will surely suck it in because it's stars Jason Statham. <br /> <br /> It was just boring mostly. The action "Kill the bike" was ridiculous. "Training" was a nap. He just never caught me and I did not want to take care of anyone, including the star of Dallas, Jared Martin or Fred Williamson. <br /> <br /> Choose one of the others, and you'll be better.
