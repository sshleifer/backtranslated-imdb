I love Don Knotts, let me say it in advance! He is a huge talent and the best at what he does, which presents a nervous, delightfully stunned loser thrown into the position of power. He is fantastic in this role as Roy Fleming, Reluctant Astronaut, but the movie is quite boring, really, although as a child, my brother and I were delighted to watch this and his other films. It's still worth watching, but it's really the movie that kids play best. I would classify him as 100% family friendly and something that you could sit down and watch with your children during your family night. <br /> <br /> As with all Knotts movies, there's a great cast of your beloved actors, and you can not help but smile when Knotts gives one of his trembling, open lips, no matter how old and you are tired. <br /> <br /> From an adult's perspective, I think it's one great thing in this movie is how it's given to NASA in the 1960s - all new modern buildings, hope, optimism, future! And I was surprised how gentle and study was Leslie Neilsen. The only complaint about this story is Roy's love interest, a rather worn, unlike woman who can not give him the time of day until he becomes a big shot - if you're like me, you'll hopefully give her a tip at the end . Watch out - you will whistle the theme melody for a few days after watching, it's catchy.
