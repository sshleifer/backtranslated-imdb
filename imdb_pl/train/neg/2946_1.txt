I must say that in my childhood I am very proud of the many films I have borrowed. The exception is Theodore Rex. Talk about the film of cheaters of all time in the life of every actor. Can you imagine what the fired agent Whoopie had to tell her to sign up for this shit? Hey, Whoop, you ever saw a dinosaur show, well, they're making a movie out of it and you'll see Germany! "After that, the agent often had to refer to Star Wars. <br /> <br /> This movie was so bad that I thought that Whoopie had to buy every copy of this movie and destroy it. I just wish she could do the same with my memory because my sister still gives me nonsense for watching this movie. I mean, I'll even admit that I watched Mr. Nanny and Kazzam in cinemas (good reasons why I gave up both Hulk Hogan and Shaqa for a while), but this one is in my memory as the worst childhood and the greatest regret from renting in my life, and that was 16 years ago. I am now 24 years old if you want to do math. <br /> <br /> Whenever I think about my list of the worst films of all time, I do not even mention it, because like a rapist, I try to suppress that it ever happened. Fuck yourself, Whoopie, be happy that people will only recognize Eddie and Sister Act 2 as the worst of luck.
