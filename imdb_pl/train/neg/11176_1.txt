I saw this movie in early preview and I can not stress enough how bad I thought it was. From the very beginning, the audience moaned over the terrible southern accent of Pacino. Poor Al looked really, very miserable, and I can not decide if it was a deliberate part of his role as a narcotics addict, or maybe he just did not sleep before coming to the set. However, much worse than close-ups, Pacino is a miserable excuse for the story. At the beginning of the movie we get tips that the character Pacino is gay and I suspect that it was originally intended by the screenwriter. Later, however, we should suspend our disbelief and believe that both Tea Leoni and Kim Basinger (both are idling through lame roles) covet this elderly, half-dead, effeminate man with a funny accent. The worst part was the main storyline that was related to some corporate espionage that is never fully understood and we never care about it in the slightest. Because it was a preview, I will reserve my final judgment because of the possibility of re-recording and editing, but you can bet I will not pay a penny to see it in cinemas.
