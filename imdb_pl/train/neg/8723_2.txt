A very bad movie. A very, very, very bad movie. It's a rarity, but definitely not worth hunting. This Italian detachment of the jaws does not make sense most of the time, and the rest does not make sense. "Alligator" is not convincing at all, and many threads do not matter. If it's in a local video store, you can watch it if you're a fan of monstrous movies, but it's not worth hunting.
