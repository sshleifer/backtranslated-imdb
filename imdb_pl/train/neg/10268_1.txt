No doubt this is one of the worst movies I've lost money for! The plot is, I'm sorry, I said there's a conspiracy? The most terrible moment was when ... I can not think of one! The best special effect that made me hide under the bed quilt was ... I can not think about it. You knew who the killer was from the very beginning. There was nothing terrifying in the whole movie, in fact the only two obscure passages were when you saw your sister, Misty, in the shower and when you saw Sister Toppan, who took off her top. This movie should be watched only to learn how to NOT create a horror movie !!!
