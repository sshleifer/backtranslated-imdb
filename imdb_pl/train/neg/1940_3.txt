journalists' journal and demanding zealous reckless press officer and sobbing grandmother were shrunken and clothed. <br /> <br /> I can not blame the actors, but I'm sure someone had to say, "You're kidding, I can not say it! "<br /> <br /> This episode had a press perspective and a police perspective, while the police perspective was standard enough, the press perspective and characteristics were exaggerated exaggerated and unbelievably unbelievable in points. <br /> <br /> I noticed that it was HBO production, if so, perhaps the stereotypes of the blacksmith's hammer can be explained in this light, <br /> <br /> I was completely embarrassed at the press conference scene. he lacked credibility and did not call in any way. 40 minutes to the first episode and I am still waiting for the tension. <br /> <br /> Skip five Daysthis. production 2008/9 with these characters is much better and more uncertain, even if the crime is at the top. <br /> <br /> This story has unforgivable moments that can only be described as stunningly unbelievable. <br /> <br /> That the press spokesman would start a press conference without the presence of an investigating officer who could ask press questions. <br /> <br /> so unbelievable that it felt like an amateur hour. <br /> <br /> Then I started looking for journalists called "Scoop" and for Perry White to come. <br /> <br /> I saw Hunter from 2009 before "five days" reached Australia, not realizing that it was a prequel and I was looking forward to Bonneville and McTeer again. <br /> <br /> Head shaking terribly.
