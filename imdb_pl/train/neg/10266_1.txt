1st watched 11/07/2004 - 1 in 10 (Dir-Jon Keeyes): Over-the-top rehash of alleged 70's horror movies like Friday the 13th (version 1 to whatever ??). I can not come up with a lot of redemption here, except (or can I come up with something?) The story revolves around a group of stupid people listening to a radio program a year after some children have been killed in the forest as a "tribute" supposedly to this. But here's one of the stupid people having links to the actual event because her sister was one of those who was murdered (again, how stupid is that she will even be part of this). Guess what? The murderer is on the spot again and from the beginning we are aware of who it is (so there is some secret). In addition to everything where there are "cops" and why nobody calls them. I can not believe that this movie was financed by someone and made. One would think that until now Americans would have been rated a bit higher, at least in their film experiences, but not so.
