I do not intend to approach and criticize the RAW theory. This is a page about movies and whether the film is delivered or is well made, and not the philosophy of debating on the site. <br /> <br /> Having said that, this movie really blows. This is one RAW shot after the other. Some of them are archival films, so you can see how he aged over the years, and it's pretty cool. But otherwise the impressions from watching are extremely monotonous. <br /> <br /> It's a strange comparison, but I was thinking about Sunday afternoon, when I watched some of Barbra Streisand's stars * Funny Lady * (another really bad movie). After some time I was in the Barbary Fellowship, I still wanted one scene to appear in which she would not show up: you know, and in the meantime other characters in the film were ready for something else ... in a moment. But it was about Barra. Well, this movie is * Funny Lady * RAW. <br /> <br /> So, if your idea for a good time is to look at the many angles and faces of the RAW face while he is rolling his theories, gathered in a lame structure that adds no interest or insight, then be my guest . For me, I could not do it after 20 minutes.
