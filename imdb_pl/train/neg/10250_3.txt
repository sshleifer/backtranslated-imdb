A boring, cheap sci-fi thriller, made with almost complete lack of conviction (a control room full of computers and other devices used to receive and decipher messages from space is carried only by ONE MAN and is very poorly guarded at night) and full of sound effects. Christopher Lee is not only wasted, but also gives one of his few shows "I'm only here for money." (* 1/2)
