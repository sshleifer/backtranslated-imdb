Director Sidney J. Furie created a postmodern masterpiece in Hollow Point, which challenges and constantly surprises the audience. <br /> <br /> Sidney J. Furie dares to ask what is happening with the tired traditional traditional paradigms of "plot" and "make-up" when the balls of "motivation" and "reason" are removed. <br /> <br /> The result prompts me to say that my opinion about him could not have been higher. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars. <br /> <br /> P.S. Nothing makes sense in this film, law enforcement officers are totally unacceptable and organized criminals are full.
