This is one of the worst things that ever came out of England, so it says a lot. The tension when we need to know if Lembach is staying is amazing. The upside is a meeting with a nice secretary, Sheila, in underwear with a picnic print, after being captured by Dr. Rat Face. This film also has several views of London, although none of them is good. There is also a point where a car accident occurs which causes the heart rate to return to a level below the norm. There is also a watch that is teleported, and the fear that the woman will not regain her watching, is parallel to the horror of the "Sixth sense" only much more boring and British. Add to this a furious battle between the British police and doctor Szczurek, who brings nothing, plus an electric shock to many people, as well as a cat and you yourself ... ummm ... British film. The MST3K version is quite good, though not one of the best.
