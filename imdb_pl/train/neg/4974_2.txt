Let the saints keep us because this movie will not help. <br /> <br /> Someone with access needs to email Mel Gibson and tell him we need a faithful Beowulf production. Something that has something to do with the epic poem that is the basis of modern Western literature. <br /> <br /> Recent (since 2000) Beowulf's versions make us think about two things. First of all, why are you so interested in this story? Second, why all these filmmakers are wasting money on this shit. <br /> <br /> The only reason they got two is that the version with Lambert (Beowulf 2000) was worse and needed 1. <br /> <br /> What's worse, some people will watch it and have a wrong view about the poem. How the industry in which Peter Jackson gets a literary conversion to a movie can be right. Really, the Roman Forum as a model for Heorot is too much. <br /> <br /> AND PLEASE, horns on helmets? Save me. It's offensive. <br /> <br /> / hjm
