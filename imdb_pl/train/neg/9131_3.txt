It's hard for me to believe that I watched it again last night after over 25 years ... <br /> <br /> Some time ago I watched 6 Fu films in a row ... Boris Karloff and all 5 Chris Lees. The last 2 Lees, both directed (and I use it loosely) by Jess Franco, were disgusting. At the time I omitted this one, remembering that in some respects it was EVEN. <br /> <br /> Well, I watched it. Never again. Do you know what's worse than the disgusting movie? A really GOOD piece of S ***. And that's what FIENDISH PLOT is. This is a VERY good movie. GREAT production project, sets, costumes, music, photography, editing, mainly a good cast, some decent action ... <br /> <br /> ... and absolutely, positively, one of the WORST SCRIPTES in the history of the film !! !!! AAAUGH !!!!! The first minute of the movie is so deceptive ... it can be confused with a decent movie. And then they start singing "Happy Birthday to Fu" ... and goes down. Burt Kwouk (about whom his master says: "Your face - he is familiar") accidentally poured the Fu's life elixir, to extinguish the fire, as a result of which he was sentenced to torture, funeral and cutting off one of the ears was the closest to the fun thing. It was as if someone decided that he wanted to make a "movie" movie - it would be funny. RIDICULOUS, this is ... FUNNY ... it's not. At all. <br /> <br /> It's sad because in the first few minutes it's clear that someone has done BIG research on the Fu Manchu series to get so much "okay". With another script - either really FUNNY or dead SERIOUS, they could have - they could - SHOULD have - have classic hands. A movie that could make you forget about the horror of these atrocities, Jess Franco ... instead of comparing them to masterpieces. <br /> <br /> There was a period in the late 1970s, when a whole bunch of classic characters from 30 years revived in films that were generally horrible. Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, Tarzan, The Lone Ranger, Charlie Chan, even Doc Savage. I'm not sure this one can be the worst of many. It took self-control not to scroll through all of it, especially scenes containing Sida Caesar (the head of the FBI who was also the cousin of Al Capone - you see what I mean?). It's not just that the ideas in the movie are not funny ... they often make it make no sense at all. For example, when they "interrogate" police officers to impersonate the king and the queen, and we end up seeing people "listening" dance routines, such as singing, dancing and riding a unicycle. How many drugs did the authors of this thing have to take to make sense for them? <br /> <br /> As I said, shame ... and a real waste of all this talent, including Peter Sellers (who played both Fu and Nayland Smith), Burt Kwouk (who was in the film Chris Lee Fu in his time ), Helen Mirren (policewoman who is shockingly in love with the villain and is damned close to stealing the last half hour of the movie!). I'm starting to wonder if someone NEVER does the "right" Fu Manchu movie, or will the fans have to settle for the fact that Karloff is almost ONLY one?
