I really want to make people really try to make it funny when making a comedy. It's a movie where you can sit, but nothing special about it. After watching this you will say that everything was fine. Watching was not boring, but the audience was not kidding to laugh. Entertainment should mean that you get something more than o.k. story. This movie wanted to be "Tootsie" but instead failed. <br /> <br /> I gave him 1 in 10.
