Herculis Puaro is a well-known "hero" whom we know well from books and films. This movie or this story does not work and I felt it was not Agatha's mistake. The cast is not good, the actors exaggerate and make stupid gestures, the costumes are so clean and tidy that everything (even Arabic clothes) looks fake, and for a serious viewer who thinks twice that this movie can be seen as a comedy of a mysterious drama . The actor playing Herculis Puaro does a good job, but nothing fantastic. The scenes are, as said earlier, perfect and look like false. This story is not too captivating, but a mystery of murder, but who cares about the death of a madwoman and a malicious blond 45+ in the Iraqi desert ?! "Victim" is not nice.
