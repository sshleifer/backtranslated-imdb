It was great to see some of my favorite stars from 30 years ago, including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They did not receive any characters or good lines to work. I did not understand or care about what characters do. <br /> <br /> Some of the smaller roles of women were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small auxiliary parts. They showed talent and it's sad that they did not play in better and better movies. Unfortunately, I did not think that Dorothy Stratten has a chance to play this one important role in the film. <br /> <br /> The film seems to have a few fans and I was very open when I started watching it. I am a huge fan of Peter Bogdanovich and I liked his last movie, "Cat's Meow" and all his early films, from "Targets" to "Nickleodeon". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to watch when watching this. <br /> <br /> It is ironic that this film is about a detective agency in which detectives and clients enter into romantic relationships with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's girlfriend Cybil Shepherd had a hit TV series "Moonlighting" stealing Bogdanovich's idea. Of course, there was a big difference in the fact that the series consisted of tons of witty dialogue, while trying to do it with a slapstick and a few screw lines. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: This is not a "Paper Moon" and only a very pale version of "What's Up, Doc".
