Spooks is a pleasant trash, containing well-directed sequences, funny threads and dialogue, and a third action act. <br /> <br /> Many described this in the British version of "24" and you can see the similarities. <br /> <br /> The American version shares weak stupid intrigues, but the execution is much milder, more sexy and I suspect, dear. <br /> <br /> Some describe the weak comedy as a "mild comedy". <br /> <br /> This is a delicate hour with a spy story, the exact opposite of anything created by John Le Carre. <br /> <br /> Give me Smiley every day.
