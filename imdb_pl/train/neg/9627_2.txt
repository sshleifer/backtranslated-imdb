Ok, I love Ben Stiller, although I'm indifferent to Jennifer Aniston. I do not think this girl could act in the slightest way. Any movie or sitcom in which I saw her is very difficult to overcome by her false acting. It looks like he just stands and reads the script. This movie had only one good thing, and that was what Ben Stiller was. This plot is so used and abused that it is ridiculous. How many movies have the same type of story? Can we say "The forces of nature?" The plot is not only old, but the result is so predictable, boring. I knew everything that was going to happen before it happened. It was boring, but watching Stiller is always a joy !!!
