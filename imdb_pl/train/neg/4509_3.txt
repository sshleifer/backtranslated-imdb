"Memoirs of a Geisha" is a visually stunning melodrama that seems more camp-like, a drag queen satire than anything to do with real people. <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie defensively insists that geishas are neither prostitutes nor concubines that embody traditional Japanese beauty. But apart from one breathtaking dance, the rest of the film turns into "Pretty Baby" in Storyville, or at least Vashti and Esther in Purim history, because all women's efforts for art and artificiality involve entertainment much, much older, drunk surly men . Maybe it is a Japanese culture that is prostituted, and not only for American fools after World War II. <br /> <br /> It may be the tension of speaking in English, but Ziyi Zhang shows little of the great flame she demonstrated in "House of Flying Daggers" and "Hero (Ying xiong)" . Michelle Yeoh from time to time displays the radius of his assured performance in "Crouching tiger, hidden dragon (Wo hu cang long)". Only Li Gong shows real life. Otherwise, I still imagined Charles Ludlama in different roles, and even Cillian Murphy, just like in the kabuki theater, especially since the cat plot was fought after fighting the cat. <br /> <br /> An alleged love story has zero chemistry, mainly due to age differences, and I was mostly sympathetic to Ken Watanabe and I hoped that his Hollywood pay would compensate him for the loss of his dignity as a mysterious "chairman". I remember more emotions in "Portrait of Jennie" because a young girl wants to grow up to Jennifer Jones to please Joseph Cotton. <br /> <br /> We see short flashes of reality when geishas pose with ordinary women as photos Ziyi Zhang experiences the war years in a very colorful kimono dying operation. The finale has a slight sense of normality. <br /> <br /> The score contains many traditional melodies, with Yo Yo Ma cello and Yitzhak Pearlman's violins instead of traditional instruments, which are beautiful to listen to accompanied by lovely cinematography, if someone completely ignores the plot and rigid acting. <br /> <br /> When my mind wandered, I wondered how the great Japanese samurai film directors would cope with this story, which probably would have been more formal, but much more emotional.
