There are only two films that I would give 1/10, this smelly and "Man who fell to the ground". I remember seeing the Protocol in the theater in the early 1980s when I was in high school. The script offends everyone's intelligence (including high school students). He completely lost me with the "hillarious" gag of someone who was shot in the ass. Goldie Hawn is supposed to be adorable, but she looks dainty and moronic. Then there are insulting stereotypes about the Arabs, and then Goldie, who wins with everyone, spurting populist drums. Acting was awful, including Goldie Hawn. I could not stand the next movie she was in until IMO redeemed herself in "Everyone tells me I love you." This is the movie you create if you do not want to put any effort into writing the script. The worst.
