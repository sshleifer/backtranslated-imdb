I'm not an artistically inclined person. I am a science-oriented woman and I felt that this film was perhaps one of those films about an artistic type of camp with a budget. I watched some of this with my fiance and my future daughter. We've tried to find something in this movie to keep our interest. My fianc√© and his daughter voted it and we went to Ocean's 13, but that's another story. Unable to resist, I woke up the next morning and gave the film another shot. I started watching the movie again seriously. I just do not understand, I thought I would get it. I thought that the funniest part was the redness of the ashes and urn that found a place by the fireplace as a vase for what looked like dead flowers. Interesting and still had dead things inside. It was a strange and bizarre movie. Maybe that's what they went for, but I will not be cheated a second time!
