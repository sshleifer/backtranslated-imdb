I have read some good reviews on this board for "Mr. Scarface ", but for every uninitiated Italian gangster movie like me, the picture probably will not make much sense. Indeed, after initial setup involving a scam worth 10 million lire, the picture turned into a rather routine flutter of revenge with a slight turn in the identity of Rick's character (Al Clivera). The whole gang war theme was muddy to me by including Vinchenzo Napoli (Vittorio Caprioli), but like most other viewers he commented, he is the only one who gave this picture a life with his often ineffective attempts at violence. I thought it unbelievable that Manzari's thugs who were chasing Tony on the streets did not jump out before Tony even put a hand on them. Jack Palance throughout his career as the title character was wasted pretty unceremoniously in the antimilactic finale, which meant that the American working title "Mr. Scarface" was rather debatable. I've seen enough Western spaghetti to know that not everyone is working; I suppose in this case my first look at the film of spaghetti gangster did not bring results.
