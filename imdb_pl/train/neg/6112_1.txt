I was thirteen when I saw this movie. I expected a lot of shares. Ever since Escape From New York was classified in Germany at the age of 16, I entered the movie as a fallback. It was so boring. Then I realized that it was only nonsense when my husband put out his wife. That is, today you do it online and you pay for instant access. It's over 20 years ago, but I'm still angry that I'm wasting my time on this movie. This is soft-porn for students. Undressing Bo Derek and painting it with color - nice. But then they should name the movie Bo undressing and painting her.
