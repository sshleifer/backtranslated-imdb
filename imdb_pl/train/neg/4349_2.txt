This movie is horrible. Carlitos Way (1993) is a great movie. Goodgfellas is not one of the best crime movies. This movie should be considered closer to THE STING Part2 or maybe Speed ​​Zone. Remember these jewels! The only reason this movie was made was to use the cult following the original. This film lacked everything De Palma, Pacino and Penn were working on. There was no sympathetic character and it was the fault of all those responsible for its performance. I hope that RISE TO POWER will win every RAZZIE, and maybe even come up with several new categories to be a record holder. After watching the movie S @ * FEST, I sat down and watched the original Carlitos way to remove the bad taste from the mouth. After seeing this, I wish Pachanga came and dumped me from my misery.
