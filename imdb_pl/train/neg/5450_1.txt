Such a pretentious and poor attempt to hypnotize. A diabolical scenario and dialogue as well as truly embarrassing acting. Truly the worst movie I've ever seen (in the cinema). Nothing in my opinion saves this movie from total disaster. I saw it when it came out at the Brighton cinema. People were leaving, and more people talked to the toilets than in the toilet! At the end there were beats and contempt from the humble crowd, which was quite sad because the relatives of one of the main actors were present and looked really embarrassed. However, the film was so bad that I really did not feel sympathetic with them. Everyone has to start with something and their son started his acting career with this really terrible attempt "Tarantinism made in the UK". Five years have passed, but sometimes I still get tired of the memory of this sad night in movies! This is a movie without any redemption opportunities! I gave him 1 because 0 was not available. They should come up with a "shameometer" for everyone involved in this pathetic movie mess. I know that some of them have gone to better things, the positive is that none of them could fall lower.
