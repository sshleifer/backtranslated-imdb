I had to change my view of the worst movie in the world that just saw this movie. THIS IS IT! <br /> <br /> Make no mistake, this movie is horrible. <br /> <br /> Here's a list of reasons: <br /> <br /> A hopeless plot (even though it's based on a real story). Horrible acting (judge Reinhold). Incredibly bad acrobatics. A childlike dialogue. Non-existent continuity. No atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Take a picture? <br /> <br />
