... but it just does not work and I'm surprised how many people think it's good. On what basis? Here and there are a few loose tips, but the whole material is self-sufficient and unconvincing. Lynch's films are generally intriguing because they generate a sense of confusion, and yet they are very funny. There is a certain visual sense, there are some partial threads, characters, ideas, etc. But it is boring and so, aimless. Because everything that is to be investigated is either "small" or too far-fetched, or simply said in a better way earlier. It's just Lynch researching DV, nothing more, so it should be treated that way. 1/10
