As an ordinary listener of The Rolling Stones, I thought it might be interesting. Not so, because this movie is very "his own age" in the 1960s. For me (someone born in the '80s) it just looks like hip-hop purist propaganda shit, but I'm sure this movie was not made for me, but people who were active in the 1960s. I was expecting drugs with these Stones, I was disappointed, he showed real life, hard work in the studio, so much so that I felt like I was working with them to come to the conclusion of this horrible movie. I have not seen any of the directors of other films, but I suspect that they follow a similar director's style, as if "amatuerish", which gave a feeling like on the Eurotrash television program, badly directed, hit together and deprived of real entertainment. My only good opinion on this subject is that I did not waste money on it, it was free with the Sunday newspaper.
