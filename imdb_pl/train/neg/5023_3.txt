Nobody, but no one, could chew the scenery, such as Divine One, Ruth Elizabeth Davis and "Elizabeth and Essex" is a great example. Although she sometimes overpowers this role, watch her when she looks at Raliegh, writing lyrics for the song her waiting ladies are waiting for her: in this one moment she makes us realize how Elizabeth was able to rule and rule absolutely! Another time it is done by the success of the script. When Elizabeth must be vulnerable, she descends as weak and clever. This has the additional effect of undermining its authority: when it blows its stack and threatens to impose justice, it is difficult to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> Flynn exudes charm, making us see how Essex managed to get his heart out in Elizabeth's heart, but he is completely inept in transmitting the complexity and pure evil of this man. Nor does it help that Essex is badly insured. Why is he that passionate who wants to overthrow his Queen - even if he swears to her faithfulness - except that he is more bluish and therefore more "worthy" of power? And why is Raliegh cheating on Elizabeth, intercepting her and Essex's letters? There is no risk of falling out of grace and we know where Essex is heading (and his head). So why is it risking its own head, speeding up the inevitable? <br /> <br /> What did Curtiz do with all the money he received? He does not even try to hide the fact that his battle scenes are shot on the sound stage. He should have finished with El≈ºbieta for the first time alone in the Tower; everything else that follows (especially the last scene between her and Essex) is unnecessary. The costumes are fantastic. And is it me, does Bette look exactly like Susan Sarandon?
