I have seen other Guinea Pig films, such as Mermaid in Manhole and He Never Dies, and although they are quite sick, they have at least some sense of humor (however dark). Devil's Experiment is nothing like filming a group of punks who give a young girl many methods of torture and violence, and there is no plot or any redemption value. This is not frightening, except perhaps the way of thinking, but it is definitely disgusting and I certainly would not call it entertainment. Now I'm not a model of good taste in movies and I like my garbage and madness, but that was too much for me. I am for anxiety, in fact I am looking for things that are disturbing whenever possible, but that was a bit too much. The young woman is kicked, whipped, subjected to constant noises by means of headphones, until she drools, and then thrown over with raw meat and viscera and left somewhere in a hammock in the forest. If you think it sounds great, go for it, but it will definitely deter me from seeing other guinea pigs. 1 in 10, absolutely nauseous.
