There is so much wrong in this film, but to sum up: Terrible acting - so bad that it had to be deliberate. weak scenario - they could have some good ideas, but it was not the best way to present the story. absurdly bad ending - in some cases the ending manages to save the movie - not in this case. if you manage to go through the whole movie, you'll want to finish off at the end because the ending is not even worth waiting for. This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. It was a complete torture sitting in this movie, I would be grateful that someone would anticipate me in advance. So do yourself a favor. Watch this video only when you have absolutely nothing better to do. Even then you will regret that you have surrendered to unspeakable torture.
