I have absolutely no knowledge of the author Phillip Pearce or any of her novels, and if TOM`S MIDNIGHT GARDEN is typical of her work, probably as a child I would not be interested in her books. When I was a child, I was not interested in literature, unless I had soldiers fighting with monsters, with a lot of body <br /> <br /> Judging by this movie version of TOM'S MIDNIGHT GARDEN, I think Pearce writes for lower children with middle class, because most of the story tells the story of the protagonist Tom Long, who moves to a house without a garden, and then suddenly finds a metaphysical. Having your own garden was undoubtedly something that the working class did not have in the fifties, so I think there is a political subtext somewhere. There is also an affair with a young girl named Hattie, but are cynical children surrounded by love stories? Perhaps the worst criticism is that there are very few emotions or adventures happening in the narrative. <br /> <br /> This is a children's film that seems to come from its source. He is harmless, but I am surprised by his high rating by IMDB voters. I wonder how many of them would give him such a high score if they were 10-year-olds who just saw the trilogy THE PEOPLE OF THE RING?
