Twist ends can be really cool in the movie. This is especially interesting when the turn of the action is right in front of our eyes, but we simply do not pay attention to it. These types of torsional endings are those that make people think. Then we have twists and turns like this movie. He turns that regardless of whether or not you pay attention, you have no idea what will happen. When they reveal this kind of accidental twist instead of shock, it's a bit of a stunned reaction. This movie begins as if it was to be interesting in relation to horror, but after about 20 minutes is nothing but a boring dialogue and stupid phrase. get lost traveling in the forest and hit the tree trunk. They ended up in some old, frightening house of a lady who hates men, and their home daughter Marion (Laurel Munson) greets them. Strange events take place when these girls stay in the house for a few days, instead of trying to go out or go home, and the tension goes into a stupid slass. and it's always from a few characters. We have three main girls, a terrible lady and an old lady, and the conversation about any important role does not go beyond these five. What's worse, they never have anything interesting to say. In fact, it is quite crazy sitting during conversations. We want to know what's going on, and instead just talk, talk and talk (nothing). <br /> <br /> There are numerous holes here. The house where these girls are in a car accident is most likely three miles from anywhere ... wow, three miles! Two hours or less will kill them. Why did not they go with the employee of this household who was going to the city? Did he have one sitting? Why do not these girls ever ask about leaving and they just like to stay, rarely even checking themselves? Why did it have to have so many stupid twists and turns? Maybe the answers are in a boring scenario. <br /> <br /> Having a movie with five characters is a really bad idea. It is not exciting, it is not scary, and the ending is definitely there, but undoubtedly stupid. <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 from ****. 79 minutes. R for nudity and violence.
