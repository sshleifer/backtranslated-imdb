Wow, in the end, after a few tries, I managed to finish watching this horrible god movie, just to find out that Rick Sloane and his production team have finished this year's sequel straight to the movie. <br /> <br /> With all movies reviewed by MST3K - and really dig with the bottom of the barrel, showing the reputation of evil "Manos", "Werewolves", "Unbelievably Strange", and the smaller ones know disasters such as "Laserblast", "Zombie Nightmare '' and 'Time Chasers' - this must certainly be the absolute largest pile of trash they have ever shown (which makes it perfect for riffing). Very simple, the film tells about a group of Munchies gremlins in the wild, using human desires of fame, fortune, fortitude and, of course, sex in a way that ends up killing people. But this is a kind of movie in which acting is so funny (for example, the machismo test is illustrated by two guys who fight in the yard using garden tools), the letter is so forced (such as the often described gremlin scene hanging on the shoulder of one girl, which she noticed, if only she turned her head a quarter to the left ... and this is not the first time in the film where it happens), and the story is so ... rarely noticed (hence the riff MST3K on the subject of "law in the future in which films must be created by FILMmakers "), which is really the root for furry dolls killing everyone on the screen. The worst movie ... ever.
