... they took the trouble to make this movie? Someone? I did not think so. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a movie about puberty, go and rent Summer of '42. This is not Summer of '42. <br /> <br /> When your big stars are Nolte and Sarsgaard, and Sarsgaard gets more time on the screen, this is your first warning sign And of course for such an "artistic" movie, there are a lot of curses and skins, just for that that they look "artistically". <br /> <br /> Sarsgaard made his usual, uninteresting, cardboard character, interrupted by moments that were to be intense. Intensity is like someone with a bipolar disorder. <br /> <br /> Miller is best known for her appearance and what she said about the city of Pittsburgh after this movie. Pittsburgh SHOULD have a grudge against her. She turned the actual Pittsburgh pedigree. <br /> <br /> Foster gave Sarsgaard a run for his money in the style of cardboard. Wow! Was this his first role after graduating from high school? <br /> <br /> So we have this strange triangle. Foster is in love with Miller, but he is with his boss / girlfriend. He can not take Miller to bed and take his boss to bed. So he binds to Sarsgaard & Miller and looks at how they do it. <br /> <br /> Then, after one of Sarsgaard's pseudo-intense moments, Foster & Miller do it, a scene that we "treat" in every careless, groaning detail. Finally, to sum it all up, Foster and Sarsgaard use it with Foster as Miller. Now I know how 2 guys do it (as if it was something that I needed to know). <br /> <br /> After all, there is only the tragic ending of one character and the retrospective remaining views 2. It makes me go straight down my stomach. Wait! It was the pepperoni pizza I just had. <br /> <br /> I would like to go back to the time when this movie took my life.
