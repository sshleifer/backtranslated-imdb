A nifty romanticization of the sexual exploitation of New Orleans black women by white men power and privileges. Ooh. Does this sharpen your appetite? Well, up to the VHS or DVD, and eat this unreasonable trolling through the seasons of history. For good, it was adapted from the book of the famous hack Anne Anne. The direction is as capricious and melodramatic as a bad dialogue. Most of the acting is amateurish. The only noteworthy production is that it employed almost a dozen black actors, almost all of whom were not employed in today's market (Jasmine Guy, Ben Vereen, Pam Grier, Eartha Kitt), including some faces that were barely visible (Bianca Lawson, Rachel Cuttrell). This is also, in itself, a great showcase for Nicole Lyn. Pompous and lumbery James Earl Jones is also at hand. That is, the late Ossie Davis, the minimal talent that owes its success to the legendary company Negro Ensemble Company. This film should be rated "T" for tripe.
