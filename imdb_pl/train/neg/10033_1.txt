I was very unhappy with this movement. Everything was terrible from the very beginning. The comedy was inhuman, exaggerated action, songs spotless. Even the plot was not important. I had high expectations from a writer who wrote successful scripts such as Guru and Dhoom. The actors worked too hard and did not help the movie at all. Of course, Kareena rocked the screen in a bikini, but for two seconds. I think that Hindu stunt guards should investigate how action movies are made. They overdo it too often. In Chinese movies, this style works because it is their signature. But the signature of Hindi cinema is a song. A good action movie should last no longer than two hours and can not look unrealistic. But in the future, I'm sure that these action movies will be much tougher. It should also be noted: comedy and action movies do not mix if they are not properly made. Good luck next time.
