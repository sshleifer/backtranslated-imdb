"Mad Dog Time" ... "Trigger Happy" whatever you want to call ... just does not hit the target. Maybe it's just me, maybe I just do not like Gangster comedy (as I thought Oscar, Johney Dangerously and Mafia are sucking too). It's probably more "witty sharp word" than all comedies, just not as witty and sharp as this (or other reviewers. <br /> <br /> Rick, Mick, Vic Thing were old, starting with the fact that it was a running gag. <br /> <br /> There were not enough changes in the location or feeling in the period, Most of the movie was either in "Dreyfus's Club" or in different offices / dark rooms ... (what was it like to sit down with Gun to withdraw from what Goldblum won?) <br /> <br /> The supporting staff was ... excellent on paper (great to see Silva and Drago), but the characters were killed before they had time to grow, and Richard Pryors was a joke! Element Romance and Love also got stuck in it. <br /> <br /> 4/10 I do not think I will come back to him in my nearest future time.
