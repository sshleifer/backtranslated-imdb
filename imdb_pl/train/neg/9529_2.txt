This iconic movie from 1977 has two crazy lesbians (Sandra Locke and Colleen Camp) appearing in the home of a rich socialist, Dr. George Manning (Seymour Cassel), in the hope of helping to locate a residence that they do not seem to find. But these two have different plans when they find out that George's wife is out of town, take control of the residence, bind George, kill the supplier, and at the same time destroy this place in one evening. A bizarre and disturbing movie, but both get the prize in the same bizarre way that the movie ends. Most of them will not like it immediately or they will fall into this ridiculous movie after about 30 minutes. Either way, some even consider it a classic classic. <br /> <br /> Larry Dodson
