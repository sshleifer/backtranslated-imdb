Why was there so many people at the San Francisco Film Festival at the evening show "Up Against Them All" by Roberto Moreira ("Contra Todos")? "It's about a killer," said my friend. "Well ... and this is Brazilian," I added. Beautiful multi-colored people, tropical weather, lush rhythms and a hipster plot? Big incentives no doubt. <br /> <br /> Someone forgot to tell us one small detail: this is a very bad movie, really horrible and unpleasant to watch, because it's badly done. <br /> <br /> So how on earth has "Contra Todos" made a round in Berlin, Melbourne, London, Manila, Stockholm, Cairo, Chicago, many smaller local festivals, and now in San Francisco? Apparently because of the way the promotional process and the perimeter of the film festival are working. <br /> <br /> First of all, he won the first prize at the Rio Film Festival, where he was named the best Brazilian film of the year. It must have been a bad year; they had much, much better. Then, concise summaries in catalogs plus imagined noise lead to crowded auditoriums and - because the film is nowhere described, and thus strict analysis is avoided by the critics - it continues the rounds. <br /> <br /> The blur of the festival aimed at promotion sometimes I lose a lot. One of the festivals in Chicago was called "Contra Todos", "speedball cocktail straight from Brazil" and referred to Claudia's boyfriend as a "slum-like stud". Soninha is "a nymph-like teenage daughter, Teodoro, about growing sexuality." The film is "filmed with the urgency of a camera often held in hand", and the director "develops an authentic and tangible sense of frustration resulting from home desperation and decay". The effect is "unbearable harsh and honest", and the film moves "towards a conclusion that fails as life on display". This is not the best magazine, but it certainly excites the emotions of a potential viewer. <br /> <br /> "Contra Todos" refers to a man who is hit, actually two men, as well as a wife and daughter, and a newly born Christian girl. This shot - in an ugly, digital movie with no talent for working with a camera - mostly in barren poor suburbs, not in one of the bustling "favela" or Brazilian rural style slums where such great films as "Black Orpheus", "Pixote "and" City of God "have been made, not this time in Rio, but São Paulo. <br /> <br /> The stricken man with family problems is Teodoro (Giulio Lopez) and his partner with the drug problem is Waldomiro (Ailtan Both actors have little television experience, like an actress who plays sloppy blonde Teodoro, Cláuda (Leon Cavalli) and Silvia Lorenço, who plays his pouting, son-reunited Soninha, who can get through the back corners of several telenovelas Who knows? - they can be good in a better film, except for those young men who have been defeated by Teordoro or, when busy, gang gangs The directors do not work very often, although the camera enlarges their pores. <br /> <br /> Several observers, one at the Berlin festival and one in London, saw the disadvantages of this film, but unfortunately again buried in the back of the network. Henry Sheehan noted in Berlin that the "film" (his quotes) was "the worst of video works". "It seems that the filmmaker chose the film, because it was a cheap alternative to the film," wrote Sheehan, "and he did not creatively use the new medium" - nor, he adds, he did nothing else creative. /> <br /> Sheehan drew attention to the first big mistake of the film: "it starts as a home drama, which should increase when half an hour after the action Moreira reveals that the father and one of his friends are professional hits men. The expectation of thirty minutes adds nothing to the film, it seems a completely arbitrary decision and is at least a waste of time. But what Moreira does is like a small child who got a set of tools for his birthday and we go around pounding everything in sight without the rhyme, mind and skill. "Destructive, but real. <br /> <br /> Writing about the festival in London for kamer.com in 2004, Metin Alsanjak tried to look at the positive side, but nevertheless revealed the lack of redemptive functions in the easy naming of the performances with "the movie" The best feature. "Yes, very much easily, considering that everything else is so bad. "Alsanjak admitted that" this low-budget, violent and obscure description of lawlessness in Sao Paulo is devoid of all sympathetic characters and, as a result, of hope. "Too dark and cynical to be a telling proof of human condition, the film does not help poor subtitles .. "Alsanjak combined Contra Todos with" Dogme "and Mike Leigh did not help. <br /> <br /> Beyond this pointless first half hour, in which nothing redeems the boredom of our expectation of the first acts of violence - which, when they come, simply "blow everything in sight without rhyme, reason and skill" - Moreira clumsily tries to redeem his sudden finale, adding what What seems to be a release at the same time followed by an unlikely ironic summary scene in which one of the characters is getting married. Undoubtedly, the director wanted to show the "banality of evil" of low-placed people in the workers' quarters, but he can not make characters that he sees in general come to life for us. And the structure of the film shows that he also can not edit his material. <br /> <br /> (Seen at the San Francisco International Film Festival on April 28, 2005)
