Robert Taylor definitely showed that he is a great dramatic actor, playing the role of a buffalo hunter in 1956. It was one of the few moments in which Taylor would play a heavy movie. Nevertheless, this picture was far from splendor, because soon after Taylor escaped to television with a successful series The Detectives. <br /> <br /> Stuart Granger hid his British accent and turned out to be a powerful performance as Taylor's partner. <br /> <br /> Taylor is bigot here, and his hatred for Indians really shows. <br /> <br /> Another very good performance was veteran Lloyd Nolan as a senior, drinking old woman who also joined the buffalo hunt. In his early scenes, Nolan really did a great job with Walter Huston in the Oscar-winning role in Skarbrad's Sierre in 1948. Note the appearance of Russ Tamblyn in the film. The following year, Tamblyn and Nolan will join the phenomenal Peyton Place. <br /> <br /> Writing in the movie is rigid at best. After the film ended, it was the elements of nature that made Taylor in the middle. And what about the elements of writing here?
