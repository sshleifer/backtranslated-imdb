I had a few problems with the movie: <br /> <br /> (1) Scenario - specifically, the voice of Kim Basinger: Movies are not books; they should * show * the action, instead of having a voice * tell * us what is happening. Sometimes I find a movie with a voice that works, but here it seemed a more lazy way of writing a script. In fact, it sounded to me as if she were practically reading fragments of the novel in her voice. <br /> <br /> (2) I did not feel any emotion in the relationship between Jessie and Brother Thomas, and I felt that Alex Gra Carter was very angry. This is a significant defeat for me in defining the characters Jessie and Thomas - without a relationship between them it seemed to me that she just wanted to have a stud, and for him it was a matter of being sexless. If it was properly done, the relations between them would give much more context to the story. <br /> <br /> (3) With the book, I understood the midlife crisis of Jessie. In the film, it seemed more like boredom. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, I did not think the movie was as bad as switching off the TV. . . though this thought occurred to me.
