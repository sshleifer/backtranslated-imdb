I was delighted to see this movie because of this story and my desire to watch the horror. <br /> <br /> To my disappointment, it has become more comedy than horror. Acting, dialogue and film flow were very poorly made. Much of it did not make sense. For example, there is an event consisting of about 30 people and everyone is terrified that one person is in a secret place and everyone is a healthy looking young adult, and the guy threatening them sounds miserable. I kept thinking, maybe it was a parody of another movie, such as The Scary Movie, but they were trying too hard to make it look gruesome - an emphasis on the rehearsal. <br /> <br /> Blood and gore are also poorly made. I've seen Halloween costumes that look more believable than this. The guy with his head cut ... he looked clean - there were no signs of bone, body, blood or even head. A strong blow down the ax on the body should be in something ... it seemed that the guy waved his stick instead of the ax. <br /> <br /> Revealing who the main villain was supposed to be a turn, but denied other parts of the story. What was going on in the guy's mind to get this way? If there was to be a turn of events, you should at least add some mystery and tension.
