Too many things borrowed in class B- <br /> <br /> Sunday Super Bowl is one of the slowest days in cinemas each year. For this reason, film studios avoid spending movies with larger budgets this weekend. Every few years, the studio releases a controversial women's film (The Wedding Planner from 2001) to compete with the great game. This weekend in the Super Bowl, like the "Wedding Date", will try to find success and attract viewers who do not watch the game. <br /> <br /> Sick, lonely woman Kat Ellis (Debra Messing, TV series "Will and Grace") employs Nick's male escort (Dermot Mulrony, "About Schmidt") to pose as her boyfriend at her wedding sisters in London. Her family is struggling to get married, and her ex-fiance, seven years old, who threw her for no reason, is the best man. To make him jealous, Kat parades around Nick to convince him of what he's missing. But ultimately, Nick helps Kat realize that he can open up and let someone love her. <br /> <br /> The movie borrows too much from similar wedding videos. This is almost a copy of "Picture Perfect" from 1999 and mixes in scenes similar to "Wedding Planner" and "My Best Friends Wedding". The film also has the reverse motif of "Pretty Women" and, knowing the audience, the director makes clever references to this and other films. <br /> <br /> "Wedding date" has all the stereotypical elements of a typical wedding movie, there is a stereotypical bossy mother (Holland Taylor, "Legally Blonde") and practically plagiarized wedding speeches of family and friends at the wedding and trial dinner. The return at the end was made earlier, but it was something that was not expected. The real reason why Kat was abandoned is a surprise and changes the direction of the movie for the last half hour. <br /> <br /> Although "Date of the wedding" is predictable, she can stand alone. Debra Messing, in her first major role, proves that she can be adorable and funny. Dermot Mulrony has great chemistry with Debra Messing, but most of his conversations were too banal and unrealistic. He can make the best use of what is given to him and be able to save a character. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the use of many clever puns (often sexual), the movie is really funny. Although the film is primarily a movie with chickens, it has elements that everyone can enjoy. Good story and humor make it the best movie with long times.
