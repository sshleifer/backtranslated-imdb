It's one of the most boring movies I've ever seen, its horrible. Christopher Lee is good, but there is nothing in it, the only part is the opening scene. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the title. "End of the World" is really a bad movie, I stopped watching it to the end, it was so bad, just for hard-working film fans who have a brain to withstand vomiting.
