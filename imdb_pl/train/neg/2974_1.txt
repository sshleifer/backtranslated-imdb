I am a nice guy and I like to think of myself as a tolerant species. I think that I try to consider a movie in the context of the genre in which it is located. If nothing else, it saves me the feeling that I should really say terrible things about people and movies that I do not like to do. <br /> <br /> The plot in this one was clearly obvious, the production values ​​very low and sets, uhm, simplified. Acting changed from time to time in the 'good for high school' territory. I felt that it was shot in one day - please tell me it was. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that sex, although quite rich, was quite mundane, difficult, at least in my copy, "sound" that was incompatible with the action (climatic groans and screams lying on the bed unbuttoning the bra? ??). There was definitely no "advantage" - nothing distinctive or interesting, and surprisingly quick cuts. <br /> <br /> My voice is then "1", with the following summary: it would be better if the material to remove the filler in the club has been extended, and the rest of the film is condensed.
