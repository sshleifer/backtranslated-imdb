As a madman who is particularly interested in this special historical event, I was very disappointed with the film. Of course, the costumes and the staging were quite authentic, but the Hollywood presentation of this "little British big horn" was really boring. <br /> <br /> The amount of footage devoted to marching or parading soldiers had to be unprecedented in the history of the film. I've always heard triumphant music in the background, I knew I had to prepare myself for the next arduous scene of a meaningless filler. Of course, the producers invested heavily in "staging" and were determined to gain value. <br /> <br /> Despite the outstanding cast, their dialogue was boring again and their characters were never developed. Each time Peter O'toole or Burt Lancaster finished the stage, I was ashamed. Their poems were so weak and irrelevant that it was hard to believe that they were the same two great actors who played the role of Lawrence of Arabia and Bird Man of Alcatraz. <br /> <br /> There are worse epos, but this one is not much better.
