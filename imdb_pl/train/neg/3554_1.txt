I hired it in the 80's and I honestly can not remember anything specific in this movie - it's just the worst movie I've ever seen. This is not one of those "it was so bad, it was fun". It's not one of those "it was so bloody that it leaves you with a bad feeling." It was not even one of those "what the hell was it?" Cinema. I do not remember the performance of the actors, but it was poorly filmed, the story was chaotic and did not have a specific style. When it ended, I was angry that I lost time. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of movies that I did not understand because of unknown cultures, styles and / or stories, but it was clear that these movies have some of these properties. Incubus has none. <br /> <br /> I was actually considering NOT commenting on this "song" for fear that someone can watch it out of curiosity, but I am forced to warn anyone who appreciates the film to skip this movie.
