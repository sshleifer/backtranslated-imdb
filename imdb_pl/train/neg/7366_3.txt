What did F * @ # watch? Steven STOP !! Please! This movie is insatiable and stupid. In a weird departure from action and adventure, Mr. Seagal is now fighting (of course) with vampire "similar" creatures that have a super human strength. WELL? Oh, and their eyes blink sideways in an inhuman way? Wow! However, even in this film, to suppress Seagal's "have-to-last-hit-and-not-can-dig-mine-$$ ego, HE is somehow stronger than them. However, all average people are crushed around him. Come on, I understand a great neighborhood rebel or drug dealer, but these are people of superhuman strength. Oh, I understand, Seagal goes through a short history of identity problems, because apparently he and his cohorts in the movie think he's Wolverine! Oh My GO ... And what's the worst! Yes, it's worse. He has a voice over even a changing voice in the middle of a sentence when we look at his face. Of course, they do not sound like him and I believe that it can be one of the other actors in the movie. It was pure madness. Although I wanted to turn it off, I always watch the movie on which it ends. It's still low, even for your movies directly to Steven movies. Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! Two thumbs down! Features of redemission? Well, I think I will be honest in this aspect. At least some of the special effects were fine and I like the choice of clothing for actors and actresses. All the women were quite attractive IMO. Still, and I told STILL, it does not make up for the blatant X-Men, Underworld, (put in your favorite zombie, vampire movie here) rip off! Director, screenwriter, producer, ALL should be banned and banished from the film industry. I think I feel like most people think about Blood Rayne (and almost all other Uwe Bolla pictures) about this movie. That's all my $ 1.00 on this movie. See if you dare.
