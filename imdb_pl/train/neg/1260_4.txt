Yes, CHUNKY, it's a pseudonym that the romantic advantage of Donna Reeds, played by Tom Drake, means her! So let me understand it right away. From her first role in THE GET-AWAY (1941), her last, DALLAS (1984-1985), Mrs. Reed NEVER could not be described as CHUNKY. Not this attractive and slim actress. Whose roles in M.G.M. he rarely met her talents. <br /> <br /> Ms. Reed is supported by a cast of competent actors who, unfortunately, have to go through this alleged comedy of the "helical ball". Clearly M.G.M. he was out of reach of this movie. The type is better produced in COLUMBIA, PARAMOUNT, RKO and even UNIVERSAL. Neither the "touch" of Ernst Lubitsch nor the prank of Preston Sturges saved this film. A rather conventional romantic comedy that had all the hallmarks of the pre-war effort (WWII). <br /> <br /> If Irving Thalberg was still alive, the game would be on the screen or he would have made a significant transformation, or he never saw it in daylight. It suited the "safe zone" of Louis B. Mayer, not requiring family entertainment. Form that could not cope with the post-war challenges of the DeHavilland decision, lose their theatrical networks, television and contribute to the collapse of M.G.M. Fortunately for Donna Reed, her best days are ahead of her culmination in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY (1953) and her Oscar win in the category of Best Supporting Actress.
