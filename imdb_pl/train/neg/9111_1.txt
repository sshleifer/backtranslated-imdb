Cruel intentions 2 are terrible, I mean feeling unwell. Words can not explain how bad it is, but I will leave it alone. <br /> <br /> The storyline of Cruel Intentions 2 is very similar to the first movie. Sebastian (Robin Dunne) is expelled from private school and is forced to move to New York. There he decides to start again and just live normally and settle down. Unfortunately, he has to deal with his half-sister Kathryn (Amy Adams), who wants to download him. Sebastain falls in love with Danielle (Sarah Thompson), the innocent daughter of the headmaster. Kathryn wants Sebastian to just sleep with the whole school, which has been described as "home whore". Kathryn also wants to take revenge on Cherie (Keri Lynn Pratt), who humiliated her during the school gathering. Kathryn wanted the first grader to be in the biggest whore at school, a similar sub-story for the first movie. <br /> <br /> Cruel Intentions 2 is basically a canceled television program that has been transformed into a prequel. There are so many problems with the movie. It is badly written, indecent and malfunctioning. Fortunately for Amy Adams, the show never took off because now it is quite a big actress. While Cruel Intentions had a sense of realism and could be seen in the real world, Cruel Intentions 2 is embedded in the land of sitcoms and as described on amazon.co.uk "crazy version of Saved by the Bell". In the first movie, there were a few dark topics related to sex and drug use, but in Cruel Intentions 2 they tried to make it fun, and some ideas in the movie should not be like Kathryn having an affair with the teacher. Other ideas also do not work, like a secret society in which all popular children meet to discuss the fall of other students. The film also showed a serious problem of sexual 15/16-year-olds. I know that teenagers have sex, sometimes a lot, but when they do it in film or television, they are treated very seriously. One of the known senses was that Daneille encourages Cherie (who is around 14/15 in the movie) to simulate sex on the horse's back to the point where she has an orgasm. The idea of ​​transforming a girl around 14/15 into a slut is very bad for me and should not be the subject of a comedy. The jokes in the movie are falling regardless of whether it's a verbal gag, like "it's all wet when it sees you", a visual gag in which Sebastian pushes Kathryn's face first into the mud. <br /> <br /> There's a lot wrong in this movie that I do not have time to, but I say it should be avoided. Just watch Cruel Intentions, although it's not a classic, it's still a decent movie and it's a good idea. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a wet pervert's dream, with many children at school.
