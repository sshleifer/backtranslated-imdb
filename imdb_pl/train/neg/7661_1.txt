The title of an inferior movie of all times is one that is quickly and often published. Most of the time, it's an exaggeration, but I'd like to welcome Alone in the Dark to the short list of real candidates: Plan 9 with Outer Space, Battlefield Earth and Adventures of Pluto Nash. <br /> <br /> When I watched the 90-minute boredom, it was hard even not to fall asleep, even when I tried to laugh at the movie so much. But sadly I felt lonely in the dark (I was going to avoid the pun, but I could not resist) as I looked around hoping to see Mike Nelson and his two robotic friends. Unfortunately, my friends and I had to provide a comedy throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> So ... about the movie itself. Let's talk about the action and the effects, because it should be the only positive part of the movie. The film contains bad creatures that are a cross between Xenos in Aliens (they even call them Xenos), and creatures from Black Pitch. The can can be randomly invisible (and I assure you it is accidental) and is wounded by light. There are also small centipedes used to control people who turn them into something resembling a zombie. All are shown with obsolete special effects that would be average in 1997. Action scenes are chaotic and impossible to follow. People shooting randomly on the stage with a blue screen or an empty set of monsters who were put in a post. The light flashes quickly on the dark screen, making students burn with overwork while bad rock music is reflected in the background. <br /> <br /> And these were the most important points. The story revolves around an investigator of the paranormal (Slater), whose idea of ​​looking hard is wearing a shirt with a black wife with a jacket and no shaving for 2 days. Archaeologist (Reid), who is rather inept. And a government agent (Dorff) whose lines relate to the order of barking. All three should be ashamed of their performances (not that they really did a good job) and the casting director should be ashamed. I suppose Reid and Slater are lovers in the movie. The film contains the most awkward love scene I've ever seen in a movie between them. <br /> <br /> Then comes the conspiracy. Honestly, the parts that make sense are not at all interesting. The rest is illogical at best. Holes in the story can contain the collective ego of all three stars. The film begins with a text and voice explaining the story. This opening lasts over a minute and the viewer already knows that he is waiting for something terrible. This opening narrative is later repeated adnaus in an uncomfortable dialogue in a very clumsy and hard-spoken way for the rest of the movie. And the ending did not make sense. Not only did it make no sense in the film world, but it just did not make sense. <br /> <br /> Finally, the direction of one Uwe Bolla. Disgrace, that's all you can say. Its use is shaking the camera to simulate the voltage. His lack of direction with the actors. Just watch Reid in scenes where she is not in the center of the picture. Complete waste of money for special effects on the effects of time. Finally, I decided to use my voice to explain something that should be painfully obvious to viewers. <br /> <br /> I paid $ 1.50 to see this program in the second theater. And while the laughter of me and my friends assured me that it would be worth every quarter to advise people to avoid paying more for this film. Catch about 3 friends and share the rental costs and play this movie for a new one. <br /> <br /> Shame on Uwe Boll. Shame on Tara Reid. Shame on Christian Slater. Shame on Stephen Dorff. I'm ashamed of anyone who was associated with this movie.
