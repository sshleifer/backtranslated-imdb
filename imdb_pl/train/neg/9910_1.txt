One of the worst movies ever. It's not funny, bad TV cinematography, bad acting. It is sad to see so many famous old actors barely able to walk, let alone acting. The main woman Nancy Young can not act. A terrible direction. Sub-par with bad TV movies. Bad jokes occasionally appear. Even the basic premise of the film does not make sense. Somehow they have to refrain from the wedding, but there is no logic behind their actions. The slow pace made my wife stop watching, but I suffered. Old people should behave as if they were young and horny, but it is pathetic, not fun. How did they get the money to do it?
