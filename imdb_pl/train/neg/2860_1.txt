This movie only has 1 because you can not give zero! if you have a weak stomach, do not watch at all. animal rights people you do not want to see. it makes people vegetarians swear that I was a witness! the only cool parts is the case and the fact that it's a real story. it's really really scary that this guy was working at ADT while he was killing people! you still feel safe when you hit this little code? I do not! He had access to every code in Kansas !!!!!! I hated this movie, it was not scary, it was mentally scary! Do yourself a favor and do not rent / buy this movie. It seems to me that it costs about USD 20, INCLUDES YOUR FOLLOWING PAID actors !!!!
