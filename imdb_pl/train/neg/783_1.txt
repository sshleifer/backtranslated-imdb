I watched this program and I just did not think it was funny. This could have been the first episode. Recently, I realize that ABC is playing many stupid shows today and falling as a station. All characters in this concert are very bad actors, but even if they were good, jokes and scenario are horrible and they still fail. I would say that I believe that this concert will be canceled, but seeing how ABC is doing terribly because of the quality of the programs that they play, they can simply keep this program only because it is mediocre compared to them.
