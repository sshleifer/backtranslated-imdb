I LOVED the Student for the first two seasons. <br /> <br /> But now in season 5? (is it 6?) Things just get too tiring. <br /> <br /> I used to like the show once, but it became his own Donald Trumps' ego festival. He admitted that his company will work for you, but give it a rest! some things say "You're FIRED" is simply offensive. <br /> <br /> after watching the show I would not like to work for him. not because it is arrogant, pompous or such. It's just that the performance is unrealistic, and the way it deals with things makes me just turn. Good entertainment? YES, but tiring, because the piercing back becomes so tiring ... it's not teamwork, not personal, just business. Look at the rear seat.
