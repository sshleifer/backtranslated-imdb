This series of anime starts great: an interesting story, exciting events, interesting characters, beautifully made and made. Not everything is explained right away, hanging in front of the proverbial carrot, encouraging the viewer to watch each episode. But imagine the disappointment that a science fiction thriller / giant robot is just a background for psycho-mumbling and quasi-religious exploitation. If you want to hear, "You're ok. It's good to be you. " after sieging the negative slogans and negative emotions of the characters, this is for you. If you want to watch a science fiction movie that's just fun, forget about it. Both the original and alternative endings were grossly disappointing for me. All this, and this movie was too informative.
