Actions, violence, sex and rough language are things that the characters do during the entire movie. Everything they do is done for a reason. Mark L. Lester is (not) known for his brutal (no reason) movies (Commando, The Base). This story is strange, but stupid. Actors play their stupid characters very well ... I do not say they are stupid, but I mean they are very bad actors. This is another low-budget unknown B series action movie. If you've seen something like Delta Force, Drive, The Patriot, Sanctuary or something like bad movies of the same type as Misbegotten ... do not rent ... movies I mentioned. ... I give it 1 and half of 5.
