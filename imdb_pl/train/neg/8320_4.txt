After watching Awake, I came to the conclusion: the director and screenwriter Joby Harold did an Awake with the intention of laughter from the viewer, because the simple film is full of absurd elements. absurd and absurd elements (for example hospital uniform, which is used by the main character's ghost ... or the doctor's spirit left him on the floor?) The concept of this movie is a bit brilliant, but all the role-playing holes and absurd things make this movie stupid and bad . With the exception of the great Lena Olin, all actors bring bad performances. Hayden Christensen has zero words and the same applies to Jessica Alba. role.Awake makes the viewer laugh. It's so funny and full of absurd things that can not be taken seriously. My recommendation: skip this shitty movie.
