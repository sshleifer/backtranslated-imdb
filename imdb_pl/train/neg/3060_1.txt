It must be the scariest, most twisted holiday movie I ever clap, and it says something. I know that the people of Mexico have strange ideas about religion, combining the ancient Aztec beliefs with traditional Christian theology. But their Day of the Dead is not half as frightening as their look at Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> So ... Santa is not a happy, fat alcoholic in red (look at those pink cheeks sometimes!). Rather, he is a thin sociopathic pedophile living in Heaven (or Heaven, whatever), with a group of children who work harder than the one in Kathy Lee Gifford's sweatshops. They sing such charming traditional songs of their homelands, wearing stereotypical costumes that I was surprised that there is not a small African-American boy in the black face singing "Mamma". This Santa Claus is a perverse Tom who watches and listens to everything that everyone does with their "eye in the sky". This is because he can say who is naughty or nice (with emphasis on those who are rude, I will bet). <br /> <br /> There is no Mrs. Santa, no elves (why do he need elves when he has children's work?), and reindeers are mechanical wind-up toys! This hovering strange display floats on the cloud, probably supported by a silver lining. <br /> <br /> Nemesis of Saint Nicholas is ... devil ?! What is it, Holy God, our Lord and Savior? Weird. In any case, Satan sends one of his minions, a purring, prancing devil named Pitch, to try to spoil Christmas. Let me understand this - the forces of the purest evil are trying to destroy completely commercial and greedy holidays? It seems something unnecessary, right? <br /> <br /> The pitch is completely ineffective. He tries to persuade some children to be bad, but he is unlucky. I was struck by the story of the holy little girl Lupe, who is very poor. All she wants is a doll for Christmas, but her parents can not afford to buy it (they have spent all their money on the cardboard box they built the house from). So Pitch tries to encourage her to steal a doll. In fact, this is the only way a girl who is poor can get a doll because being a saint and praying to God and Saint Nicholas does not really work. But Lupe is opposed to temptation and tells Pitch to take you with him, so he is rewarded with receiving a doll so horrible that you know it's Chucky's sister. <br /> <br /> On the way, Pitch manages to get Nicholas stuck in a tree (uh-huh) from where he was saved by Merlin! Merlin? You're kidding! Since when mythical druidic characters appear in Christmas tales or have something to do with the Christian religion? Does God not approve of magic? They would have burned Merlin on the stake a few hundred years ago, not asking him to come to the rescue of one of God's Aspects (or, I suppose, Santa must be to fight against Satan). This movie is one long HUH? from start to finish and make you wonder if this eggnog you were drinking was not barbed or anything like that. Probably it was because this movie is like one long giant DT.
