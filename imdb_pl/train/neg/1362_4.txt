He convinces Robert Morley to leave so that he can accept his identity and start hacking computers in the very sophisticated company of Karl Malden and Bob Newhart, another extraordinary duo to the movies. <br /> <br /> as in "Marie Antoinette" from 1938. Perhaps he had to return to this genre. <br /> <br /> This movie is funny at best. It's hard to believe that the next year, Maggie Smith completely changed her ways and gave the shocking performance of Oscar in "The First Miss Jean Brodie." <br /> <br /> Pani. Smith was created here to be a seemingly stupid head, but after the film is the brain of the outfit. It is a pity that writing with her has not gone.
