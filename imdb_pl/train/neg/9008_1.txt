There were a lot of unknown movies or movies due to bad reviews that I liked a lot. It was not one of them. <br /> <br /> It was abused and used camera techniques that made me feel like I was watching a soap opera. It was ridiculously predictable and most of the film was about to be done, and then you asked "that's all?" When I decided not to take the film too seriously and watch it from a purely banal point of view, it became more enjoyable. This is one movie that would be closed on MST3000 if it was still turned on.
