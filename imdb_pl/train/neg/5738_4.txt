"Darkness" was to some extent funny, but never seemed to have a plot that was lacking more than other films accused of this damage; i.e. "bad taste". It started really well, from a man running away from something. For the first few minutes it was very scary, but after some time the movie became funny at the top level, which at times was difficult due to poor lighting and terrible recording quality. It's hard to believe, because the acting of minors, who most of the time, seemed to be some friends talking to a video camera, making a queue when they were walking. This, in the absence of any plot, made it look like the movie was started without and ended without any script. As said earlier, Gore was the only starting point for this movie, which most of the time was difficult to understand.
