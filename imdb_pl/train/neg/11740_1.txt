A positively terrible vehicle of George Sanders, in which he goes from being a thief to a police tsar. <br /> <br /> While Sanders was a great character actor, he certainly was not the leading man, and this film confirms that. <br /> <br /> It is absolutely out of stupidity. Gene Lockhart gave a comical relief until the anger that led him to shoot the tragedy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, George Sanders and co-star Carol Landis committed suicide in real life. After making a film as regrettable as this one, it is not shocking. <br /> <br /> Ordinary attractive Signe Hasso is nothing here.
