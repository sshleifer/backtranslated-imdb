The only advantage of this movie is the actual plot ... Otherwise, this movie was terrible. Acting was ridiculously bad, and the set design was tacky and very tacky. The story was decent, but it was very difficult to watch because of terrible action. I do not recommend watching this ... The only advantage of this movie was that the actors were a bit attractive ... Especially Ryan Bauer, the man who plays the soap opera star. Part of the editing was well done, but there are continuity errors everywhere ... I'm starting to get sick and bother watching bad homosexual movies ... Can we get a good movie quickly?
