I love the memories of a geisha, so I read the book twice; it's one of the best books I read last year. I could not wait for the movie and I was afraid that reading the book would ruin the pleasure of watching the movie. I did not expect the film to be so bad. Part of the best part of the book was omitted in the film, and the characters were weak, and Hatsumomo (Li Gong) was the worst. If I have not read the book, this video would be a bit confusing and inexplicable. The outline of the story of the movie "Nitta Sayuri reveals how she crossed her fishing ..." Has anyone seen how or when Sayuri was Nitta Sayuri? Forget about the movie and read the book.
