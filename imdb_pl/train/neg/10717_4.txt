I give it generous four out of ten stars, dots or markers, or something like that. <br /> <br /> There were two really funny scenes in this movie. All the scenes with Amy P and Tina Fey and Greg Kinnear (Greg Kinnear !!) moved quite nicely. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, ordinary stereotype trade, blazing speed, brutally pushed through a silly soundtrack, and the "soundtrack" is generous. <br /> <br /> Anyway, two really funny scenes were about Amy P. It's just very funny in an animal way. It is a mixture of this monkey-like skit that they make at SNL and Lucille Ball. <br /> <br /> I hope they (Amy P and Tina Fey) just admit that they did it for money, because if you did it, it gave rise to Sarah Palin parodies, so I think we can say yes, it was worth giving the black guy back to the role of a servant who is really there to help you be more human. <br /> <br /> Bla. 4 outta 10, as I said, is generous. <br /> <br /> But no more, girls, OK? Oh, I almost forgot. Mama from "Two and a Half Men" is in this film and had some plastic surgery, so her lips now look like the lips of a 30-year-old woman, so every scene she is in is like trying to change her face or connect her in your head, or simply answer the question: "No. Wait. Wait. Has she had plastic surgery? "Because as a viewer, you really do not want her to have plastic surgery.
