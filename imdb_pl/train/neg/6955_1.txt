I do not see the attractiveness of this series (which is to be science fiction). It's really "let's see what soap works this week" and oh, the Cylons take part in flashbacks. <br /> <br /> Cylon "babe", which still nails the other one, is quite bad, it's pretty obvious that the revision was added to the show. Every time it appears, I'm stunned that the WTF is supposed to happen. And do not even try to rework me about "feature arcs". <br /> <br /> It's a soap opera with thrown CGI. This is not scientific fiction except the original assumption. <br /> <br /> This series is not everything it has succeeded. If you like fashionable, sharp, suspicious, lively and unspecified camera work, this program may be for you. Because the suckers seem to delight in this performance, it is a clear signal that the opinions of the suckers have been changed from TNG Picard.
