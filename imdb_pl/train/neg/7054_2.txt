This movie was absolutely pathetic. The pathetic scenario and the lack of any story simply caused me to watch three losers drooling on bikini babes. Sometimes I felt that I was watching the episode of Beavis and Butthead. I could not even sit in the whole movie. Emran Hashmi is disappointing, and Hrshitta Bhatt is not impressive at all. Celina Jaitley was not angry. The only noteworthy part of the movie is the parody of Anu Malika and his obsession with shayari. It was quite fun. The songs "Sini Ne" and his remix version were really good. You can always count on lip locking and lip synchronization with Emran. All in all, it seems that Emran does not have a good script from the Bhattas to support him this time.
