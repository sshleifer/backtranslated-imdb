I saw this movement a few years ago at the Central Florida Film Festival. I liked it, showed great potential. I think that most people grind this film, because the film seemed twisted (at the discretion of the filmmaker on the official website - this shortcut was presented as "rough"). <br /> <br /> But nevertheless it was an easy comedy. I think many people try to read too much in comedy. All they should do is make you laugh - that's all. I did it at his show, so I succeeded at this level. Anyway, my 2 cents.
