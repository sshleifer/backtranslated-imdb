I realized that watching the horror of the euro, especially the films produced by the cult luminary Jess Franco, that you can not expect the plot to make sense. However, Franco exaggerated with this film; and despite the surreal atmosphere and reputation of the film as one of the best director - Succubus is unfortunately a really awful movie. I must admit that I saw an American version of the cut, which lasts about 76 minutes; but unless it was just a logic that was cut out, I'm sure that the longer European version is equally boring. The story has something to do with a marauding woman; practicing S & M and talking junk, and it's all really boring. There is no gore, and sex is boring, and most of the time is taken up by a boring dialogue and despite the fact that it is a short movie; It was difficult for me to do it until the end. I must say that the locations look good and Franco did a good job using his surreal atmosphere; but the positive elements end. Jess Franco is definitely a gifted director who made some classic trash movies - but it looks like he was one of those that he made money, and I generally recommend skipping him and watching the director's more interesting work.
