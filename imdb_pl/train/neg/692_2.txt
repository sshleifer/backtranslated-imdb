One of the many slashers that appeared in the early eighties, Pranks is only distinguished by the early performance of Daphne Zunig (The Sure Thing, The Fly 2); her heroine dies early and the rest of the movie is completely forgotten. <br /> <br /> During the Christmas break, a group of students volunteer to clean up the damned college building. The crazy killer, however, throws the key to this work, methodically bumping into the youth in turn in various macabre ways. <br /> <br /> Using every clich√© title in the book, director Jeffrey Obrow delivers a boring and disturbing horror that made me pray for killing heroes so that I could continue to watch something more valuable. Most deaths (what, let's be honest, that's why we usually watch this kind of film) is short, not bloody; the only really terrifying images appear at the end when the bodies of the victims are discovered by the remaining survivor (there is one particularly bloody fragmented corpse) the film could have done more). <br /> <br /> At the last moment, the film saves itself from the disgrace of receiving the lowest possible result from me, having a nice unexpected ending, but it is really only for the slashers.
