I remember watching this movie in 86, when the film first appeared and what a horrible movie. Acting was cruel, the plot was so weak that it should or should blow up with the breeze. I think it put me on more than one occasion and I was not tired, I remember. Please avoid at all costs it is better to keep all teeth removed without anesthesia, which would be more entertaining. It is a pity that I could not give him a zero or negative result. I regret that I have not wasted my money to buy this from the video store, all I can say is that the tape he was on was still quite new, virtually not surprising because the film was so poor. If I remember correctly, I sat and watched her with the girl with whom I really wanted to go out and the fact that she was sitting next to me was still not enough to wake me up.
