I found the DVD "I Dream Of Jeanie" in the cart for 1.00 USD in Wal-Mart. When I saw that it was "the story of Stephen Foster", being a musician and a music teacher, I had to see it. I had no idea which year was produced because it did not say on the cover that it was a remake of the Sewanee River from 1939. The portrait of the composer Bill Shirley is sometimes painful, sometimes funny. The man has no testosterone and is a wimp all the time! I can not believe that Stephen Foster thought that music publishers do him a favor by publishing his songs ... without paying for it! In addition to this funny concept, there is an almost 20-minute episode of Ray Middleton and his black guy "Christy Minstrels" performing songs by Stephen Foster, which was difficult to watch, to put it mildly. I can not believe that anyone would consider this movie to be resurrected in our present time. It is embarrassment and should be forgotten. Fortunately, Stephen Foster's songs will NEVER be forgotten .... also, the portrait of Jeanie Eileen Christy was certainly the highest point in the lowest point of Hollywood history.
