Continuation of "Walking Tall" from 1973. It is a continuation of the true drama of Buford Pusser's Tennessee sheriff, but this part plays like a lame TV movie. Because Svenson takes over the lead role of Joe Don Baker, but he is too gentle for this role; he descends like a furious country singer with a stick instead of a guitar. Good supporting actors such as Richard Jaekel, Luke Askew and Robert DoQui have little to do. I would like to give the film one star strictly according to his good intentions, but the script is a clear and lazy mass of routine problems, and production is cheap. Then in 1977, "Final Chapter-Walking Tall," and in 1978, the TV movie "A Real American Hero."
