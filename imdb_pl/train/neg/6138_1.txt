This movie was awful from conception to execution. The US must set up a "Star Wars" site in this remote country? This is their premise? The road to access, concludes the US, is to win an obstacle course, such as a cross-country race, in which the winner can ask for anything from the leader. And who better to win this race known as "Game" than a gymnast? Of course! A gymnast would be the perfect choice for this mission. And do not forget that his father was an operator. Fortunately for our hero it happens that in happy places there is gymnastic equipment, like a stone horse with bows in the middle of the square (for no reason) amid a crazy city. Ideal. <br /> <br /> But above and beyond the terrible, HORIBBLE premise are uncomfortable fumblings of romantic scenes, apparently highly depressed ninja, whose only job seems to hold the flag to indicate the path of the race, and the worst climax in history. After winning the race, our hero presents the wishes of the US government. And here's all the effort was worth it, because the USA gets its site "Star Wars"! Huzzah! THIS IS YOUR TRIUMPHANT ENDING ?! Wow. <br /> <br /> But still, being such a bad movie, watching can be fun. The cover itself, depicting a ninja with machine guns, was enough to make me borrow this film. <br /> <br /> But if I ever met Kurt Thomas (a gymnast) in real life, probably kick him in the face after a 2/2-turn twist in the position of the hand.
