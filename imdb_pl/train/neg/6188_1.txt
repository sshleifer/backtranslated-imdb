It's definitely the worst Jane Eyre adaptation I've ever seen. It is not certain whether the script writer has ever read the book Bronte. George C Scott is ridiculous and awkward like Rochester - when he is not just old, acting furiously. Susannah York has the most outdated hairstyle from the 70s I've ever seen in a Victorian movie. The characters almost do not talk to each other, so the rich joke in the book, which is the basis of their deep intellectual and lasting love, has disappeared. The ending is absurd. <br /> <br /> Please, hire a version of Timothy Dalton. It is as true to the book as reading a novel aloud. Dalton is wonderful as Rochester. G. C. Scott is funny.
