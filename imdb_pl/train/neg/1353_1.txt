What is this? they are mish-mash of bizarre, recurring motifs (snails, Shirley Temple, swastikas and overtly racist music, among others) unfettered by any kind of narrative, story or character development. All this matter seemed to me deliberately a "freak show" and I do not mean only unusual casting decisions. He has a sense of bad acid travel far beyond drug use attributed to Hunter S. Thompson or William S. Burroughs. The only movie I can compare to is Eraserhead (my second least favorite movie of all time), which was intended to be much more depressing, but I still found What Is It? total loss of my time. One thing is to take a look at the inner functioning of one's mind - even the chemically altered consciousness of someone else - but completely different to throw strange visualizations in me solely because of the strangeness.
