I must precede this by saying that I am a great romantic. That's why I really wanted to like this movie. So I write my thoughts to save the rest from the disappointment that I felt watching. The Leap Years tells a story filled with the fate of Li-Ann, who falls in love with kind Jeremy and undertakes to fulfill every leap year. A very romantic premise based on a great story and cast that does not look like you're watching another Jack Neo movie. So why so bad? First of all, I think the filmmakers thought they were making a music video because they decided to replace story telling and all real emotions with cheap assemblies, predictable activities and stereotypical lines. I am both upset and ashamed that I was one of the few in Singapore who watched The Leap Years, but those of us in the cinema would agree that our repressed moans for polite speeches were loud. My hope was to see a romantic movie that would outperform Forever Fever, the best Singaporean romantic comedy so far, and The Leap Years do not even come close. Some blogs call it The Crap Years, which is difficult but ultimately true. Do not waste your money or emotions just like me. The film will make you forever give up love.
