But let's face it ... a few nostalgic sighs seemed to me. <br /> <br /> The show is so consistently great that it can have a few hiccups. I get a new season and just power it, as if I had 2 days of life. I like the idea of ​​calling it, but it was more of an episode from the end of the season, which would explain the following situation: <br /> <br /> Dr.Cox should not be bald for a few episodes, the only explanation I think about is that they have changed episode rotation or had to shoot the start again. <br /> <br /> and that my friends, why hell is bald. /> In any case, the performance is amazing ... bring the 7th season.
