Anyone who has studied physics or cognitive science will go away after 40 minutes in disgust, just like me and my wife. Unconscious masses can be broken by arguments that abolish the hand and absurd "conclusions" drawn (even without a logical reason) from real science. I am offended by such nonsense presented under the guise of "science". I can only conclude that the writers chose the quantum physics book, they did not understand a word, then they watched the Matrix a thousand times and proceeded to write this film. <br /> <br /> the murder experiment in Washington was carried out by the Transcendental Meditation Program. A short search will reveal the science of their methods. (http://www.freedomofmind.com/resourcecenter/groups/t/tm/dissenter.htm) <br /> <br /> Save money.
