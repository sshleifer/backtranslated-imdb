Call-girl is a witness to the murder and becomes the next target of the killer. Director Brian De Palma is really pretentious here: his camera bypasses the corners of the museum (after a long time spent over the image of a monkey), divides into a divided screen for artistic purposes, practically distributes its story sequence (again on a split screen) in which two characters they watch a TV show about transsexuals and set their (first) finale during a thunderstorm. "Dressed To Kill" is tiring, above all because he asks us to swallow so much and not give anything important. Much of the acting (except for the young Keith Gordon) is mediocre, and the (second) final is the stripping of his own "Carrie" De Palma - not to mention "Psycho". Explanation of dirty deeds is like Hitchcock's trick, not tribute. Stylish and cool, the final effect is clearly baked. ** with ****
