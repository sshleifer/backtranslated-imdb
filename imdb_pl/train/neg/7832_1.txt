I barely managed to go through one episode ("Crouch End"). The dialog was slim and recommendable. Acting was tragic. Eion Bailey, despite the best attempts to keep drama, remains largely silent. His eyebrows point to a recent botox treatment. Claire Forlani could just as easily play a lady in danger in a silent movie. The protagonists were fairy tales, each of which played a stereotypical cog in the story, in the majority of accidental, meandering story. Poor special effects can be justified taking into account the budget of the TV miniseries. But he tries to create tension and surprise thanks to the distracting cinematography added to the unobservability. I have the impression that the ending was to be witty and surprising, but it was bad and had little to do with the rest of the story. If I had to compare its overall quality with something else, I would put this episode of "Nightmares and Dreamscapes" on par with Hercules NBC.
