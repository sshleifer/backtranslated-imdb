This movie is simply awful. It's boring, low quality, actors are just the worst actors I've ever seen, and the script is so bad it's funny. <br /> <br /> The "main" actor is supposed to be a hot guy who gets all the girls, but he's ugly, overweight and looks like he's from the early 90s. <br /> <br /> All characters they leave for the weekend to meet friends, but nobody is really friends! The spouses have not seen the "main" guy for over 5 years and even then they were not really friends. The "date" of the main guy knows him only from work and there is no girl they pick up at the bar. Now tell me that you risk losing your job to spend the weekend in the cabin with people who are not even your real friends. Because that's what he's doing at the beginning of the movie! <br /> <br /> Do not waste even one minute of your time on this lemon. I made home movies more frightening! <br /> <br />
