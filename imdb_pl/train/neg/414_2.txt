Going to this movie, you know it is a movie in which six lab technicians work in an enclosed lab with an invisible geek. So you will guess immediately who will live and who will die. Those who survived end up exactly what they could expect, so there is no point in plotting. <br /> <br /> And if you're not sure if it's a B movie or a movie that's just happening in the laboratory with an interesting story, William Devane plays the part: instant movie status. <br /> <br / > The film is promising at the beginning. In the laboratory, we meet an invisible gorilla who becomes more and more brutal. Oooh, premonition. The best scene in the whole movie is the situation in which the laboratory team again shows the gorilla. Great special effects. The same when they make Bacon invisible. <br /> <br /> There are a few bare breasts, a really bad dirty joke and not enough curse to give the film a R-rating that really does not need. <br /> <br /> There were no surprises for the thriller, except when Shue does like MacGyver in the freezer, which is more "Whaaaa"? OK, there is one surprise. Then Caine (Bacon) returns for the last time to the elevator shaft. It was a surprise, but only because you are shouting on TV: "No! You're dead! Finish the movie! Speaking of yelling on television, that's all I've been doing for the last 25 minutes. "Put on your safety glasses #! Instead of putting on infrared goggles so that they can see it, they try out all the other tricks in the book (fire extinguishers, sprinkler systems ...). <br /> <br /> The story really lost her at the end. But the special effects were good; that's the only reason I'm giving him 2/10.
