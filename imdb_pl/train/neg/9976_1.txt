The first scene in "Problem Child" has a child peeing in the face of a nun. For this movie it's witty. A nasty, hideous "comedy" is inadequate on so many levels that it does not believe. John Ritter is a nice father who adopts a child from hell, and kudos for him for maintaining dignity in the surrounding attack one note, annoying performances and childish humor. What the hell is Jack Warden doing in this mess? The film directed by Dennis Dugan and unbearable in attempts to include sentimentality, when it is done with primitiveness, the film is so badly made that it is quite a bizarre experience. But it does not matter. The weakness of all this is Michael Oliver, the most disgusting and dissatisfied child actor ever to hit the screen? Believe me, you will want to hit him on the lips.
