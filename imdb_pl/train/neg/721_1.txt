This movie has some key disadvantages. The first and most important of these is the clear lack of a good story! This, unfortunately, makes the film not only difficult to watch, but also sends a certain sense of hopelessness to the observer, as if he wasted valuable time on their short life. This means that the film can not capture the audience, instead it encourages the audience to contempt for the film and everything related to it! In short, it's really, really BAD! Do yourself a favor and chew a big rubber boot, you will find it much more interesting and enjoyable than watching Terminator Woman.
