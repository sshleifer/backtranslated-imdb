Awwww .... yes, it is cordial and everything that the unlucky family is adopted by ABC / Sears and has its own "renovated" home. The humanistic appeal ends here. I liked it at the beginning of the run, but now this show has become disgustingly exaggerated. . People in Habitat For Humanity must shake their heads in disbelief. For example, is it necessary for a healthy sixteen-year-old boy to have a jacuzzi in his bedroom or has his bed been cheated by the "Low Rider" plumber? Does mom really need her damaged, non-working and rusty old pick-up truck, restored and "polished" by some of California's best customers? The new one would do his job nicely and probably for a third of the price. Do people really need a 60-inch plasma screen in every room in the house? There is also the question of who pays increased property taxes and utility bills. Even after the departure of the zanyaki from "Makeover" someone still earns a living. I doubt that friendly people from Social Services will see humor in all this generosity. <br /> <br /> This show is nothing more than an ABC ranking game and a silent advertising for sponsors.
