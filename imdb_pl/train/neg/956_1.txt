It's amazing that this movie turns out to be one of my hits. This is by far the worst number one movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Not only was I once so bored (fortunately not more than 1.5 hours), but the test of humor before puberty this feature is not even close to approximation, but one of the corners of my mouth is slightly bent. After the first very uncomfortable part, you hope that the other parts will be at least slightly better. In vain do you hope that it only goes down from there. <br /> <br /> The film has no story worth telling and repeats this story three times. You can only hope that by some miracle all the remaining copies of this movie will be lost forever, and Trent Harris never puts his hands on the camera anymore ...
