In fact, these young people were so distasteful that I could not wait for everyone to be murdered, including Clarissa (Joanna Canton), because I considered her the most annoying group. <br /> <br /> But I knew it would be a mess from the first minutes when teenager Christine opened fire to the priest and nuns with Leslie Gore's music in the background. He had nowhere to go. <br /> <br /> Even the prosthetist looked fake, and the "blood" looked suspiciously like a Hawaiian hole punch, though she later acquired a red look to fit into the stupid Halloween make-up they all wore. I'm sure all morons from GOTH will appreciate this nonsense because they will like this group. I certainly did not like it. Blah ... <br /> <br /> And even my favorite horror Adrienne Barbeau can not save this stupid horror of teenagers. Still, it looks hot. I'm glad she cares about herself because we do not see her too much these days. <br /> <br /> However, this is a step forward from meandering HORROR Dante Tomaselli (2002), because a somewhat coherent plot, so I will give her so much. This and a small Boston Terrier named Boozer also raises it. In the end, I like what Boozer does Clarissa. It was the only good scene in an otherwise stupid movie. <br /> <br /> Lion's Gate Films must have been desperate when they chose this movie. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
