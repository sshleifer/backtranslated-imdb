My brother is in love with this program, let's do it straight. I completely agree with people who said they were copying Dexter's Laboratory and Pretty Strange Parents. <br /> <br /> I never really liked quite strange parents, that is, some things made me laugh, but most of the time it's really annoying and not sweet at all. It's almost the same as in the case of Johnny's test. Only that NOTHING will make me laugh at this show. Gags are so stupid and senseless, and to tell the truth, maybe it's just me, but the children do not dress like that! Yes, I think Johnny's hair is amazing, but c'mon! <br /> <br /> And Dexter's Laboratory, which once was one of my favorite programs and I still do not mind. What makes me disgusted and ashamed of Johnny Test, who makes the absolute JOKE of this amazing show! <br /> <br /> One more thing. The. Dog. Is. So. Irritating. It's louder and nastier than Johnny! A gay accent? What a nonsense! I hate the dog to death and I hope it will die because it would be better for children than to listen and watch the indecent nonsense that appears in this program and catch the gay accent. Unless you want to look at the wonderful flames, and your brain is fried with this show, do not watch it!
