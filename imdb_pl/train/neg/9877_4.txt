Fantastic Mr. Fox is a comedy based on the classic book by Roald Dahl. Wes Anderson directs and respects a short book with the same title on the big screen in the full movie. While I respect what Anderson, an extremely talented man, did, the film got lost in his own clever spirit. It seems that Anderson left the story, knowing that he is a talented man, and if it was a bad movie, it would be his first bad movie. Just like when you go to school and have your first bad day, this is Anderson's first bad day in making movies, so I'm going to release him easily. I admit that he had cunning and a nice spirit, and the animation is nice, but the movie becomes more and more difficult, leaving behind history and random shots of random things. Characters are also good. Jason Schwartzman proclaims the wise son of Mr. Fox (George Clooney), Ash, and especially engaging. The film does not quite reach the terrifying level, but it certainly gets closer and closer when it comes a step further. I'm sure Wes Anderson will be back on the path with another amazing movie, when and where he decides to make another film, but for now, sorry, Wes Anderson, this movie was a big disappointment.
