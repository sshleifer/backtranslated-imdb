I can not help but I think I like movies that are to be scary and just bad. Personally, I've listed it in my top 10 worst movies, right below the creatures from the abyss! Watch this movie and laugh, do not expect any academy awards for acting. More chances to understand the film. Honestly, I've seen much worse. Plus, some maniac who circulates in the desert, wiping out the same people who just died, is unbelievable that it must be original. I think it is one of those who love or hate films. you can make up your mind so that it's awful, but it somehow pulls it away, that's why I love it
