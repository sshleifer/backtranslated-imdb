Drew Barrymore is an actress who goes through bad times, not only in her career, but also in her personal life. After she was a wonderful child actress, she fell into oblivion with mediocre low-quality movies. While she recovered from this dark past, this movie remains as a reminder of the worst days of Drew Barrymore. <br /> <br /> The film begins with an interesting assumption, very similar to Brian De Palma's "Raising Cain"; with a story dealing with multiple personality disorder that sets the story of a horror / thriller. Barrymore stars as Holly Gooding, a young woman who is trying to make a new life in California after the traumatic event of her past, where her other personality apparently killed her mother. <br /> <br /> Suddenly her past comes back to haunt her when her evil personality returns to her life, wanting to ruin her new peace and new found love. In the midst of chaos, his new boyfriend, Patrick Highsmith (George Newbern), will try to help Holly face the demons of his past. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the underestimated De Palma's thriller, "Doppelganger" is for the most part an average movie that not only never fulfills its purpose, but ends in one of the worst ends of film history. Although Barrymore is definitely not at its best, she manages to maintain her dignity with above-average performance. The rest of the cast, however, is from the average to the painfully bad game at the highest level, though Leslie Hope manages to be one of the best. <br /> <br /> The script is full of stereotypes, and the influence of De Palma is quite obvious. While the film tries to be original, creating literary references in almost every line, the dialogues are boring, and the wooden game certainly does not do anything good. He has a lot of nudity and strange reasons and excessive use of special effects. <br /> <br /> The makeup effects are done by the outstanding KNB and are really one of the few good things in the movie. However, the bizarre abuse of effects in a completely non-exhausting context reduces the impact of the KNB work and makes the shame in another film unbelievable. <br /> <br /> The fact that it is B -Movie is not an excuse for poor quality, because with a better and more coherent scenario it could be an interesting movie. Unfortunately, we only have an average movie that gets worse every second. Worthy of beautiful Barrymore. 3/10
