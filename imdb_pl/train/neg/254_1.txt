Ah, bait. How do I hate you? Let me count the ways. 1. You try to be funny, but you are thin and unhappy; every joke is predictable and expected, and when it comes, it does not make you laugh. Instead, I want to quit. 2. You try to be dramatic but unbelievable; the woman is terribly worried, and the "bad guy" looks like Bill Gates and is as scary as ... well, Bill Gates. (Try to imagine how Bill Gates tries to intimidate someone with a pistol, does not work, right? Maybe a lawyer, but not a gun.) Does not fit.) As for Jamie Foxx, well, just watching how to try a dramatic and honest dialogue is ridiculous and tells me throw. 3. You try to be full of action, but instead are boring and drag too many times. And when the action warms up, the camera tripod must have been lost because the scenes wobble more than the Blair Witch Project and I feel disgusting, and once again I want to quit. 4. You try to be a good movie, but you did not make it, YOU SHOULD NOT, WAS FAILED! I would rather go barefoot in the Sahara with a packet full of beef without water, no sunscreen, and only Meryl Streep for company. This hell would be more beautiful than one minute spent watching everyone in Bait, who are outdoing themselves in an idiot-written story with Bill Gates for the evil guy, and do not even talk about the massive bomb that fires in the car that Jamie Foxx has just left, but somehow he manages to escape ... just kill me now or do the right thing and promise me that somehow I will never have to watch a movie that is so bad.
