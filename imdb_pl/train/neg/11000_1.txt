Words can not describe how awful this movie is. It's a series of random, obscene clips about everything, from Batman's stupid trick to a guy who has him with an old dead lady (REALLY disturbing). The only amazing thing about Underground Comedy Movie is watching Joey Buttafuoco, the best actor in this movie. It is also rated NC-17, rejecting the only people who can tolerate it.
