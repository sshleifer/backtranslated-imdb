Stuffing plot, uninteresting characters and sub-par (to put it mildly) a dialogue of the plague of this television production, which could not be interesting even with a billion-dollar production budget. <br /> <br /> Characters are not credible, in their motives, actions or their confessions. The plot sounds like a bad Dungeons and Dragons (TM) hook, but with plasma rifles and power fields. There are serious problems with continuity, and the degree of meaningless interaction between characters causes the author to at least win. <br /> <br /> Avoid this as a plague. Watch any episode of Dark Angel and you'll have better acting, dialogue and story lines. Yuck.
