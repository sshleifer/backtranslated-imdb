This movie is horrible! He competes with "Ishtar" in the amount of embarrassingly bad moments. I would rate it lower than 3, with the exception of a few funny lines; but overall, this movie was crappy! They seemed to have done it for a weekend in some fallen resort. Joe Roth should join Elaine May on the sideline forever!
