It was one of the worst movies EVER !!!!!!!! It was so bad, I was laughing at the whole movie! The plot was so tacky; especially the end. This movie is changing from the end of the world catastrophe to saving eels! I mean, come on! And I swear ... I think they use SOCK PUPPETS for eels! In the middle was this horrible scene of kisses with the two main heroes who got divorced. How predictable! It was terrible that my mother, my sister and I could not finish it, and when I finished, it was about a year later! The second time we watched it and this time we ended, we made comments similar to MST3K throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Summary: watch it only if you're a filmmaker! Make fun comments, watch it for a sleepover for laughter, and I mean HUGE laugh. Also watch out for mockery. The metaphor explaining this movie: This film is a very shallow field full of marionettes with cheese and socks!
