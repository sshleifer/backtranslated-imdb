I can not see it. it was one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. sometimes it's hard to be a Mormon when there are such films. what a sad look at the Mormon life. I can tell you if you saw this movie, that it's not like that in a single ward. if it were, I do not think I would do it. It is a pity that most Mormon films are created by a group of geeks who have nothing better to do. the acting was so bad that my wife and I barely succeeded. I think it can be said that it has all the characters of the movie B. are there C movies? In any case ... I thought that this movie is sucked and full of cheese. I would like some Mormons to start making some high-quality movies.
