Having nothing better to do, I decided to check "Aztec Rex" (as it was announced) for this hell. <br /> <br /> A stupid story could be better if the dinosaur effects were convincing. In fact, they looked like animates (these raw designs that the artists later use to complete CGI effects, add more details, smoother movements, etc.) Absolutely terrible-looking dinosaurs, which is the only reason you would probably want to sit down. <br /> <br /> The only redeemer was the beautiful Dichen Lachman as Ayacoatl. She kept my interest; if only the budget was increased and convincing dinosaurs could be used. <br /> <br /> Disappointing. At least the cast and the crew got a free trip to Hawaii, where the movie was filmed.
