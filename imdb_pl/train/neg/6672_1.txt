I'm 47 years old and I've spent as much life as I can remember, a lover of horror movies and science-fiction movies. Being quiet, black and white, without a budget or with a big budget, there are very few of them, which I can not find. I will say, however, that I will give this film for good gore and creature effects, but that's all. It's a case of effects on the story. The truth is that we live in times where there is little that remains, which was not in horror. Therefore, for each type of film, to really have fun, it must have a good, original story. Good story can overcome weak effects and bad acting, but a bad story with good acting and good effects is still a bad movie. This film does not even have a good action, only good results. So if you can not just go up, pass it on.
