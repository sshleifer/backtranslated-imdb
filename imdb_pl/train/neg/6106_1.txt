It was just awful, the plot was just OK, but the rest was bad. I mean a puppet, and even tried to make a digital movie, which is even worse! Usually I would like to have a low-budget movie, but it was only a waste of time and almost made me want to return the set on which it appeared. I have about ten low-budget film sets with 6-8 movies and I have to say that it is the worst of them. Besides, the vocabulary is off and they use fake plastic machete that does not even look real, they can use those that look even a bit like real, so save time and money and do not watch this horrorable movie.
