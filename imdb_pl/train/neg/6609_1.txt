I can not say that Aag is the worst Bollywood movie ever made, because I have not seen all Bollywood movies, but my imagination tells me it can be. <br /> <br /> This film seems like an artistic attempt to commit suicide on behalf of the director, and I believe he has succeeded in his mission. No actor from the list outside of this film would risk sharing the same bill as the whole humiliation that this film brings with it. <br /> <br /> But let's not blame the director here, there's a cinematographer who looks like he's getting ready for the amateur movie house of the year award. It is over a dramatic result that hopes to move you to the next scene. An illuminating man who had to hold a cigarette in one hand and a light bulb on the pole in the other, hoping that the flame burning the cigarette would increase the necessary light in every scene. And of course, the actors! Some of them are not newcomers, otherwise everything could be forgiven. The team of actors at Aag has been combined to promote the new beginning and the dimension of recreating the most famous Indian film of all time, "Sholay." Do not forget that these actors have not been forced into this movie, are A-lists and willing participants of something that, let's face it, would surely have high and willing social expectations ?? Therefore, the question arises, did Amitabh put aside (for now), did other actors really believe that their performances even tried to improve the original? Did Amitabh Bachchan read the script and believe that people remember his dialogue in this farcical abomination of the film? Do not be stupid, of course not, it was a demonstration for the public about how much money can be led by actors. <br /> <br /> I really hope that everyone involved is happy with what is really a vulgar attempt to remake a classic movie that successfully pollutes everyone's mind when they look at the original.
