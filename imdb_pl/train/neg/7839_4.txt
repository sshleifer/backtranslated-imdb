Serge Farnel has made very precise criticism of this film in the revue "The Rwandese night" (www.lanuitrwandaise.net) <br /> <br /> Critics who show how France was behind the whole situation that the UN Rwanda survived. <br /> <br /> The UN soldiers were in a dangerous situation, while the French soldiers were warmly welcomed by genocidal forces. <br /> <br /> A day earlier ten UN soldiers were killed by genocidal forces. <br /> <br /> That's why UN soldiers decided to protect their lives by driving French trucks. <br /> <br /> In this way, they gave up the Tutsi, which is unforgivable, of course. <br /> <br /> But we must remember that the French soldiers organized this situation.
