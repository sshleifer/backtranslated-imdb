This movie is horrible. Bad acting, bad writing, bad music. It's just awful. Not only is it a misrepresentation of RPGs, but the key elements of the film are poorly made. May God, in whom I do not believe, have mercy on the souls of the unfortunates who conceived and gave birth to this abomination.
