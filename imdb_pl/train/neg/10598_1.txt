this is a piece of s - t !! it looks worse than in the case of t.v. movie. and I'm flashing to think that the sequel has been continued, and the results ... war is prettier than this one. jean claude van shame did it again and wonders why his career is now. no script, no history and you should not waste time. I mean that. 1 in 10 is too high, too high. Goldberg should be undermined. Van Shame is not an actor.
