This movie will be a hit among those who like sophomoronic, mindless, explicit bragging about sexual exploits and F ... in almost every sentence. How good a plot? How's comedy? Like romance or other human values? Stay away from the whipped. It was so bad that I left after about half an hour. I saw two children slipping in, what looked like about 10 - very harmful - it deserves X.
