This movie is really something like a grateful egg, well in part. Unlike other reviewers, I found that the main disadvantage is the lack of opportunity to attract the viewer's interest in the characters and the story. I sat there because I'm interested in rock'n'roll and bands' dynamics, but if I were to judge it solely on the basis of his merits as a film, I would have to give him a thumbs down, with a few reservations: Jason Behr is good at John Livien and pretty convincing as a rock singer; the narrative about his childhood trauma is unclear, although we get tips on the well-preserved relationship between Livien and his parents, but his behavior is bizarre to the viewer (which should not be). Nevertheless, the idea of ​​using stage personality to solve internal conflicts is interesting, but not innovative or fully explored as a topic in this film. The references to John Lennon were annoying, but I admit I'm not a Beatles fan. In any case, Livien and his band reminded me more about Oasis than The Beatles, in the sense that there was something derivative about them. Another frustrating thing about the film was the way it opened itself with the interesting - though intermediate - philosophical levels of reflection on the main character, but left threads of his thinking out there just to pick them up in a very short movie, when Livien says: "Before God, there was music" (I've ever seen this commercial for Tia Maria in the 90s. "Tia Maria was ahead of time" and that's how it came about); it seems like an idiotic conclusion, and the viewer has no idea how he got to him, but he has the right to do so. Fortunately, his bassist and friend, skillfully played by Dominic Monaghan, seems to recognize the erroneous thinking when he answers: "You do not know that." <br /> <br /> All in all, limited direction forces and the plot could go one way in future projects, in pointless banality or in an interesting and mature perspective.
