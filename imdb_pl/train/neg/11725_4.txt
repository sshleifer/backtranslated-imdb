RATING STAR: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> James Dial (Wesley Snipes) is hiding on his ranch in Montana unsuccessful capture of a known terrorist. Then he contacted the agency again to go to London to take another trip. His goal was stopped there and he was under strong police protection - but they do not want him to just catch their man - they want to take him. Everything goes well, but then the mission becomes unsuccessful and when the senior police chief, Windsor (Charles Dance) is killed, the blame falls on Dial's feet. Wanted as an animal, she hides in a nearby home and befriends a young girl named Emily (Eliza Bennett), who deals with her own problems and becomes his involuntary helper when he goes to clear his name and practice who betrayed him. br /> <br /> The latter Snipes went straight to the DVD escapade from nowhere, with minimal advertising even for something so small (I do not recall seeing any ads or trailers for this anywhere.) With this in mind and after Snipes' story about the efforts on DVD, it seemed that Snoop Dawg tells you to fall like it was hot. But I felt compelled to do it anyway. He is not one of his worst, but does not reach a level higher than the standards of some of his better (The Detonator, 7 Seconds, really says it all). <br /> <br /> It is, at best, gentle, with minimal action, naive in a cool dialogue and Snipes not quite in the lead role. Similarly, in the main supporting role, it is quite clear that Dance appeared only to check pay and it is usually one that no cast will shout in the hills in any of their CVs. <br /> <br /> Many say that in the end the only "deal" that interests you is the situation in which Snipes's will end with Sony, and thus the end of subsequent DVD action movies. **
