This film is one of the reasons why IMDB should allow 0/10 vote. Acting is terrible, even what some people praise here, the figure of Carpathia! The script looks like it was written in a hurry. In one of the scenes, the black preacher who was left, asked by Buck, which means "dan7" on computer graphics, said: "Daniel 7, * CHAPTER 24." He probably meant VERSE 24, but the filmmakers longed for this slip . Perhaps the worst thing is that the eschatological position of the film is biblically incomprehensible. While many Christians were in favor of interpreting the events from the end of the film, this interpretation in my opinion is wrong. To understand these shortcomings, read "Christians will go through the trouble" of Jim McKeever and "Blessed hope, biblical study of the second Advent and rapture" of George E. Ladd.
