Treasure Island DVD should be required to be watched on any movie production course! This is a textbook example of how NOT to make a movie. Watching the film, and then listening to the writer's / director's commentary graphically shows the huge gap between what he knows about the heroes and what he tells his listeners about them. Call me old-fashioned, but I think about movies as means of communication, and communication is not complete if the audience does not know what the hell the director says. The director's overwhelming goal is to make a film without "Hollywood convention." Among these conventions, unfortunately, is the consistency of character and clarity of the concept. The director himself realizes that the audience often does not understand the points in which he deliberately avoided the "Hollywood stereotype". However, he never realizes that stereotypes exist for some reason. They are an abbreviation for the quick and transparent transfer of complex ideas. It is good to avoid them, but they should be replaced by another way of passing the same idea, and not simply eliminated. The film is built on an intriguing assumption, rich in potential. Two dolls are intended to fabricate personality and background for an unidentified corpse, which is to be used in a disinformation mission in the last days of World War II. Soon, everyone begins to fill their personal fantasies with a character, and their invention becomes more and more real to them. Someone with less contempt for the "Hollywood convention" of traditional story telling could create a great movie with this idea. This movie is definitely not! Puppets do everything in their power to ensure consistency for these characters, but too often they are overcome by a stunned and confused script. In particular, I am more and more impressed with Gonzo, who plays the dead corpse. In many muppet movies, he always stands out as a very charismatic puppet.
