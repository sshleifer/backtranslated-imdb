Andie McDowell is beautiful as a 40-year-old woman whose late start in a serious relationship leads her to a much younger man and a later fall with two of the best girldfriends for a long time. <br /> <br /> Seeing a gigolo / gold hunter in a sincere young man, "friends" who put an end to this "stupid relationship", go beyond the limits of "helping" his friend (who is obviously blinded by this gigolo) underhanded gra ". <br /> <br /> The short sequence of situations is absolutely ridiculous, it's no longer overwhelming her.There can be hope for a sweet love story without these incredible scenes, instead all the viewers are left with him involuntarily shaking their heads - these Without giving details about the cliff, I warn the viewer about the high expectations for this film, most (like me) will be very disappointed, the scale from 1 to 10, this classifies me weak 4. There is much better material there is not it's worth your time.
