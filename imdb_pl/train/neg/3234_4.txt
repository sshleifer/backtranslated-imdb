How do you rate a movie like this one? Does it really even have a cinematic value? It's a movie that tries to be as close as possible to snuff film. Basically, the whole movie is a clean group of guys torturing a young girl. Not very attractive, and not so realistic. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the film tried to be as realistic and shocking as possible. However, the film is simply too false to be able to act as intended. Slapping and stumping are soft and false, and also sound. Of course, they often kick the floor, not the girl. Also, the way a girl reacts to all torments is quite tame. I mean, if it was real, I'm sure it would scream. There are more moans in it than shouting. <br /> <br /> The film is of course a low budget and it is a brave attempt to achieve something shocking and realistic, as well as original and provocative, with very limited resources. I do not think this movie has had a big impact on me when it was released, although it had to do something right, because six sequels were released in total. <br /> <br /> Fans of shock and this movie will probably disappoint you, although there are still fetish people who will have a chance to jump out of this movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
