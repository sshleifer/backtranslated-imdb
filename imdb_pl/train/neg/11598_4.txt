When you look at the next ominous sequel to Nightmare, like Freddy's Revenge, you must at least give him a bit of something to try something new. And although The Dream Child is more enjoyable, it offers absolutely nothing new in the series. Yes, they are, as always, a creative death, like a kid who becomes part of a comic and faces "Super Freddy", but even such scenes are not used to their full potential, and parts without Freddy are simply boring. <br /> <br /> It meant the official death of terror for the series. Freddy seems a comedic relief now ... but for what? <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10
