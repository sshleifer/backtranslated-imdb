During a sleepless night, I switched channels and found this embarrassment in the film. What did they think? <br /> <br /> If this is life after "Remote Control" for Kari (Wuhrer) Salin, no wonder she disappeared. <br /> <br /> And why did David Keith take the role? It's pathetic! <br /> <br /> In any case, I turned on the movie at the end, so I did not have much storyline. But it must have been the best part. This nervous college kid brings this dominatrix-ish girl home ... this scene is straight from comics - or cheap porn movies. She calls her mother a retentant and kisses her father, "Oh, I did not expect a language!" Great lines! <br /> <br /> After this I had to see how it ended ... <br /> <br /> Of course, this bitch from hell has a past, so the SWAT team is upstairs. And so ... they surround her! AND YES YES! The kid blasts her brain !!!! AHAHHAHAHAHA !! <br /> <br /> This is a must see on TV. <br /> <br />
