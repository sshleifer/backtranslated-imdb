Minimal script, minimal character development, minimum fixed camera. The maximum stretched scenes, the maximum headache causing rapid magnification, the maximum figures walking in the forest doing nothing. Until the 12:01 hour flashes on the screen, you can go forward and not miss anything, because there are three hunters who know nothing about anything. To be honest, there is some string music in the film that was interesting, so maybe the music video would be a good solution. Unfortunately, this did not happen, and what should have been twenty minutes is unbelievable. Forget about "Trigger Man", I know I'm trying. - MERK
