In the first we know the world in which there are werewolves and are a bit organized. The plot in this movie made sense; TV reporter investigates this and tries to discover the truth. In the end, he must kill many of them, including his boyfriend who becomes him. Then he shows the world that they exist, transforming into live television. Special effects were just ridiculous in the first movie and they do not improve in this film. Regardless of whether they are transformations, bad dolls or cheesy computer graphics showing superpowers. <br /> <br /> The plot is not that bad; for some reason they must kill the werewolf leader. This will not destroy all the werewolves and will not end up being a threat from werewolves ... they just want to kill her. I think there was a vague reason for this, but it really gets lost in the movie. <br /> <br /> After the movie "ends" we have a 10-minute editing of the film we've just watched and each scene is one where the werewolf leader breaks the top, revealing big breasts, while the Devo-esquire band plays in the crowd werewolves. <br /> <br /> The only thing that makes this movie even visible is Christopher Lee.
