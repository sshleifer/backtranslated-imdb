Even worse than the worst "Lynx's confusathon", "Brain Dead" does not make sense. A shamefully wasted talent (Bill Pullman, Bill Paxton) bounces like in the cartoon "Tom and Jerry" on acid. Character development is negligible. It just starts to climb on a "strange scale" until it reaches a peak in total chaos. Do not get caught up because of the above-mentioned great actors. They have nothing to work with and you'll wonder what's going on throughout the unbearable 85 minutes. I strongly recommend avoiding the "dead brain" at any price, unless you have to distract your brain into total nonsense. - MERK
