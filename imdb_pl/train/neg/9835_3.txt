Before I explain Alias, let me say "The Desert Trail" is bad even when it comes to the standards of the Three Stooges westerns. In fact, it presents Carmen Laroux as half-evil girl Juanita, when you hear her Mexican accent, you will immediately recognize her as Senorita Rita from the classic short dress "Saved by the Belle". <br /> <br /> In "The Desert Trail" John Wayne can play the character of Moe Howard, and Eddy Chandler will play in Curly Howard. Like their Stooge counterparts, the running gag in the 53-minute film is Moe hitting Curly. Wayne's character, the persecutor in the skirt, is not very charming, but he's supposed to be a good guy. <br /> <br /> Playing a rodeo cowboy riding Wayne holding a rodeo cash at the bow tie and taking a cash prize that he would win if the proceeds were good - other riders have to settle for 25 cents dollar (actually even less after Wayne robs money) ). No explanation was given that Wayne tears off riders and is still considered a hero who gets a girl. <br /> <br /> Things are getting complicated at this point, because the villain (Al Ferguson) and his assistant Larry Fine (played by Paul Fix - who would play the sheriff Micah on the television "The Rifleman") see Wayne rob at the box office and then steal the rest of the money and kill the rodeo manager. Moe and Curly are accused. <br /> <br /> So Moe and Curly move to another city to escape the law and change their names to Smith and Jones. Who they meet first, but their old friend Larry, whose sister becomes the love interest of the other half (Senorita Rita stays behind the old city and does not appear in the film). <br /> <br /> Nurse Larry plays well beautiful Mary Kornman (now she was grown up, but in her youth she was one of the original cast short films of Our Gang by Hal Roach). Kornman is the main reason for watching the mega lame western, and her scenes with Moe and Curly are much better than any other in production, as if they used a completely different crew to film them. <br /> <br /> Even in 1935, the action sequences in this game are extremely weak, and the technical creation of films is amazingly bad. The two main scenes of pursuit end with a film material with wide shots of a rider falling from a horse. Each time, the editor trims the shot of one of the heroes on the ground, but there is no horse in the frame, the footage is completely different, and the character has different clothes than a stuntman. In other places you can freely use film material, and none of them even convincing. <br /> <br /> One thing to watch out for is the mid-movie scene in which Moe and Curly get on their horses and drive away (to the right screen) from the cabin when the camp galloping towards the cabin from the left. The cameraman follows the two puppets with the free pan to the right, then makes a whip to the left to reveal the approaching group. In addition to home movies, I've never seen anything like that, not because it looks stupid (what it does), but because a competent director would never play the scene in this way. They film two horsemen who will leave and then rearrange the camera and film the approaching group as a separate action. Or, if they felt creative, they would show the sequence so that the camera would show the riders in the foreground and the branch approaching in the background. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
