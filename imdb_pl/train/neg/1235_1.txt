I really could not wait to see Planet of the Apes, but it was a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> Settings and masks are great, but this is the only good aspect of the movie. All other things are really annoying. Mark Wahlberg does not play, he's just in the movie, he looks stupid. Other actors are not very good either. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing is that it's history. This is absolutely funny! For example: monkeys lie unconsciously on the ground, but people do not attack them, no, they wait until they appear again! This is just one example of stupid history, but it takes too long to tell them all.
