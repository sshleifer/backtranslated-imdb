If your idea of ​​entertainment is to watch the graphic material of people passing by cars (you'll see a woman passing under the front wheel, sprained when the car passes over it before going under the rear wheel - and show it twice, if you missed it the first time), there is a document for you. Apparently I did not watch this very disturbing piece of voyeurism anymore, but that was enough for me. Maybe the rest is even better. <br /> <br /> I wonder how long it will take before the TV networks start showing slush videos. Perhaps game shows based on self-mutilation can be nice. <br /> <br /> I already know that people are upset in the world and that terrible things happen. I do not have to see the proof on the TV pretending to be entertainment.
