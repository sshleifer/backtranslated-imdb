Although I'm not Sam Rockwell's fan, I was surprised when I saw his name in the subtitles at the beginning of "Joshua". Heck, I did not even realize he was in "Joshua" until I started the movie. It is obvious that I watched a film based on a film, not lead. A bill was issued for "Rosemary's Baby", "Omen" or any other demonic movie "Joshua". Unfortunately, he fell flat. Slow, incredibly slow and flat. However, I continued to see how it all would resolve, hoping beyond any doubt that the climax would shed some light on this subject. Well, I admit, it happened (a bit weak), but what an obsolete closure. And what a movie with a low budget, or at least designed it. The person falls down? you do not see a drop, you see someone lying in what seems to be blood. The person is hit by a taxi? you do not see it, you see someone complaining, he's holding a bike. I am not sure if it is called "style" or laziness, or simply the lack of funds for special effects. We have a "rich" family with a crazy mother, a workaholic who tries to balance everything, kid? Joshua, who can / can not be an antichrist and a newborn daughter who cries a lot. She cries as much as we can see how many days she lives? and what was it about? Are there rats above, is it Joshua? Is his mother nuts? Is Joshua crazy? Is he just jealous of a newcomer to his family? Will it grow into Michael Myers? Or does he lead the family to the edge? I do not think so. Before, they were nuts, and no "so-called" action could make me believe otherwise. Unfortunately, no questions were answered, almost no open doors. I'm sure it could have been an idea, but because of Pete, give me something. Anything. There are many better movies to watch, in which there are no children. Joshua is more like the Mini-Me of the antichrist.
