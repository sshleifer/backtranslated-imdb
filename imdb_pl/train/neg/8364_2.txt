I see the boys preparing the budget for this film. "Let's see now, we spend 50% on getting Dirk Benidicta, because Battle Star Galactic and Team A were great. We spend 40% on performing the Demonic Costume, no matter that the Demon is to be discarnate in the script. And we spend the rest of the film making. " It was very bad and VERY uninspired .... Does anyone loved is present while watching (or brings a good book)
