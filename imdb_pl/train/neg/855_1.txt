Not the best movies that you can watch these days. I have read many reviews about Shining and I expected it to be very good. But this movie disappointed me. The sound and surroundings were good, but there was no history. There was not a single moment of fear. I was expecting this in a horror movie, but there was no horror without a thriller. The only scene in which I was scared was the scene of changing the chapter, showing "Wednesday." There are many fragments in the film. Most things remain unexplained and have nothing to do with anything. History does not tell us about women or other depicted scenes. It can be a good movie to watch in the 80's, but not in the 21st century.
