Yes, The Southern Star has a pretty unforgettable title track sung by this heavy crooner Matt Monro. This largely sets the tone for this bloated and rather boring function, staggeringly ill-equipped by George Segal and Ursula Behr as a brave couple looking for a large diamond. Add Harry Andrews (with a strange accent, no less) chasing the ostrich, tons of wild nature footage and poorly composed and matte photography of Raoul Coutard, and you end up with a completely uninteresting rumble through the jungles of Senegal.
