I watched this movie at a friend's house. I'm glad I did not waste my money to buy it. The video cover has a scene from the movie Capricorn One from 1975. The film begins with several clips with rocket launchers that are not related to a manned flight. Smokehouse Sibrela is a short video clip of astronauts preparing the video transmission. Edits your own reading instead of letting us listen to what the crew has to say. The video ends with the Zapruder movie show. His claims about radiation, shielding, star photography and others lead me to believe that he is very oblivious or has an ax that can crush NASA, astronauts or Americans in general. His education is bad, just like this movie.
