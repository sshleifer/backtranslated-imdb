Note: I will reveal the key part of the story, but if you watch a DVD cover or any promotional material, you already know. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be written by an eleven-year-old who is not very smart and was probably very tired when he wrote it. The writer does not know the difference between a chemical and an organism. <br /> <br /> Forget that the UN and the NSA seem to be running a program in Hungary. Forget that when those intelligence agents chase after someone whose usual touch kills you within a minute, they do not wear protective clothing (even gloves). These are the threads in the context of this film. In the scientific world in this story 2 + 2 = 6.34 and gravity goes sideways. <br /> <br /> The fact is that the people in this movie do not (with a few exceptions) behave as people behave. Almost every time a character responds to something, it's wrong. The love story (of course there is one) makes scenarios of soap operas seem to be Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> I can not believe we've wasted a free movie rental on this matter.
