This is one of the most boring horrors I've ever seen, because it is absolutely rich, John Carradine has a very limited time on the screen. All characters are boring, and the story is terrible, and besides, I saw two turns at the end, miles coming! A great setting and a terrifying home would certainly help if it was not so boring, and there is not a single figure from which you could root out, and I hope it reaches the lowest level of 100, because it deserves to be there be in my opinion. When John Carradine appears at the end, it's quite a good scene, but it's too late and the only other screen he has was in flashbacks. collapsed by Bee, as it was rather bloody. I got it in the DVD set Horror called Back From The Grave, and in my opinion everyone is really abusing, plus it's fortunate that it was included in the set that I bought, otherwise I would have thrown it out the window! It's one of the most boring horrors I've ever seen, because it's absolutely a terrible god, John Carradine has a very limited time on the screen, and I say avoid him like a plague! You do not want to go through torture. The direction is absolutely horrible! Carl Monson is absolutely horrible! Working here means that every thing looks cheap, wasting your potential to create a terrifying atmosphere and simply keeping the movie at an incredibly boring pace. Acting is just as bad. John Carradine is good at his stage, but otherwise he is not in the film, except for flashback scenes. (Ruled Carradine !!). Merry Anders is terribly worried about it, like Laura, because she did not convince me. Ivy Bethune is fine and is a little scary, but she has also abused her, but at the end she had a terrifying smile. The rest of the cast did not give me enough attention because I had a lot of trouble going through it, but they were all really bad. In general, avoid this, it is not worth the agony! BOMB with 5
