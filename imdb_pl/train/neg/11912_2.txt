The story of this film is very interesting and in general the story is not so bad ... but the details: writing, direction, continuity, tempo, action sequences, acrobatics and the use of CG all reduce and spoil the movie. br /> <br /> First, the action sequences. They are all quite uninteresting. Most are made up of someone who gets up and gets shot, not trying to run away, fight, avoid or anything else, even if they're in the world all the time. The sequences just seem bland for something produced in 2004. <br /> <br /> CG has very nicely rendered and animated effects, but because of their use they look cheap. <br /> <br /> Stimulation: everything happens too quickly. For example, "Elle" is training to fight in a few hours, and from the very beginning can perform reverse movements, etc. Why is it so acrobatic? None of this has been explained in the film. As Lilith, she would not have to be able to do reverse casts - maybe she could not because she had wings. <br /> <br /> Besides, we have sequences like a woman running through the car and getting up and just wandering into a deserted room with a sink and mirror, and then stabbing in the throat, all for no apparent reason, and without any viewer really caring about just being hit by a car (and then I felt the secondary effects of another, exploding car) ... "Are you okay?" he asks the driver "yes, it's all right" he says, bloody and disheveled. <br /> <br /> However, I watched it all because the introduction promised me that it would be interesting ... but in the end, the poor execution made me wish for something else: Blade, Vampire Hunter D, even this movie with the vampires in which Jackie Chan was comical because they managed to suspend my disbelief, but it only made me want to wake up the director, let me know the writer.
