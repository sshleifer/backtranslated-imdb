I do not like this movie very much. If you've read Puzo's books, or at least you've watched the first two films (especially the first one), you'll agree with me. <br /> <br /> Compared to Corleone's saga, the screenplay of this film is sometimes even funny, according to Puzo's novel. The characters and relations between them are distorted. The story ends nowhere, although it seems to go in a certain direction during the movie. <br /> <br /> It is understandable that in the 90s we should expect different times of the Corleone saga and we do not intend to find things as they were before. But on the other hand, I do not know why they had to copy some dialogues from other films, in contexts when they did not fit. Why it? It sounds like those poorly made sequels that just try to copy the features of the original movie. <br /> <br /> It will never be understood that Mario Puzo, Coppola and Al Pacino have joined forces to do this. The man who directed such songs as Apocalypse Now and Godfather must be forgiven for almost everything he does at the cinema until he dies. Like Al Pacino, because he is an actor. But Mario Puzo should not have written it. Why? He damaged all his previous work. What a pity, my friend. Puzo's novel "The Last Don" is a 90's tale about the crowd and is great. We can never say the same about the story of the Godfather III.
