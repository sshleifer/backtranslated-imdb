I saw the trailer of this movie and it looked great, so I went out and bought it. What a mistake, the acting is chaotic, the special effects (if you can call it that), they look like something that would not be out of place in the school performance. Some characters are so stupid in this movie that you will be lashing when they are on the screen, which unfortunately happens often. When it comes to history, forget about it. It's a warning, do not waste any money on this movie, it must be one of the worst things I've ever seen. If for any reason you like this movie, watch Troll 2, you'll probably like it too.
