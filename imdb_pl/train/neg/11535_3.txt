Gillian Anderson is an arrogant, driven, career woman who collects Danny Dyer's working class oikana for a fun night. After a silly accident in the countryside, they are brutally attacked. After returning to health and after an accidental meeting with one of the attackers, their thoughts turn to revenge ... <br /> <br /> I thought that "Straightheads" is terrible. Violent, brutal, misogynist and unpleasant. If I did not like this sentence, I would call "Straightheads" a nasty movie. Certainly it was a kind of movie that would not have any budget release directly on video in the dark days of the 80's. Honestly, I do not know how "Straightheads" got the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not prudish. I do not mind sex and violence in movies, but they must be married to a movie with a) a good story or b) good characteristics or c) preferably both. Straightheads did not have one. No progress in the story or characters and too much left unexplained and unspoken. Fortunately, "Straightheads" went nowhere fast. It was only 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> It's a pity, because here was the germ of an interesting movie, with a particularly interesting turn in the story in the last third. How often do I say it, but it could be good if it was done correctly. What a pity. I really like Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer, but they did not hide in this film. She is particularly undervalued (and is still particularly efficient). <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good British movie of revenge, rent or buy "Shane Meadows". It's a small masterpiece. Last weekend I should see his "This Is England". Cheese cheese ...
