I crouched throughout this movie. First of all, the idiotic story has little to do with Parson's own history. Hollywood has made an attempt to create a kind of comedy pursuit movie. Imagine "Englebert Sings Hendrix". <br /> <br /> Do not take anything about this movie to be exact. The name Parsons in the title and the theft of his body is simply used as a trampoline for a film with a low chase budget, a blatant attempt to get a few dollars from Parsons' legacy and his fan base. Gram's father had long since died in 1973, other global figures are fictitious, nothing of it has anything to do with Gram's life or death. <br /> <br /> If you're a Gram fan, I advise you not to see this movie. It is a pity that it is not. It saddens the view that something special is treated as such a disgusting feed. I would swear I heard Gram turning in his grave while the movie was playing. If you are not familiar with Gram's life and heritage, do not take anything in this movie as Gram. <br /> <br /> I can not say enough bad things about this movie. If Gram lived and saw this movie, he would have killed himself. On the other hand, maybe he would be afraid if he knew that this movie would have a result.
