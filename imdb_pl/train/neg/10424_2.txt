I should love this movie. the acting is very good, and Barbara Stanwyck is great, but the movie always seemed trivial to me. the film makes people from the working class look low and cheap. the fact that the daughter is ashamed of her mother and that the daughter does not rise above her, always worried me a bit. Barbara Stanwyck, when the mother adores her daughter, but the daughter gives up mothers, she loves to find happiness with her father's family. I wonder how many other people have seen this movie in this way. The acting behavior was very good and worth seeing. I really do not like the story. only personal preferences. Thank you
