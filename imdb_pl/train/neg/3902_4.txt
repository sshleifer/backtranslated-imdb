This is actually the god's adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. In comparison to the American version with Guinnet Paltrow, the script was written to remind the book as much as possible. But acting was terrible. Apart from Kate Beckinsale, which in my opinion was a real Emma image in the book, all the other actors tried too hard. Mark Strong was not the "gentleman" he was supposed to be. He was often rude and offensive, he had no feeling, and throughout the movie, you could not see his love for Emma at all. This had a terrible effect on Kate Beckinsale, who seemed to be trying to "fight off" her leading role as well as her partner. What's more, there was no chemistry between the entire cast. Hariett Smith, played by Samantha Morton, seemed to have no connection with Mr. Elton, played by Dominic Rowan. That's why she did not look as broken as she was presented in the book. Movie settings are also too weak. Costumes are all the more. I imagine that Emma Woodhouse dresses in a more fashionable and elegant way than she is here. The ending is too long. It's good that it reminds you of the ending of the book, but it's the deadly ending of the movie. And again, I do not see a sense of happiness in the face of Mr.Knightley. In conclusion, I believed that this adaptation is loyal to the book, but to poor actors. It seemed that the film was made without any budget. I would rather see a "lighter" version with Paltrow and Northam, even if it is obvious that it was created as a "hit" than watching these actors (except for good Olivia Williams and better Kate Beckinsale) ruin the entire script.
