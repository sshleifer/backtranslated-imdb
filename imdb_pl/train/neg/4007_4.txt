I hope that anyone who trained these losers on their accents was released. The only high points are a few supporters, 3 out of 5 of my favorites were killed by the end of the season (and one of them was a cat to put it in perspective). <br /> <br /> The whole story focuses on sex and nothing else. Sex with vampires, gay sex with gay vampires, gay sex with simple vampires, sex to get blood of a vampire, sex after drinking vampire blood, sex before vampires, vampire sex, sex without vampires, sex because we are afraid of vampires, sex, because we are angry with vampires, sex, because we just became a vampire, etc. <br /> <br /> Nothing against sex, it would just be nice if it was a bit more subtle when you were involved in the story. Maybe you have a plot and then put some sex into it. But they did not even bother to do it ... and Anna Paquin is a stunned whore. Or it sucks, or its character sucks, I do not know what. <br /> <br /> Another part of the story, which I think is highly unbelievable, why the 150-year-old vampire Bill, who seems to have his stuff, will be interested in someone like Sookie. He's still flying at him because of things he can not control. He leaves for two days, and she already decides that "he will not come back" and suddenly has feelings for a dog-man? Give me a break. She should be a 25-year-old woman, not a 14-year-old girl. People close to her die all over the world, and she has the brightest smile on her face because she just handed out her V-shaped card to some guy because he can not read his mind? As the protagonist of the story, I would hope that the program will do a little more to make it understandable and someone who will invest your interest, not someone you secretly expect to be killed or fall into a coma. I can not find anything about her character, which I like, and even the fact that she can read in her mind, is impressively uninspiring and not the least interesting. <br /> <br /> I will not waste time watching the season 2 come in June.
