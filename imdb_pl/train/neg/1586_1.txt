I am probably one of the few who read Stephen King's book, on which this film was based. After reading this excellent work, I could not wait to see her movie version. After watching the movie, I was completely disappointed. The only thing that connects this movie to the book is the title and name of the character. In the book, Schwarzenegger's character is placed in the quiz show. Survival is the main goal. But he is not in the arena. He loosened up in the city and has to escape from the game show (I think you would call them) villians who do not look like movie characters at all. This assumption caused high tension and suspension, and ended with a culmination. The movie was absolute trash. There was no film quality. I completely respect Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor, but he got lost with it.
