This could be the worst movie I've ever had. Inconsistency would be a compliment. Even the end did not make sense, but it was a huge relief that it finally ended. I looked at it with some kind of fatalistic fascination to see if it could get worse and it did. At the end of this mess I regretted that none of the characters survived and did not feel too charitable towards the actors. Even waiting on the abandoned railway platform beats this mess. Apparently I did not answer enough to fill my prescribed ten lines, so risking the excess, I will say it again. This movie is zero and it would be less if I had a word for even lower scores. Or maybe minus zero?
