May contain any spoilers (not that anything in this movie was new or even slightly surprised you on this point) <br /> <br /> Why does Disney feel the need to recycle everything they have ever done in oblivion? Sure, it's cheaper for them, but after a while you would not think that the overall quality and the way people think about them will go down. House Of Villains is a wicked show of cartoon crossovers that make no sense at all. Some signs of complete disregard for previous films are: Voices do not even match, and Iago is angry again (Since when?!) I know that these films are aimed directly at children, but there was a time when everyone could enjoy Disney movies. Even the musical number of the film (which for years was a Disney specialty) stank. I would not recommend this film to anyone even very young. All I can do is that if more of the same caliber films are released, it's only a matter of time before any small animation studio surpasses Disney in terms of quality.
