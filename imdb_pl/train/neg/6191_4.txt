I watched this movie, along with every other adaptation I could get - including the viewing of plays - as part of the preparation for some research. Cinematography is very moving, just like music. Unfortunately, all life has been removed from history. I've never seen such a terrible image of Mr. Rochester. All his most basic features have disappeared. Where is his joke? Where is his passion? Scott Rochester is more like a Rochester film, St.John, than a character from a novel. In fact, the actor playing in this adaptation in St.John played a passionate saint. I have no idea what they were thinking about. I would like to give this movie a slightly higher voice based on great music and photos, but honestly I can not stand this movie for too long because of George C. Scott's performance.
