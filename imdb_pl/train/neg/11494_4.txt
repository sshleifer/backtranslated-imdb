Richard Dix is ​​a big, not very nice industrialist who almost worked himself to death. If he manages to spend the holidays that doctors offer him, can he find happiness in the last months of his life? Well, it will probably be better if he neglects the VOICE OF THE STARS. <br /> <br /> This entry directed by William Castle has some great moments (introduction and presentation of Richard Dix's life through the chronicle a la Citizen Kane) and several intriguing plots in recent drums. Dix's performance is generally quite good. But unfortunately, it just does not work because you do not buy characters that behave the way they do. The film also moves from the dark (and fascinating beginning) to the almost happy movie from the 1930s, such as the middle section (full of nice urban ethnic types who do not mind that they are not rich) and back to the complicated story noir it takes about 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> This is a decent movie - worth seeing - but it took a bit more time to set up a few characters and a female woman capable of meeting the demands of her role.
