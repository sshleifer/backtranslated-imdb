Although many people here praise this movie, I have to warn you. There is no logic. I think that Basinger does a decent job in acting, but you can not make a thriller if there is a great lack of realism. <br /> <br /> This scene shows a good picture of the movie: while Basinger, chased by murderous thugs, decides to sit down and look at the picture he finds from his pocket. The image comes from her daughter and sounds "we love you mommy". Who does this? What is eff? And believe me when I say it's not as stupid as the other scenes in the movie. Someone stated that it is a "hidden gem". Well, I must definitely disagree, this movie has been hidden for some reason. And not a jewel. Oh, and please, I do not even want to comment on the red set of tools. It hurts my brain: D Usually, the lack of logic does not bother me if it is in small quantities, but this movie is basically possible only because of the lack of logic. Still, I give him 4, because even though he is embarrassingly defective in logic, he has a certain mood that has kept me to the end. <br /> <br /> So if you decide to watch it, you know you have been warned.
