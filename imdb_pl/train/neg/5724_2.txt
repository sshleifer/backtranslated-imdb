I agree with the last reviewer that this film had horrible acting. Yes, there was a lot of blood and nakedness. But it was overshadowed by a slow, meaningless storyline and stupid ending. Where was filmed anyway: Canadian Chinatown or Hong Kong? The hostel was a much better movie and I recommend seeing it. The technical irritation I had with the DVD is that if you turn off the Spanish subtitles, they will come back after a few scenes, and then you'll have to go back to the main menu and turn them off again. Do not waste time on deleted scenes because there is no sound and it looks like a tourist material.
