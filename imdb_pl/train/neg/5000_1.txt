This is probably the worst excuse for TV shows because, oh, I do not know WHAT IT WORKS NOW? NOTHING has never happened in this funny "series". Even if they are mostly made by Britney and Kevin, you do not get any good details about their personal lives. It's mostly their stupid, playful little talk and behaving like white garbage. Look, I love Britney music just like the next kid, but this show is just a clean filler for a Britney-addicted nation so that they'll be watching her nail clip (yes, it could be a real episode). Thank God, these two things fell apart because together they were GREAT Boring. This program is TOXIC!
