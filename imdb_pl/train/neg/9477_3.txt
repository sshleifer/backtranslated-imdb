It must have been one of the most ugly wrestlemanias in history and is only saved for 2 games. Hardcore fight between Edge and Mick Foley, as well as Vince Mcmahon against Shaun Michaels. The main event between Price and Triple H was a complete waste and to be honest I almost fell asleep, it was so out of action, the coffin match was not worth Undertaker, and the match between Boogie Man and Booker T was a complete joke. If you're really a huge fan of WWE and missed the beginnings of WWF and Wrestlemanias 17 and 19, you'll probably love it. But I discovered that this Wrestlemania leaves much to be desired.
