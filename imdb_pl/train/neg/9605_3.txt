This Italian film from the 70s is NOT even in the class of Dog Soldiers, The Howling, and even this horrible American werewolf in Paris, BUT ... it's nice to watch. I'm talking about watching the main actress, the stunning blonde who runs the amok in her birthday suit. We're talking about graphics, total nudity ... it's obvious she's a real blonde ... humma humma humma !! History is hoot, SFX is childish, and acting (mostly) stinks. The only salutary value of this film is everything (and there are MANY) scenes of nudity and sex. Tamed by HBO standards, it's still fun to see when you're out of Saturday night. OK ... THIS IS A SPOILER ... There is no werewolf (except for the scene opening the hero's ancestor (??). The girl imagines that he is a werewolf ... in other words, a clinical lycanthrope.
