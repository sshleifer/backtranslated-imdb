Wow! I remember so many horrible movies that loosely circled around high school since the early 1980s. They usually had an incredibly tense storyline and a lot of 27-year-old actors pretending to be students. When I watched this movie, I felt a bit of nostalgia about growing up in the 80's. But then I find out that this movie was made in 1989? Say what! Well, the nostalgia factor ends right there, it's just bad. The plot prepares the city to close the high school and threatens to transport all students to high schools in the city center. It's weird because the students of this school are both rich and rich. In fact, the main character lives in the residence. You wonder how they can not find money to keep this school alive or have they ever heard about real estate taxes. Oh, but here's the kicker. The school board says they'll keep the school alive if the students can collect $ 200,000. So seniors do it. Hmmm, you collect $ 200,000, but instead of saving for college, are you spending it on saving a high school where you are a senior? And why will they close the overcrowded school thoroughly before the end of the year? And ... ahh forget, this movie was stupid and made in 1989!?
