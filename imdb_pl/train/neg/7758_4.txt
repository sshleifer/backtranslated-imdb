the film had a lot of blood in it, when the sabretooth attack also fell in love with him, when this guy and the women had a good time, and then the saber attacked the women and ate the stomach and took out the liver. it was the best and walking on the forepaws with 1ton, it's fun to make this movie better and less telling if you know what I mean and also please, please, the people who made the movie do not make any movie that the end of this movie was terribly lively sabretooth and killed that women in the end this movie reminds me of injuries ending whenever there is 1 enemy! OK, damn, this movie sucks, I can not believe it, I loved it when my lilac brother got mad because of stomach and blood attacks.
