I'm watching bad movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is not good enough to be a bad movie. Not a bit of humor or a bit of talent all the time. <br /> <br /> I'm LAZY. <br /> <br /> I usually see a bad movie and a curse. It was so bad, actually I made a review to try and save others from the completely boring mess I was victimized. <br /> <br /> I am splashing my copy of this movie. <br /> <br /> It's too lame to use a clean room. Such boring. Watch "Bloodsucking Freaks" or "Shock, shock, shock" to get absolute shit that has some advantage as entertainment. This sludge looks awful, it's awful, and whoever did it should feel awful.
