One of the worst that has ever been produced. The plot looks as follows. Drive through jungle-looking areas for about 10 minutes. Let him go somewhere and take off his clothes. Go through the jungle yet. Give another excuse to undress. Return to the jungle. Look! There is a guy who looks like Tarzan! Strip, Bo - strip. Kill safari people. A guy who looks like Tarzan has a fight scene. He saves Bo. Belts. Start credits. Start credits, start.
