I wasted my time and gave this exhibition a chance. It must be one of the worst new programs. If they gave the show awards that suck in TEN, put the category. Acting is weak and the plot is made up. Now the dinosaurs were a bit strange, but at least it was fun. This show lasted three seasons and was finally scraped. This new program, based on advertising from insurance companies, is not funny and really has nothing to do with it. Probably the original ads and the number of times that were and still are repeated is wrong with this show. It just came to television and we are already tired of seeing the figure of a "caveman".
