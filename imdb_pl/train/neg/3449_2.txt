Fortunately, there is no video of this would-be western who would be a vehicle for Big Frank at a time when his career was deteriorating. The story of a weasel who lives on the reputation of his big brother, who escapes from the city by bad guys, only to return to urban rallies with new open courage, had to be written by the background writer. In total, this show stinks. History is basically boring, ill-conceived and so naive that it can offend your intelligence. I have to move away from another reviewer who said "... underestimated ..." The critics have slammed him in this time and deservedly so. You will have to catch him at the last concert if you are late and have insomnia. But if you can sit through it, you have more fortitude than most of my friends.
