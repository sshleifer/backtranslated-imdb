I am a big fan of the series of comics, but this movie fell far below my expectations. I was expecting Heavy Metal 2000 to fit in ... slow motion, bad dialogue, lots of blood ..... but it was worse than anything I could have imagined. <br /> <br /> The plot is almost the same as in the comic book, but the good points on it end. The characters have no energy or spirit that caught my attention in a series of comics. The film covers only a small part of the comic, and the part used is more slow and boring than the later parts. The film focuses on minor events, not on the interesting story of the comic. <br /> <br /> With the right people working on this project, it could have been amazing. Unfortunately, it was not like that, so now there is another scary movie that few will see and even less will love. My copy will surely collect dust for years until I finally throw it away.
