Lifetime did it again. Can we say stupid? I could not wait for it to end. The plot was pointless. Acting was terrible! Especially teenagers. History has been played thousands of times! Are we desperate to give actors a job? The announcements were attractive, and I was really looking for a good thriller. After some time a good movie appears, but it is not one of them. While no one has anything else to do, I would avoid it at all costs. It was a waste of two hours of my life. Can I recover them? I would prefer to scrape my face against a brick wall for two hours, then soak it in peroxide. That would be more fun.
