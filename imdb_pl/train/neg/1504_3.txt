I am a big fan of the Spaghetti Western genre, and I usually like the cheap ones too. The infamous director Demofilo Fidani is rightly known for the cheapest, the funniest and, well, the worst contribution to this genre. Fidani's films were usually very poor, and because his talent was quite limited, he usually tried to sell movies, adding to the titles the famous western names of spaghetti, such as "Django" from "Sartana". In the special case of "Gi첫 La Testa ... Hombre" from 1971, he took the title "Gi첫 La Testa" Sergio Leone (aka "Duck You Sucker") and added "Hombre". The film can be found under various titles ("Fistful Of Death", "Western Story" ...), I personally bought it under the name "Adios Companeros", which is shared with another Fidani movie with almost the same cast, "Per Una Bara Piena Di Dollari ", which is also entitled" Adios Companeros "in the German language version. <br /> <br /> The plot is rather weak, basically follows a guy named Macho Callaghan (Jeff Cameron) and his involvement in rival lawless gangs by Butch Cassidy (Jack Betts) and Ironhead (Gordon Mitchell ). <br /> <br /> The main performance of Jeff Cameron is not very convincing. I do not think Jacek Betts is very good as "Butch Cassidy". The legend of B Gordon Mitchell's movie is always worth trying, and although he was probably not a very good actor, I always considered his performances in the Spaghetti Westerns quite funny and original, and he actually saved some of Fidani's films (such as the rather bad "Django and Sartana .. Showdown in the West "). <br /> <br /> There is one very funny and original thing in "Gi첫 La Testa ... Hombre" - the great Klaus Kinski plays the priest! I could imagine Kinski in any role, but before I saw this movie, I would never have guessed that someone would throw him at the priest. Kinski is great once again, although he has little time on the screen, and one scene where he breaks off the fight is probably the only good scene in it. Another interesting thing about this movie is that the legendary director and the fierce king, Joe D'Amato, took pictures. <br /> <br /> "Gi첫 La Testa ... Hombre" is a cheap, bad movie, but it still has some fun moments. Being an enthusiast of Western Spaghetti, it was nice to see me, but if you're not, it's not important, this movie, or just watch it to see Kinsky playing the priest. 3/10
