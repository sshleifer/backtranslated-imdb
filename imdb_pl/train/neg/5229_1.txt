boring things that we have here. His 5 minute shorts are better than this. I know why? because there is only 5 minutes, not 91 minutes or how long it lasts. <br /> <br /> The story is a bit ... eh ... the last half hour is all right the rest is boring and it's not fun = (I was hoping the trailer made it look funny, but the pace of this movie is quite slow and unfortunately not funny, just a boring klaymen falls in on himself and tries to make us laugh .. does not work. <br /> <br /> Maybe next time knox. <br /> <br /> Maybe re-cutting this movie and adding better scenes would result in many healings, but not good at the moment.
