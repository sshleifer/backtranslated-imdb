I have to admit that I caught it a few times on the USA network. There is something about the stupidity of this movement that makes me want to watch it when it's on. Yes, you're right about lower-level acting, a plot that can only be seven years old, etc. But I can not refrain from sympathy with some actors. On the other hand, several of these actors have signed up for an even more cruel sequel.
