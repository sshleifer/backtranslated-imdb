If you've ever seen Brian Avenet-Bradley's movie and compared it to the feedback it gets on IMDb, you know that most of the comments and votes are fake. TRUST ME: you will be bored! People in the production team write their opinion (sometimes they even admit it). But this is not enough: they also constantly click "no" when a negative comment on the film appears. Therefore, negative critics are always placed behind mesmerizing ones. <br /> <br /> The film itself is bad, bad, bad: bad acting, bad lighting, bad script, bad ending. Believe me now! If not, you will believe me later! <br /> <br /> Brian Avenet-Bradley may be a good businessman. Otherwise, it can not be explained that he finds people who continue to finance his films. (Okay, they're cheap, but still.) But being a creative person is a complete failure.
