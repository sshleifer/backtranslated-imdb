The average original Sci-Fi Channel image. A little squirmish, but not much. Submarine nuclear U.S.S. Jimmy Carter is on a mission deep beneath the thick icy ice near the North Pole, when he is attacked by gigantic super-charged electric eels. A crew member (Simmone Jade Mackinnon) thinks that she has developed a way to communicate with monsters, but there are no bigger chances for unclear reasons. Among the crew members are also David Keith, Mark Sheppard and Sean Whalen. This movie could be a bit better if eels / monsters were not so cartoonish.
