He falls into the film category "Too ridiculous in the sections of dialogue and execution that should be taken seriously." While Shriek If You Know What I Did On Last Friday, the thirteenth or My Boyfriend's Back, know that they are evil, Scarecrow does not. Evil Dead has set such a high standard of horror comedy on the budget genre that Scarecrow is simply out of place. <br /> <br /> Suspicions of inexperience are immediately in play because there are no signs of noise or vibration in the fuselage and cockpit of the aircraft. Repetitive display of pictures of 3 men just screams about the story, but nothing comes. Although men are, of course, scarecrows, there is no explanation. <br /> <br /> Knowing that this movie is too serious because its good can make you smile. I do not remember if Joe Bob Briggs ever watched Scarecrows, but I believe he would not bend so low. However, with an IMDb rating above 6, many people do not agree.
