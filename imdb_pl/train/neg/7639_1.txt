I saw this movie at the NY Gay & Lesbian Film Festival and thought it was pretty bad. The first and most distracting was the way most of them were shot; that is, a lot of slowed pace and overly artistic close-ups that seemed to make no sense - neither history nor aesthetics - beyond showing the operator's skills (which I think was also a director). This film seemed to be invented by a pretentious filmmaker. The main actor (Sam Levine) was certainly very sweet, but at best he was an average actor; and the rest of the cast was ranging from bad to worse. The story itself was mostly annoyingly predictable. I must admit that most of the audience liked the movie; still laughing and sighing, but I did not like it.
