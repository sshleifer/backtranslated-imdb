Man, what a scam! Not because it was not good (because I did not expect anything from him), but because I was misled by a DVD sleeve that unknowingly paraded its "stars" as Stuart Whitman, Stella Stevens and Tony Bill. Indeed, their names did not appear in the first films, much less in the rest !! As it turned out, the only film that connects these three actors together, is equally obscure LAS VEGAS LADY (1975) ?? but what does this have to do with the MONSTER OF THE NATIONAL LAKE, is it anyone? <br /> <br /> Still, because I paid $ 1.50 for rent and was in the mood for a movie about monsters, I decided to watch the movie regardless of it, and it stinks! Apart from the fact that he had a cast without a name and an anonymous crew, the air was clearly visible from a distance, and the most I could do about it was to laugh at JAWS pretensions and, deliberately, with a stubborn moron of two morons who often argue with a stunned local sheriff. Creation itself? plesiosaur, or half dinosaur / half-fish ?? it is imperfectly realized (naturally), but, as in the case of THE GIANT CLAW (1957), which I just saw, it did not seem to bother the filmmakers because they are as much of it as they can, especially in the second half the movie!
