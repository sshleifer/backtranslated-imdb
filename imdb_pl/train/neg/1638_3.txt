I was looking forward to meeting Amanda Peet in another good role after the recent "The Whole Nine Yards" loan - by the way, certainly worth a loan, but that was not it. <br /> <br /> I remember that the trailer "Whipped" was a bit funny, and the conspiracy of three exaggerated 20-year-old New Yorkers, which everyone came up with and manipulated by the charming Mrs. Peet, was worth the shot. One afternoon, I convinced my two friends to come and see this movie with me. This review is my penance. <br /> <br /> In the first act we have three main studs telling about their conquests in the restaurant. What should be fun, at least to say, is rather pathetic. Was there any salutary trait for the three men and their encounters that we should get out of this? <br /> <br /> [And although I do not mind films that are cheerfully vulgar, I wondered why no one in the restaurant turned around when the studs were talking loudly about sexual and scatalogical details. They do it every week in the same restaurant? You might think someone is complaining. Oh, wait, I forgot: two other guests are noticing in one scene. But this is just a configuration on the punchline. Everyone else in the restaurant is deaf.] <br /> <br /> The second act has three studs, all of which fall on Me, and then develop the rot of the brain without asking each other or what really happens between them . . And I kept asking myself, how do studs behave as they once did, what redeeming qualities he sees in them, to hold on to them for more than one date? Does it start with brain rot? I counted on the fact that the figure of Eric, a married buddy, would become more than just an irritating training bag in this act. His role is to give advice on marriage. But why do they even try to talk to him when they will not talk to each other? And his advice? Sheeesh! <br /> <br /> The third act solves the conspiracy, but at that time I looked at my watch. My friends told me that they are still waiting for something really funny and I had to agree. The scene that explains everything was sufficient and all questions and mysterious bits of dialogue throughout the film were explained, but we just checked them from the list. ("Oh, good, that's why Brad did it, and Jonathan says it and ...") <br /> <br /> What we did was from the stupidity of the story, rather than something funny. Even the credit dumps were not very fun. In the end, there was nothing left but a desire to warn people about this film. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3
