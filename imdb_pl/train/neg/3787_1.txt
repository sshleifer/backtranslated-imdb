I must be the one guy in America who did not like this movie. I guess it was not my style, or something like that, I just can not see what's fascinating about it, it was * hardly fun, let alone one of the greatest achievements in cinema history. <br /> <br /> It's about a guy who came from nothing and becomes a drug lord. Quite a simple way to describe the whole movie and this is exactly my feeling about the whole movie. In contrast to what many people think, just because the film deals with mafia / drug trafficking / criminal groups, does not automatically make it a great movie, do not forget about good story telling.
