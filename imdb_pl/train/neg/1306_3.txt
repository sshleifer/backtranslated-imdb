(aka: DEMONS III) <br /> <br /> Made for Italian television, although filmed in English and never to be a continuation of earlier DEMONS movies. He was supposed to be simply entitled THE OGRE, and thus director Lamberto Bava released him. <br /> <br /> The American family rents an Italian villa for the summer. The woman (Virginia Bryant) has a recurring dream of herself as a little girl going down to the old wine cellar of this villa and encountering this cocoon-like structure hanging from the ceiling. It is lit and covered with cobwebs and has spider legs or insects hanging from it. I drip what looks like green paint. <br /> <br /> Of course, my husband does not believe it. The villa is just old and creaks and makes strange noises in the middle of the night, and she should just ignore her. <br /> <br /> But then OGRE appears in something like XVI costume. Centaurs looks like a wolf's head attached to him and he is attracted by the smell of orchid. <br /> <br /> The films are not really bad and at least the dialogue is half intelligent, without the funny, awkward turns they will bring. There is no real blood except some skeletons rotting in a basement pond that really looks like the bottom of a modern pool. OGRE itself simply disappears after being driven by the family Jeep Cherokee. <br /> <br /> The copy of the Shriek DVD I watched was defective, and the image was black for a few seconds about a half hour in the movie. Extras include a short interview with Lamberto Bava, in which he explains that it was not a sequel etc. etc. Etc ... along with several trailers for other releases of Shriek DVD. These are quite standard things. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 <br /> <br />
