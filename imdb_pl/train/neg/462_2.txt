It must end as one of the worst films of all time. Awful acting, horrible scenario ... and those were good sides! One certainly miss you! Jokes, if you could call them that, were so predictable that they were pathetic. Pamela Anderson is still based on her body to diminish the fact that her acting is just as artistic! I sat ready to give him a chance, hoping it would improve, which, unfortunately, no! If it was a choice between this and the book, I suggest that you read it well! I like Denise Richards, that's why I gave this film a chance, but why did she let his movie be cast in this movie, it's beyond me!
