I often feel like Scrooge, slamming videos that other people are raving about - or writing a review to counterbalance an unreasonable rave. I think that this film is almost impossible to watch, and for me it was unusual to quickly scroll through not only boring, stereotypical dialogue, but even boring, stereotypical music numbers. Any originality exists in this film - an unusual home setting for a musical, a lot of fantasy, some animation - is more than balanced by a script that has neither a bit of a joke nor an inspiring story development. Individually June Haver and Dan Dailey seem to be nice people, but they can not wear a movie as a band. Neither is he really charismatic, nor does he have big sex appeal. They are both bland. I like Billy Gray, but his character is quite good. For me the best part of the movie are the beautiful June Haver costumes and a wonderful body.
