Dukes of Hazzard is a good achievement? a movie worth $ 53 million, which is worse than any episode from a 25-year television program sold down. The plot is useful enough, but thoughtless play is rare, and casting is quite awful: Johnny Knoxville is more of a passenger than a hero, M.C. Sheriff Sheriff is a nondescript bandit, Enos tormenting Michael Weston, apparently perfectly planted Willie Nelson seems to wait for a check and waiting for Burt Reynolds, who got stuck in some purgatory, where he is doomed to survive old movies as a player, is an interesting choice for Boss Hogg but he has one good moment with a Hexler and one hundred dollar bill. Do you know that the movie is in trouble when Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson are the most charismatic presenters? But worse than the script or casting is hopelessly the direction of Jay Chandrasekhar: seemingly born without the concept of comical timing, unable to do more than the basic two shots and seemingly unaware of how to shoot a car chase, let alone a few decent stunts in the movie, it seems be determined to suck up any signs of life from the film before they materialize. There are several neat, postmodern moments that revolve around the Confederacy flag and Daisy's stereotypical role in each episode, but no movie that makes you pine at a time when Hal Needham managed this kind of thing (and wrong), can be good thing.
