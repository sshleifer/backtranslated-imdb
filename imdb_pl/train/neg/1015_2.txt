Pathetic ... worse than a bad television movie. I can not believe that Spacey and Freeman were in this movement. For some reason, the character of Morgan Freeman constantly talks about "pussy" and talks about the girl boy NSync. Morgan Freeman, calling women a "pussy," is just awkward ... What the hell were the people who thought about this movie? Too many plot lines combined with horrible action, confusing camera angles, bad script and cheap background music meant that the movie was absolutely unbearable. <br /> <br /> I rented this flop with low expectations .... but. ... well ... it really sucks.
