The third proper film by Guy Richi (not counting the horrible "Swept Away" is a complex action thriller related to gambling, gangsters and chess.) Fans of Richi's previous efforts probably hate Revolver as much as I do, with his twists and turns). Richie became Jason Statham playing Jake, a freshly released ex-girlfriend who is supposed to take revenge on the ridiculously named Dorothy Mach (excellent OTT Ray Liotta), but instead gets entangled in several other flaws, one of which is Andre 3000 from rap Outkast), which throws him and us audiences, many red herrings throughout the film, which become extremely boring. The climax of this mess in the film is a piece in the restaurant, where the dialogue turns down in favor of the well-shot, slow shooting in Sonata Moonlight Beethoven. In total, Revolver is a flawed job, not entirely terrible, but far from Richie. it's a homework task to be assessed "must try harder!"
