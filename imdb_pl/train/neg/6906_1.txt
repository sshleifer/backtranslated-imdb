This film not only has a poor storyline, poor direction and terrible acting, but it opens up a completely new meaning to racism. <br /> <br /> In this movie "White" chicks are whores, "white" boys or they are wana-gangsters and are successful (so again) "White" businessmen are repulsive shit toilets. <br /> <br /> I just wonder what would happen if I did exactly the same movie with exactly the same script story, but I did it about the Caucasus. "Dude, it's good to finally see that you've stopped meeting these black chicks." <br /> <br /> It seems that no one notices this, but watch this movie again and vomit, as they introduced the new Zealand "white boys". Suddenly, his white people, who are the main cause of gang aggression, and whores for a quick explosion. Only girls from Samoa have a heart, there is no such thing as a white girl without a slut. <br /> <br /> I'm disgusted that they could not make this movie without giving the New Zealand community a repulsive profile. If you think I'm generalizing, watch this video and see what you're doing with the "white boys". Just because Samoans actually call us "white boys" does not mean that it is funny. If I said hey, black boy, I'll lose my teeth. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. Do not waste your money. Do not be a racist.
