The spectacle echoed with a "gurgling" sound effect that kept me awake. A very soothing show. I think I could sleep in those parts where there was danger or danger. I also heard that some shots for the sponge divers were shot in Tarpon Springs, Florida. I assume Lloyd Bridges has never dived there. I only remember performances in replays, and although this was never an exciting place, we invented our own underwater episodes in the lake at my grandma's house ... imagining the echoes of gurgling sounds and stories about our adventures. I thought "Flipper" has a better undersea action. Of course, he had an advantage in his natural environment.
