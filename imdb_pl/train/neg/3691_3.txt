First of all, I'm not a big fan of Rajnikanta, but Baba was a great disappointment. Between the terrible story, the action and songs were only mediocre. The plot becomes very instructive. Instead of running for an office such as NTR or MGR, Rajni almost seemed to be another great Tamil Nadu guru. My wife tells me that Rajni swore to make more movies since the movie came out! <br /> <br /> At first we were lucky that we bought Babu (older than Sivajiganeshana) by accident, trying to buy this movie .... it was a great movie that compensated the purchase of this bag ... except that Baba looks even worse in comparison! <br /> <br /> Bryan
