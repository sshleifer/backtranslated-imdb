Like last year, I could not change the whole thing. Okay, so Chris Rock as the host was a good choice because it was unclear. Or rather from the whole amount packed into the theater, at least he was not in the top ten most boring. On the other hand, many presenters were in this coveted Top 10. I did not know that everything was done by autocue (although I knew it was a script), but it was really awful to see these supposedly good actors unable to put expression, they look away from the clues and stumble over simple words (Natalie Portman - if there is no director, she left). The night of fancy dresses and boring speeches was long and arduous, Beyonce Knowles pledged some good songs and there were very few speeches and clips of decent acceptance. Adam Sandler wins the prize for the worst presenter. <br /> <br /> For help in writing this review, I would like to thank my mother, my dad, my lawyers and my pedicurist for everything that they believe in me that I have a high metabolism and of course I have not starved for a month. I will not cry ... thank you.
