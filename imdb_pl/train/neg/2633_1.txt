I saw the trailer of the movie several times in the theater and I was excited. He looked like a classic action thriller, like the ones from the 90s. I also remembered Fugitive movies, cat and mouse chase between Douglas and Sutherland. However, The Sentinel is the most unforgettable action thriller of all time. As I can see, many people claim that it is a TV movie. Not exactly. First of all, there are much better TV movies in this genre. Secondly, television films can sometimes be very funny, but this movie is the exact opposite of fun. It is not at all visually stylish and important, the tone of the film is unattractive. This is not an action movie, there are two action scenes consisting of a chase and a clash. They are not big action scenes, but the worse is that these action scenes are very tasteless, like the whole movie. Douglas and Bassinger's romance was very unnecessary. In addition, the plot of the assassination of the president is also the most banal tale in this genre, but they insist on it. And this is not a movie with a cat and mouse, as it should be. Although Douglas is already very old, he still has the potential to act in the action thriller. In the film, Michael Douglas can not be Tommy Lee Jones, for example. Sutherland is also a bad choice because you feel like you are watching Jack Bauer and somehow his character is one of the reasons why the film resembles a TV movie, Eva Longoria Parker is a strange choice, of course it is too passive or straightforward in this film because it is actress of a soap opera. The film was not funny for me even for a second, so I could not stand it for a moment.
