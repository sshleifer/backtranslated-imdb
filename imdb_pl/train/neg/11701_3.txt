Another example of why Stepehn King's books should not be converted into films. (Even Carrie, one of the best, is ruined in the adaptation of the book to the screen.) The foundation of the story focuses on a fat lawyer, always on a diet that "accidentally" kills the old Gypsy. In court, with the help of the judge and the local police commander, he gets off, although the accident was a kind of blame because he did not pay attention to the driver. The father of the late gypsy woman throws a curse on 3, and our main character, Billy (lawyer), is getting thinner by the day. Although the film was kept in the book, for the most part and has the typical ending of the king, the acting was stiff and I felt compelled. We went from one scene to another without anything in between, something like reading acts in art. The king himself made an episodic scene in the film (something like Dave Barry), which confirms my belief that the authors should only remain like this: the authors. Leave the actors to play. Not that anyone in this movie was so great. I saw the main characters in the movies, where they were much better.
