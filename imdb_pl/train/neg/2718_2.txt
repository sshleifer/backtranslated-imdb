It's the least frightening movie I've ever seen. As the blob manages to eat everyone, it is the greatest mystery of the film. The drop moves so slowly that o.a.p in the zimmerframe can get rid of it. Blob has a good bit of luck, meeting a typical horror woman who, instead of running away, stands for half an hour to be eaten. If you have not seen this movie, I advise you, its too funny to take it seriously.
