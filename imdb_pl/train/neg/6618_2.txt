GENERAL PERFORMANCE: - Finally, the long waiting AAG hits the screens. Unfortunately, he could not set a progressive fire in the audience. The first best thing to tell about the movie is the idea of ​​transforming a powerful SHOLAY. And Varma made a good choice, changing the overall background of the film. If he repeats the same Ramghad background, people will say again that there is nothing new in it. The other background is valuable, but the way he presented it is not worthy. From the beginning of his career at SIVA in Telugu, he used the same lighting and background. Seriously, I do not know if this guy Varma thinks about lighting or not, or there is no lighting technique other than Gordon Willis GODFATHER. It's all DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH. Why did some body use so many Dutch angles and extreme close-ups !!!!!!! The division of the shot is poor. Characters could not carry emotions, performances do not match them, Storytelling is worse, The background is really terrible. <br /> <br /> Babban: - Amitabhz was superior to his work. VARMA has produced great villains such as Bikumatre, Bhavtakur Das, Mallik Bhai, but this time he failed to carve the best heroes of Hindi Cinema. There is no comparison between Gabbara and Babban. Babban is more psychotic than a villain, but he has a gentle angle for his brother (This is a present in this movie). Amitabhz's performance is not its hallmark. His appearance is pathetic. The nose scar symbolizes the forgotten black characters of the black and white cinema. What they have ever worked on in Babban has failed. Babban has no comparison with Gabbara. <br /> <br /> Narsimha: - The first thing in this form is not putting the audience in uncertainty around his hands. If he did, it would be like teaching ABCD to the holder of a bachelor's degree. It's good that he opened the secret early. But retrospection is pathetic. Varma could not use a great actor, such as Mohanlal, for his sign. <br /> <br /> Durga: - The only character with improvement. This character has been improved with satisfactory changes and has been used according to the plot. <br /> <br /> Hero, Raj, Ghunguroo: - No body disturbs or at least does not take into account these figures. The total failure of the film begins when the director can not work on a close friendship between our heroes. These characters have nothing to do with this movie. <br /> <br /> RAMGOPALVARMA: - Its quality is degrading, diminishing. AAG can be treated as a C-class film. Sholay is a revenge fire, a city problem, which means true friendship and a highly valued nuisance and fun Dharmendry. AAG never carried emotions with his characters. Story telling is too weak not to arouse sympathy for the characters in the audience. Do not compare AAG with Sholay, you still will not like it. <br /> <br /> If you dare to watch this movie. You will be burnt alive in RAMGOPAL VARMA KI AAG
