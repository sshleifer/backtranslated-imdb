I rented it because the second segment survived me as a small child. One morning I went downstairs, started watching HBO, and the Raft (segment 2) scared me well. This time I still liked The Raft, although I could not say whether it was nostalgic or if it was good. The other two segments were complete. I can not believe that the producer will pay for this trash somewhere. Everything that I achieved by watching this ruined one more childhood memory. Creepshow 2 will now join Rad on my list of contaminated childhood classics. 4/10
