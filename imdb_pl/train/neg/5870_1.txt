I did not like this movie at all! First of all, I do not know why, but everyone here says that the art of Clémence Poésy is perfect, which I think is completely wrong! It's not like Natasha: another look, a different character ... What's worse, she is a very inexperienced actress and therefore she was unable to play this role! Completely disfigured the heroine! It was really disgusting to watch her play! In my opinion, it would be much better to give this role to the Russian actress, because it would be much easier for her to understand the Russian soul for the Russian. Unfortunately, Kutuzow looked like a drunk man who had not shaved for two weeks and defeated the battle in which he lost his eye ... (Thank God, in this movie there are actors who were amazing! Alessio Boni coped very well with this task! I was pleasantly surprised! He is one of the few people who read a book, which is very important for the arts, I also liked the art of our Russian actors, it was really great to watch them.) The only thing I liked about this job is the beautiful views and amazing dresses! My advice is to read the book and understand the true meaning, the purpose with which Leon Tolstoy wrote this masterpiece, and maybe the realization of the whole idea of ​​the book ... 1 of 10
