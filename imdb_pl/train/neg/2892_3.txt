The naked body of Ursula Andress is one of those things that make you believe in God. The other two women (especially the one who plays the maid) also have great bodies. Why, then, a higher degree that I can give a film of such quality and quantity of nakedness only 3 out of 10? Because to get to Ursula's incredible body, we have to sit in a movie which is otherwise unpleasant and boring (remember that I watched the full version of 101-minute, not 78-minute American, which probably cuts out a lot of foreign material). In the typical Italian comedy tradition, most of the heroes are exaggerated caricatures (an army freak, a Latin lover, a permanent drunkard, a naive maid) that are not funny, simply taken over. Last word: look at it, but keep your finger on the fast scroll button, you'll need it. (*)
