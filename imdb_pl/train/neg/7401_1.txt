* Sigh * Leave us Finns to take a stupid idea, blow it up and try to sell it as cool. Lordi is a mediocre team at best, and a single grip will only lead you so far. <br /> <br /> For all marketers, idiots: this is the reason for the inherent minority complex that often meets in Finland trying to export something. <br /> <br /> Lordi is not terrifying. Lordi is lame. Lordi is OVER. <br /> <br /> I want to apologize to the rest of the world for this idiocy with a plastic face. Of course they won Eurovision. <br /> <br /> No, wait - they won Eurovision. this is it! I'm refusing my case.
