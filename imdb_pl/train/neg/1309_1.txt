This movie was extremely boring. It should be at least 15 minutes. Images of children and animals killed were a bit disturbing. <br /> <br /> I usually do not write comments, but this one was so bad with so many good and excellent comments. I think that in this case we are one step closer to honest evaluation of this title. <br /> <br /> What else can I say? I fall asleep during this movie 3 times. It was about 4 hours after I woke up from an 8-hour sleep period. I think this is the point itself. <br /> <br /> There is no dialogue between the characters except maybe 2 sentences at the very end. <br /> <br /> When you fall asleep watching him, do not try to rewind and catch up because they will fall asleep again.
