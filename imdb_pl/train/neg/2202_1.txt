This movie makes me think that the others I saw with Combs were an accident. The plot has more holes than I think I've ever seen in the movie as something more than a "b" movie. Acting was so much fun that even memories of Combs' previous wins were not enough to save him. Given the scenario, I have to imagine that there was not enough money in the budget for things like continuity and original ideas. I am totally upset that I paid Blockbuster prices for this basket. The fact that it was produced for television would help me avoid this cruelty and to be honest, something that poor films should be required to warn. Avoid this movie no matter what.
