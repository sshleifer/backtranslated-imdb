As a member of the cast I was a member of the team during all basketball games, I would like to inform the world after it appeared in the movie that we were not allowed to see it because it was banned in Oregon. This was due to the fact that the producers and director broke the contract with the University of Oregon, where he was shot. It looks like the U of O sign has been shown. During filming, we were allowed to eat several meals with staff and production staff. Mr. Nicholson was quite memorable from being one of the most ill-mannered men I've ever met. Enough time for a young 20-year-old. Certainly not what campus life really was at the turn of the 1960s and '70s, despite what Hollywood might think. Trombonist from Oregon
