It must be one of the worst Swedish films. <br /> <br /> It is embarrassing that such a bad script could become a movie and shown in cinemas only in 2006. <br /> <br /> I have never seen so many visible products sponsored in one and the same movie. It should not be so obvious. <br /> <br /> I can not understand why so many famous actors even thought that the idea is even visible in such a movie. If I had any respect for some of the famous actors in this movie, before I saw this movie, now it's gone. <br /> <br /> I heard that this movie will be, and I can not understand how it is possible.
