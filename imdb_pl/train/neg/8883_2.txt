Cliff Robertson as an intriguing husband, married to a rich wife, provides here praiseworthy performances, if he ever existed; It's as if director Michael Anderson was yelling "get him out, think of a zombie, only less spontaneously" by his little bullhorn when he was training Robertson's effort. The rest of the cast is barely better; Jennifer Agutter of fame LOGAN'S RUN is almost invisible in the role that was to be developed as a key role. If the quality of the game was three times better; if some of the more open plots were filled; and if the stimulation gets an injection of adrenaline, then this sucker can be reduced to the standard accepted by the Hallmark Lifetime TV crowd. Just as his assessment is so inexplicably high that you can not help the insider that chronic insomnia use DOMINIQUE to catch some naps. Perhaps late at night television telemarketers lose a great chance not to treat them as such.
