I liked it, really. Please, do not think I'm an idiot, but I must admit that I liked the movie. I expected it to be nonsense, it's nonsense, but sometimes it's okay to relax and watch a shitty movie where you do not have to concentrate too much, right? I did not expect any hidden meanings or morales, and there were none, but it does not matter, because I watched them only for entertainment and it entertained me. Films like this are the reason why Ben Stillers (justifying "something about Mary") and Vince Vaughns (however you write his name, I could not bother checking). You can watch the shitty movie as long as you do not expect too much of it, and I should stand behind one, run, maybe run, but do not go because I do not have a car, on Blockbuster Video or even an election, and borrow some of these movies with humor in the toilet and stay in one night watching them. Have a nice day for the reader. P.s. If you do not say that this comment helped you, I do not like you, if you say it helped, God bless you, you go to heaven.
