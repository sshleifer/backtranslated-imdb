WARNING! Do not even consider watching this movie in any form. It is not even worth downloading from the Internet. Each piece of porn has more substance than this wasted piece of celluloid. So-called filmmakers apparently have no idea how to make a movie. They could not say a good joke to save their lives. It's an insult to every human being. If you're looking for a fun-filled movie - go find somewhere else. <br /> <br /> Let's hope that this Mr. Unterwaldt ("Jr." is a good indicator of his obvious inexperience and intellectual childhood) dies a slow / painful death and NEVER spins the film. <br /> <br /> It's actually even a waste of time to WRITE ALL about this shit, that's why I will stop now and watch a good movie.
