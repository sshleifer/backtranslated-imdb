If you're looking for eye candy, you can enjoy Sky Captain. Sky Captain is a video game in which live performers were injected. Visualizations are nice and interesting during the whole movie. Now, by saying this, visuals are the only good thing in Sky Captain. <br /> <br /> After ten minutes I knew that I was watching one of the worst films of all time. I was hoping that this movie would be better, but it never got any interest. After thirty minutes, the desire to leave grew and grew. Now I have over 2,000 movies and have seen probably five times as many movies. But this is only the second movie in which I wanted to leave my whole life. <br /> <br /> Acting --- there is not. The three main performers are pathetic. Jude Law (also in another film where I wanted to leave) is just awful in the title role. I'd rather sit at Ben Affleck in Gigli than watch Law again. <br /> <br /> Paltrow is trying so hard to be campy, that it turns on her face. The last article I read said that Paltrow was thinking of staying at home and being a mother rather than acting. After this performance, I would praise this decision. <br /> <br /> The Story --- The soap operas are better written. The story behind Sky Captain begins badly and continues to deteriorate as it progresses. <br /> <br /> Directed --- missing. Everything has been woven into special effects, whose history, acting and director suffer a lot. Even "The Phantom Menace" had a better effect and it does NOT say anything great. <br /> <br /> I would have to give this film "0" with "10". Avoid paying cinema prices and wait for the movie to be released.
