This film has a very simple but somehow very bad story. The whole film tells that the girl is sucked through the gate to another dimension, and years later she is re-opened by the witch, while a group of friends (including the main actor who has trouble defeating his ex-girlfriend who is one of the other campers along with her new partner ... another girl ... it's true that they are lesbians and of course there is nudity for no reason, unfortunately, the demon is following a grown-up girl now, unfortunately none of this has ever been explained. Where did the demon come from? How did she survive as a child in a place full of evil demons? Who the hell did he train her and make her a gladiator outfit? Acting is horrible, but it's hard to say because writing is so bad that maybe nothing is wrong I give him three, because the wrestler was quite good, and the effects were pretty cool, even though they were very cheap. it was not bad enough to be funny.
