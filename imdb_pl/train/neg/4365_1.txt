Ariauna Albright is a really good actress, but why she was involved in this lame parody is a mystery. What could have been a funny wind as a classic boredom. A unique feature of Ariauna is that she can work just as well as look sexy, unlike her partner Lilith Stabs, who looks good, but it is obvious that she spent her money on an acting school in a spa or cosmetics. It was a production that screamed about T & A, and thanks to the writer's creative script she could achieve it in the flow of things. However, Ariauna does what he can in certain circumstances and to some extent saves his reputation. Tempe should be aware that when you dress two attractive women in the fetish uniforms of police officers, viewers will expect some fetish play and T & A. Nough.
