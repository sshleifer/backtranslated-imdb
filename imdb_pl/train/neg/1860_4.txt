Children's comedy by Michael Keaton from 1998. Under the same title, she was severely condemned for her trashy special effects, but in comparison to what Screaming Mad George has prepared for this horror film, they are amazing. The killer snowman seems to be made of styrofoam, and his arms look like large kitchen gloves. Which probably were. The cast emphasizes this parody of dozens of other (much worse) films, and Paul Keith as a city doctor is especially memorable in a small but fun role.
