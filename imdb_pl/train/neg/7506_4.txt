Good actors and good performances can not mask a meaningless scenario, bad dialogue and behavior patterns that do not move into anything you care about. The most interesting figure is David Berkowitz. Lack of character development - lack of growth, lack of interest, only some sufferings for no particular reason, not teaching us anything and not even caring about the fun.
