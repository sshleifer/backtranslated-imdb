The unprecedented direction leaves a decent cast in a handsome but bland adaptation, in which the dialogue seems rather recited than honest, and performances in cash by ghosts do not complete worship or magic; Edward Woodward, as the Ghost of Christmas Present, wobbles on stilts and seems to have the impression of Bernard Cribbins. As Scrooge, George C. Scott is too loud and seems to never believe in it, which deprives him of effectiveness. The scenes in which he showed his past have such a big impact, as if he was browsing his family album without enthusiasm. It seems that no one else puts any effort into it, except for Frank Finlay, who is chronically worried.
