From the first time I saw the cover of the film and the stretched photograph, I thought that this guy, this friend "Scwarz" must be 6 feet or 6 feet 2 inches long. <br /> <br /> Not 5 feet tall. Not this, it's his fault. <br /> <br /> In each assessment I turned on the movie one cool night in Tucson, on the second floor terrace with a good cigar and let it go. At the time my wife was having an affair and everything was going down, so I needed a good entertainment. But as bad as a movie ... I really liked it, with a bottle of Merlot, I could admit. <br /> <br /> Really, I watched the movie many times. It always makes me feel good !! It's not that it's "trying too hard" to be cool, or "It's so close" to hit an action movie ... It's crazy. And then he really has no idea. Then again crazy. It's the best of the best when it comes to the speed-pursuit scene. Wow!! I have never felt safer in my life. Also warm and happy. I was grateful that they behaved on gas during the chase, because of less production in the summer months ... anywho <br /> <br /> The direction was "not inspired", the sequences of action and fight required choreography, or again directed and sharpened, the sound was off, the delivery did not hit you, it just kept going the other way. The "locals" of the village where they were, or rather, the town, were "out of cue" and did not seem to follow what was going on very well, they looked or even "stared" at the camera's lens. Like a deer in the lights, something like some with a smile, smiling deer. <br /> <br /> I feel bad because "Columbu", I just bet, has a good heart and a caring spirit for people in America as well as for my countrymen. <br /> <br /> However, "Baretty Island" is very lethargic and unbelievable. Nevertheless, I like it very much. My now x-wife hates him, but I love it! <br /> <br /> It's funny that I'm very discriminating when it comes to movies that I like or even "love". All in all, I like Franco. This is. <br /> <br /> In addition to this movie, if you like to kill a few hours with real pleasure watching, straight to B videos or "bad" movies for your little library collection, if you can find it, see 'The Big Sweat '(1991) with Robert Z' Dar. You know this big guy from 'TANGO & CASH'. "The Big Sweat", a bomb from the policeman's history without a real plot and acting discovery, which is so bad, it may well be "crutches", and at the end of "The Big Sweat" I think they lacked money because they had a cast and they just set it on fire and let it burn during loans. -Fun. <br /> <br /> But generally, not as well as on the Baretty island, I gave him the "1" and overall rating of "horrible" to the horrible-good movie B ". I am waiting for the sequel, maybe like "Revenge of Bareta at Montazuma" (Franco takes a Mexican vacation and then suffers from water, declares war on the water supply.) Or "Gunpowder war", where he will face a great ruler of drugs in his country, chemically combining gene and forming a hybrid super bedbug (insect) that would be bred and dropped into cocaine fields and eaten coca, and after passing it through a worm, it creates a chemical reaction that turns coke into pure powdered sugar. Then the next part will have to save young people from excessive sugar addiction and so on. He could get a major toothpaste company to approve and partially fund the project, carefully placing the product in function. Well?(*)
