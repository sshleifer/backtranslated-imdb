A cat in a hat is just a slap in the face. Mike Myers as The Cat in the Hat is simply not funny, and Mike Myers could not be worse. This is his worst film he has ever been to.

But this movie is so bad that I can not even describe how bad this movie was. Because Welch should be dismissed or the writer should. <br /> <br /> Perspective Hedeena: 0/10 No Stars F
