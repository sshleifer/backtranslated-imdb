Ok, here's the basic story. It is 1933, Peter Sellers is Dr. Fu Manchu, a 168-year-old Chinese who lived a long time. The film begins with birthdays, in which he celebrates the drinking of a special elixir, which (even the movie never mentions) extends his life. On this occasion, the potion is awkwardly dropped by the assistant (Kato, if you remember the films from Pink Panther), and he orders his servants to go to find 6 rare items to make a potion. This creates a global hunt for people, in which his henchmen eventually rob diamond museums and set out for London to meet Dr. Fu's nemisis, retired detective from Scotland Yard, Nayland Smith, also played by Sellers who are trying to keep him in this, what is to be a witty comedy adventure. <br /> <br /> This was the last full-length feature of the Merchant he did before he died. The terrible tragedy is that he was in it. Sellers who are such a talented comedian and have remarkable "funny" roles in Panther movies and especially in the movie "The Party" are something that is in this film. This movie was an absolute torture to sit down and I could not even finish it. Quite DIES, and I was still cowering, watching the performances of the Sellers. After the arrival of the wonderful "Being There" work a year earlier, how do I mean JAK can do it and HOW did it happen? As one person mentioned, the first 10.15 minutes are fine, but then WSZYSTKO W DÓŁ ... <br /> <br /> Avoid the plague. <br /> <br /> Rating 1 in 10.
