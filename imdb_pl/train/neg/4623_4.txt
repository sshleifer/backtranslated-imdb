If you have not seen the television series gong, you will not like this movie, not knowing that the series makes it a great movie. <br /> <br /> I give him 5 out of 10, because a few things make it funny that it helps to compensate for his obvious problems. <br /> <br /> 1) This funny era snapshot was created in the late 70's and early 80's. 2) You get a lot of funny scenes with people you saw in the show. 3) It is interesting to see Chuck (the host) when he does not make his personality on TV. 4) You'll see many weird people doing strange things just like you see in a TV show. <br /> <br /> I will not list all the bad things, because there are many, but here are some of the best known. <br /> <br /> 1) The Gong Show Movie has a lot of actual TV clips that are tired of the length of the movie. 2) The plot of the film outside the segments of the clip is very weak and essentially consists of only one point of the story. 3) Chuck is actually half decent as an actor, but most of the other actors are typical in comparison to the top 70s. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie to watch, when you do not have an hour and a half you want to watch everything at once. Watch 20 minutes at a time and it's not that bad. But even then it is not so good either. ;)
