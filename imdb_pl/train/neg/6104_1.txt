"Fungicide" is probably the most incompetent, embarrassing, pathetic "movie" I've ever seen. Acting is criminal, the direction is practically non-existent, and the special effects are probably connected with the release of a monkey with learning difficulties on a defenseless laptop. <br /> <br /> I'm far from suppressing creativity, but I really believe that you should not do such things. I am sure that the creators of the "film" will say that yes, the "film" was hampered by a low (as in nothing) budget - but in this case they just should not bother. In fact, they offered the world something so terrible, so terrible that only an imbecile could get the darkest shade of pleasure out of him. <br /> <br /> Starting the "movie", it was not like I was expecting "Citizen Kane" or anything. I was expecting a low cost of a small horror with a bit of ingenuity, a bit of fun, and even a little energy. I got the cinema equivalent of a used handkerchief. <br /> <br /> The plot? Well, our learning antihero who works in the basement of his parents is maniacally mixed in a cup. Apparently, such high-level education is the result of years of research. His parents then send him to a strange place like a hotel in the countryside to relax. There are other people there who are just too horrible to write about. In any case, the scientist drops the test tube on some mushrooms - and soon the mushrooms grow and kill some people. (Wow, I'm starting suicide writing a storyline). Our heroes save the day by detonating a barrel of balsamic vinegar (attaching a "fuse" to it - really a piece of string). The barrel explodes inexplicably with the power of a small nuclear weapon, destroying all the fungi. End. (Thank God). <br /> <br /> This summary is as good as a "movie" (and makes it sound much more interesting than it really is). You really should never cross this stage of development (by which I understand the outline of the plot scribbled with crayons on the back of the envelope). Someone should really come in and give someone an energetic shake and say "NO". <br /> <br /> And these "special" effects. Well, they're "special" fine. It's crazy about CGI. And done by a person who can only assume that the bicycle pump is the pinnacle of modern technology. And when fungus monsters are not in the style of a home-made graphic set from 1984, they are represented by actors shuffling along the sheets (I'm not joking). <br /> <br /> One of the most unforgivable things about film is his laziness. This can be summed up by the scene in which the hero turns the weapon (a la Clint Eastwood), and then fails to get them in his pockets. I mean a few repetitions and he could do it, but just leave it as it is - really weak. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that the money was spent on the trash from the camera. The creators of the "film" should hang their heads in shame and forbid them to stay within fifty meters of any equipment for the production of films. <br /> <br /> I also think it's bad that the friends and family of creators come to IMDb and false reviews and give stupid high ratings to users that give a completely inaccurate picture of the "movie". "Fungicyd" is an absolute parody of the film. Mr. Wascavage is very, very stupid or very, very cynical.
