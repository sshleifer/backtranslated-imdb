I've always been interested in everything that concerns Bigfoot, so when I was looking for a movie to borrow, it caught my attention. It was the WORST 4.50 $ I have ever spent and I want to get my money back! Do not waste money on it !! It was one of the cheapest movies I've ever seen. The whole movie was so unbelievably boring and I discovered that I often roll my eyes and did not even look at it. I just had enough. Acting was terrible, the effects were terrible, everything was really bad and tasteless. All this was a really bad, boring movie and a total waste of time and money. I hope that one day they will make a good Sasquatch movie, but by then I will have to sit in countless cheap dudes like this to find a real masterpiece.
