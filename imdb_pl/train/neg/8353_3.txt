Beaudray Demerille (weak Peter Fonda, who also directed), an aging gambler, wins the young teenager Wanda "Nevada" (a beautiful but not talented Brooke Shields) in a poker game. Total unlikely couple (of course) sets out to look for Indian gold in the Grand Canyon. <br /> <br /> This is history and there is really no need to look deeper in it. It simply is not there. Acting is also very poor, which was quite a surprise, given the fact that Peter Fonda was in the lead. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something interesting in this film, look at the pretty scenery and a bit of a good look of the young Brooke Shields. Her character, however, is so annoying (especially at the beginning) and stupid that she never goes out so sexy or attractive. It's a shame, but given the story, I doubt that something more can be done about it. I wonder why Peter Fonda directed and played in this film. He even had to talk to his father (Henry Fonda) in a (useless) episode in this funny mess. Unfortunately, it was their only movie together. For example, could Henry not be in EASY RIDER? 3/10
