A few fianc√©s are mysteriously murdered at the altar, and later their bodies are stolen on the way to the morgue. The newspaper writer Patricia Hunter decides to investigate these mysterious killings. She discovers that just before each ceremony, the bride received a rare orchid (apparently from the groom), which contained a powerful drug that had yielded to her. Patricia learns that the orchid was first bred by Dr. Lorenz, who lives with his wife in an isolated estate. In fact, Dr. Lorenz is responsible for crimes, placing brides in suspension, and using glandular fluid to keep his wife forever young. Patricia, along with Dr. Foster (who works with Dr. Lorenz over the medical puzzle surrounding his wife), try to force Dr. Lorenz's hand to establish a false wedding that ultimately leads Patricia to the clutches of the mad doctor. This movie had a very good opening drum, but basically it ended with too many shots and other weak scenes. The cast is decent, Walters and Coffin deserve better, but this is life. Russell steals the show (even Hamming Lugosi - who does not give one of his more memorable performances, even considering his Monograms) as Countess Lorenz playing a role with features of many stereotypical features of many contemporary Hollywood donna. Poor and elaborate ending. Rating based on films B, 4.
