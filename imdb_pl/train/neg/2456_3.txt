I saw this film during the Tolkien's Interim lesson during the second year of study. I sat, unfortunately, close to the screen, and my professor chose me to serve as a beating boy - everyone else laughed, but they were not in constant sight. <br /> <br /> Let's leave it out: Peter Jackson's film "The Lord of the Rings" owes the film to Bakshi. For example, in the Jackson Ring Team version, the scene in which Black Raiders attack empty beds is almost a complete copy of the scene in the Bakshi movie shot by the shot. You can call it plagiarism or tribute, depending on the agenda. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that the similarities do not end. I'm not going to do any research to find out what they are because it would mean I have some respect for this movie. I'm sure others have described the similarities - look around. <br /> <br /> This film is a complete train wreck in every respect metaphor, and many, many people were killed in an accident. I decided to replace what I remember in a more or less chronological way. If I have omitted anything else that has offended me, it is because I am completely overwhelmed, in the face of the wealth of failure (in high points, mediocrity). <br /> <br /> * Due to the intensive use of rotoscopy, Gandalf is no longer a gentle, wise wizard, but a wildly waving prophet of extermination (whose hat inexplicably changes color one or two times during the film)). <br /> <br /> * Saruman White is sometimes called "Aruman" during the film, without explanation. He's purple and red for some mysterious reason. <br /> <br /> * Sam is disgusting. Presenting his friendship with Frodo is strangely childish and unsatisfactory. Yes, hobbits are as small as children, but they are NOT children. <br /> <br /> * Merry and Pippin never appear - they just appear when changing the scene with one sentence. The film is filled with sloppy editing in this way. <br /> <br /> * Frodo, Sam, Pippin and Merry sing cheerfully, jumping along the road. One of the hobbits buys a lute at least twice as large as his back - which was not visible before - and starts beating in the typically fancy bard style when everyone breaks into the "la-la-la". INCREDIBLE. <br /> <br /> * Apparently, Aragorn is an indigenous American dressed in an extremely stereotypical fancy tunic (without pants), with a huge, square buckle from a pilgrim. He is probably the worst swordsman in the whole movie - he often gets wobbly before he gets knocked down on the ass. <br /> <br /> * Black Riders seem more leper than evil tools. They get stuck where they are going at a painfully slow pace. It is disturbing to be sure, but not terrifying. <br /> <br /> * The scene in front of the Black Riders trying to cross Ford Bruinen (where they stare at Frodo who is on the other side on horseback) stretches to infinity, at which time the Riders shed their horses in a somewhat dangerous manner ... they do nothing more. The stage was probably supposed to illustrate the hallucinatory fall of Frodo when he succumbed to his wound. It turns out that it is more overwhelming than anything else. <br /> <br /> * Dwarf Gimli is as tall as Elf Legolas. He is DWARF. There is simply no justification for it. It also looks like a fucked David Gnome. It's a primitive but accurate description. <br /> <br /> * It seems that Boromir has stolen the gold armor of the Vikings Elmer Fudd from the episode of the opera Bugs Bunny. It looks funny. <br /> <br /> * Despite the resemblance to Tolkien's illustration, Balrog is a hooter and the least dangerous villain in the whole movie. It looks like someone is wearing pink slippers and is not much taller than Gandalf. "Purists" may prefer this Balrog, but I will take a Jackson version every day. <br /> <br /> * Battle scenes are uncomfortable and embarrassing. Almost none of the characters has any level of competence with their weapons. I'm not asking for action-packed scenes like those in Jackson's movie, but they MUST fight. <br /> <br /> * Treebeard looks very short and I'm sorry that he took everything. Watch the movie, you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> All right, now for the GOOD part of the movie. <br /> <br /> * Some of the voice actors are pretty good. It's not so bad that Aragorn SOUNDS just looks like the Jolly Green Giant. <br /> <br /> * Galadriel is a bit interesting in this performance; like Tom Bombadil, she seems immune to the power of the Ring's temptation, and her voice actress is not terrible either. <br /> <br /> * Boromir's death is not as intense as Jackson's presentation of the same scene, but he is still dramatic (and more faithful to his death in the book, though I do not believe that Jackson made a mistake by shooting it, like him). <br /> <br /> * As my professor has noted (between whispered threats) orcs (mainly in Helm's Deep, if I'm right) resemble war-devastated corpses of soldiers, a political statement that works quite well if you realize that what is being done. <br /> <br /> * Although this is not a positive point in the movie, Bakshi can not blame you for most of the mistakes in this movie, I was told - the project was tight budget and late production lost creative control over some of the higher level (which he certainly did not read the books). <br /> <br /> Let me say: I respect Bakshi for even trying something of this size. It's just hard to believe that he was happy with the final product. <br /> <br /> In general I can not recommend this blasphemous adaptation of Tolkien's classic trilogy even for laughter, unless you have already read the books and have your own visualizations of characters, places and events. I'm sure somebody, somewhere, will choose it in turmoil; if you do, keep an open mind and get what you can.
