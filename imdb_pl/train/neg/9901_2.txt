It really should be one star, but there were so many stereotypes, predictable twists, I saw it all before the parallel slasherami, that it actually gives me an extra star for the fact that it made me laugh ... I'm sure of the directors' intentions. <br /> <br /> I do not often write comments about movies, they must be either sensational or in this case really bad. <br /> <br /> Honestly, as soon as I saw Jeff Fahey in it, I knew he would be weak because he had a unique nose to pick out the worst movies. <br /> <br /> Somehow, this farce made me look at it all the time, maybe for the happy voice of MR T (do not give Mr. T, but you'll know what I mean, if you'll be this look), if you look at it, make sure you do not pay to see it. It could work if they actually put on the intended comedy, but I'm sure you'll find a strange laugh in this farce ...
