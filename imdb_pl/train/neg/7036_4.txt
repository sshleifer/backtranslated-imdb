I do not destroy anything when I inform you that in this movie you see a woman having sex with a goat. If it's your thing, then your movie has arrived. <br /> <br /> A woman and her husband are going to see their sister from the house, who lives in a family house in the forest. Her sister is at least a scary woman and she seems to have interests that go beyond family love. To the side appears a group of distasteful characters and begins to play various pagan rituals. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite weak and the characters are quite stupid. The woman stays on, even when her husband begins to turn into a jerk and meet with pagans, he even continues to have sex with him. There are many exposed bodies on the side of exploitation and several perverse connections, but nothing else is better elsewhere. Oh, and the goat sex scene mentioned earlier. <br /> <br /> Most viewers will not reach the end. Fans of exploitation will escape, but they will want more. <br /> <br /> 4/10
