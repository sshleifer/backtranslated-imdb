Absolutely nothing happens in this grim, annoying thriller without emotions directed by Amenabar's regular colleague, Mateo Gil. The film, which in a sense deals with boredom and the search for the thrill of emotions, in reality does not provide anything and seems to be an exercise in boredom. The only mild moment is the climax of the film, which lasts about 30 seconds of all painful 100-minute time and is solved too simply. The plot is devoid of refinement and credibility, and although the idea is original, the way history unfolds is arbitrary, and any plot or twist is the result of external disturbance (deus-ex-machina). The hero is always passive, everything happens to him without forcing him to show any initiative or resourcefulness. If you're a fan of the genre, watch "Tesis" instead.
