I watched this movie at the Sneak Preview and I'm glad I did not pay for it. This movie is simply disgusting. He is full of jokes with a dick and fart and is not proud of the sequence of actions (such as shooting in "Little Germany"). I did a small list of things that I liked in the movie ... and many of them did not agree. <br /> <br /> 1. Penis by Dave Foley. 2. Jokes from farts. 3. Poop jokes. 4. Dude was a pussy. 5. Not Gary Coleman. 6. The Taliban 7. They are mocking Bush again. LET'S GIVE HER IDIOT .. go ahead. 8. The guy has blond hair. 9. The plot. 10. Killing minors 11. Uwe Boll was in it. 12. Most of the cast was just indignant there. <br /> <br /> Now (a few) good <br /> <br /> 1. The guy uses the cat as a silencer, like in the game. 2. A lot of shares. 3. Crotchy came back (and the Postal producer's cameraman) 4. Uhm ... I did not have to pay for it. 5. There are several moments of "what for effect" <br /> <br /> Boll did it again. He made another bad game in the adaptation of the film. Kudos to you, Mr. Boll. 2/10
