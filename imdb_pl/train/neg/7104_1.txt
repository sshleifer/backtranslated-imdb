The producers of this movie offer funeral costs to anyone who dies in fear of watching this movie. They should offer intensive psychotherapy to anyone who has really enjoyed this smelly one. A young couple moves into a home where a woman lives who looks like a woman from a couple. Extremely boring and very predictable. In the end, I did not care about anyone in this movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs.
