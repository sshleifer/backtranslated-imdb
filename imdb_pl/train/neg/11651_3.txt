Considering that this film was made in less than a year, it can explain its shortness (81 minutes - including the final credits, or about 76 minutes of the actual movie). But what he can not explain is the lack of humor that the previous film possessed. <br /> <br /> Gags are fast and sometimes not even fun. The only real fun parts are the quick parody of Nike basketballs, the portrait of James Woods with Max Van Sydow in exorcists and fragments scattered throughout the movie. It was very unpleasant to start Charlie's Angels, who, like the first Scary Movie and the Matrix spin off scene, basically recreated the scene without a greater sense of humor. <br /> <br /> Today's youth may not be able to relate to the parody of gags of classic supernatural horrors from the 70s, such as the exorcist and maybe from the 80s Poltergeist, et. al. <br /> <br /> Let's hope that Scary Movie 3 will take some time to assemble spoofing. <br /> <br /> One thing, the film contains more than the last promising young actress Anna Faris (which I admit to seemed extremely hot in the sequel). Only for her cast and acting skills, I give this film "3" from "10".
