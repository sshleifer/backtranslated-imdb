It was a movie that you could watch, but the plot was a bit weak and most of the jokes came from Rodney's earlier films. Having said that, it was worth watching. I gave it 5 out of 10. So basically it's one of those movies that do not go out of your head, but if you find them on the tube, take a chance.
