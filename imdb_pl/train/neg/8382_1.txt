It was a Bugs Bunny cartoon called "Baby Buggy Bunny", which was EXACTLY the plot. Finster with the child's face robbed the bank, and the money in the carriage drove off and fell into the rabbit hole of the Bug. He changed as a child to get into the buggy hole to get his money back. The scene in "Little Man", in which he looks in the bathroom shaving mirror with a cigar in his mouth, comes straight from the cartoon. It was a fun 5-minute cartoon; not so much the whole movie. If this really interests you, buy a DVD Bugs Bunny. The first time was much more original (1954). In addition, you'll get many more classic Bugs Bunny cartoons to run!
