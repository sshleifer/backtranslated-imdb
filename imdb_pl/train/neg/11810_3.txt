I noticed with some amusement that in the final subtitles PD Detroit is thanked for their participation. The police chief even has one line to speak in which he plays alone (and boy, can you say he can not act). The reason for amusement is that in this film the police first shoot and ask questions later. Not a PR, I would think the police would want it. Besides, it's your standard film of cops and thieves disguised as racial in the 70s. Alex Rocco receives the ungrateful role of a policeman who can not move forward and is burdened with a mentally ill wife. He makes up for this by spending time at a local brothel. Hari Rhodes is his amazing partner who has a great wardrobe and likes to chase suspects while wearing trenchcoat. The film moves until the penultimate shooting, which absolutely does not make sense (why do people who are guilty only of robbery, take all the police?). Not only do we see one shooting, but because there are four bad guys, we can see four. Then there is an unexpected ending that is supposed to guess what really happens, but it left me just thinking how stupid it was. Seeing that director Arthur Marks was also behind the braindead "Friday Foster" and "Bucktown", I should not be surprised.
