Okay, this is stupid, they say they do not make another movie with Nightmare, it's the "last" ... What are they doing? They do another, not that the next one (part 7) was BAD, but why are they playing? In any case, this movie did not make any sense, it was extremely boring, the characters were very one-dimensional, Freddy was another joker, who is very stupid for such a good series. The plot is very, very bad, and it's even worse than parts 2 and 5. I did not get a movie, it's a stupid story in 3-d, aimless! I hated the movie so much that I still remember all the parts I did not like, which was basically the whole movie. It is so different than the prequels, it tries and tries, but this one tried the hardest and was slapped on the face. In addition there were some death scenes, although they were different, sucked on with great strides. How can they go that far? Did not they see that they made the biggest mistakes in parts 2 and 5? However, they do it? All this involves money, DO NOT SEE THIS SAD EXCUSE FOR THE NIGHT SERIES. <br /> <br /> I HAVE BEEN NIGHT AT ELM STREET SIX (6) 3 TO 10. <br /> <br /> GOOD POINTS: I had potential with a story. <br /> <br /> ZŁE POINT PUNKTY: Straszne aktorstwo / brak śmierci / Too funny to be classified as horror / very misleading.
