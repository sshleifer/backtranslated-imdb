I was lying on the bed with a really bad cold or flu or anything. I think I might have killed some time watching some horror movies that my mother bought me some time ago. It is a pity that I have never chosen this movie! After watching this I felt even more sick and I wanted to quit. After the words (when I got better, of course), I did some research on Dennis L. Rader and I noticed that Dennis in the movie was not like the real one. I hope no one ever watches this movie, but if they ever go or feel like I did after seeing it for the first time. I think it would be better to watch Santa Claus 3. At least this movie had better reviews on this site.
