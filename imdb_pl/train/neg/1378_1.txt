This is like a bad television series from the 80s who relaxed and tried to become a soft core porn video. Oh, my God, it was bad. The plot of each character was of minor importance. The story itself had nothing to say. I think something about the persecutor. At last he shoots himself? This is not clear, but somehow volleyball plays. And the main character (Randy) sleeps a lot. The only reason my friends rented this movie was because Casper Van Dien was in this movie and ended up wanting to quickly jump to scenes with him that were barely visible. Thank God I did not spend any money on it, but I want this hour of my life back.
