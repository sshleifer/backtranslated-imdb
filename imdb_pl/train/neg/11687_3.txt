Inside Man evokes yawning, snazzy disappointment, tells the story of detective (Denzel Washington), who is the subject of an investigation because of his possible involvement in the case of missing money. When the bank is robbed, and the hostages kept against their will by the brain thief (Clive Owen) and his team, the detective is forced to force the thief to give up? his only attempt to prove that he is innocent and worthy of his position. Enter the powerful woman (Jodie Foster) with her own secrets and intentions, sent to recover the item from the bank's owner's safe, which is stored in the bank, and you have a three-way dilemma. Unfortunately, everything you get is set in a movie, and at the end, nothing pays off. Denzel Washington is the most uninteresting in an inefficient and tasteless egocentric performance. The only saving money for the film are its competent collaborators Jodie Foster and Clive Owen, who are much better than the film itself. In fact, Jodie Foster provides the most surprising and high-class performance against the type as a ruthless, crafty villain. Clive Owen does not have much to do besides hatches and poses, but the depth of his presence and achieved acting skills more than make up for his poorly developed role. It is strange that so many talents that are of no importance or interest are wasted on this film. You have to wonder what director Spike Lee was thinking while creating this movie. However, the most troubling aspect of Inside Man is how much unjustified praise has been received. In the case of a movie that seemed to have all the advantages of a hit from the summer, this movie is terribly flat.
