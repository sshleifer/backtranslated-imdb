I have this movie in a 5-dollar basket for walmart. I do not recommend watching this movement. I can give it to one of my friends if I'm angry with them and I want them to suffer for 2 hours. <br /> <br /> I looked at the cover and reviewed the summary and thought it was a war movie. I would like to know how boring this movie will be before its inclusion. It was my mistake to think that something will happen in this film. It's just a group of people going from one camp to another. Drill sargents treat soldiers very badly, and the protagonist tries to help people get out of the fight in Vietnam. <br /> <br /> Okay, here's my rant about this movie: For me, this movie is slow and heavy to watch. It was just one of those movies you put in and you got stuck because you want to turn it off, but you stick to the hope it might have at the end. It is not so. After the movie ended, for my T.V. because I was angry that I wasted almost 2 hours of my life watching them and another 10 minutes writing this review to warn people about it.
