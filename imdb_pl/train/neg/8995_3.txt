I missed the beginning, but I saw the majority. A friend got it on DVD in a cheap room at FYE. <br /> <br /> All skits are very short, but most of them are too long. Most of them forgot something funny! Pretty much racist / sexist / "homophobic" humor, sketches based on stereotypes or skits that use racist terms for people. <br /> <br /> I'm trying to remember everything that I thought was funny about it, and I'm in trouble .... The Tunnel Vision network logo is a mouth painted with lipstick with a eyeball. Lips open and close to the eye like eyelids. Something terrible. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. Most of the actors have gone for better things and are lucky that the bomb did not stop them.
