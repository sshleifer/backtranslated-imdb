Daniella has some problems related to her attractive appearance. He begins to lose his mind when he learns about a distant relative (who resembles) who has been burnt for being a werewolf. She's getting a bit wild when she's beating horny men and cutting her throat. In the end, he finds a man who helps stop her inner beast, but when others ruin their happiness, he extracts brutal and furry vengeance. <br /> <br /> "Werewolf" is not a very stupid movie, but is a good movie from the crowd. It was possible to spend time playing, using bad actor / dubbing / translation and pure trashiness of production. But he moves slowly on his own, but he has enough nakedness to not fall asleep.
