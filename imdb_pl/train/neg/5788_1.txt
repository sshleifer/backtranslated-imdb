OK, so Mr. Agrama's company (which is involved in the dubious business with former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi) has produced the terrible mishmash of Mr. Carl Mack. <br /> <br /> What is this terrible mishmash I'm talking about? Well, Macek took three completely unrelated Japanese science-fiction animated series (namely Macross, Southern Cross and Mospeada), added TONY dialogue - believing strongly that the American audience is too stupid to understand the narrative and artistic virtue of silence - edited a whole lot brutal content, I added metaphysical mumbo jumbo, she was baptized using one of the worst voice actors of this party of hell (Reby West's singing was - and still is - unbearable and total indignation, especially when compared to Mrs. Mari Iijima) ... As a result, 85-episode serial with hundreds of problems with continuity and story holes. <br /> <br /> Of course it was cool to look at it (especially in "Macross Saga") and the plot parts that remained untouched were good. But what was good at Robotech was not the result of Mack's work nor the "voice talents" he recruited. It's because of hardships and efforts (invaluable - why? Would I be too bold to accuse HG of plagiarism here?) Japanese creators. Those of us who finally learned about the real deal and compared the originals to Robotech would like us to never be exposed to Robotech. The originals are of course much better and have a lot more sense. <br /> <br /> Robotech did something valuable: he induced the legendary anime creator Leiji Matsumoto to launch a campaign to protect Japanese anime creators, "intellectual property from such unauthorized and unjustified alterations that produce people without talent, such as Carl Macek.
