There really is no way to beat the bush, saying "Lady Death: The Motion Picture" just sucks. Apart from the fact that the main character is a well-stocked blonde running around in hell in a leather bikini with sporadic graphical impulses, the film seems to be created with the mentality of a cartoon from the 80s based on a line of figures. Even a bad guy even says like a would-be Skeleton, he has a compulsory inept supporter and lives in a lair, which looks like a villain's domain from an old Saturday Blackstar cartoon. Just do not expect humor other than sometimes wreaking evil dialogue. Another time, it seems to be a kind of anime story better suited to hentai, but there is no sex, rape on the tentacles (thank God!) And very small sex appeal, despite the physical appearance of the title character. This material is not just an adult, unless you count the half-naked heroine and bloody death. Essentially, we have a full-length episode of She-Ra, Princess of Power, but with more scant clothes and more gore.
