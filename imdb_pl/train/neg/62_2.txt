SWING! is an important movie because it is one of the other films produced and played by Black from the 1930s. Many of these movies have simply deteriorated so much that they can not be watched, but this one is in pretty good shape. It is also a nice opportunity to see many talented black performers from the period just after the splendor of the former Cotton Club - time forgotten today. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, while the film is historically important and has wonderful performances, it's also a mess. The main theme is very similar to the Hollywood musicals of that era - including prima donna, which will ruin the show and the unknown surprise that comes from the place where you can save the day. However, writing is just awful and a bit kitschy - and designs images of Black America, which some may find slightly degrading. This is because before the story really develops, you are treated by a villain who lives from a hard working wife (a popular stereotype of those times) and when he gets caught with hussy (who, incidentally, completely defeats this role), have a fight, which looks like a scene from WWE Smackdown! And this only lady wants to cut a second lady with a straight razor - a really kitschy scene! Later in the movie, when prima donna behaves terribly, her husband hits her in the face and everyone applauds him! It seems that sometimes the movie wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the PLUS audience, and even can not do it well - with some of the worst acts I've seen in a long time. > <br /> Still, if you can look at poor production in almost any way (with cheesy characters, poor acting and bad writing), this one can be worth watching so that you can see the perfect singing and tapping - as well as to capture the forgotten black culture. Just do not say that I did not warn you about acting - it's really, really bad!
