Somewhere there must be a list of the worst gay movies at all times. One of them has too long shots of stars that sit and gaze into space into space, or somewhere where cats who eat spaghetti eat unbearably long. This image of motion sickness is the story of a boy and a boy who live, love and swim, get stuck in grottos, one of them has a mother with depression, and another has no mother, talk, walk, swim and have sex drunk, then break off and someone goes to the hospital for eight days and then goes out and there's a lot of fast forward and backward rewriting and there are long shots of one of them staring into space or just sitting and doing nothing. I think it's some kind of artificial filmmaking technique, maybe the movie is so bad that it has to fill it with long, wasted shots, or else if they had to rely on the story or story, the film would have been about 14 minutes. Do not get me wrong, it's about the 30th gay movie that I've watched over the last 6 months, and some of them (most of them) were very formulated, predictable and boring, but this is really terrible waste The best one so far was "Beautiful Thing, "so I looked at it and after the first opening photo that lasted and lingered, I thought," Oh, no, it will be creative sinny mah. " and I watched him, and when I finished, I put the DVD in the basket, I'm sorry I did not like it, and if so, I'm sorry if I get offended.
