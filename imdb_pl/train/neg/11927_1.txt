No doubt the worst movie I've seen in a long time. I have endured to the end, because there must be something here, but no. The plot, when it does not deal with clich√©s, goes to the point of non-existence; the dialogue that is to be street is simply trumped; characters never develop outside of sketches; set-pieces are trivial. Worse, considering his co-director, photography is just that. <br /> <br /> Comments in other places that raise this level alongside Get Carter, Long Good Friday or Kaspar Hauser are far away; Saints' lives lack their innovations, let alone their depth and shading. In short, their craft. The ruthless editor could probably cut it down to a decent 30-minute abbreviation, but in its present form it is a movie project of the 6th form implemented on a scale of one million pounds; wandering and bloated with their own pretensions. The fact that they received funds (certainly only because of Rankin's name), while other small films are fighting for cash, is depressing for the British film industry.
