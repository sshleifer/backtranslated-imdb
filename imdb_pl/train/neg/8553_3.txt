It's a really bad movie. Ideology is not as perverse as in the films Collins did later. However, my main concerns about this movie are that it is unbelievable and to be honest boring for a long time. The whole concept of a former SAS man joining the terrorists without any particular reason is not very convincing and one can not help wondering why a group of highly organized terrorists (who later become quite unaware) fall in love with it. The film begins with a quite strong scene, but then meanders for a long time, building towards the grand finale. In general, I think that Whoever dares to win could be an interesting 45-minute episode of The Professionals, but the story does not include a feature film. Although the film was successful at that time, it began the collapse of Collins' career, which in the eighties mainly produced cheap and questionable military or military films. It's a shame because he is a really versatile actor, but at the end of the day Martin Shaw has carefully chosen his roles and has a career that is still successful.
