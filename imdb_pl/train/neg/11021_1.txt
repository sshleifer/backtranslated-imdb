Hallam Foe tells us a story about a boy who lost his mother and later experiences some kind of Oedepus complex. <br /> <br /> It's about 95 minutes, but ten will be better. In the middle is the hour in which he trains climbing on the roofs and habits in the church tower like Quasimodo (only he is less sympathetic). <br /> <br /> There's a weird love story involved. I have nothing to do with it. It just so happens that he looks like his mother. We know he misses his mother, that's what the first ten minutes were about. They should just put the beginning and end together and it would be O.K. short movie. Now it is a portrait of a character that does not change. He is a guy with whom something is happening. The only active choice in the whole movie is to apply for a job. <br /> <br /> It's all Oedepus's case that's going to help us analyze his character. He paints his face, dresses in women's clothing and wears a dead badger on his head. Badger! You must see the ending! He returns to his home with a badger on his head (and is filmed like a cheap horror movie) to kill his father's new wife (with whom he had sex at the beginning). And somehow they thought it would not be fun enough, so they put on some indie punk music. I must admit, however, that I am allergic to films that want to write a psychological complex on your nose. It seems that the director / guy MacKenzie / whatever tries to show us that he is also studying psychology at school. You are so smart! Thank you for restoring all these forgotten theories to our memories! You really kicked! What a Wallraff! Okay, now I realized that this movie is based on some random book, but still ... <br /> <br /> Photowise is boring. Many talking heads. In addition, the editor has changed the colors from the stage to the stage, you know cold and warm etc. Why? perhaps "Hallam Foe" is both a function and a test film for the blind. Or maybe they just thought that the drama would not be enough to tell us that he felt lonely, so they increased the blue color so that we would really understand him. <br /> <br /> I will not even comment on the banal indie-oh-how-how-cute drawings that they made in the presentation. And all these "sweet" sexual things. The whole film is an independent banality. But I recommend it. I laughed more than a few times. Although being a film student is really annoying, and seeing how this nonsense penetrates the machine.
