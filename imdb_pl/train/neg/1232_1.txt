She says a girl named Susan Montford wrote and directed this "movie". No wonder there are no other titles to write or direct. She made a serious professional mistake by choosing this career. This is one of the worst human creations of this millennium. <br /> <br /> The basic thing wrong with this film, apart from the funny story of a woman running away from four weak bandits, is a glaring and complete lack of LOGIC. <br /> <br /> ** After leaving the shopping center, four thugs who surround her are approached. Tell me which woman aggressively slides a potential attacker when she is surrounded and insults him verbally? I do not mean after the attack has already begun, because then of course it is normal that someone is fighting. But she pushed that guy away and almost escalated him to the next level. No woman would do it, unless 1) she had a gun, 2) she is sure that this backup is very close, so she is relatively safe from getting hurt, or 3) the attackers are so young and weak that they are quite sure she he can take them. None of this was applicable in this situation, so she just acted like someone who asks for rape or assault. By the way, when the security guard approached, SOON, when he came into sight of Kim Basinger, why did not she immediately run to him for help or scream? <br /> <br /> ** When he leaves after the guard is shot in the head, he enters the abandoned part of the city and breaks down. She had a good three-minute advantage over the persecutors, instead of just walking away in the oblique direction behind the houses and climbing the fences and continuing, she pulls out her Red Toolbox and starts wandering under the hood. I understand that she tried to repair her car, but she should have run away. <br /> <br /> (I did not even mean the chronological summary of the movie because I hate people who do their reviews, but it just happens that every main sequence of this movie has something so blatantly stupid that I have to comment). <br /> <br /> ** Why would you wear a loud Red Toolbox, how are you trying to sneak out in the dark? When she is caught, one of the jokers demands to open the toolbox. First, he resists, and then finally opens it. And he takes out the key. This scene here is so rich in the subtle overtones of the complete failure of the dramatic effect that I have to break it, it is one of the most stupid scenes in the whole film. When she was asked to open the box, she resisted at first, as if it were her plan to somehow force one of the thugs to open him out of anger after she did not open it, in the same way that someone in some action movie can have a device that the enemy requires from this person to touch / pushing / open / manipulate, and when this hero refuses to open it, the enemy captures this device, only to automatically distribute the device / shot him in the face / he was unconscious , which has always been the hero's plan. It feels like they are trying to do it with Kim Basinger here, when she opens the toolbox, dramatically and quickly removes the KEY and sends one of the thugs, and somehow GETS from him and three other thugs. <br /> <br /> ** For the rest of the movie, basically what you see is this suburban housewife sneaking in the woods as he wears his Red Toolbox, taking various tools used as a weapon to kill HIS ATTACKERS . <br /> <br /> ** When did she run away, how did she end up going back to the place where the bandits were? I think it was a scene in which the radio was playing a tribute to a dead colleague. Somehow she ran into them when I thought he was moving away from them. <br /> <br /> ** In the end, this whole premise is so weak, because the whole reason why it is prosecuted in the first place is caused by bandits. "In retrospect, she witnessed the murders that they had committed before the security officer, so they felt they must kill her. Preposterous. As one of the bandits said, they could just leave the city and return to the city from which they were traveling, no one else has seen them, and probably did not get a license plate. Even if these possibilities do not work to their advantage, how to raise hell and hunt for someone who kills them, increasing the chances of avoiding the original murder?
