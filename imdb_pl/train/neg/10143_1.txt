FLIGHT OF FURY is proud to be Steven Seagal's worst film I've ever seen ... Until now. <br /> <br /> It's horrible boring, with no action scenes that are not interesting, Seagal is not really trying to do it - he's fat, and his voice is once again called. <br /> <br /> Co-stars do not perform better, being rather an unpleasant burden for the 3rd rater. <br /> <br /> Director Keusch is very poor and it's no wonder that he is also responsible for another pair of stinky Seagalys (SHADOW MAN & ATTACK FORCE). The screenplay written by Seagal himself is ridiculously inept. <br /> <br /> According to IMDb, 12M $ was spent on this boring load of the old tosh - If these numbers are correct, I feel a big tax violin, because nowhere is this amount spent nearby. <br /> <br /> LOT FURY is actually a shot to remake flick Michael Dudikoff BLACK THUNDER - which must be better than these tripe. <br /> <br /> It has NO advantages, give him MISS! 1/2 * from *****
