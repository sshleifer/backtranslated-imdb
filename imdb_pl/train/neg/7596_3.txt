The film, starring Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell, two respected and talented actors, sounds like a great idea. An independent movie sounds even better. Studies will control less content, so that actors, writers and the director will be more creative. <br /> <br /> But why is this movie so bland? Ask dust. <br /> <br /> This movie assumes that from the very beginning we are deeply invested in the form. Nobody has a proper story, so we do not know why characters behave like they do. <br /> <br /> Explanations about physical and emotional scars are left to our imagination, if you still have left at the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> I told a friend that I went to see this movie and that I thought it was terrible. <br /> <br /> Her question: "Not even Colin Farrell could have saved it? My answer: "Even Colin Farrell's butt can not save him."
