I had (wrong) a fortune to see this movie at a show in the USA. Reluctantly, I sat down in a hopeless case, I'm shocked to see so many good reviews here at IMDB. <br /> <br /> The original movie was a turkey, but interesting. This suited the early seventies, after the 1969 revolution; this movie just stinks ......., well, nothing really. This is so bad. <br /> <br /> Imagine a bad perfume advertisement - see what I mean? <br /> <br /> Madonna has never been able to act, and has been embarrassed on the big screen for years. With each of these years it looks increasingly worse, more and more resembles a skin of meerkat. <br /> <br /> Guy Ritchie, who built his "reputation" at Lock Stock, could never direct - his films are shallow, badly cut, fashion shows. He does not disappoint here either; he wisely threw his wife as the star of this defeat. <br /> <br /> Please, people, do not pay attention to the good reviews that this movie received from other posters below. These are quite obvious business bets. <br /> <br /> Do not encourage Ritchie to humiliate him by giving him money. <br /> <br />
