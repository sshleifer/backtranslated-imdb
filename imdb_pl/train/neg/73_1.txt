It must be the worst piece of trash I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is a heartbeat? He looked deformed. I would like to know that he and Naomi Watts are an object in real life, because I spent the 2 longest hours of my life, wondering what she saw in him. <br /> <br /> Orlando Bloom is a heartbeat? With a thin beard and stares in the spotlight, I can not say I agree. <br /> <br /> Rachel Griffiths was her usual fabulous self, but Geoffrey Rush looked like he could not wait for you to get off the set. <br /> <br /> Should I feel sorry for bankers and murderers? This is far from Butch Cassidy, who was actually a funny movie. It was trivial, banal and boring. We stopped just because we were convinced that it would be better. No. <br /> <br /> The last 10-15 minutes were accidentally fun. Heath and his gang are imprisoned in a border hotel, and women and children die because of their presence. It's not funny. But it was funny when they left the hotel with armor, because we only thought about the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I waited for them to say, "I'm gonna bite your leg!" We laughed, just like a few other perverted members of the audience. When we were leaving, almost everyone talked about how time is wasted. <br /> <br /> Maybe I did not pay cash to see this disaster (crafty preview), but it was definitely not free. It cost me 2 hours of my life that I will never come back.
