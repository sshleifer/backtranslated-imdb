Medium viewers looking for a sense of internal consistency in the movie should probably give it a pass. It generates the same feeling as staring at an interesting collection of individual images that seem to have some connection with each other, but it never merges together. <br /> <br /> This isolation approach to the creation of a certain kind of cinematic assembly may appeal to a few students or critics who are saturated with the internal language of contemporary cinema, it is annoying and condescending for us ordinary people who just fell from the hay. Open access avoidance may be an intentional trademark of authors such as Kar-wai Wong and Tarantino, but for me it turns out that Andy Warhol is warming up. The only redemptive feature I find is production values, and they simply do not cut it all by themselves. <br /> <br /> This is one of those productions in which you watch and listen and wait impatiently and in vain for a clever development of an idea or thought to sustain all the extraordinary and beautiful individual scenes. Excuse me. Calligraphic credits start to roll out when interest begins to move. I feel the same big yawn and disappointment, which I think is very competent and in-depth comments about this film, which never leads to anything really understandable. Ideas and pictures without an external context are not my idea for fun. <br /> <br /> Call me a philistine wandering the streets of Hong Kong looking for a bowl of suey cutlet. <br /> <br />
