The first question that comes to mind after seeing this trash, is who on earth gave these idiots the right to use the name Omen in this film? A shambolic, embarrassing, pathetic attempt to continue the Omen series. When the movie starts, the background music sounds as if it was raised straight from the Bugs Bunny cartoon and from that moment the movie gets worse! I do not know who wrote the script, but I bet they got E - for when they took him to show the teacher! After some time, it's difficult to tell if it's a comedy, because what's happening is as funny and untrue as the original Omen he's asking for. Acting is ridiculous, especially on the part of the leading Mrs. Faye Grant. she keeps stupid faces, or is it hard for her not to laugh? Hard to say. The worst sequel I've ever had the misfortune to witness. 1 out of 10.
