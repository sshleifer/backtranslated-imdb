Personally, although I am able to appreciate really good films, I also have a strange ability to enjoy even the most crappy nonsense. You know, those days when you just want to sit there and watch some horrible action movie that will kill time. This is the only movie I remember, which closes in the middle and I absolutely do not intend to take it back. The plot was so fancy and predictable that I was calling, which would be easy in the next scene (and usually I'm not very good at it). The actors were terrible, I saw better acting in junior high school plays. Even the cuts were bad, the flow was bad. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a parody that forgot to play.
