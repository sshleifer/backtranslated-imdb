This movie is the worst movie, but for me it is very high. That's what a slass movie should look like. It takes place at a university where there seem to be only a handful of students. The teachers are stupider than the bag of hammers. It is filled with a good Catholic priest, sexually repressed humor. Bad hair, bad clothes. Dialogue is so dingy that it's hard to believe that I could predict lines in quotes. The cuts have a bit of creativity and they seem to revolve around stabbing people in the genitals. Lack of continuity in the soundtrack and characters who deserve to die because they are so bad, I recommend this movie for fun. Get a cheap beer and some friends, watch it and laugh.
