I saw "Paris Je T'Aime" because a friend really wanted to see it, so I went with him. Entering, I was indifferent about the film, but leaving the theater I really regretted that I was wasting 2 hours of my life sitting in this summer production. "Stories" are almost completely forgotten, except for the fact that most of them were terrible. What do Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara have to do with Paris? The endless parade of American actors definitely gave this French film a non-Franco atmosphere. Cliches about Paris were infinite. Yes, most of them played with stereotypes about Paris, but devoting so much time to joking about the French stereotypes, directly and unfortunately, they promoted them once more. Yes, Paris is a city of love. We get it. <br /> <br /> The worst segments are: directed by Wes Craven (Oscar Wilde); the one with Nick Nolte; mime one (worst?); hair products one; the one with Juliette Binoche (Willem Dafoe as a cowboy in the middle of Paris?); this vampire (When I think about Paris, I'm thinking about Elijah Wood). The one from Natalie Portman who really looked like Mentos and was stupid (a blind young man should know that Portman plays only a role when she called him). And so on. I felt infinite. <br /> <br /> I also did not like Coen Bros. It really plays with these Parisian stereotypes, but I do not think it's funny. Irritating. Gus Van Sant was interesting, but he was so small (and the punchline was obvious) that he barely registered. <br /> <br /> There were only two "successful" segments and they were about an immigrant, leaving the child in kindergarten just to look after the child for a rich woman. Nice irony. And a segment about an African who has been stabbed. This is the best segment in the whole film, but this segment has nothing to do with Paris. History could have happened in any city around the world. <br /> <br /> The last episode, the one with a plump, middle-aged woman, was also interesting, but the basic tone was bad. They wanted to honor her limited understanding of the French, but the segment began to be condescending. <br /> <br /> The whole project was forced and not inspired. Almost like the French government sponsored this film to promote tourism. In general, "Paris Je T'Aime" with only 10-15 minutes of interesting things was a terrible cinema experience.
