The Good: I liked this movie because it was the first horror I had seen in a long time that scared me. Acting was not so bad, and the killer "Cupid" was credible and disturbing. <br /> <br /> Bad: The story and plot of this film is extremely weak. It just was not much. The way the killer killed his victims was very scary and disgusting. I do not recommend this movie to anyone who can not deal with gore. <br /> <br /> Generally: good fear, but bad story. <br /> <br /> ** with *****
