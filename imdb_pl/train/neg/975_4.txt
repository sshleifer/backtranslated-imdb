I saw the director's "Woman On The Beach" and could not understand good and great reviews. This film is similar to that of two people who are involved in a relationship with very little dynamics and even less interest for others. Just like in other movies, you must want to listen to empty dialogues, go through very little and admire dissatisfied, quite uninteresting characters. If you think you like this movie, do not let my review stop you. I like movies in minimalism, but I think that Tsai Ming-Liang's films are much better. In the movies, Lee Kang-Shenga has a pretty great actor. There is nothing here. I would like the IU to like it, but I do not. Well.
