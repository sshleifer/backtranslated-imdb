Sometimes I enjoy really bad movies .... those that sometimes arise when people (even talented people) meet with good intentions to produce a movie and for some reason it turns out to be a catastrophe. Films like "Attack of deadly tomatoes", "Plan 9 from outer space", "Manos-Hands of Fate" and "Heavens Gate" etc. <br /> <br /> So when I heard that this movie "Rachel's Attic" was considered by many to be the worst film of the decade, I just had to see it. <br /> <br /> Boy, I regret this decision. This movie is over evil .... so bad it's not even as nice as a bad movie. Acting, filming, scripting, etc. They are even worse than a low-budget porn movie: the sound is terrible, the "plot" is completely incomprehensible, "acting" is ridiculous ... it's a complete loss of all time and money. At least a porn movie has porn to break the monotony, while this absurd nightmare has a guy clutching a rotten apple and a "crazy hatter's" tea. <br /> <br /> Lighting does not exist. Many "scenes" take place in semi-darkness or complete darkness, which is probably equally good. "Writer-director" (I use terms loosely), David Tybor, trying to get kinky scenes with enslavement ... but the results would be funny if they were not so pathetic. There is a certain nudity, but it is so fatal that it acts as a sexual suppressant. I could go on forever and not bring justice to all the shortcomings and shortcomings of this really terrible waste of film. <br /> <br /> For love of God, avoid this train wreck. I know that despite (or maybe because of) my negative comments, you can still be tempted to see if this piece of rubbish is really as bad as I say it is .... but trust me ... it's even worse than I said and absolutely, you positively regret the experience (and expenses if you are wasting money on buying or renting).
