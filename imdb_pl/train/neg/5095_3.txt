In the evening, I sat in the movie, forcing myself to do so, although I never cared about any character or what happened to them because the two guides, Gérard Philippe and Michèle Morgan, were the main movie stars of that time, I wanted to see them in "something other, "which certainly was. They both gave great performances, but with distasteful characters. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the whole film is about a vile town in Mexico, inhabited by almost uniformly distasteful characters (the doctor is of course the main exception). What Michèle Morgan has ever seen in Philippe to fall in love with him is never explained. <br /> <br /> This is probably the work of Jean-Paul Sartre. I could only think that if Sartre's work is similar to this film, it must be a very mediocre attempt to imitate Camus' masterful novel "Plague" that dealt with the plague in North Africa. <br /> <br /> a well-preserved, but uninteresting movie.
