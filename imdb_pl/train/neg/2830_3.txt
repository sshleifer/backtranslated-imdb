If Ashanti were a serious attempt at a film about the institution of slavery still common in third world countries, the film could be better received. Instead, it turns into a star disaster of the film in which the stars came, she spoke and chose her salary without much conviction. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine and his wife Beverly Johnson work for the United Nations World Health Organization and deal with humanitarian affairs in East Africa. Peter Ustinov is coming, who can barely call for enough ham to play the role of a Muslim slave trader. Because Johnson is black, he catches it with many children and a few adults. <br /> <br /> Of course, Caine does not come kindly to kidnap, and the rest of the movie is released in an attempt to save. The rest of the cast has people like William Holden, Rex Harrison, Omar Sharif and the Indian movie star Kebir Bedi in part and they look so incredibly bored with all this. <br /> <br /> Usually in such talented people as those mentioned above, they will simply be overly worried and feasting on the diet of the scenery. But Ashanti does not even do it. <br /> <br /> What an incredible waste of time. The aroma of the tax write-off permeates the air.
