Dynasty Revisited in Hawaii ... Full of stereotypes, highly predictable, unrealistic, and sometimes even stupid. If, however, you have nothing better to do, it provides 40 minutes of simple, uncomplicated entertainment, an endless look at wonderful male and female muscles and a very good photograph of the spectacular Hawaiian scenery. On the other hand, if you're looking for something more, stay away ... <br /> <br /> And by the way, if you've ever worked at a hotel or know anything about running a hotel, you have two options: 1. You'll be sick every two minutes for the stupidity and stupidity of how the Hotel Business program presents, or 2. Look at it as a science fiction comedy, like me, lie, relax and laugh it!
