If "Exorcist II: The Heretic" from 1977 did not do him favors, it's hard to imagine what that extraordinary Richard was looking at in this colorless exercise without emotion. You've seen it before: Burton plays a writer who discovered at a young age that he can move inanimate objects by the power of his mind (and you thought that "Carrie" does not affect Hollywood!). "Medusa", although adapted from the novel by Peter Van Greenaway, plays like recycled goods, although the special effects in the cathedral's finale are solid (if typical). Lee Remick is in some ways present as a doctor, but otherwise the auxiliary cast is very weak. Burton is sick, but tired ... even telekinesis can not save him at this moment. * 1/2 of ****
