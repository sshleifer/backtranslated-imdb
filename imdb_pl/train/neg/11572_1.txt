Slow, boring, extremely repetitive. No wonder the Weinstein company did not buy it. This Spurlock should eat more McDonalds while filming himself and give up production. There is no way you can watch and enjoy it. Preacher is a joke. The whole idea is not funny. You can make a 2-minute movie with this idea, not a function. I am so sorry that I rented this movie. I will never watch anything called Spurlock on it. This is completely rubbish. The creators of this type of video should be on youtube and never receive a distribution agreement. The film states that American consumers and their shopping are guilty of the current depression when shopping and buying products, thanks to which money circulates in the system and forms the basis of a healthy economy.
