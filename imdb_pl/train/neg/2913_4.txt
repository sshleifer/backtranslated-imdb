Of course it is very nice to see improvements in the Turkish film industry, but I would expect something more creative from Togan Gokbakar. starting with a script that in my opinion was not wise, as some might think. especially the cheesy of dialogues that put the audience in a position as if they were not intelligent enough to understand situations that most of the time make the movie unbearable. it also has an obvious ending; you can easily guess the killer from the very beginning. the weakest part of the scenario is the inability of serious mental illness of patients to behave like normal people, eg professionals right away! medical terms that even normal people can not use ????? !!!!!! and this scene was so suitable for the title "Dikkat Sahan Cikabilir" !! these are not the only weaknesses of the film. the film also had a lot of curiosity. the picture of the most dangerous patient was an exact copy of Hannibal, and the appearance of Togana at the very end is of course the worst mistake he could make in his first film! the confusion around the size of the film and the interviews given by the actor made people curious and forced them to watch. Gene is a total disappointment. I would wonder if Sahan was not so famous, would Togan be able to make this movie with so much budget? I hope that Togan will realize that he is not fashionable to play the role of a director, as he said in an interview. Hitchcock did it wisely, and Night Shyamalan continued it successfully! he should be aware of the fact that he is not yet Hitchcock or Shyamalan !!!! hoping that next time in this great industry you will be more cautious and creative!
