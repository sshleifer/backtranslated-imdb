I think I should start by saying that almost any style of work can be fun in parts. The real test is whether it is good from beginning to end, which is the reason why I gave the analogous title of this review. Most of us will agree - even those like me who like to read a lot of blogs - that blogs can not match good writing for many reasons. Similarly, FEM can not compare to good film making for many reasons, and I believe that this is a weak example of independent filmography. From beginning to end, MES feels like a connected vlog. (Hell, even MySpace gets a bit of ugliness.) If I wanted to see an hour lonelygirl15 - I do not want to - I would go and see. FEM, although definitely more rough than the gum-like chewing of these media, is so personal that there is no interesting story. It's like watching the mundaneness of life, which I think most will agree, it's very boring. And yet FEM creators want us to thank you, their very postmodern film about making a film. Cue my yawn. <br /> <br /> In the end, it does not occur to me not to care about it. I am shocked that I really am interested sometimes to write this review, even. It's not that MES is downright bad, because it is not; he has a few moments in which I smash a smile or think that maybe - only maybe - something will happen. It is rather that it is simply ... mediocre. I feel so indifferent that it almost fits the oxymoron: passionate indifference. <br /> <br /> I hope that the creators / "actors" in the film will free themselves of debts. They will probably need it when one of them moves out of life. <br /> <br /> See this video if you have time to lose and nothing you want to do; Otherwise, pass it on and do not worry that you missed a great, undiscovered talent. You really do not have one.
