A particularly malicious example of Italian cult cinema with a nonsense title to run (if at all, an alternative SIGN of Satan is even less important for the story!), This hybrid Horror and Giallo (with a strong dose of eroticism) only creates a flat atmosphere all the time? properly matched by the service, which is almost terrible! Here we have an ordinary group of people (an actor group) who are stuck on the island (to which they have been invited by the Count, since he fell in love with a leading lady, a dead bell for his missing wife)! The heroes are basically stereotypes: a middle-aged hero, but lush (played by Giacomo Rossi-Stuart and whose family history bears more than just part of the brutal tragedy), the heroine modest, slovenly companion (reminiscent of Mae West and emerging from the most annoying lot! ), docile, but devoted stage manager (forever confounded for his inhumane behavior!), lesbian couple, mysterious gardener (ubiquitous Luciano Pigozzi, who at least once hits the action, if I know what I mean), jealous housewife (nominal star Femi Benussi, though what is worth it is really a band song), religious fanatic butler, sensitive maid, etc. Film is not unobservable, cruel dubbing, cochlear tempo, shoddy production (with scenes depicting raging sea raised from some black and white film!), and the fact that murders take place only within half an hour does not help. Besides, the score of Marcello Giombini, although pleasing in itself, seems absurdly modern in these circumstances; Having said that, the revelation turns out to be surprisingly complicated (considering that there are no suspects here).
