A surprising misunderstanding from the usually trustworthy Larry Cohen (God Told Me Too, Q, etc.), Full Moon High tries to be so funny and fails miserably, even with decent Ed McMahon (!) And Kenneth Mars. Alan Arkin looks embarrassed during his performance, and Adam's son just looks numb. This makes Teen Wolf look like a comedy classic.
