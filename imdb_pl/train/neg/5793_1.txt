It really was that bad. On a par with (luckily!) Short-lived television series "Dirty Dozen", in which Ben Murphy performed and which was created at about the same time (also in Yugoslavia). <br /> <br /> for cast members of this movie - especially for Telly Savalas. He was too old and fat for this role (pushing 70 when he was doing trash), and the reviewer who draws parallels with Greek Telly and John Wayne in the Green Berets in this context sums up. > <br /> Other reviewers have noted the many funny hives that contain this crime against celluloid, so I will not repeat them here. I will add, however, that I am amazed that no one has yet mentioned the ridiculously small look of the helmet Savalas wears on his large, swollen head. <br /> <br /> I am also surprised that this wreck of the movie has an IMDb rating of 4.7. <br /> <br /> As for me, it's "1" on the other side of the board. If you want to have a good example of why flogging to death is a really bad idea (especially 20-plus years after the original) - look no further than "The Dirty Dozen - The Fatal Mission". <br /> <br /> Awful - avoid it !!!!
