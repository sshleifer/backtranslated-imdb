This movie must have been the worst horror I've ever seen. Acting was terrible, scary and cheesy and talking about a predictable story! I will never watch this movie again, nor will I recommend this movie to anyone. What a waste of time! First of all, just after starting the movie, I understood what I got into. Everything they did in this movie is copying scenes from many other horror films and combining them into one movie. Phone calls, Halloween night, psycho and one knife! It's absolutely funny. I was not afraid at all during the movie, which I thought was supposed to make horror films. When it comes to making a movie, it's very funny, as everyone says about how this movie was so great and so frightening. I mean, if you do not realize that movies are, for example, a cheap "Scary Movie". At least take good actors there, and then maybe it would be removed as a good horror movie.
