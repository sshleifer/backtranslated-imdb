Let me start by saying that I consider myself to be one of the most (most!) Open film viewers ... Movies are my passion and I am a regular visitor in my local movie rental company. ... I also feel the need to add that they often ask ME for advice on films whenever I get there, and I never think I can leave this place without a detailed discussion or exchange of ideas about what The movie cult area is happening ... I love to rent strange things and that's why this movie was recommended by one of the guys from the iconic video. He told me that he thought I had to see it, and because the cover says something about it being a film with an atmosphere of Jodorowsky (one of my favorites!), I hired her. <br /> <br /> The voice I gave here is not really fair, because I do not think it was awful, I just did not know how to judge it differently. The question mark would be more appropriate ... <br /> <br /> It's the first and only movie that literally got me sick: I felt physically sick! Am I the only one whose stomach has literally turned away? I still did not want to turn it off, or maybe I just could not, because I was paskudny ... <br /> <br /> I never want to watch this movie again. <br /> <br /> Not terrible, as I said, 1. Not my cup of tea (or in this case, vodka) ...
