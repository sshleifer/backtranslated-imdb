While the police detective refuses to believe nonsense about the return of vampires to the village, the local doctor treating the victims begins to suspect the truth about the crimes, "according to the summary of the DVD sleeve. <br /> <br /> Incorrectly titled, dramatically unsatisfying mystery of vampires. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the second level of the film easily overtakes the weak stars of the film: stoic Lionel Atwill (as Otto von Niemann), skeptical Melvyn Douglas (as Karl Brettschneider) and nice Fay Wray (as Ruth Bertin). The more pleasant cast is crazy Dwight Frye (as Herman), hypochondriac Maude Eburne (as aunt Gussie Schnappmann) and suspect George E. Stone (as Kringen). Mr. Frye, Mrs. Eburne and Mr. Stone achieve remarkable results. Is there another movie ending in a mad rush to the bathroom? <br /> <br /> Magnesium sulphate ?? Epsom salts? it's a laxative! <br /> <br /> **** The Vampire Bat (1933) Frank Strayer ~ Dwight Frye, Melvyn Douglas, Maude Eburne
