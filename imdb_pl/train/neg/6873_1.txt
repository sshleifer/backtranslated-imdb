Television productions in the early 2000s were weak and bad. Before signs such as (Alias, Lost, Prison Break, Desperate Housewives or Monk), the TV did not have the right hit, which could attract the attention and interest of the viewer from the 2000s. Titles such as (Relic Hunter), (Mutant X), (The Lost World), (Sheena), and even (Baywatch Hawaii) were not encouraging to watch and follow, at least they were not so captivating and interesting. the time that preceded them. (Special Unit 2) was no exception. In fact, Men in Black meets the parody of X files! (As if it was a special unit 1). But even in accordance with this ingenious formula; it did not work well. It was promising; in those days there was some saturation in the cases of "supernatural" after a decade of many X files, so the natural spirit did not want to do it either (imagine Mulder as a womanizer!). However, (Special Unit 2) was not the strongest or strongest when it comes to creating a comic science fiction TV series. It was very funny, where, for example, every sexy situation must turn into ugly disgust. He had this bad taste disgustingly. (Michael Landes) was non-charismatic and mostly unbearable as a comedian. His chemistry with (Alexondra Lee), as well as any alleged sexual attention, was all sluggish. Sure, the series looked ridiculous, but overall, it was an unpleasant song. It is clear that there was nothing more interesting than his main idea. Among other songs (Evan Katz) as co-author and co-producer, such as (Seven Days) before or (24) later, it must be a low point! Despite his characteristic personality, he could be a stupid joke most of the time. Therefore, if it was a goal, they made one of the stupidest! And really, it would be one of the rarest moments to be grateful for canceling the concert only after 19 episodes!
