Excuse me. Someone has to say it. It really was / was a boring movie. Perhaps worthy, but boring. I almost cried out of boredom while watching. Acting is very tragic, history drawn and predictable, the score and work with the camera completely standard and not very exciting. This is one of those movies that you can not hate (because it concerns people with disabilities), but I hate it, I suspect almost everyone. Interestingly, the critics were so nice to the movie. I suppose they can not be objective either. It was created to win prizes - which I remember duly. But it was neither interesting nor fun. I have not seen the game, so I can not compare.
