(Avast, minor spoilers in front of you) I got this tape from my local library, which keeps a copy for obvious reasons. <br /> <br /> Once I went to the town of Matewan in West Virginia and there in a small museum. I saw the schedule of the citra municipal theater in May 1954. The films would change every day in the theater. Because in these parts there would be no television for the next decade, it was the majority of entertainment available in the city. "The Raid" seems to be created for cities like Matewan in 1950. Although he was not on the list this month, I'm sure I showed it on Monday or Tuesday evening to the public, which probably was not too demanding. The historic raid - bold and extremely successful - did not seem to be too well researched, so the film is full of Hollywood ornaments, including the loose works of Lee Marvin. Marvin takes the opportunity to practice being Liberty Valance. It seems that Albans had more Yankee soldiers who came and went through the city than Washington. <br /> <br /> What really made me angry was that the invaders turned into Confederate uniforms. Only in the shoddy pictures of civil war, rebel uniforms look so impeccable. When son Anne Bancroft catches Van Heflin in uniform just before the raid, I expected the boy to think it was Halloween. <br /> <br /> And then there is Anne Bancroft herself. While watching the movie, I checked IMDb to see if there was another Anne Bancroft. The acting actress from that time looks completely different in his later films and there is no presence in "The Miracle Worker", "Agnes of God" and of course "The Graduate". <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing if only 1). do you live in St. Albans and 2). you have a few hours to kill yourself in the Hollywood story of the biggest message from your home town.
