You have been fouled and beaten in subordination by my harsh statements about "femme fatale" / "guns n 'gals"! Now comes another race in disappointing discoveries: ninja movies! I have seen many of them before and let me tell you that this is not all you need! They usually do not stick to this topic. This, among other things, has no originality! What does the ninja have in common with the prevention of nuclear annihilation in Russia? And is not there also a "martial arts" movie? Do a lot of shots sound like an amazing action movie for you? Is blood the number one reason to love it to death? Will you waste your hard-earned cash on a woman singing in a transparent T-shirt? Answers to these important questions can be found in THE NINJA MISSION, which should be in the martial arts section of your video store. To get even more nonsense Ninja fun, try to check out these Godfrey Ho movies by Trans World. You get what you deserve, and that's a promise! Recommended only for addicted to hardcore ninja!
