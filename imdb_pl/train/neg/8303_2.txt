Since the 1983 edition of A Christmas Story, the story of Jean Shepherd about his alter ego, Ralphie, has become a real classic. "My Summer Story" still has Shepherd as a narrator, but there is absolutely nothing of charm, and heroes are not near the caliber of the original movie. <br /> <br /> "My Summer Story" is in fact a mish-mash of mediocre and simply not very interesting stories, including neighbors from the mountains and fighting peaks. Charles Grodin, whom I normally like, is extremely unlike the role of a father (Darren McGavin more accurately deals with this in the original), and his character never seems to be forced. Kiernan Culkin is a weak substitute for Ralph, and his younger brother is forgotten here. Only mom seems to have any value here, or maybe because the manager of the cinema manager beans with a sauce boat, when he shifts his happiness too far from annoying housewives on a "free night". they are usually irrelevant and stretched to paper. It may appeal to the unusually demanding, but as a continuation of "A Christmas Story", it is very poor and not worth the time of most people. 2 out of 10.
