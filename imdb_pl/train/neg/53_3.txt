I study Catalan and I was delighted to find El Mar, a film with mainly Catalan dialogue, in my art store. <br /> <br /> Hmmm ... I was not delighted to see him. <br /> <br /> As other reviewers have said, it is well-made and beautifully photographed. Although the child's opening sequence is shockingly violent, it is well-preserved and convincing. (For the most part, I mean ... Did Mallorquins dismember the body in preparation for the funeral in the middle of the market, in front of the 10-year-old boy who died?) Well .... a small detail. Until then, it had something from the non-magical Lord's Labyrinth, also embedded in the Spanish Civil War. <br /> <br /> Scroll forward, and the three children who survived the opening incident, came in age. Francisca is a nun working in a tuberculosis sanatorium, and both boys, Manuel and Ramallo, are patients. I know, but hey, cases happen. <br /> <br /> The problem, as with many Spanish films (an apology for Almodovar's fans), is that with one exception (Francisca) the characters are so strange *. Their motivations, personality and dialogue are often simply inconsistent. <br /> <br /> What's more, it goes down to terrifying abuse. Be prepared for a lot of pain and a lot of blood. The reviewer, who called this "potboiler", is on the right track. If it was created 40 years ago, the poster would say: SEE FORBIDDEN LOVE !! RAPE!! MURDER!! MUTILATION!! FANATICISM!! WRONGING AGAINST ANIMALS !! BETRAYAL!! <br /> <br /> The opening sequence is not enough to make the characters' personalities and relationships credible. For it to work, it should have a lot of flashbacks to develop characters. In fact, it seems like a bizarre and depressing intersection of "Brother Sun, Sister Moon" and "Pulp Fiction." If it sounds like something you have to see, enjoy it. I think I'm going with something that does not make me feel that I need to shower to wash away the blood and darkness. <br /> <br /> When it comes to the Catalans, it's a dialect of Mallorqui, a dialect quite different from Barcelona, ​​although I was surprised by the commentary that even the Barcelonians apparently needed Catalan signs to understand.
