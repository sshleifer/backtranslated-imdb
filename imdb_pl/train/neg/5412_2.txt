Pyare Mohan can safely be placed on the black list of one of the worst films of humanity. The film, one of the many films for the disabled, which were created after the phenomenal success of Czarne, is a mockery of the disabled brotherhood. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan are only caricatures of disabled people. While Black presented the emotions and emotions of a disabled woman and glanced at her world, Pyare Mohan shows two desperate-like monkeys who have no qualms about being handicapped and falling into half of the world to protect their love interests. Anu Malika's music is fair enough. Vivek Oberoi, who started his career in Saathya promisingly, unfortunately loses his balls fast in the Hindi cinema. Fardeen Khan has never been an acceptable actor and deserves to be banned from the film industry. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol are just pretty girls in a difficult situation, having horrible times at Thialnd, without anyone who would save them - except for the desperately mentioned ones. Boman Irani, as the vile Don Toni, is acceptable. Avoid the movie if possible.
