They really can not be stupider than this movie, which has to do with 3 losers who are trying to capture the college spirit during the annual Christmas celebration at many of our high schools. The problem is that these losers are trying to do it 15 years after their student years, when one of them has the task of watching over the daughter of a senator who is being prepared to be the next vice president. the daughter is not popular, but of course it comes out of it all. The girls are undergoing drunken rage, exotic dances and other absolute nonsense. <br /> <br /> It really can not be worse than this awful movie.
