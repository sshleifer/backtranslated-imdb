Some guy is hit. Seeing the second guy shoots him. He has several bodyguards and kills the killer, but the reporter is starting to get interested. He goes to the hospital, where he took the guy who was hit. He enters and turns one bodyguard, but does not want to talk. I can not understand why. It's not like anyone else is interested. He is the only reporter there. In any case, her editor discourages her from working on this bad story. But hey, she does it anyway. He goes to his sister and we have a killer. A few minutes after she left, they went berserk. Someone blows up their trailer - a large ball of fire. Then he searches for a bodyguard from the hospital. He finds him on the boat, but a minute later both of them immerse themselves in the scuba tank, because the three guys are trying to hit them (and they blew up the boat - a big ball of fire). Reporter and bodyguard are killing two guys who are trying to hit them. <br /> <br /> In the next hour another guy is hit by the street, there is a shooting with several stiff legs in the warehouse, some car chases with a wreck and death, false suicide, etc. Lotsa stiffens, a whole kind of slaughter. <br /> <br /> Great things, but what the reporter and bodyguard can not imagine is why the hell the original guy was kidnapped. What is the motivation? Of course, this can help us find out why the reporter is even interested. By almost everything, she is the only reporter in this story. No one else cares about the media. Even with all the large fireballs and corpses. It's true that the original guy who was cheated was not a celebrity. His work was a bit boring. He was only the president. Yes, the one who lives in the White House. Oh, and the security guard is a Secret Service agent. <br /> <br /> Is this a spoiler? <br /> <br /> It should be. After all, there are no TV cameras, no other print reporters, no bloggers ... this is just one of those police crimes ... <br /> <br /> So what's the spoiler? <br /> <br /> Lemme think ... <br /> <br /> No! Wait! The spoiler is that his wife did it! Yes ... First Lady. It was released because the president was fooling around. And he escapes. It's really hot, huh? But how the hell could somebody come up with it? Why would anyone care? In the end, only one reporter is interested. <br /> <br /> I give this move "1". It was so stupid that I just had to look. And it's even dumber! It's a real spoiler! But even if I told you, you must see it to believe it!
