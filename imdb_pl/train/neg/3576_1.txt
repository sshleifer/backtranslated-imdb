Even when I saw this movie at a teenager, I was wondering how ironic it was that Pia Zadora played in the film about the artist who slept to the top. As beautiful and sexy as Mrs. Zadora, even she could not stop it, sorry about filming. Even her photo session to the Penthouse, in which "The Lonely Lady" was not promoted "in the day", can stop this film from refueling. The only thing that could save this movie? A completely different script. Let me miss it.
