I was one of several extras in this huge bomb. I just found the right place to work on the racing stages in A.I.R. as it was then known. Thanks to goodness, my scene in the first few minutes of the movie and I do not have to sit through the whole thing. It was a bigger party than a movie set, but hey, the pay was good. Attention to details was not a strong point of this, but who was to find out. really slow, then the movie accelerated to what was close to normal speed. Many scenes were changed when they were filmed.
