This is probably one of the most bizarre slasher movies ever, badly preserved and badly written. <br /> <br /> PLOT Five students stay during the holidays closing the dorm, but someone has projects on them and starts killing them one of the main suspects is the terrible guardian John Hemmitt played by Woody Roll, or it could be one from five heroes. <br /> <br /> ACTION Not so bad, not so great, except Daphne Zungia, who dies too fast and should be the main character, and the rest quite boring, although the main character Laura Łapińska sometimes has her charm and finally regret it. <br/> <br /> KILLING I can not really see why they forbid it, the killings look mostly fake, one guy has a cut hand in half at first, which looks really false, but others are pretty nasty as one girl gets a head overturned by a car, one girl gets boiled alive, and another gets burnt alive. <br /> <br /> OVERVIEW This is not really a great kitten and they were much better
