At a time when Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger were a paralyzing, hectic, powerful Hollywood couple, they filmed this (almost) scenic remake of Steve McQueen-Ali MacGraw's action thriller of 1972 on a runaway double. It almost worked for the first time, because McQueen was such an important presence on the screen - even a stone silent and tired, you could feel the ticking of the clock, its clear magnetism. Baldwin is not in the league of Steve McQueen, but he has his own charms and is probably a more versatile actor - if so, he is not a showcase of his attributes. Basinger is fine and he looks good, but James Woods is artificially hammy as a stupid mafia magnet. The sub-story with the participation of another couple taken hostage by former partner Baldwin was unbearable in the 1972 film. And it's even worse here. When it comes to action scenes, they are pretty old hat, which makes you wonder: why even convert the original? ** with ****
