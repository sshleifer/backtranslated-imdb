The only reason I'm commenting on is that I finally discovered why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we've all probably realized that at the same time this week, Dr. Cox is bald because they showed these episodes in a different order than they filmed. The last episode in which our favorite grumpy, loving Jesus sister Roberts dies, Dr. Cox shaves his head. He must have shown them that they did not act for some strange reason and forgot that they had slipped off the continuity. For shame, Scrubs. They had made such mistakes before. I remember how Elliot is trying to date Scott Foley, and her hair is wet for two seconds before the water hits her. I try not to notice, but my favorite program has to speed it up.
