I think it's overrated PG-13 shit! At least the performance of BRITTANY SNOW was good, and some others, such as IDRIS ELBA, were also good, but other teenagers at the ball, like friends, were not so convincing. The killer was so stupid and he looked so stupid. Deaths were stupid, boring and completely unoriginal. The film was also very boring and very overrated. It was not full of tension at all, I almost fell asleep. This is another bad remake of the PG-13, a really terrible IMO movie. The ending was so stupid that the culmination was very hasty and boring. The film is also quite slow. Generally, the only good thing about this nonsense festival is BRITTANY SNOW. I think she gave a good performance and IDRIS ELBA, but otherwise it was a terrible movie and a terrible remake. This is just my opinion. I gave him 2/10.
