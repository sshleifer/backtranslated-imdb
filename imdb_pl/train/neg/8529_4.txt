What boob at MGM decided that it would be a good idea to put the student Clark Gable in the role of an employee of the Salvation Army? Ironically, another handsome future star, Cary Grant, also played in the Salvation Army just two years later in a very overrated SHE DID IT INCORRECTLY. I think it's pretty easy to see the madness of these roles in retrospect, but I still wonder if the WHO thought that the Salvation Army guys are "HOT" and who can look at these daring men and see them as realistic representations of the parts they played. Long ago I worked for the sister organization of the Salvation Army (Volunteers of America) and I NEVER saw any guys working in the studio there (and unfortunately also me). Maybe I should get a job in the Salvation Army instead! <br /> <br /> So, for extremely interesting, it is a good movie to pay attention to, but for all others it is a bad magazine, sloppy dialogue and annoying moralizing that makes the film very slow.
