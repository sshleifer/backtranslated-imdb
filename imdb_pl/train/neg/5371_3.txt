This film was rather a disappointment. After a very slow, very intense (and quite bloody) beginning, the film begins to lose it. Too many storylines leave too little time for explanations, and when I came out of the theater I was wondering what this is all about. Characters remain shallow, history is not convincing at all, most of them are deja vints things without a trace of parody, and there are some very bad parts ... For example, a young cop must dig a body. Of course it's night and it's raining and it has to do it alone ... yawn! Or the manifestation of evil as "Nazism" plus "genetic manipulation" ... Wow, it's really original. However, there are a few nice bits, such as a fistfight scene, mountain views and some (running) gags, but (although Reno and Vincent Cassel do what they can), it's definitely not worth it.
