I saw it by accident one lazy summer afternoon. He played on the HBO family programming channel. At first, I was drawn in by what I thought was Disney's animation. But then, after a few minutes, I found the remote, so I could find 'INFO BUTTON' to find out what's in the world on my TV. I do not mind Harvey F., I like him in many of his films, but one is not, he is a teacher. Sure, he has one of the more unique voices in Hollywood, but works only as part of a larger visual package. Attachment to the sweet duck made watching slightly difficult. As for the rest of the cast, not inspired. I suppose that work on this film did not speak to a really good voice over talent. <br /> <br /> So weak voice talent, strong animation ... who was this movie? Homosexual ducks? I do not understand this. Are there really no models to follow for young and future homosexuals that we have to resort to animated ducks? A lovely story and like the title, this movie, which is hard for me to love, like an ugly duckling.
