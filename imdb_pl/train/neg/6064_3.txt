Good good. As good as the first season of John Carpenter in "Masters of Horror", it's a complete opposite. He certainly proved that he is still the master of horror thanks to "Cigarette Burns", but "Pro-Life" is probably the worst I've seen from him. <br /> <br /> It's stupid, completely devoid of the terrifying atmosphere and the tension is too long to welcome him, despite less than an hour of work. The script is nonsense, the protagonists are irritable and unattractive, and the conclusion is beyond absurdity. <br /> <br /> And for those suckers who actually bought a DVD (one of them is me); did you see how Carpenter describes this movie? He is really proud of this and talks about how he's doing his best job for a long time and praises the script. And on the path of commentary in which he notices the obvious corruption that led to the final cut, he simply says that he did not think it necessary to rectify the error, and he simply let him be there. I'm afraid the old master completely lost touch. I sincerely hope that I did not succeed. <br /> <br /> I want to leave a positive note and mention that the effects of creation are amazing. Technically, this film is top-notch, with effective lighting schemes and makeup effects.
