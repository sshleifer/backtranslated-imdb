The "secretary" is one of those cheesy, cliched, "thrillers" that are subject to watching on a Sunday afternoon when there is virtually nothing else. Although the plot (a woman with dementia becomes jealous of all who succeeded in the office and decides to do everything in her power to stop them) may be one of a kind, I have recognized the innumerable twists of action, probably taken from other television films, he was subjected to the same reason. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, I was not wild in the cast. Mel Harris is one of those actresses who appears in many television movies as a "mum" or "victim" of a dirty game or abuse, so you have to wonder what life is leading. In this, she has the joy of playing mum and the victim of psychic secretary Sheila Kelly, which was not a very good choice as a villain. While Sheila Kelly has made good moves in her career (Singles, Breaking In, and I'm guessing Law and Order), she's also plagued by a series of pitiful television roles, and that's what she adds. As for the others, I do not have any explicit memories of them, so they have to say something. <br /> <br /> This one will be played on the Lifetime network (I think I saw it there), but do not worry about watching, unless you're too bored with words. Not that it's more exciting for you ...
