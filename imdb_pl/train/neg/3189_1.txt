It probably proves that Joe Don Baker will do everything for a zloty. The concept of the film was not very good at the beginning. This film has so many bad things that I do not know where to start. Acting is terrible. Pictures are marginal at best. The soundtrack was very bad. The result is terrible. There is a reason why this film went to Mystery Science Theater 3000. I voted before I wrote this movie and I can not believe that 9 people actually thought that this "film" was perfect. They had to like two go-go dancers. The ultimate justice would be if they closed the stinking in the movie vault at Wichita and never let anyone see it! The score 1 in 10 is much better than it deserves.
