RATING STAR: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> McBain (played by Gary Busey, before the name became synonymous with the character in The Simpsons) is (usually) an unorthodox policeman who obtains results, but urges his superiors to something rotten. Avoiding the stereotype that his partner was killed at the beginning of the movie, the plot takes a different turn and sees that he was assigned to travel to Mexico, where a secret American super tank was smuggled with incredible firepower and imaging capabilities, just to be a hostage, together with crew, by a gang of terrorists. <br /> <br /> This cheap appearance (even by the standards of the 1980s), boring action movie was a bizarre move by Gary Busey after making an impression, the fiery, villainous character of Mr. Joshua in the Killing Weapon. He just goes through the movements with his cardboard figure here, as always annoyed and bizarre (with "butthorn" being his hallmark for bad guys), but without material that could support him. Henry Silva is present as a villain of the screen, but he is completely confused as an Arabian leader (in a red beret!), And a terrible script gives him some awkward lines of boring dialogue that makes his performance ridiculously wooden. He is one of many actors, including L.Q. Jones and Lincoln Kilpatrick, who appear but do not add anything to the mix. After a boring first half without many exciting activities, things improve slightly at the end, but it is too late and none of them is able to have fun. *
