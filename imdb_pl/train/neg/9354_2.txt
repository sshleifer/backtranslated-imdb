It is a key aspect of the movie that Jobson seems to have forgotten - he has the opportunity to tell a story, showing it to you. You do not have to tell the audience what to think, because they will see it. The action here is intertwined with the most intense narrative unleashed on the unsuspecting audience - the purple prose of the sensitive fifth former. And it should be unnecessary because it is a great cast and some beautifully composed and shot images. Maybe Jobbo felt that basic history needs a little support. He could be right, he lacked the basic credibility: in the 1970s, Edinburgh was not full of beautiful, rugged girls with a passion for Velvet Underground and a gentle point for a passing sociopath. From too-nice and new clothing that carries this character to the intellectualism of cod, who is trying to combine it all together, everything is too invented for my taste.
