Despite a few moments in heavy rain, encounters with a drunkard, as well as a miller with a gypsy and a monkey, as well as a stay in a sanatorium, this quiet comedy Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle is short with the support of Buster Keaton and Al St. John is just fun, though it's quite funny Arbuckle's sequence in a flirt with Buster, which is final in the "meet sweet" scenes, especially since it's one of the few moments when we see the smile of the Big Stone of the Face and laugh in movies! It seems that many scenes have been shortened, probably due to the abuse of footage. Still, if you're aristocrat Arbuckle or Keaton, Goodnight, sister! It's definitely worth a look.
