So what is it ?! I found Nicholson's plate and, unfortunately, uninteresting. The figure of Angelika Huston has exhausted my power. And Kathleen Turner is a dirty little slut. It's not like "I do not understand." It is not that I do not think that some ideas could lead to something more. This is a film in which there is nothing more than that we should accept these ideas, and this is what the film aims at. The fact that Nicholson falls in love with Turner is absurd, but on the other hand, it is supposed to happen. This, however, does not seem to me.) Funny, or b.) ... even a bit interesting !!! It was a waste of my time, so do not let the noise become the best ... it's a waste of time! Taking all this into account, the initial sequence of the church is quite beautiful ...
