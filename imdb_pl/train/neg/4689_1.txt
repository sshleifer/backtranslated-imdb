A really horrible movie made by director-director Ted Tetzlaff. A decent, good-looking film, but for a movie with a time bomb completely devoid of any tension. Ford, as someone put it here, lunaty after all with a characteristic smile. There are some details about the former Canadian army or RAF, disarmed bombs during the war, his wife leaving him, but none of these stories sums up too much. The bomber itself is a complete mystery. Why is he trying to blow up that face? In this respect, what time period are we talking about here? World War II or post-war? I assumed that the latter makes the bomber theme even more important. Generally, however, it is simply a terrible movie. There are many good time bombs that can be ignored. Watch any episode of "Danger UXB" to get a more exciting time, more or less at the same time.
