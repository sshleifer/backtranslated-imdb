This movie makes Peter an elf in Robin Hood's costume, not a human boy in the probably-no-Robin-Hood costume, and ignores all personality traits that really matter. This movie makes Wendy an idiot. And poor captain Hook TOTAL clown. And of course, because every Disney cartoon must have a character who has too many hits in the head, they did one of the Lost Boys. The only character who has not been disgraced in this movie is Tink. The only star is for her. <br /> <br /> The story itself? Darling's parents do not even have time to notice that their children have disappeared !!! This is probably one of the most important points in the original story and ruined it! Also the famous kindergarten scene between Piotr Pan and Wendy is a stunning piece - There are no thimbles or acorns - one of the small things that make the original story so special. It is strange that he even lost his shadow and she helped him keep him. (Even when it comes to his shoes and it does not make sense to me.) <br /> <br /> To ruin such a great story just to entertain children, should be illegal. Know now, if you do not know it yet - this version of Disney has nothing to do with the original story - which is not really a story for children, but just a great, great story. <br /> <br /> It just annoys me.
