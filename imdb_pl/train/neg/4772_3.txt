Before I watched this movie, I could already say that it was a complete copy of Saw (along with the place where they were and a black guy who wanted someone to break his arm to get out of the cuffs). The name of MJH on the film usually puts me away (ugh, can we say GROSS ?!), but I still wanted to try. <br /> <br /> Starting, I was a little interested. Acting is absolutely horrible, and I was laughing at almost every reaction of the characters (especially the man who played "Sulley"). MJH was even the worst, but I continued to watch. <br /> <br /> However, the ending was the biggest joke of them all! I was seriously in shock thinking, "THAT was the ending ?! Is this a comedy? !
