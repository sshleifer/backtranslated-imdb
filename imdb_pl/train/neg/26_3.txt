Assuming that it will not end in the "straight to the video" release, I would have to say that I will cancel this title at any price. Unless you get bored with good, well-made films. I saw it last night at AFI Dallas and I left with 20 minutes because I did not care anymore (about the story, not about insulting the director ... it's awkward). When only 5 minutes appears in the film (shot, smashed window before firing any shots ... and then the window breaks with the first shot), everything will go wrong. Let's say it is just an indicator of things to come ... unfortunately. <br /> <br /> I will spare you all the details, but this is below the norm in every aspect, even the half-lost actor Michael Madsen is disappointing when you expect him to be half-drowsy. And the rape scene ... Christ! "Close and take it" should never be used on the rape scene. EVER. <br /> <br /> 3/10
