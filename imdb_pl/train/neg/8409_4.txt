Eddie Murphy for the best supporting actor ??? What an insult to Alan Arkin and Djimon Hounsou. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx (who can play) goes through this movie like a zombie. <br /> <br /> Beyonce ??? It worked ?? <br /> <br /> This movie is paling when compared to CHICAGO or almost any other musical. <br /> <br /> Were it not for the great singing and performance of Jennifer Hudson, I would give it ZERO. <br /> <br /> And no, I have never seen a game on stage, so I do not do typical Broadway and Hollywood rap.
