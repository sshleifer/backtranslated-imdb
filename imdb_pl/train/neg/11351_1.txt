Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. appear in the MASSIVE commercial. and yes, my son was pulling us in to see it. Between DVDs and theaters, I've seen almost everything from prominent (Incredibles, Shrek) to really bad (Wall-E, Brother Bear). But it was the worst movie I've ever seen, children or children. It was "when will this stupid end?" Kind of experience? OK, it is aimed at small children (or better - it offends the intelligence of everyone who is over 3 years old), but I have never seen anything so predictable, repetitive and slow. Then, when you're fed up, but relieved that the movie is over, at the end is the bizarre thing that you think is a joke setting, but there is no such thing - it's serious, though hard to say, trying to achieve. Three-dimensional effects ... yes, if you've never seen the Viewmaster, it's a big deal, otherwise not (if you look at the screen without the glasses, it seems to be the same process). Even my son was bored at the end. Both my wife and I looked at each other and finally said "wow". Bad in every respect.
