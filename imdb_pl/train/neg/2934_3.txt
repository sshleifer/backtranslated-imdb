Simon Pegg plays the role of Sidney Young, a stereotypically clumsy British idiot who works as a journalist in this American comedy. After a very happy break, he starts working in a respected Sharps magazine run reliably at Jeff Bridges in New York. It's more The Devil Wears Prada than Shaun of the Dead. Kirsten Dunst, who works well with Pegg for laughter, is extremely interesting, but does not completely set the screen on fire with his passion. <br /> <br /> Sidney goes through several emotional challenges, trying to decide if he should forget about his journalistic principles to get material in the warehouse. Of course, he was finally seduced by the glamor and charm of the world of stars, especially the young star Sophie Maes (Megan Fox from Transformers). Fans of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and Spaced will wonder if Pegg himself has never experienced similar feelings in this film and how much he led Fat Boy Run as one of the best comic bookies in the United Kingdom ruined by USA /> <br /> In total, it is a forgotten comedy. Come back to us, Szymon, we can forgive and forget.
