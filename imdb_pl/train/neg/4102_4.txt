"Dead Letter Office" is a low-budget film about several employees of the Australian postal service, trying to rebuild their destroyed lives. Unfortunately, acting is weak, and the links between past heroes' misfortunes and current attitudes are clumsily and overly schematically represented. However, the most disappointing is the presentation of life in the office of the film title: there is no mechanization at all, and it is impossible to determine what the employees really do. Of course, part of the plot is that the office is at risk of being closed down, but this kind of office certainly closed in the thirties, if it ever existed. It is a pity, because the overall tone of the film is overwhelming and crooked, and there is a promise in the script: but few details convince. In general, it feels like someone who has not really experienced much real life; student film, with concept and outline, but unfortunately not much more.
