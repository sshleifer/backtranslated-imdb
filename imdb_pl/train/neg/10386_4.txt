Could it be interesting? a Japanese tale of a haunted house from the point of view of a newly installed American family? but it falls due to too simplified treatment and maladjustment of both the cast and the director. <br /> <br /> The film suffers from the same problem that I often encounter in the popular contemporary renaissance of the domestic tariff, ie that ghosts turn out to be bad for the real reason, besides what is expected of them! Besides, in the haunt department does not provide much? the gigantic crab attack is just stupid? as ghosts usually live in a specific character and cause them to behave in a very unusual way, e.g. Susan George seduces a diplomat / family friend Doug McClure and Edward Albert forcing his daughter into a bowl of soup! <br /> <br /> At some point an old monk appears at home to warn Albert of danger if they stay there? in the end he was called to exorcise the rooms. However, history has to be repeated, and the tragedy is the only result of a tense situation that has been duly created? leading to a violent but unintentional funny climax in which Albert and McClure, possessed by the spirits of their Japanese predecessors, engage in an improvised karate duel to death! At the end of the day, there is a harmless time? tolerated in just 88 minutes, but in no case is necessary.
