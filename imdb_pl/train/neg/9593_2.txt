Judging by some comments in IMDB, I was expecting an action movie - perhaps a dramatic or stupid movie or a simple or comic movie, but basically an action movie. <br /> <br /> Whatever it is that I watched, it definitely was not like a movie. The story is simple and simple (although the prologue tries to make it seem complicated). Take three interest groups: 1) government 2) rebels 3) group of killers. <br /> <br /> Take the first one (they never appear in the movie). Then just let one of the killers, Princess, become a rogue while on a vengeance journey. Add love and interest to rebellion with remorse. And you have ingredients. <br /> <br /> But they still could not turn it into a story or a movie. Between a few random sequences of actions and strange images trying to be Sci-Fi at a low budget, you feel a sense of emptiness. The film is simply not a movie, but a strange, incoherent, boring dream. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10
