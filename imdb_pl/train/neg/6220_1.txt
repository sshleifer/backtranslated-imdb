This film was a real disappointment for me. I've been a fan of Gram Parsons for a long time, and when I found out that they were making a movie about it, I was very excited, I got a VHS movie when it appeared, and I was excited about what I saw. This movie was not about his life, but about consequences of his death. I thought it would be a movie about going down with Grams Life and Music, but they had to make a movie about his death. I'm tired of hearing about his death in books and movies, I wanted a movie about his life, not his infamous death. I was very disappointed. I would like people to look at his life more than his death. The only good thing about this movie was its soundtrack. This movie is a disappointment for any fan of Gram Parsons.
