Yes, there are worse films. Most of them were created for fun, in the budget for shoes or as t.v. movie of the week, but even if it was a "movie of the week", he would rate no more than two stars. It is a bad film about a serious topic involving a battered woman who escapes from the king of slimy people to the protective arms of the king of stinking people. (If this is an attempt to show that he does not need a man to protect her, the wuss man is redundant in relation to the film and should not be in it). There is no tension, development of the character and heroine, which can outwit the Rotton onion. (I think he's flushing his ring on the boat with a self-contained tank, not just dropping her overboard in the ocean (where her body should be), and when her husband finds her, demonstrating that he's a moron, he's still making childish assumptions , which led to almost killing her.) I'm always amazed when I see that a movie like this is generally assessed and I realize that Dr. Seuss still has a huge untapped market of people who will be questioned by his work. After laughter on humanity, I cry.
