It starts with a nice note just to break down quickly and disappoint expectations. <br /> <br /> Mac (Akshay Kumar) and Sam (John Abraham) are not properly built before the boss of the Mac decides to hang him with three stewardesses. The rest of the drama is about how Mac, Sam and Uncle Mambo (Paresh Rawal) deal with situations that sometimes seem forced. <br /> <br /> About the cast, Paresh Rawal is a very talented actor, I thought he was wasted as a moody chef. Akshay Kumar is passable, John Abraham is very angry, he is still stumbling over furniture, and Rajpal Yadav is the only economical grace in the movie. <br /> <br /> The other half of the movie is sometimes fun but the whole DUD (songs are boring) and big disappointment if you're hoping for some healthy entertainment and comedy.
