If you have beloved actors, Peter Falk, Rip Torn, George Segal and Bill Cobbs, you do not need Billy Burke, Coolio or any other entertainment. Huge talent is completely wasted in "Three Days to Vegas", and the blame goes straight to the script. The movies from my neighbor's holidays are just as interesting as this wrong road movie. If you want to see how to use a casting veteran with a good script, check out "The Crew". There are really no redeeming factors here, and watching these great actors struggling with such a weak material is a crime. I wanted to like it, but the shallow scenario cheats the audience, basically giving the actors nothing to work. - MERK
