I like a movie that has at least a trace of history. This does not appear in this movie. This is a series of vignettes without consistency. <br /> <br /> There are scenes of a person collecting pineapple cans. A woman with a blonde wig never removes sunglasses. This woman shoots other people at the beginning of the movie and we never know why. It disappears completely after about 30 minutes. There is another flirtatious woman who endlessly cleans a man's flat. There are endless scenes on the joint fast food, in which Mamas & Papas "California Dreaming" is very overcrowded (I liked this song). Dialogue concerns mainly food (pineapples, chef's salads and ordering drinks?). I assume that most of the actors gained weight during this movie because they consumed many fast foods. <br /> <br /> There is no passion in this film because there is no history. It's supposedly an affair - it's not something like that. I wonder just why I missed Fast-forward. Waiting for something important? it is not so. Maybe this is the only consolation for this movie - the scenes have moved so fast that it made you assume that there will be a revelation for all nonsense.
