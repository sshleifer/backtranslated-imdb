ALL FOR LOVE (as it sounded when it was broadcast over the weekend) is a romantic drama from the era involving Captain Saint Ives, a French officer in Napoleon's army who is captured by the British and imprisoned in Scotland, where a young girl who visits and falls in love meets prison. There is also a plot related to the murder. <br /> <br /> I will be honest and admit that I was not too busy film because I am not a fan of period dramas and a somewhat episodic scenario, but I will say that everyone agrees well and has a good cast in which they perform Miranda Richardson, Anna Friel, Richard E Grant, Michael Gough and Jason Isaacs. Costume design, as you might expect, is also perfect <br /> <br /> I will be very surprised if this movie will not have any complaints after posting in BBC2 for an afternoon snack. Captain Saint Ives is in bed with a prostitute, where the nipple is fully exposed and there is a bathing scene of French prisoners, which includes the full frontal nakedness of the man, not to mention the murder scene, where the blood is clearly visible. You really need to worry if the BBC planners have any indication as to what they are doing
