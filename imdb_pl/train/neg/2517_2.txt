This movie is a perfect illustration of how NOT to create a science fiction movie. The worst sci-fi tendency is to make your theme a horrible, sophisticated, pseudo-orwellian / Huxleyan / iian "vision" of the "human future". <br /> <br /> Science fiction filmmakers (and authors), as maniacs, take very seriously, considering the high ratio of shit-to-good material in their genre. I think other genres with high CTGSR (yes, just invented, relaxed), like horror or action, and even romantic comedy, seem to have a little better understanding of the fact that they do not change the world with a deep "message. <br /> <br /> Sci fi can certainly be a serious success, as many great filmmakers have shown. But the whole concept, which is represented by "Robot Jox", has low profitability in the form of "the future" (lonely good element: bizarre, elegant ads around the world that encourage women to have more children) and its painfully heavy "Iliad" (Like ACHILLES FOR GOD SAKE! Actually, I did not pick it up until I saw the movie for the tenth time, but I went to public school, so the filmmakers are not fired.) <br /> <br /> Of course, if you're a crazy movie weirdo like me, this minus has a great advantage. I absolutely love these movies because bad movies are often more fun and sometimes even more interesting than good ones. I think it's the kind of Lester Bangs approach to watching movies. <br /> <br /> Note: the main role in this movie (Gary Graham? Is that his name? I refuse to check). . He does it. It's cool, especially when it's drunk / spins.
