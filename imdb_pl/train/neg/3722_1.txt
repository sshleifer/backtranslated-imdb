I remember being forced (yes - literally FORCED) to watch this movie by the southern Baptist preacher, when I was a child, and even then I loved his horror. It was designed to scare poor suckers to be "saved". The only thing that saved me was the fact that it was finally over and I could go out and have REAL life. <br /> <br /> See the chapter on this film in the book Sarah Diamond "Policy Policy Christian Right. FASCINATING. And certainly more interesting than a movie!
