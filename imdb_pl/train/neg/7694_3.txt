If you're not twelve, this movie really is not worth it. This is of course a low-budget movie with B actors, and a genre like fantasy sometimes requires intense CGI work that is not good. I knew it would be bad when I rented it. I like to laugh at bad movies. I did not know how bad. It is tolerable, until after 2 o'clock, it really starts to burn. Fighting styles take place between a normal fight that respects the laws of physics and the fight against the wire. There is no real explanation for going through. It has a story, but once again it is a movie for children. It seems that there are clear moral lessons from the day that is passed, like Sesame Street or something like that. It's bearable. But much better if, say, nine.
