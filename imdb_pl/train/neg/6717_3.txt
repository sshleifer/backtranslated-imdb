It was a terrible deity. History was everywhere and more often I was confused because of the horrible edition. I did not feel compassion for anyone because their characters were not sufficiently developed. They were extremely superficial people without dimension. Trashy, tacky stereotypes with threads that have not gone anywhere. The stripper's chick was just entertainment, even if she looked decent. I do not know what it was, but how stunned I was when they showed this sunday at Sundance? I almost canceled my subscription. One would think that such a channel will show more high quality films. There are many, much better gay and lesbian films. "The Celluloid Closet" is an excellent document. I really liked "Wigstock: The Movie". I'm sure there are others who were thinking about me at the moment, but I'm trying to say that it was not worth it. If you catch it on TV, okay, but do not worry about it. <br /> <br /> There were maybe three or four shots that looked really nice (sad that I could count them on one side), otherwise the pictures were also very bad. In many places the lighting was far away. I think some effects have been used to try to add something that practically had nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> I can not deny that Johnny Rebel is quite hot (of course without light hair). It is a pity that his acting did nothing to me. Hold on to real porn, buddy. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
