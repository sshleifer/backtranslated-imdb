The premise is amazing, and some of the actors, especially Sally Kellerman and Anthony Rapp, are charming ... but this movie is almost impossible to watch. The music sounds as if it came from some kind of internet website and texts as if they were written in rhymed open dictionary on your lap. Most of the singing is off. I think they could have filmed a singing paragraph and put in the music ... Dialogue is really stupid and banal. The film works best when it talks about real estate, but unfortunately it often goes into silly farce. I checked my watch after the first twenty minutes and after 40 wondering "when it will end".
