I rented this movie last week. I saw Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman, so it seemed promising. And so it was until Justin Timberlake appeared on stage. He is a really bad actor and should never be shot again. I mean, he's one of the most boring, boring actors I've ever seen. He does not put any emotions on any of his lines. Why the hell was he cast in the role of Josh Pollack? I think Matt Damon would be a better choice. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey was another big disappointment. His character is so boring that he seems like a bad combination of his characters in American Beauty and John Doe in Se7en. Maybe it sounds good, but believe me, it is not. <br /> <br /> Now Dylan McDermott's acting is very good. It's one of the few good things about this movie. It is simply inspired. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman is good but nothing special. However, it has some really nice lines. <br /> <br /> About history, although sometimes it was obvious and exaggerated, it was good. I was expecting a big turn when Lazerov (Dylan McDermott) died, but nothing really happened.
