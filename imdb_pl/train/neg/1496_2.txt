Evil Breed is a very strange slasher flick, which unfortunately is not good. The beginning of the film seems promising, but overall it is a disaster. Dialogue is very bad, but not as bad as acting. Acting is brutal and unbearable. characters deliver terrible lines there, and even if it's intentional, this method does not work because characters become annoying. Some of the killings are innovative, but it took too long to get to them. After about half an hour of the movie, we get the first death (other than at the beginning), then almost every other character is burned in the next five minutes. The film then transformed into a kind of deception with funny-looking characters, unrealistic karate like fights and a scene in which the man pulls his intestines out of his * sscrack. Nothing is funny, it's just funny. The film then becomes ultra-hot and ultra senseless. Most characters are stereotyped even for more modest standards and are just as solid as ter left on the counter for 5 days. The Bad Race is not even ridiculously bad, which is why it does not perform the main task. Watch the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, just before dawn, or See no evil for a real destroyer.
