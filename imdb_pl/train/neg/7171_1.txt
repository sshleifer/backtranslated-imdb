This movie seems completely pointless. There is no reason why something happens in it, as if it was written by a small child who got bored halfway and thought "how can I wrap it? And what did Jared Harris and Christopher Walken think? Did they do it for the plant? I could not tell you the story, I'm not quite sure if you can be quite honest, but if it is, then do not register. Jared and his bird go to Ireland after she falls down the stairs while she is tormented. They go home with a very annoying little girl, they meet Christopher Walken, who dug an old woman preserved in peat. He brings her back to life for a different reason than she keeps telling her story, and she shows her gratitude, immediately icing him. From that moment everything becomes a bit stupid. A few hours of my life that I would like back!
