This video has an interesting discussion. Is being a moral person good enough or do you need something more? <br /> <br /> The film says that without the guidance of God, being a good person is not enough. At the beginning of the movie there is a poem: "You and I can look at a person who is morally good, but both know that he will go to hell." <br /> <br /> Although I'm not a Christian, discussions on this topic during the movie they were fascinating, but not in the way intended by the film. I left the movie with a stronger sense that being morally good * is enough. The presented arguments and discussions were very biased, so much so that they would crumble with the burden of their own ignorance. Fanaticism can be a powerful thing, especially when it occurs in the minds of the ignorant and uneducated. As the figure of George Carlina in Dogma said: "catch them when they are young." <br /> <br /> The basic premise is very interesting. A biblical scholar from the 1890s tries to publish a book that says morality without God is okay, if morality matters. Do you tell your child not to steal? Or maybe you tell him not to steal, because God does not tell you that? (not bothering to tell your child not to steal it, because well, how would he feel if it were his stolen balls?) <br /> <br /> The author, Carlisle, wants to recommend his school, help sell the book ( to spread the world). However, he needs unanimous agreement, and one of the scholars opposes this. He raises, in a very interesting discussion at the beginning of the film, about morality for the good of morality versus God's argument. To prove his thesis, he produces a time machine (placed in the movie only to make the plot work with which I am okay) and sends Carlisle until 2002 to see where he teaches morality without God, guiding us. /> <br /> As it should be obvious, it has its own opinion and is changed by what it sees and changed at the moment of return (because it comes back, it is not really a spoiler, it's a movie movie after all). <br /> <br /> When it comes to the film as a movie itself, it is quite slow and quite badly working. Something that was not needed in this movie is that it produces two "bad guys" who want to know who Carlisle is, even if he has not hurt anyone, committed no crime or anything. What is wrong with the film that shows Carlisle's opinion, showing his view of this "sinful world" and turning him a new point of view? <br /> <br /> Also in the movie there are a few points that confirm that I'm happy that I'm not a Christian, or at least someone who says "It's God or nothing." Three at the end of the movie rather worried me ... first, when the two "bad" rushed Carlisle just before he jumps, Carlisle does his * only * really mean act ... pretends that his leap in time is the coming of Jesus, and it makes the "bad guys" (who are also Christians, strange) think that they have just overlooked admiration. <br /> <br /> Secondly, on the return of Carlisle, he finds a boy, in which he scolded at the beginning of the movie that he did not steal (but not to mention God, the kid kept the balls and ran away), and tells him the time that the theft is evil because God commands it. Like the above quote from Carlin, horrifying children in religion is a faux pas in my book. <br /> <br /> And finally an epilogue. Another fear tactic. Carlisle asks the inventor how far into the future they can go, and he says he does not know ... the epilogue shows him how to try to distort the Bible in the distant future (starts at 2100), and it fails ... constantly decreases 10 years old, and I try again, and by fading, he's about 2030 years old. Throughout the film Carlise mentions that the end of the world has come, because the world was full of sin, and the loss of the name of God ... the tactics of fright has been used for thousands of years. enlightened time, the Church would also enlighten. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I saw this movie. Although I was pretty sure that it was enough to be morally good, now I know it for sure. It is worth watching if you are not a Christian to confirm how happy you are, without being as ignorant as the people in this movie.
