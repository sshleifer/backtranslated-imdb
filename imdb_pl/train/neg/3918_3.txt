This movie may have been the biggest disappointment I've experienced in renting movies based on an IMDb review. All in all, I just thought it was a second-class movie. <br /> <br /> Leslie Cheung is certainly satisfactory because the anti-hero and Ma Wu deal with his character with serene competence. On the other hand Ma Wu makeup (facial hair) is so obvious that I just could not take it seriously. He looked like an overweight teenager, dressed for Halloween, with a beard at $ 4.95. <br /> <br /> The special effects were so, although the "undead" in the basement were pretty good. The language of the trees looked like something from a bad movie from the 1950s monster, although the POV shots from the tongue looked more like Sam Raimi's characteristic shots in the newer tragedy "The Bad Dead." The pyrotechnics were humming and the final battle is as boring as possible. (In fact, it reminded me most of the episode of "Lost in Space", in which the Robinsons are caught in a sandstorm and ...) <br /> <br /> The plot was not particularly original and was told countless times in the form of European fairy tales. There was no tension and no twists and turns. Actually, you immediately know how characters are presented who are good, who is bad and who will survive. <br /> <br /> I just returned this movie to Netflix, and then I sat down to write this review. First, I checked the date of production. Yes, he says 1987 ... not 1967, about which I thought he could be. And that sums up: Production and FX values ​​are typical for the 1960s. The story and the action seem much older because in the 1960s interesting and demanding films were created. <br /> <br /> ** with *****
