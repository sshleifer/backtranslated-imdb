Pretty horrible, but watchful and fun. It's the same old story (if you survived the 1980s). Vietnamese veterinarians fight together as pals against injustice in the States. A-Team meets Death Wish, my favorite! <br /> <br /> Time passes, the soldiers return home, and years later the colleague is in trouble. No, wait - in fact a friend is dead and his father is in trouble. Our first hero, Joey, is killed by an extremely terrifying (super-pointy) meat softener when he tries to defend his father's small shop in front of the local "protection" gang, despite being tied up with a wagon from the war. Desperately seeking help, the father talks to Sarge, the leader of Joey's old unit from Vietnam, when Sarge appears at the funeral. <br /> <br /> The shrill circle gets fat, and the old gang is saddling for the city. You can imagine most of the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that has driven me crazy is that Sarge is constantly telling people about planning and how they are really good at what they do when they plan ahead. But Joey would not have been placed in a wheelchair by a gunshot in Vietnam if the unit were not spinning around! Then, when the city is going really well, when they are fighting with gangs, they do it again. For no reason, they completely bypass their plan and try to nail the gang without anyone being present. Phh !!!! I raise my hands in disgust. Stupidity! <br /> <br /> There is also a suspicious moment when all current members of the unit make sure that they have tried the heroin they are ripping from the gang to make sure it is real. Every one of them. Hmm .... <br /> <br /> What are you going to do? I think I look like that. The film is not too scary to see it, but it IS a wicked person. There are all those culminating moments when nothing happens. The most dramatic things that happen are the ones at the beginning of the movie - explosives in Vietnam, Joey's death battle and a gang brutally kicking aside an innocent teddy bear (poor Teddy!). <br /> <br /> I guess the main advantage of this movie is that I feel disappointed. Even tangled threads with "mysterious helpers" and their bizarre cross motives were not enough to save them at the end. But one day maybe everything will go well and make a sequel. Hahahaha !!!
