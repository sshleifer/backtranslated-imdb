It was the new lowest level among the westerns. The letter is terribly bad, characters can not be underlined and are disgusting or bland, violence is terrifying and technically not very convincingly done. And Tobey Maguire shows us his reverse side of his talent, sleepwalking through his part with these expressionless eyes and his hoarse voice, which here only betrays mannerism. "Ride With the Devil" is one of my five worst film experiences, a western that can never be crossed in negative respect.
