I decided to watch this series after watching endless ads on the BBC in the weeks before it began. I watched him despite the fact that I do not like pretentious things that Alan Hollinghurst writes (I apologize to his fans, but I think we have the work of a new emperor's clothing with the work of this author). I admit that the game is excellent, it is beautifully filmed and I was quite entertaining by that - however - I discovered that the plot was extremely thin and after seeing all three episodes I felt very unhappy with this rather empty production. "Clear" homosexual sex, which was discussed in the media, has already been made several times on television - so I'm afraid that it was not shocking. Full marks for production values, but low for the story / content I'm afraid of.
