I am a fan of the Nightmare series, but this one is terrible. Deaths are so fashionable. If you watch it 20 years later, the whole Nintendo scene is outdated. I liked flashbacks. I think they should just prequel when it's still alive. That would be more interesting. This is a movie that you can take or leave. It depends on how much free time you have.
