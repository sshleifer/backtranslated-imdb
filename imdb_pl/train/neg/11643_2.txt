Although the title may suggest examples of the 10 commandments, this is definitely a mistaken assumption. This is an adaptation of 9 beautifully unrelated stories from the 14th-century collection of short stories by Giovanni Bocaccio from "Decameron". <br /> <br /> Placed in the majority of the peasant population of the medieval Italian city, it is a diatribe about the reality of sex (and its consequences) in this world and time. A realistic picture of Life in this world, sometimes it seems a journey in time. <br /> <br /> Given the element of his time presented by man, one can also see the more risky side of morality in his characters - and also the ironies of life, sometimes. It can also be seen as a general satire of the principles of the Catholic Church. <br /> <br /> Nothing really special, but definitely interesting, if there are no expectations or assumptions.
