I've read the comments that you should not watch this movie if you're looking for a moving Shakespeare dialogue. That's true, unfortunately, because all the moving dialogue, this wonderful spectacle, has been cut out and replaced with songs. I've read the play, and recently I was lucky to see her in this role, because she remains one of my favorite Shakespeare comedies, but this movie seems to take away everything I like. The Princess, though she did what she was directed to do, had no royal influence, and all the girls seemed to lose the cunning of their heroes - also affected by silly cuts, which not only took the female characters of a rare dialogue but took comments from the context - a bit strange it was to hear the princess preach; "We are smart girls to make our lovers laugh like that!" When they did not sneer at all. The reels throughout the film also disrupted the flow and took many great scenes, because they showed information in scenes after them and were in a modern phrase. In conclusion, an excellent game, ruined by a strange concept and foolish cuts. Kenneth, I usually love what you do. What were you thinking?
