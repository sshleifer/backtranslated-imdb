I am a fan of horror / gore and this movie was so bad that I felt embarrassed not only by "actors", but also a director and a bad juice producer who actually earned money for this schlock. <Br> <br /> You can expect a great slaughter from the title, some plot and at least some direction or dialogue. Instead, you get something that looks like a slightly more brutal and sexual episode of Three Stooges. At least I'm laughing at the Three Devourers. While watching this shit, I turned on another TV set and started watching Howard Stern until something interesting happened. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, I was constantly watching Stern. <br /> <br /> Watching this "movie" I realize that I was able to produce a movie with three monkeys, 2 DV cameras, 50 dollars in loose change and a damaged computer. This film is an inspiration for me to make a movie without a budget. Watch this movie if you dare, but be careful ... there is nothing to do here, but a lot of talking and very little action. This makes "KaZaam" look like a Meryl Streep movie. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the Germans did not forbid him because of sex or violence. Other countries must take this into account.
