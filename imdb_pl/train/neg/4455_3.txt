Where to start? OK, do not compare this movie to the fight club for a start - funny. Even if it was a patch in the club, violence, blood, gore, etc. They would be more obvious and realistic. Secondly, this movie is not a football factory - it is much more real (and Danny Dyer makes Nicholas Nickelby look uncomfortable). Alright, the story is quite decent, and the battle scenes are well choreographed - with a decent ending I can add. But the film is poor, seriously poor at all. When people mentioned that the accents should not spoil the movie - I do not agree - either a simple casting mistake or lack of effort in voice training caused the video to be annoying all the time - it was obvious from the scene that one American / Geordie played this role. Do not get me wrong, a good looking guy who looks great with the head of his skin - but not a football hooligan. I could talk endlessly about how absurd was the football scene - the situation of a "false steward". In addition, when GSE intend to play United in the north, they go by train, expecting only three of them - it does not make sense - it is a real gangster and bandit organization, which in the film is presented as a mickey cult of about 5 people. When it comes to accuracy - have not West Ham and Milwall played in the last few years when they were together in the Championships? Hmm, ten years OK. And I'm sure "Bother" will just be able to roll in the Milwall pub. Essentially, this is a very bad movie that people will like if they do not know real football and hooliganism. If you really love football and are intrigued by the world of hooliganism, you will just feel like this movie has offended your intelligence. Ross George
