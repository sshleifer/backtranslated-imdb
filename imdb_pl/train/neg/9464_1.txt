Well, the announcements looked ridiculous and I usually do not go to the cinema on the opening day, especially with my children, because ...... well, you never know. This is a movie that does not appeal to children or adults, because jokes are too perverse to children and fall completely for adult entertainment purposes. I was embarrassed that I was with my 9 and 6 years old and I have to explain to my 6-year-old what S H * T. writes. Basically, this is where the classics of Doctor Seuss are completely twisted. Adds an evil and lazy neighbor who wants to marry the mother of the children for her money. If it was a storyline, maybe it would be good, but in the end it would be the main thread around the whole movie, and the "cat" plays a subplot role in showing the neighbor to his mother for who he really is. Take my advice, read the book and upload the movie.
