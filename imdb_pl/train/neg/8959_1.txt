Some people may consider this movie a work of art - to be able to express their imagination on film to create a movie full of antagonistic pain and death .. Personally, I think that this film is a disgust that should never be released. This movie is revolting, illogical and meaningless. Not only is it a complete waste of time, but it makes you sick for days. The scary images shown in the film not only allow you to capture the air, but they are memorable and you forget about them for several days. Such a shame that people waste their imagination on such inhuman suffering. "Kill Bill" would be another example, but at least "Kill Bill" has its purpose, meaning, culmination and resolution.
