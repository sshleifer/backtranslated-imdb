the lowest possible result is one star? What a pity. I really intend to lobby IMDb for the "zero stars" option. to give this film even one star, MUCH gives you WAY. Am I the only one who noticed the microphones hanging over the head of the funnel at the station? and acting, should I say that they are missing? apparently talent was not a factor when the casting director arrived in the city. The talent show in my junior sister's primary school provides more scope and depth of emotion. and those fake Irish accents were like nails on a chalk board. The only thing that could make this movie worse would be ... oh, wait, no, no, it's as bad as it gets.
