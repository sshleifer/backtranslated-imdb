Absolutely the worst Burton movie, which seems to be worse with any film that he directs. A miserable scenario filled with clich√©s is only the first of many opposing aspects of this film. It's a kind of movie in which every time something happens, you'll hear someone shouting "he lost his weapon!". or whatever it is that everyone knows. Carter is really awful, just like Wahlberg, who can not play that simple and be convincing. Very cool effects and photography, but poor music in the John Williams plebiscite by Burton Elfman. Heston appears on a pointless scene to speak his most famous phrases from the first film. Very poor results. <br /> <br /> If anyone else saw "Sleepy Hollow" there, he would probably notice, like me, the declining quality of Burton's films. I have heard that this particular project has been produced by others and that Burton has been appointed as director, in which case his judgment should be challenged. But I think that he allowed all possible visions he could have earlier in his career to slip; evidence is in movies. In "Sleepy Hollow" he could not decide what kind of movie he made, whether it was a comedy or a real horror movie, and the population of British actors (Chris Lee, etc.) made you think it was a monstrous rally movie (never they are horrifying, as horror fans know). The film could not succeed in either horror or comedy because it was so schizophrenic and no style was developed to smooth out these two elements. "Planet of the Apes" looks similar, and the result is more like "Total Recall" or "Tango and Cash" than science fiction. He also fell into the routine of so many other "great" directors who try to satisfy the whole possible audience. Talk to Burton, if you are there - choose something and do it straight, or use the style to look together (as in "Martians attacks" or "Beetle juice") or you might as well retire because people like me who like me we are fans of your films, you will stop going.
