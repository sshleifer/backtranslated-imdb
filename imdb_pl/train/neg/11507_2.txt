Noble effort Guy Ritchie is defeated, knocked down, raped, kicked, shot, stabbed, spit, punches, sodomizes, abuses and leaves to death through Madonna's horrible performance. Her acting was very similar to a graduate of the Drama School in Al Gore and public appearances. Guy Ritchie did a bit of a noble attempt to do this, and if you rule out ALL of the scenes his wife was in, it's an honest movie at best. I think the best acting job ever was that Guy comforted his wife that her performance was good enough not to shoot again. If you have the opportunity to see Swept Away or trim your nails for 89 minutes ... go for an extended pedicure.
