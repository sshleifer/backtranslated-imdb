This film competes with "Plan 9" as one of the most stupid movies ever made. Always worry when the same person is: <br /> <br /> 1. Star 2. Director 3. Producer 4. Writer 5. Stuntman and 6. Editor. Unfortunately, Justin Kreinbrink has completed all 6 tasks! IMDb shows that he and his father were Western stuntmen. So maybe it was a problem. <br /> <br /> Here is just one example from the movie: in the film, the sheriff must take a witness to another city for protection. Of course, the bad guys will find out and wait for them. But what is happening? Good people are riding together and a shot is heard that hits a tree near them. When the camera shows us bad guys, everyone is sitting on the journal, talking. What is wrong with this picture! <br /> <br /> I can go on. Perhaps this movie was supposed to be a comedy. If so, it did not do it well either.
