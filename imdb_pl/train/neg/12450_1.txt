Ten minutes worth of stories stretched for the greater part of two hours. When nothing happened in the middle of the road, I should have left. But, hopefully, I stayed. And left feeling guilty for wasting time. The operation was OK, but the plot is so clear and weak. The script is just as bad as it gets, but again, pulling out a ten-minute story does not leave much room for a good dialogue.
