This movie was terrible. The first half hour is very similar ... sorry for the lack of articulation, but it was just a bad version of A Clockwork Orange. The first scene is almost photocopied from one of the first in Clockwork! Apparently it was a tribute, as for the appearance of the Clockwork poster on the wall of the hero, but the "ripoff" is more appropriate word. The film seemed to be torn straight from the classic Kubrick, filmed only by the eyes of the new director. Blind director. Unfortunately, when the Kubrick's massacre stops, the film becomes even worse. As another commentator said, the depth of the film is simply pushed down the throat. Arrogant, self-absorbed and ultimately pointless nonsense. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the protagonists 'quarrels would have touched the nerves if any of the characters' development took place in this film. I felt absolutely nothing for this guy. And I'm an alcoholic, so I think if someone could feel something for him, I would be me. Scary character development, dialogue and story. <br /> <br /> The title is the worst part of the movie. In the case of a film called "16 years of alcohol", alcoholism does not matter. See the first paragraph - it was such slaughterhouse A Clockwork Orange that I can not accept it. A more appropriate title would be "16 years of violence" and even better "A Clockwork Banana". <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie. If you disregard my advice and you pull it out anyway, drink it. Trust me.
