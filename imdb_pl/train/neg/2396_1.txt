I just saw this movie on TV and I have to admit that I was a bit surprised that even on it. There were so many fools, clutter and bad editions that it was better to watch the old episode of Sesame Street. Acting was fine, but please, you can really feel "Straight to Video". The cast / crew made the film a bad melodrama. Yes, there's a message in the video, but wait ten minutes before it ends to hear it. Trust me, you would not even notice the difference.
