(Some possible spoilers) <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what Dreamworks was thinking when they decided on 80 million dollars for this extremely tired and bad animated movie. They probably thought that a spectacular animation would be enough to attract viewers (mainly families) to the crowd. It seemed to work on the opening weekend, he earned $ 26 million more or less and earned $ 38.1 million. total (respect for this weekend). But I think that the viewers who came in the weekend saw almost the same thing as me when I saw and spread the word. This is one of the most lame movies, apart from the animation everything else, mainly the script seems to be performed by a three year old. <br /> <br /> The film lasts only about 80 minutes. long, but it feels like a three-hour epos. A few unpleasant points are for me, well, the annoying narrative is one of them, and it is so obvious. At some point, he flees from certain kidnappers and even if you see that the horse is clearly frightened, the narrator pops up (voice of the talented Matt Damon) to clear up any misunderstandings (which would only happen in the simplest way of thinking. <Br /> <br / > Another is the constant appearance of Bryan Adams' songs, now I am a fan of his music, I think it is good, but come Dreamworks really thought that viewers would be able to handle 8-9 of his songs in such a short film, I certainly could not, finally, and here is a spoiler, the horse is shot by a member of Calvary, no less, she (horse) falls into the raging river, Spirit (fire) tries to save her, but both pass over the waterfall, which must have at least a 50-meter drop and later in the movie at the end we see that this horse is alive and well, I know it's a movie for children, but even that small amount of realism is unacceptable To sum up, this is a really bad rival, I do not say that children will not like it, but everyone else will check their watches just waiting for the ending of guts. Definitely on my Top 10 list this year. - ** with 4 stars. <br /> <br />
