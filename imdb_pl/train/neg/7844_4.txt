No one goes to a movie like The Hills Have Eyes 2 and expects the second coming of Citizen Kane. The same applies to most of the low-rent horror films, especially those that Roger Ebert called "films of dead teenagers." The Hills Have Eyes 2 definitely qualifies as a movie with a dead teenager, only here the teenagers received the superficial appearance of the military interns. <br /> <br /> Some say "it's just a movie" when dubious facts are brought up in a movie review, but I've always believed that everything was fine, all good fantasies must be rooted in reality. In Hills Have Eyes 2, we believe that the main heroes are military people during training, but they look and talk like kids from high school at the campsite. Dialogue is terrible and often vulgar to excessive. Although the movies are not nearly comparable, I imagined that the "soldiers" are in the platoon and are trembling with terror. <br /> <br /> Very few characters evoke a soldier other than rifles and fatigue: radio transmissions are carried out like teenage phone calls; The colonel turns to "Private" as "hey, asshole". And it seems that no one has the slightest idea what to do, or any sense of command structure when things start wrong. I'm thinking about the soldiers from the film The Stranger by James Cameron, the film about pure fantasy and that even those futuristic Marines behaved like real soldiers, despite fantastic situations. Fantasy rooted in reality. <br /> <br /> I'm trying to start watching the movie as a 5 in a scale of 10 and assess its strengths and weaknesses. You must allow concessions for the material; there's no way Star Wars can be as good as the Godfather movie on equal terms. But both are excellent examples of their type. <br /> <br /> In this respect, while Hills Have Eyes 2 is quite a terrible exercise in amateur and immature writing, in this respect it is only slightly worse than the typical Dead Teenager Film. From a technical point of view, the film seems to have decent production values ​​and is quite well made from this perspective. Scenes that are intended to shock or which are intended to evoke an urgent character or tension usually work. So, watching The Hills Have Eyes 2, it can actually be a fate worse than death, there is certainly much worse horror cinema in circulation. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching for those who like this type of stuff without the usual fanboy's luggage or those who have no tendency to think that every movie they see is either the Best or the Worst ever. If you do not "get" a horror movie, especially Dead Teenager variants, you probably will not have fun with it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
