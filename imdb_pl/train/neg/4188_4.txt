I am a great expert on the music of Neil Young, and with her and the great praise of the film she received in many alt-indie press circles, I found the first Greendale show I could find. My excitement was short-lived, because this turbulent plot and weak lyrical impulse meant that most of the filmmakers fell asleep or disappointed. <br /> <br /> Neil says that the movie began as a soundtrack, and the characters came alive so much that I just filmed the soundtrack. Not the best way to make history. No character really has a bow, and when there are "significant" events, the viewer does not care because the level of irritation of the film technique is so high at this point. The film is a song, and for this purpose, the characters at the end of the songs are singing lyrics ... the technique works on the first stanza, which is performed, and then plays on the nerves. This is not real or false, it is simply undesirable. <br /> <br /> Horrible acting, in which the characters find one mood and play together. Poor lighting sometimes. The only vocabulary I can give to a film concerns a few scenes shot in the form of a message, but this technique is so used in the cinema today that this film did not do much. Good soundtrack, but I can not buy anything quickly. Bad movie.
