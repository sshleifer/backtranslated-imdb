I watched the movie for two hours and I do not know what's going on. Someone was murdered, maybe not, or maybe someone did it, maybe not. It brought back the memories of the good old days (bad old times?), When all Canadian CBC movies were smelly. The last stinker was an exception, but this tangled circle of fashionable feminism, a brilliant mind and mute dialogue make up for the lost time. I never considered Margaret Atwood's books easy to read. This film continues this amazing Canadian tradition. It is not easy to watch. Maybe trendy people at chi chi cocktails in Toronto will pretend to like them. We, people in feasts, are a little less pretentious.
