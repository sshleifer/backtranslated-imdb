This must be the cheapest movie from the 21st century. It's low quality, but it's finally falling below ... everything. All cheap tricks - such as flashing and dark - are used to hide these unfortunate computer effects. <br /> <br /> All actors are below average, especially the main character Anne Fletcher (Simmone Mackinnon). There is a scene where Anne is asked, "Why do you seem so careless?" The correct answer is because it can not work. No matter what happens (the world is to be destroyed, her friend dies, she is released), she has the same stupid smile on her face. <br /> <br /> It's not only the movie that's B-quality. This is also a description of the back cover (at least in Finland). The text mentions things like Lorica Gray -vessel, Capital -vessel and the main character Garrison Harper and Anna (not Anne) Fletcher. The description sounds like another movie, both with the character called Fletcher and sea monsters
