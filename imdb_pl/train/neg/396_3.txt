I saw it when it was in the theater, it started so strongly that I mean in 1980, it was a bold movie, and the special effects were excellent at that time. Now, to really understand this point, you would have to be at least 30 years old in 1980. Because studying the film historically omits the attitude of the mind at this time and other related psychological factors. Now, as I said, the movie was full of tension and very funny. It builds to a great climax .... It ends, I mean the person who described it as having a balloon bursting with water in his hand before throwing it away, except that it is a very poetic description. In my experience, it was not strong enough. My wife and I were fine ... how can I say that? We were nervous, that is, we paid the money, we invested time to watch a movie that was perfect. "We both felt that we were robbed of the ending, which convinced us that the producing company must end up with money and could not rise enough to finish it properly. In fact, my wife said it best, it did not end there, ONLY STOP!
