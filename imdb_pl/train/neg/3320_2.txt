Honestly, I had some high expectations when I first started watching this movie, but it turned out to be probably one of the most boring movies I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> First, the pace is incredibly slow, so it seems that it is much longer than it is (and it is not short). I'm sure that when Jane Austen wrote a book, she did it on a few pages, filled it with a description and did not intend to read people one day, it could pull and lose the appeal that "Emma" certainly did. Now "Sense and Sensibility" had this disadvantage of slow pace, but at least it had live lines to compensate for it, as well as some good performances! <br /> <br /> This brings me to error # 2, which of course works. Although I do not care if anyone is involved in this movie, I'm sure they are capable of a good job, but I have not seen much in this film. It was as if people were trying too hard to be witty, too difficult to be a "higher class", too difficult to be British (well, some of them), so everyone just left as a group of actors, not as people. <br /> <br /> # 3. The cast, as I said, seemed to be just an actor, and actually it was not like the people they played. Maybe it's good because the people they played in really were not so nice. Why, for example, did everyone like Emma? Sure, she was nice to rich, handsome people in front of them, but it was a terrible rumor behind them. If her friends were "ugly," she did not even bother to go behind them. So why is this girl so great? Why do people have to tell stories, "to make her laugh?" Of course, the snob could not even do it right. I have enough problems with Gwyneth Paltrow as Gwyneth Paltrow, and her "Emma" did not exactly change my opinion. <br /> <br /> Well, it's easy to see that I did not care. I'm sure it's a beautiful book and everything, but some books really should not be made on a big screen, and "Emma" is one of them.
