I saw it at the Edinburgh Film Festival. That was awful! Every stereotypical, violent, rich fantasy of the boy was visible, you just knew how it would end, especially with all the chef's wife's shots and the first girl in a rape. <br /> <br /> The worst was questions and answers with the director / screenwriter and screenwriter / producer with whom they tried to meet as intellectuals, but you can say that they are types that resort to violence. I bet they often visit brothels and drugs. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. I had to stop my boyfriend from leaving him.
