Reading all these positive reviews, I'm surprised. How is it that so many enjoyed what I think is a pitifully bad adaptation of my other favorite novel, Jane Austen? There are many problems with the film, already mentioned in several reviews; it is simply a hammer-up, over-acted, chintzy mess, from opening loans to slaughter. <br /> <br /> While many characters are poorly manned and neither Ewan McGregor nor Toni Collette put up such a show worthy of them, the worst is definitely Paltrow. I really liked her performances in some roles, but here she is disgusting - she is aware, nasal, messy and completely disconnected from heroes and people around her. Extremely disappointing effort - even though perfect Emma could not save this movie.
