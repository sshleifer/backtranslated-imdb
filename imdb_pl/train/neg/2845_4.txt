This film moves from the fourth to the first without bothering the third or second, polishing the gears to the finish line. Con at the beginning is easily the best and wisest part of the movie. It is worth seeing. The scene with Harlow in the bathtub appears so fast that you can miss it. It is definitely not worth the whole ballyhoo delivered by Robert Osborne in his TCM introduction to this bad to average confusion. There is no real conflict, and all characters in this alleged margin society turn out to be saints - especially the incredible figure, Al. I wonder if he has a job for me in Cincinnati?
