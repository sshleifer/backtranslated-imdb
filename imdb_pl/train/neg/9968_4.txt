As a former teacher (!) I have to admit to cultivating many scenes - although I still watched until the end. I wonder why?! (Maybe boredom?) :-) <br /> <br /> The initial opening scenes struck me as incredibly disordered and out of focus. The plot also, although good ideas appeared - for example, the difficult situation of a humanitarian teacher - was not sufficiently concentrated in any direction of three-dimensional development. <br /> <br /> This is not one of Mr. Nolte's better solutions. When it comes to young Mr. Macchia, does he say that in * each * film? <br /> <br /> Apart from the plot and complaints, the hairstyles themselves were a nostalgic (if nauseating) journey. <br /> <br />
