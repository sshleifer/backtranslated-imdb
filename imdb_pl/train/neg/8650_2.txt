If it were not for some immature, naive idiot, I know I'm going to insist that I watch this "documentary", I would never see this comedy! This movie is full of bad scenarios and funny moments. One of them is especially that Afghan police / soldiers arrest Don Larson for filming on the streets, while they allow the operator to film his arrest, and then leave, still filming, probably to his plush hotel. There is also a scene in which the car falls into another car, which has been turned upside down and nicely parked on the side of the road, without any evidence that it is in an accident or an explosion. <br /> <br /> I am surprised at the current rating she has (5,8 / 10). I thought IMDb users have more sense.
