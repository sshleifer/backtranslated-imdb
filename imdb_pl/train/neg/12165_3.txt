And so Angela grew up and received therapy and surgery to transform her into a real daughter of life, not a son she was born with, and now she has a job - wait for it - a camp counselor! How appropriate, right? I know, I love it. In any case, the first continuation of the Sleepaway Camp series is consistent with all the horror rules: more blood, more fancy killings (which are not clever, but still more than the original), more nudity, more sophisticated plot and generally worse than the original. <br /> <br /> It's funny in the same way as the original, because the characters and cabinets are so stupid and genuinely 80th that you can not help laughing. At some point, the guy asks Angela, and she says, "I'll call you," and then he quickly leaves. The guy says to himself, "How will she call me? I do not have a phone! "And then sniffs under the armpits, wondering what discouraged her (this is hair, old !!). <br /> <br /> It is well known that in the 1980s movies of murdered teenagers were more often than not being punished by their killer for any bad behavior, usually for being too loose. When I started getting into horror movies and for the first time I saw Friday movies from the mid-90s, I did not realize it. I learned it in the film class a year or two later and I was amazed that their method was crazy. I was impressed not only by the fact that the films passed on a message, although morbid, but in fact there was some thought in it. <br /> <br /> But not in this movie! At some point, before Angela kills one of her victims, she says, "Let this be a lesson for you. Say no to drugs! "A real subtle screen there writing, guys. Again, dialogue is the most fun thing in the movie. Angela (who, incidentally, went through all this therapy and these operations and all these troubles to clear her past and rediscover herself as a normal and well-developed person, and then she changed her name from Angela to, umm, Angela), says at some point: "I do not like being a wicked witch from the west, but I know what happens when things get out of control." (People start to be killed ... by me! HA!) <br /> <br /> Then he demands one of the advisers, Mare, apologize, to which the girl replies: "I would rather die!" I'm sorry, Mare, but you you really did that ... <br /> <br /> Two years ago I was a camp counselor in a camp similar to the one in this movie (except for the camp where I taught more than three children to 15 or 20 advisers and he also had rules that are not in the film, which caused me to notice the innumerable discrepancies in the film about how camp life really looks. <br /> <br /> All right, you can not make a movie because it's close 9-year-olds, although 10 or 11-year-old children have been killed in this film, I've never seen such things before. <br /> <br /> Definitely bad taste, even for a bad movie from the 80's ....
