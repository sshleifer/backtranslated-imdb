Why am I still doing this? I mean, really, it's in the title - "The Incredible Melting Man". What else could I expect? I must admit that I'm a sucker of almost everything I encounter in the Monster HD channel, but the only advantage of this photo will be the truly grotesque work of the legendary Rick Baker makeup. As for the frightening, I nod my head at this horny old steam of lemon suckers just before the lights go out. Now they were really scary. <br /> <br /> Something I could never understand in horror movies was the reason why the victims of monsters would not just run away with a virtual doom. Like a chick in the cabin. You know, there was a completely visible door in the kitchen that she could leave at any moment. The amazing Steve-O could not collect more than a quick march, so why not throw it straight at him? I do not know, maybe something is missing. <br /> <br /> This movie had something from the "Tales From The Crypt" episode, but "Tales" usually had a nice or grotesque accent that often did not show up. It was one photo that could not be dealt with when entering OR. For example, in the early stage, it can be clearly stated that Melting Man's eyeball fell out of his head, so how did he manage to get around the rest of the story? I do not think we should ask. <br /> <br /> After eighty-four minutes, this photo took about an hour and a half for too long. When it was all over, I was ready to take care of General Perry on his earlier suggestion - "I could really drink now."
