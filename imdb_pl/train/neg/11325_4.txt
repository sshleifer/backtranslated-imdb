In the wasted wilderness of the future, humanity is terrorized by Cyborg robots with human traits that have discovered a new source of fuel: human blood. Led by their malicious leader Jōba (Lance Henriksen), the Cyborgs are preparing to overtake Taos, a densely populated human institution. <br /> <br /> Only one force can stop Josh's death march? Cyborg Gabriel (Kris Kristofferson) who is programmed to destroy Jōba and his army. <br /> <br /> In the ruins of the ransacked village, Gabriel finds Nea (Kathy Long), a beautiful young woman whose parents were killed by the Cyborg ten years earlier. Now he wants to get revenge. They made a pact: Gabriel will train Nea in the fight against the Cyborgs, and Nea will lead Gabriel to Taos. <br /> <br /> Five-time kick-boxing champion Kathy Long has all the right moves in this quick adventure that provides lots of action. There are also Gary Daniels (as David) and Scott Paulin (as Simon).
