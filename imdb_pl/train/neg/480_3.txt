2 stars for Kay Francis - it's wonderful! And she did not deserve the horrible tripe that Warner Bros. had. <br /> <br /> The ambiguous premise on which this film is based is absurd and unbelievable. Kay is a small-town wife and mother who wants something bigger: she wants to become an actress. When the big actor comes to the city and invites Kay to his hotel to talk about the possibilities, Kay tells her husband that he is going to the cinema. The poor mother of her hubby put a bug in the hubby's ear that Kay is not truthful and sets out to search. It is the actor in the hotel (only talk!), And he knocks the guy who falls on the railing, landing face pond (lake?) And dies. Here are two unbelievable premise on which the rest of the film: <br /> <br /> 1) the judge tells the jury that if it was established that the man died * before * his head entered the water, they must find a hubby guilty of murder in the first degree. (Whaaaaa ???????????????????????????????????????????????? ???????????? \ t that he could be sent to prison for life. Whatever.) <br /> <br /> 2) the lawyer hubby, after conviction and sentencing, Kay says that it all HER wine. His reasoning is that if she had not gone to the actor's room, her husband would not have to follow her and beat a guy and kill him. He tells her that he is guilty, not her husband, and she nods and agrees. What. The. Hell?!?!?! The rest of the film lies in the fact that Kay is trying to gain fame and money to free her husband from prison and repair the harm he has committed, causing the first he killed the actor. <br /> <br /> I can not even continue this review. The film was too painful. Four years earlier, in the days preceding the code, you would never have caught Kay playing such a wimp! However, in real fashion, Kay Francis did everything in her power to convince us that this woman is a credible figure. I give a lot to her for trying to breathe life and credibility of this ungrateful role. This character was far from the pre-code roles of Kay and the real spitfire of Kay Francis. <br /> <br /> Steer away from this! There are many better vehicles of Kay Francis! (From personal experience, I can highly recommend Mary Stevens, MD and Jewel Robbery, are also good Dr. Monica and One Way Passage. I'm sure there are other great movies Kay, but I only mention the ones that I've seen and I can recommend.)
