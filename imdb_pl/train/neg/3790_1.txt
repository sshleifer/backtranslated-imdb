I do not publish comments, but I wanted to warn people about this film. This is an unfinished student film that has no exchangeable functions. At the technical level, it is completely amateur - continuous unintentional edits of jumps in stages, dubbing in the wild, etc. The plot is completely banal, the structure is ridiculous, and the acting is embarrassing. I do not want to be too harsh: I did my part in student films and they were all horrible, but there is no reason for this film to be in the world, where innocent fans will have to see it. /> <br /> A safe assumption that - like cast - positive comments are filmmakers, friends and family.
