Okay, I watched the movie twice, I checked it online, asked a few people for feedback. I even came to read the original Sheridan Lafana Classic "Carmilla", the book on which this movie is supposed to be based. I believe that the best way to check this video is to describe the game that you want to play when you watch it. Because the plot of the film does not seem to make any sense, here is the plot of the book. <br /> <br /> Laura lives with her father, Mr. De Lafontaine, in a castle in Siberia. They continue their lives in a blissful and calm atmosphere. One day they receive a letter from "general", a man who made his mission in life avenge the death of his daughters. He claims that supernatural powers work and explains that he will visit them soon. Meanwhile, an accidental encounter with a strange woman causes the Lafontain to look after their daughter, Carmilla, for several months. Soon Laura begins to be overwhelmed with strange dreams and begins to descend with a strange disease. Who is this mysterious Carmilla? And what does she have to do with Laura's condition and the general? <br /> <br /> I invented this game and I would like it to be played by as many people as possible and let me know what their results are. I even have a catchy name and I will also be afraid, but I can not worry about it. This is called "this movie does not make sense". <br /> <br /> All you have to do is watch the movie, try to come up with a full story that explains what's going on. I mean complete, all answers, everything makes sense, absolutely complete. <br /> <br /> It will have to answer such questions as ... <br /> <br /> * Why can vampires walk in the daylight? <br /> <br /> * Why are everyone lesbian? <br /> <br /> * Why is the girl called Bob? and why is she spinning? <br /> <br /> * When is the movie a dream and when is it real? <br /> <br /> * Why does killing a zombie seem to be an acceptable part of life that does not make anyone beat the eyelid? <br /> <br /> * Why Travis Fontaine notices and runs zombies without slowing down while driving, but in the face of a woman with an obvious hostage behind her car, accept the excuse that she is also a zombie? <br /> <br /> * So why does he let the girl, who later reveals openly that he knows he is a vampire, rides with him in his car? <br /> <br /> * And then let her go, alone with her daughter in a stolen car? <br /> <br /> What the hell is the scene for asylum? <br /> <br /> * What the hell is going on, green? <br /> <br /> * Why does the head vampire suddenly start to dress like a nurse? <br /> <br /> * Why does not he ever fight with Zombie vampires? <br /> <br /> * What is the meaning of the necklace? what is it made of? Why does he kill vampires? and how does Jenna know about it? <br /> <br /> In fact, it irritates, but it's just as cool to come up with so many questions about this movie. <br /> <br /> I have my storyline, and I must admit that it is not quite there, but it is quite a good effort. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, <br /> <br /> 'Vampires vs. Zombies' is not where they are actually vampires fighting zombies. It seems that everyone in the film knows exactly what is going on, but they seem very reluctant to let the audience do it. And somehow based on a classic horror novel from the nineteenth century. How? Why? What the hell is going on?
