Even Bob Hope, escorted by a group of excellent actors, can not save this badly-written war comedy attempt, because his patented timing does not have much to do. The plot is about the Hollywood movie star Don Bolton (Hope) and his attempts to avoid military service at the beginning of World War II, and then his haul by mistake in a confused attempt by the court of the colonel's daughter (Dorothy Lamour). Bolton's agent, played by Lynne Overman, and his assistant, incarnated by Eddie Bracken, are enlisted with him, and three of them take part in various escapades about exercises done in the hills of Malibu, California. Paramount was well-paid for this effort, employing some of his best specialists, but the management of the usually trustworthy David Butler was slack, and this should be attributed to the missing comedy element in the scenario. Moving towards the end of the film to create a chance for Bolton's heroism is still being born with weak stunt actions and a camera action as evidence. Oddly enough, Lynne Overman gets the best lines, and this veteran mockery is doing well. Dorothy Lamour looks beautiful and behaves well, and it is always a pleasure to see and hear Clarence Kolb as her father, whose voice is unique on screen or on the radio, but little can be done to save this movie, cursed as it is with an error in assigning the script.
