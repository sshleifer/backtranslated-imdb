this movie was a huge disappointment. the level of relentless cruelty and violence in this film was very worrying. some of the scenes were really unnecessarily ugly and malicious. the main characters were not able to identify or even sympathize with them. the character of the main character was as sloppy as she appeared. The atmosphere of the disease / hothouse has been tempted to theatrical reviews. from this film, you could not learn much about the Spanish Civil War. Fortunately I was in Spain and realized that it is not realistic! in addition, the use of the same-sex train as a horrible "horror film" was also very offensive and ill-treated, while the DVD is packaged and advertised to attract gays. the actors seemed uncomfortable in their roles, as if they were trying to distance themselves from this mess. I suppose if you like watching children and animals brutally killed, this movie may be of particular interest to you.
