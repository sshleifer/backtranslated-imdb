The worst movie on earth. I do not even know where to start, but I hope I can save another person from punishing this film. When it comes to acting and lighting, this movie is similar to bad porn without sex. The actors are some of the worst I've ever seen, and they could not be worse, even if they tried to make a complete mockery of the movie. The film had to have a low budget, which was certainly wasted almost exclusively on the cover of the film. This movie became a joke from my friends and became a standard for comparing other junk movies. I would like to emphasize that no other film even starts to compare. I feel personally responsible for suggesting to my friend and me watching this movie and I am surprised that he still considers me a friend after the passion that we let us pass through. Do not watch this movie!
