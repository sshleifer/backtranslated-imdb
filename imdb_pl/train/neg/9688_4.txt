Greenaway films are equally wise, erudite and innovative. However, his style and grammar arise and remind viewers of films made in the film era of the First World War: the composition of the frame, the use of the middle shot, static camera. It may be good to touch on mainstream movies in this style, but it is not new. Perhaps like this other "innovator", TS Eliot, draws more from the past than looking into the future, how an authentic innovator could or could. <br /> <br /> However, Greenaway's biggest failure is that he can not write. His dialogue and even the structure of the plot is mechanical and logical, but without the vitality of another dramatic logic, Brecht. Where this weakness is most visible, it is in his mood that is ready and logical, so the joke is dead before it is released. The result is boring: if it is not fun, it failed: ask the standing comedian to justify his action if the audience does not react. Perhaps a well-read director could learn something from Freud about humor. <br /> <br /> Finally, like Woody Allen, Greenaway has been manipulating his actors for years, working like clones. They speak bored, satisfied with air like narcissistic teens. <br /> <br /> This film, despite its design and lighting, is simple.
