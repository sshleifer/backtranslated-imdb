The film confuses ethics and religious ideals so much that it does not create a coherent argument against the death penalty at any level. By presenting the final execution of the condemned murder as a catalyst for the apocalyptic end of humanity, the film raises the parents' murderer to the status of a martyr for Christ. Somehow, according to the plot, God is outraged that society has decided to get rid of himself of the fanatic who killed his parents, setting them on fire while they slept helplessly in their beds. However, the same god has no indignation for the killer's actions. The main character, a non-religious pregnant suicidal woman, ultimately gives her own life in a challenging but unbelievable attempt to ineffectively save this convicted killer. In other threads of the underdeveloped plot, Jesus returns as a powerless and frustrated tramp to symbolically release the wrath of God. The contemporary, bland incarnation of Christ not only dehumanizes him, but mocks the messianic ideal of all religions. It is not able to influence humanity for good and without emotions, it travels on the edges of life, waiting for humanity to destroy its self. Meanwhile, with little help from Jesus, the mentally unstable pregnant woman is in a state of reincarnation in a newly born soulless child who somehow saves all mankind from the wrath of the Almighty. I also interpreted this as a statement to support abortion at some levels. This film, which tries to get a lot of religious motifs into a thriller, does not make any religious point that I could interpret clearly, except mockery of people's beliefs. He raises many questions that he never tries to answer. Ignores religious values ​​of its recipients, trying to show the asynchronous version of their fulfillment. Stupid
