I thought that I would watch a scary movie .. and it ended with laughter throughout the whole movie. In the scene in which a man transformed into a werewolf, I thought they were joking. Today's computer games have ten times better animations. A low budget is the right comment. I recommend Wolf (1994) with Jack Nicholson for a good movie about werewolves. It has good special effects as it should be (human transformation into a werewolf). If you do not want to laugh, I do not recommend you watch this movie. This movie is a joke.
