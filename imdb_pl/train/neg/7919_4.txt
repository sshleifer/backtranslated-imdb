I was very much absorbed in this movie, at least at the beginning, and any credit I give to this film is Lacey Chabert, she was fantastic !! But it ends there. I think I'm very good at determining who the killer is, and I like it when the movie is able to completely surprise me, but I felt uncomfortable and lying to myself. he decided to go in a completely different direction at the end, they did not give any impact at all, it is not misleading that very bad writing and planning, someone did not think at all! it would be much better if they kept to the plot to which they lead, and they did not seem to answer why Jane (Maria) had burnt the professor's house. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because I felt that it started as a relatively good movie.
