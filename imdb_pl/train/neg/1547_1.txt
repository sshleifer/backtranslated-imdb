I could exchange a lot of funny movies. There are comedies to be fun and they are. Some films, like Gymkata, try to be serious, but they end up fun. The Ladies Man is a movie that desperately tries to be funny, but it can not be less fun when it comes to a guy who has many chicks in the middle of the remains of the nuclear holocaust. This is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I do not think I'm laughing any more than giggles in this movie. It's just not bad. It's boring, stupid, ridiculous, annoying, amazingly bad, but not funny. I do not care about Tim Meadows, nor about this character from SNL, but I expected something better. <br /> <br /> There is a lack of logic and common sense in the film. It's as if the screenwriter had a bag over his head while he wrote, and he could not see which keys he hit. They talk about the "origin" of Ladies Man, but they do not contain motivation for his bizarre fascination with acting, as is the case in the seventies. The film tries to bring humor out of a man who seems to enjoy pornography soon after trying to hang himself. This is a comedy? I like to think that I have quite a strong sense of humor (I spend a lot of time writing comedy like me), but maybe I'm just not clear enough about this movie. <br /> <br /> Lee Evans, he's as funny as Tucker in "There's something about Maria," he's terribly bad here. I begged him to shut up in my head. <br /> <br /> At the end I hit the chair, muttering under my breath, and if the film were to last, I would probably try to commit suicide. This movie may not be as bad as Battlefield Earth, but it's the first movie I've seen that is close. <br /> <br />
