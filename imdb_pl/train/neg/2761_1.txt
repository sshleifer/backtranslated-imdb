Everyone is doing things that they later regret. The things they want can blame drugs or foreign property. Things that seem rational at the time, later turn out to be engraved invitations for suffering and endless accusations of foolishness. <br /> <br /> Some people sign a note for the new Hummer, for others it is a collection of deadly hitchhiker, yet others send their bank account information to third-world millionaires, mysteriously tied to the cash register. <br /> <br /> It was a movie for me. <br /> <br /> D-War: Dragon Wars In retrospect, I should have figured out how environmentally friendly and thoroughly processed this movie will prove to be from its fierce and repetitive title. But thanks to my free suspension of disbelief and naive faith resulting from the cool-looking poster in the lobby, I really wanted this movie to work. Unfortunately, when the old man in the pawnshop explained the whole story, fifteen minutes in the picture, I had a sudden, drowning revelation that comes from knowing each point of the plot of the still invisible movie. And what's worse: I knew how much each point would suck. <br /> <br /> Let everything be clear here, English does not have enough nuance and depth in the field of ultimate evil to properly describe how bad the film really is. <br /> <br /> As for the knowledge of all twists and turns, I was wrong. In the spirit of old Godzilla movies, the scale of which is not worthy of fulfillment, each time the main characters were threatened by the spectrum of meaningful dialogue, it conveniently released additional threads. <br /> <br /> It was attacked by close calls, miraculous escapes and concentrated deposits of weakly explained anger. <br /> <br /> This movie is what would happen if you gave the makers of the Mighty Morphing Guards access to the national defense budget. And a lot of alcohol. <br /> <br /> Let me try to explain it. <br /> <br /> Imagine that you can get all the coolest elements of a set from successful action movies of the last decade: First take the rastastic army of amphibians from the first episode of Star Wars and remove their Prozac until they are ready for the Navy Seals club. <br /> <br /> Then, take a close look at Kira Knightly and Tom Cruise (you can even name it Ethan as the "subtle" nod of the Mission Impossible franchise.) and give them a lot of film narrative noir so that no one will make a mistake trying to follow for the depth of their thoughts. <br /> <br /> Finally, add the naughty publisher in the pointy armor worthy of the Lord of the Rings and a pair of giant cobras angry at removing their scenes from the latest edition of King Kong, and put them all in a special order on the modern day of Los Angeles . <br /> <br /> Now go to the pharmacy to find something for your sudden migraine. When you come back, let go of these ingredients until any unnoticeable note of originality is dissolved in a homogenized mass of cheese and served semi-gelatinous. <br /> <br /> In a few points of this photo I said that I was speaking out loud: "Create a bad movie" and break in. <br /> <br /> Calling this type B movie would give him undeserved promotion. After a summer school and many physical treatments, it could be a C-level movie if you could sleep most of them for a while. <br /> <br /> In short, if you ever find yourself with money and brain cells to burn and you have to punish yourself for hideous, unspeakable sins against humanity, Dragon Wars can only be a movie for you.
