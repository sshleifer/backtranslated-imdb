This film is another in a long line with no budget, no effort, no movies about talents filmed and covered with a slick cover, to fool unsuspecting tenants in the video store. <br /> <br /> If you want to know watching this movie is like grabbing a video camera and some red food coloring and film yourself and your friends wandering around at night snarling and "attacking" people. Congratulations, you just did "Hood of the Living Dead"! Now see if the distribution company will buy it from you. <br /> <br /> I saw some low budget, shot on video that showed the talent of filmmakers and actors or at least the effort, but there is not. Avoid unless you're a real masochist or a bad horror makes you laugh.
