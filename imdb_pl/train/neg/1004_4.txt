Jewish journalist Justin Timberlake (as Joshua "Josh" Pollack) is surprised when the accused whispers "Thank you" to the officer testifying LL Cool J (as Rafe Deed) when he leaves the witness position. In the initial sequences of this video you will receive an explanation. You will see the evil partner of detective Mr. Cool J, Dylan McDermott (as Frances "Laz" Lazerov) who decides to NOT murder Damien Dante Wayans (as Isaiah Karol). The cops in the city of Edison are so corrupt that they shoot the suspects, steal their money and snort their drugs. Regardless of whether he wants to impress his girlfriend (here, called "Pussy") or win the Pulitzer, the corruption in the city does not suit the noble Mr. Timberlake. <br /> <br /> Timberlake decides to investigate corruption that achieves both an unexpected range and life threatening levels. Writer / director David J. Burke is holding a film on the water, but barely. LL Cool J defeats Timberlake in the lottery "pop star for the movie star" (aka progression "rapper to actor"). Mr. McDermott has a great time with his role. Gravitational loans in the proceedings are brilliant actors Morgan Freeman (as Moses Ashford) and Kevin Spacey (as Levon Wallace). F.R.A.T. means first attack and tactical response, but more important to know that "Edison (Force)" stars Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J, not Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey (who seems lost). <br /> <br /> ** ** Edison (17/09/05) David J. Burke ~ Justin Timberlake, LL Cool J, Morgan Freeman, Dylan McDermott
