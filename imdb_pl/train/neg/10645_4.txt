I've never seen Tarzan before, so when I saw him on TV, I thought I would give him a chance. Unfortunately, I have to say that I was disappointed. Tarzan was over 40 years old and slightly overweight. I did not imagine that Tarzan would look like that. And if I did not overlook it, making a cup of tea, Tarzan never gave his traditional scream. Tarzan was also missing, swaying among the trees - jumping from vine to vine. <br /> <br /> Well, so much for expectations. In any case, Jane was there - monkey Cheeta was there. There was a guy with a guitar there. There were villains and good guys and romance ... they were all very harmless and predictable. Nothing wrong, you understand, but nothing good. <br /> <br /> Probably not the best movie to introduce Tarzan: 4/10
