Have you ever heard the saying that people "telegram their intentions?" Well, in this movie, the actions of the heroes are doing more than telegraphic plans for the future - they appear drunk in your home and cafeteria about your head. This can be forgiven if the setting has been better used, or if the characters were more charismatic or polished. The figure of Embeth Davidtz is not mysterious, just wooden, and Kenneth Branagh fails to convey the bold charm that his character probably wrote. <br /> <br /> The most important: an obvious plot, performances with one note, dissimilar figures and grotesque "southern" accents used by British actors.
