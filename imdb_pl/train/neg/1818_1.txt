Connie Hoffman is very pretty and sometimes she is attractively topless. <br /> <br /> That's it, people. The only reason to even consider whether to watch this movie or not. <br /> <br /> These songs from the erotic period of the 70s are sometimes funny because of their very dating (flared pants, large hair, Zapata mustache, etc.). This is not. <br /> <br /> The script is bad, the acting is bad, the direction is bad, and the idea of ​​having a romantic man leading a senior is extremely bad. <br /> <br /> The title, referring to the sexual comedy, is grossly misleading. <br /> <br /> I heartily recommend avoiding it like a plague.
