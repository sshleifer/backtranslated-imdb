Add to the list of caricatures: the Southern preacher and "gathering", the torch singer (Sophie Tucker?), The Dancing Choir and The Mills Brothers - it only makes it worse. <br /> <br /> Contemptuous burlesque "Negro" performers who often appear in movies to parody themselves and their race. Although the "black comedy" could have been accepted in those days, it is very offensive today and I doubt it will ever be fun. Although I would not be offended, I do not think I would laugh at weak attempts at humor. However, as an 11-year-old white boy I could not understand it.
