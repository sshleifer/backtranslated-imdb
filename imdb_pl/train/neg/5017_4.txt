I just finished this movie ... I saw him on the film shelf and being a fan of Nick Stahl I just had to rent him. Honestly, you should probably stay on the shelf. The concept was interesting and there were some pretty clever twists, but somehow I guessed almost everyone before they showed up. And the movie just went a bit too far in the end in my opinion ... if you have to suffer by watching this, you'll see what I mean! <br /> <br /> On the positive note, Nick Stahl's acting was great (especially considering what he had to work with). Eddie Kaye Thomas was also good, but he always plays the same type of character ... too much Paul Finch from "American Pie", which I like. <br /> <br /> And finally, the worst part of this movie must be the emotionless performance of January Jones ... I think a pretty face really matters in Hollywood.
