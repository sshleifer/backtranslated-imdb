But this movie was boring. The historical part was fine, but the musical part was not. Not one song I cared about and no soundtrack to hear. <br /> <br /> If "Sweet Jesus" was to be comic, it will never work. they tried to overthrow him in every scene. <br /> <br /> Hancock and Jefferson were the only known characters in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The historical quotes and debate about slavery in their historical context was interesting enough, but not enough to overcome the lack of music in the musical. <br /> <br /> Do not you have to humming musical songs, except for a few songs, nothing else was worth breathing.
