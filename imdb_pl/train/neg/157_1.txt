OK First of all, the movie looks as if it was filmed in the 1980s. I was shocked when I found out that it was released in 2001. Second, the plot was everywhere, the story is misleading right away. If there was a short prologue or introduction, the story would be better. I also appreciate the fantasy, but this movie was too big. It was strange and badly filmed. Scenes did not flow smoothly, and the characters were strange. It was difficult to keep track of it and maybe it was a translation, but even it was difficult to understand. I love Chinese epic movies, but if you're looking for a Chinese epic fantasy movie, I would recommend Promise (visually stunning, the plot is interesting and good character development), not this movie. Watch out, you will be disappointed.
