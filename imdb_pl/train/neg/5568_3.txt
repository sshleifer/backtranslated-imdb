Dolph Lundgren plays the role of a former policeman / boxer who is looking for a perverse scene in Boston to find out who killed his brother who was well thought out in the community, but on the way he finds out how his brother enjoyed perverse sex and that serial killer he has to blame. Dolph Lundgren is very good in this film, in fact, based on his performance, one could forget about Lundgren's promotion to the roles of the action. Having said that the material does not give Lundgren anything to do, in fact Lundgren is completely overlooked in a grim thriller that is both predictable and incomprehensible. Co-Star Danielle Brett is also good, in fact the film works best when focused on the chemistry of Lundgren and Brett, indeed if the film took the time to explore their relationship, the film would be quite decent. However, the movie is bland, the action does not exist, the plot is not explored enough (Too boring B.S around Lundgren's investigation over his brother's employer), and the movie is unnecessarily bloody and funny. Once again, Lundgren is really very good (like debutant Danielle Brett), but the movie simply jumps from one sequence to the next, which makes the film particularly disappointing. But if anything else, he shows how Lundgren is underestimated as an actor. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of 4- (poor)
