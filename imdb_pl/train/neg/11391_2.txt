When I first started watching this movie, I was looking for some subtle metaphors, but soon realized that this film really does concern people on the train. Interactions between people are similar to those that can be seen every day on the street, and when sometimes a slightly more interesting situation arises, dialogue becomes stiff and boring. It's not that I do not understand how this movie tries to show the way people interact, but in this movie they're very boring. If you want to see and analyze this kind of relationship, it would be best to go out and buy a train ticket and look at the people on the train with you. It's realistic, but you would not go to the movie to watch a movie about how you sit there watching a movie.
