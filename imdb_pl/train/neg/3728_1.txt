As other comments show, this movie can scare you when you are a small child. (And that's probably all that's good for this.) <br /> <br /> However, if you're older, this movie only does one thing: suck majorly and that's why I do not mean acting, its soundtrack, cutting or s.th. Yes. I'm just talking about "story" (if you can call it that). <br /> <br /> SPOILERS in advance ------------------------ <br /> <br /> I do not want to give you any more spoilers than it is necessary (if after reading this you really still want to watch this movie), but if you finish any school, it is simply a great insult to your intelligence. While watching this, most of the time I was stunned because what was happening was ONLY stupid. <br /> <br /> This includes: <br /> <br /> - creating UNITE (wrong UN- association) <br /> <br /> -> we should believe that this is evil. Is it bad at all? if so: why is evil? <br /> <br /> - sign of evil in the form of a tattoo <br /> <br /> -> there is no need to impose it on people, so why the hell (no pun intended) do it? <br /> <br /> - by invoking Christ into your heart only as a mistake <br /> <br /> -> because there is no one who in this movie is considered a "real Christian", besides saying this stupid prayer. so ... just say this prayer before admiration and you are saved - no matter what ?! <br /> <br /> So the rating is 1/10
