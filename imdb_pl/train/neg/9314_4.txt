Well ... in general, this movie was pretty worthless, and it's basically a horror movie that has become more comedy. I just rented this movie last night, when my friends and I went to the blockbuster, looking for a terrifying movie. It certainly was not what we were looking for, but the sense of humor satisfied us. Actors in this movie (especially Brandon) are so false that it's funny. And especially this girl Tracy, whenever she's in a room with slabs, tells the clown to leave. They show almost no emotions and are so obvious that they work. And also, when the clown looks through the paper black box and grabs Mark, he does not even look scared, although the clown grabbed him and attacked him. And seriously, will you just be JOGGING, if you're going to be prosecuted? I'm sprinting to life! (Even if someone could probably overtake this clown, because he's like 300 pounds.) Not to mention that the effects are not as great as every time a clown breaks Susan's head in the forest and then when he throws his head in the dead plank the room with Denise and Tracy whenever Denise refuses to turn his head. As in the comment of the previous guy, the beginning does not make any sense, and I do not even understand why it was even included in the movie. So what was it for the film made in 2003? The music made it sound like in the '80s and the camera (?) Does not even look professional. For half the time, it seems that the camera can not even stand stable when it should be. Overall, I have to say that I liked the movie. I would not recommend it if you are trying to find something that scares you, but if you are looking for something you can laugh at or laugh at, I recommend it for sure.
