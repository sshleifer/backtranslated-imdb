Out of shame and shame that a great actor such as Joseph Fiennes would let himself fall into this boring crap. The film was not only bad, but also horrible and devoid of salutary quality. The plot (was it?) She did not seem to have a place. The Russians played stupidly by killing or killing, and the rest of the cast should be considered void for their pathetic performances. I gave up about 3/4 of the way and turned it off. "1" for the terrible just because there is nothing lower. Do not waste time on this, you will not miss anything.
