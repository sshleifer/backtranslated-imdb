Things I learned from The List. <br /> <br /> A decent cinematographer, a hot girl who can work, and Malcom McDowell could not stop this movie from sucking. <br /> <br /> Blockbuster won "give you your money back. <br /> <br /> Even if he reads the script and says "Ugh! Really?! ", Malcom McDowell is still trying. <br /> <br /> Chuck Carrington desperately needs acting. <br /> <br /> Hire a writer. <br /> <br /> Jesus also hates me and punishes me, having me pay $ 5.50 to see this movie. <br /> <br /> When you make a movie, you do not need to finish. Leave everything unexplained, unresolved, so uninteresting that the audience falls asleep BEFORE the ending. Genius. <br /> <br /> Any casual owner can only heal death by drawing a cross on the window. So make friends. <br /> <br /> Your maid can sing you. <br /> <br /> Chuck Carrington still needs acting lessons. <br /> <br /> Your roommate will hate you mock if you bring this movie home. <br /> <br /> An apology will not be accepted.
