What to say about this film. It's about a group of good students who have bad drugs and become criminals who sell more bad drugs to people. Two of these people have a negative effect when they turn into a toxic avenger, and his girlfriend throws out some creature that grows in the basement of the school. It's all about it, and they stretch it for 84 minutes. This movie is very bad and should be closed forever. Though it's not fair, some people like Troma's movies and can watch them if they want to. Tromy's films are the worst movies for me. I just looked at it with morbid curiosity.
