This is quite a strange movie, considering that Santa Claus lives in a cloud in space and fights Satan and his servants ... but he is still a bit funny. <br /> <br /> He has some real laughs. However, whether all of them were intentional, it is certainly controversial. This movie is not good, but I can say that I really enjoyed watching it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie "Saint Nicholas conquers the Martians", "Santa Claus" with Dudley Moore and John Lithgow, or "Santa Clause" with Tim Allen.
