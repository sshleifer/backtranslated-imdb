The fact that I watched the whole movie, says something about it ... or me. This is not a good movie. Awful. But terrible in that my attention was so perverse that it reminds me of watching the tragedy and is unable to look away. It would be a great MST3K theme! <br /> <br /> Most of the things that make a horrible movie good is here: bad dialogue, inappropriate music, fancy plot sequences, funny pseudoscience. You will be delighted with the next death sequences of death, the poor victims with aggressive mouths, and you have too much time to contemplate the impending doom, in the face of the outraged inventor of their death. Your heart will be warmed up by old action film cliches, like when two women are fighting for a gun, and it will go out, but WHO IS A SHOT? Both look at each other, then at each other, then at each other, then (apparently 15 minutes later), one finally falls down. You will sing (in Latin, of course) with street carols that turn into a spooky death choir, which for a moment threatened to change the movie into a twisted musical. <br /> <br /> So if I believe that just as I do it, when the movies get worse, they get better, it can be a decent choice for you. It's not as fun as my current favorite science fiction song, "They Live" with Rowdy Roddy Piper, but watching is more enjoyable than summer movies like Omen II or III. <br /> <br /> I give it 4 out of 10.
