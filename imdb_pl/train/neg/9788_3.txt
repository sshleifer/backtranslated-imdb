Not that I do not like children's films, but it was a tear-squeezer with several advantages. MJ Fox was a perfect voice for Stuart, and the rest of the talent was wasted. Hugh Laurie can be incredibly funny, but there is no chance in this movie. It is sugar coated with sugar and almost will not appeal to anyone over 7 years. Instead, see Toy Story, Monsters Inc. or Shrek. 3/10
