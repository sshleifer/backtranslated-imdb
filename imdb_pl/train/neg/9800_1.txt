Mighty Morphin Power Rangers was released in 1993, probably based on the Japanese sentai program, which began in the 70's. Now, as a fan of Japanese action movies and TV series, one would think that I will get a kick from this program. <br /> <br /> You can not be more wrong. What worked in the Japanese version has become a total TV abomination thanks to the powerful morphin guards. <br /> <br /> MMPR is based on five teenagers who become costume superheroes with robotic dinosaurs who create an even larger robot. <br /> <br /> Now this assumption is more far-fetched and more ridiculous than anything in the Transformers movie, but the ridiculousness of this series is often overlooked. <br /> <br /> After this came two really bad, and I mean, really bad movies, and the actors in this series completely disappeared from the stage. <br /> <br /> If you must choose, try to watch the Japanese Zyuranger series. <br /> <br /> In addition, what's going on in the terrible long haircuts from the 90s and all earrings? It makes them look feminine!
