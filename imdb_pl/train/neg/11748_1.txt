This movie must be one of the worst I've ever seen on DVD !!! The plot could have been clicked if the film had more funds and writers who would cut out nonsense and sick scenes, which I am warning very much about parents ... But the plot is like a loose cannon. If there was such a thing as a producer of powered films, this one would be made of it. It reminded me of many quick films that were released in the 1960s, poor screenwriting and filming. <br /> <br /> The only sensible characters in the film were the bartender and beaver. The rest of the film could easily be made by middle school children. I rate this movie on 1 because it is really terrible and it leaves my whole family with a sense of deception. My advice - do not watch this !!!
