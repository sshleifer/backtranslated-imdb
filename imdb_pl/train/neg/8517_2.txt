The greatest mystery of Veronica Mars is not the one she had to deal with on the screen. <br /> <br /> The secret is rather that this long-term disappointment with the ratings is still going on. This week Nadir recorded for Veronica Mars: it took 146 place for 146 shows in the big 6 (soon there will be Big 5). Yes, you read it well. Veronica Mars was beaten by every show of the now defunct WB and every UPN program. He was defeated by all appearances on Fox and of course by all concerts at ABC, CBS and NBC. <br /> <br /> Now hyper hipsters will say: but it was a replay. But everything on TV this week was a very replay! It surprises the mind why CW chose this proven disappointment with the ranking as one of the few programs he saved with UPN. <br /> <br /> Of course, something is going on behind the scenes. Favors are exchanged and transfers are received. <br /> <br /> I apologize for being so cynical, but what are the other explanations? The line "Veronica Mars has potential" is clearly dead now that it has been two years before it succeeded and failed to do so. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's Joel Silver's influence and his influence, but honestly, I'm losing why anyone would decide to spend their strength on a bad show that is not watched by the audience. <br /> <br /> A great secret and a very inauspicious CW debut.
