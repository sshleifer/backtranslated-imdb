It's easy to have fun. I liked "Hot Shots" and "The Naked Gun" and their many sequels, even if most people found them unbearable. I even managed to enjoy the majority of Pauly Shore's films. There's only one movie I've seen and I can honestly say that he was angry ... and that was it. It's been some time since I saw it, but I remember sitting in the theater thinking, "It's a stupid movie. Why did I see it? "It's really the only movie I can not recommend.
