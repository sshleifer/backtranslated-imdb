In what could have been a millstone, an average film about infidelity in the sixties (a subtle period of "free-love"), the creators of this film are based on a ridiculous scenario after a funny script and fill it with some claps at the top, happily after finishing . At no time did I feel sympathy for Diane Lane or Anna Paquin in their embarrassing free lives in the middle class, nor did I feel slandered Liev Shrieber. The plot returns slowly to a predictable, pathetic conclusion, and the only thing interesting and possible to watch in this film is the stunning topless Diane Lane. Here's a tip, it's about 30 minutes in the movie. Scroll forward and skip the rest.
