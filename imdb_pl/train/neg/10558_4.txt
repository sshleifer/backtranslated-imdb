I do not know why it has fans, but I do not know why I even gave it a result. It's ridiculous. There is a lot of giallo, in which you have to suspend disbelief, let the image roll and catch up somewhere before it becomes delirious, and some poor policeman must finally explain what we have seen. But it does not matter much and it has long sequences in which nothing happens and it does not matter to anything, whereas we have to listen to the most repetitive soundtrack, even according to Italian standards. This is not giallo, it's a complete blend of frightening ideas with Klaus Kinski in one of his most glaring performances. I think he showed up, made a day's work, and left, leaving Mr D'Amato to get others to fill. Ewa is obviously pretty, but no, that's not enough, and in the end we've seen too much of her popping everywhere, long after we completely lost interest in this thoughtless and pretentious talk. Maybe I just was not in the right mood!
