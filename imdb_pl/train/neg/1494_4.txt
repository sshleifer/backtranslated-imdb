Yes, definitely better than watching Death Tunnel. Actually, some of these deaths were quite original, and the blood was decent. It was something like Wrong Turn meets Hills Have Eyes. <br /> <br /> BUT: 1.) When "kids" (high school or college?) are discussing horrors in the kitchen, everything that Shae says is almost an exact quote from Scream (1996). The thing about girls with big breasts, etc. <br /> <br /> 2.) Was Steve NOT a bootleg Randy from Scream? 3.) Besides that it was in October, what the hell does the movie have to do with Samhain? Pretty unnecessary if you ask me. I find it humorous when I see these horrors from the 80s that explain the loose ends, pointing with druids or pentagram fingers. <br /> <br /> 4.) Wow, they made a reference to Sam Raimi !!! 5.) Why was Gary and his sister in the movie? They are characters that have nothing to do with anything. And he is so psychic that he did not even see his own death? 6.) When Gary was killed in the bathroom (at this point death just became Troma-licious), how could she hear screams when she was downstairs, but could not hear them when she was standing in front of the door? 7.) Gary's sister commented on Haggis - mainly Scottish dish, not Irish. the whole movie, will you be the one you live in? 9.) Mutants were pretty cool, but they looked like Chili con carne. <br /> <br /> 10.) When they brought Gary's sister, did they forget that Steve was attached there and wondered where he went? 11.) Was not there more than one killer? Shae defeated it, but they never met with them again. <br /> <br /> 12.) What was the flashback for these other people? Half of them Shae did not know if they were dead or alive, so what about this? 13.) Why did not they kill Gary and his sister before? 14.) Why has nobody ever called the police? And apparently everyone knew that these people lived in the woods, why did they never organize any kind of raid? 15.) As far as I know, they were not zombies OR vampires - so how could "turn into" one at the end? I'm with all the giants "huh?" At the end. <br /> <br /> Better than the death tunnel, but still quite messy. I still do not understand why they even put him in Ireland, considering that Samhain had almost nothing to do with the plot.
