I tried to watch this movie three times. On the night I rented her. About 20 minutes passed, hoping it would be better if I rested. I watched 15 the next day, I almost vomited how stupid it was ... It was not even funny silly, which is sometimes a fun movie to watch, but this movie was just crappy with a capital letter S (if you know what I mean censored world in which we live). And finally, on the third day, I watched over an hour of stupid things and did not enjoy a moment! Not one. How this script became green. Oh my! <br /> <br /> G <br /> <br /> 1/10 - this one is for cheerleading ... they deserve at least something for their hard work.
