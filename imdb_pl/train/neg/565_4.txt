The same difficulty with the musical version of "Les Miserables" applies equally to "Oliver." Instead of writing composers in the stylistic settings of the game, they simply wrote Broadway tunes that were historically unambiguous and stylistically skewed. <br /> <br /> Too gross brutality and unpalatable drama activities do not mix well with some of the sunny ditties that penetrate the score. It is an uncomfortable mix that leaves a sour aftertaste. <br /> <br /> Oliver's boyfriend does not help with matters: uncertain timbre and irritably valuable, there is something less than solid here. Fagin properly performs his traditional routine, although the melodies that he has to sing have no basis in the epochal style. <br /> <br /> "As Long As He Needs Me" receives a sharp interpretation, throaty and tense. Two large production numbers, "Who will buy" and "Consider yourself", seem overgrown, throwing everything in addition to the kitchen sink. One thing is the exit, another one to cross the line in excess. <br /> <br /> The depression, despair and corruption of most novels do not seem to be suitable for such ditties and choreography. Although the novel is considered classic, I must admit that I am having trouble with Mr. Dickens' awareness because his works seem to emit negative vibrations. This may be due to the prolongation of his joyful personal life, which was full of disappointment and regret. <br /> <br /> Not all combined talent of this production, both in the camera and behind it, can overcome the non-constructive character of the basic material. All this results in an unpleasant experience for me. <br /> <br />
