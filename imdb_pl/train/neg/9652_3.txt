The film was written 10 years ago, and another director planned it with SRK and Aami in the main roles. <br /> <br /> The film was finally made with Vipul Shah, who directed A Ayy and Salman to perform together after the decade HUM DIL DE CHUKE SANAM (1999) <br /> <br /> The film is not good, however, due to the 90's service and the worst gaps. <br /> <br /> The film tries to pack too many commercial ingredients, and we also love the love triangle <br /> <br /> Everything is predictable, transparent and banal. <br /> <br /> There are gaps, such as the fact that Ajay escapes from the airport in London and has no place for himself? even the way he starts his team is not convincing. Shah is ordinary below average Music is the worst point, most songs are mediocre <br /> <br /> Among the actors Ajay gives the best shot, although he is not convincing as a rock singer, but he is great as a negative role Salman, however, irritates his punjabi and he says nonsense, he makes an impression only when he is dazed, and Asin is nothing big, just a piece of Ranvijay's series should stick to MTV. Om Puri is okay
