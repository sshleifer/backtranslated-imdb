This movie has some of the most amazing cars I've ever seen in the movie, and definitely the hottest women, but I have to say it's still one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Here is the plot, and if you read it with a bit of inflection, you will also have acting. <br /> <br /> Beginning, bring the characters, a hot woman singing (obviously synchronizing lips). A music agent or producer enters, thinks he is amazing, asks her for a race. He rejects too many bad memories. The hero of Flash is a war war, he has several fights and becomes a movie hero with the attitude that he is better than everyone. Drive fast with a fast, exotic car. Brother racing, and then he dies. Hero avenge death, cut off the weapon from a friend. (You have never seen this friend before or after, but it seems that he really cares) Do you really want to do it; Yes; I mean, you really are sure; Yes, give me a gun; Are you sure; Yes; OK, I think I can not talk to you, be careful, I love you. <br /> <br /> Now he is going to blow up the house of uncles who owned the car that his brother was driving. He finds a woman, decides to save her, leaves, and he does not finish killing his uncle. Now there will be a race to finish the movie. Oh yes, you have to throw one more scene when bad people get in to beat people who do not really matter, but maybe it adds some plot. The race is not even that exciting, of course it ends with two car races, which should win a surprise throw. <br /> <br /> OK, I just saved $ 7.00. You can send me all your money, because I should give you as much pleasure as this movie. Do not get me wrong, the cars are amazing, and Nadija is beautiful, but it's really a terrible movie.
