I've almost always been against turning on songs for the movie. I believed that the quality of the film will be automatically improved, if only these extremely annoying songs will be subjected to acquisition. However, things have changed quickly after watching this awful Black (no songs) and this movie, (lots of songs). While Black was very weak to extreme, he delivers a thrilling story with strong acting and good direction. The songs were almost accidental and almost seamlessly combined with the film. There were no women who would have been sprayed with water for no apparent reason from mysterious water sources, while at night they spun wildly through the streets. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised by the bold and unwavering approach taken by the director. Nothing was heard, and almost every scene was completely reliable. <br /> <br /> I would recommend these films to people speaking Hindi, with at least a light understanding of life in Mumbai. The first of them, because the English subtitles were below the norm and contained many errors, which sometimes completely reversed the meaning of the actual statement. The latter, because you will certainly appreciate the accuracy of the performance when you survive it. <br /> <br /> I would definitely count it to work worthy of international recognition. Scenes with gossiping drivers were a nice touch and served as a source of real humor as well as a different perspective on the entire mish-mash. However, film in a few places is short, where the characters sometimes say the most inexplicable things that distract attention from the general direction of the film. <br /> <br /> I also thought that a few sad scenes were not done very well. It was a funny touch to watch, not a feeling of sadness, and the whole scene tended to be a little stupid. However, these are minor problems, because the film, in general, is really a rare treat to watch. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a cynical, pessimistic look and refreshing in it! Actors, not "heroes" - this is the key. A chance to see reliable people in an unusual environment - everyday life. A behind-the-scenes look at the size of depravity and a rare ray of hope for Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
