I went to that with my hopes, I could not be more disappointed in the twenty minutes after the film. Although I think it will be another terribly bad remake, I kept high hopes that maybe ... maybe someone will arrange it this time. Unfortunately, Prom Night is at the same level of quality as the last April Fools Day remake, bad script, bad direction, tacky acting and bad horror. <br /> <br /> From beginning to end it is boring, repeatable and worth about a dozen eye rolls. We've seen it before and we've seen it done a million times better than this. If you go to see Prom Night in the theater (I'd say I'm waiting for a DVD or PPV), get ready to let the audience laugh because they laugh. Laughs are not points in the movie that are meant to be fun, they are the answer to the key "thrilling" moments in the movie that are so poorly made that you feel like you are watching the latest installment of the Scary Movie. Seriously, was it supposed to be a remake or a parody? The creators of the film did not notice this sign so much that a large part of the audience in the theater I went to went around half of the movie. Which in retrospect I would like to do. But not me, I had to torture myself and stick to him, hoping it would be better. Needless to say, no. "Horror" scenes are a joke, not even because of acting, but because of direction, scenario, "special effects" and camera operation. The film looks like he made a fortune to produce it, but it still came out of it thanks to a film with a micro budget. Halfway I expected to see the markers of dollar stores on some props and I still thought that somewhere I would see a porn star in the cast. <br /> <br /> These films are frightening, if this is the future of a great budget horror, then the genre of horror is doomed.
