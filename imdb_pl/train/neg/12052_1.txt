What happens when you give a free man enough money to catch him in the rat race and watch him turn? Homeless people do not respond to anyone. They do not have mortgages, rent fees or idiot bosses. Homeless people do not have to worry about IRS, opinions about results or credit card payments. But give them only enough money to rent a flat and buy a car, and suddenly they have to worry about entering a rat race, buying gas for transport, paying for car insurance and working for someone else. They get the chance to be 'productive citizens'. This movie was just as exploitative as a movie. It's the way rich and middle class townspeople can say "see what happens when you try to help the poor?" And this confirms capitalist arrogance. <br /> <br /> Why is there a movie that asks: "What will happen when you get rid of everything the rich man has?"
