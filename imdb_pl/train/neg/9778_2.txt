I am sure that Operations Dames was a favorite place for day rides. There is absolutely nothing on the way to the plot that you can miss if you were otherwise absorbed. And if you had to fall into the mood for other activities, you were wearing a few rounded pieces to have a mood. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, there are not many things on which Operations Dames work. It takes place in the Korean War, where a platoon of geographical indications along with the British Tommy gets a bit too far and must return to the UN line. Already bad enough, but these guys also meet a group of talented USO girls and their choreographers in the same situation. <br /> <br /> You know what is sad about this film, that the generations of women had to finally be accepted army and in combat situations. These bimbos from the USO established the liberation of women of light years. In fact, even a hard-bitten professional soldier who is a sergeant responsible for these men can not keep him in his pants. <br /> <br /> But it's probably better to remember who they were at the entrance for. There is no better name if I did not recognize any of them for any individual effort. <br /> <br /> Dames operations are definitely a team flop.
