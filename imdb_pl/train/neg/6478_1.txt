I will say it again: this movie was completely poor. Children will like it, bright, but adults ... doubtful. The whole thing was basically a rebirth of the original, what can you expect, because they almost completely explored the whole concept in the first movie, but they still had to completely rework the whole movie? I mean, everything is made of the Little Mermaid. The worst thing is that Morgana "mad sister Ursula" appears out of nowhere and threatens Melody, which is funny, because Triton is there with his magical trident. Why did not Triton do anything about it? Because the conspiracy required him to do nothing. I can go on, but I will not. The whole thing is a shameless attempt to get more money from the Little Mermaid, and apparently it was dropped without any thought because they knew it was selling. Generally, it is a terrible waste of time.
