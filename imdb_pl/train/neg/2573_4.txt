If you have a lot of time to lose ... it's OK. It moves at a good pace, but to disable this movie, it would have to be a bit longer with a bit of background on the screen. <br /> <br /> Acting is fine. Marian Klaveno as a babysitter performs the best job and is the most reliable. <br /> <br /> William R. Moses played quite a good role as a husband. <br /> <br /> Gail O'Grady, as the wife had a weak part and the reasons she returned to work were not developed. <br /> <br /> The ending is a little silly. Like most of these movies ... there are parts that are interesting ... but generally you wonder why you spent this time.
