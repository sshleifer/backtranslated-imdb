Pictures of the Republic appear late in the game in the genre "werewolf" er Werecat. The story returns to Paris after a long journey abroad, during which he developed fear in the jungle, during which he had blackouts. It comes to great recognition because its novel, which is similar to the infamous trial, is a bestseller. The French government wants to know if he had access to secret documents, which seems more likely when an official is killed by a "cat". Suspicion really falls on the writer when his fianc√© ends his life. Complicating matters are the return of blackouts, so the writer does not know if he is a killer or not. <br /> <br /> A fine thriller is too slow to fully enjoy. At the beginning there are too many musical numbers and too much dead time when everything is said in the middle and later sections. Acting is fine, and the sets are pretty good, but there is a reason why most people I know remember only the top killer, is the most interesting thing in this movie. despite the short time (just over an hour) I think the reason why this movie was rarely watched on TV was that after 20 minutes you lost patience. As good as talking, I just wanted someone to do something. When it finally happened, in the final minutes it was too late ... <br /> <br /> Make a pass.
