The upcoming attractions for "The Order" make it seem like a decent horror / thriller, but we get a conspiracy that has the potential to be great, connected together, creating a pile of junk. <br /> <br /> First of all, the whole movie consists of a terrible dialogue and a terrible god. Acting was also not proud of it, but Keath Ledger (I think I wrote that way) has recorded the film in this category. <br /> <br /> For God's sake: DO NOT SEE THIS FILM!
