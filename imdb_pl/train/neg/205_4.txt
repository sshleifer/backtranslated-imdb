I jumped on the opportunity to watch this movie without interrupting and uninterrupted memorization of raha and raves. But wherever it seemed that it was really frightening, it withdrew and went somewhere else. Dripping water throughout the house, black rain, prophetic dreams, a bad change in raw sewage was dropped before they could scream. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. Nearly expressionless, Chamberlain's mask with a face offered small but disoriented disbelief, something I found in a mirror reflection. What could have been an amazing Aboriginal song and instruments in the background was instead a cacophony, which apparently had to scare the head. Ideas that modern people can personify ancient gods that Aboriginal peoples believe that red-haired white men were the first priests, and many other possibilities are passed more like a shopping list than a hint in another dimension (Dream Time). br /> <br /> [SPOILER] In the last scene it was not clear to me what the director was trying to say. Is there a big wave? So what? How big? Tsunami? Yes, okay. It's destructive but not apocalyptic. Is this the end of the world? With the wave? The last wave? It must have been a pretty, big wave. Why? Was the world angry? In this movie it did not look so horrible. Actually, I did not think the wave would fall, because the shadow had dropped the face of Burton, which the wave had cast. Is this just Burton's apocalypse? Heck, it happens to people who lose it every day. It was not interesting if it was just him. <br /> <br /> The most frightening scene that best captures Weir's potential was in Charlie's apartment, where Burton went to confront the old man for scaring Burton's wife. Charlie always asks him, "Who are you?" And after a while becomes really disturbing. Unfortunately, the film never went in his way.
