Very poor film, mainly due to poor history, but also poor acting in the case of Robert Downey Jr. and irrational behavior of many characters. If you're someone who likes to turn off the mind and just watch a movie about his creativity or performance criteria, you might like this movie. Personally, I can not do it with drama and I found it too far-fetched. <br /> <br /> I am particularly annoyed when the main character, who is to be an intelligent person, constantly behaves like a complete imbecile. In this film, if the main character behaved like a man would normally act in such situations, there would be no film. <br /> <br /> The first highly unlikely action is when the protagonist, a successful lawyer named Magruder, played by Kenneth Branagh, leaves the party and happens to the girl, Mallory Doss played by Embeth Davidtz, who screams that her car was stolen. They are standing in a tropical downpour when he is struggling with her to come home. <br /> <br /> Tells him about his strange father, who belongs to some strange sect and does crazy things. When they reach their damaged hut in the poorer part of the city, they notice that her car is in the driveway. Also the lights in the house are turned on and some items in the house have been broken. <br /> <br /> Things are very strange, it's weird (looks like a tramp, undresses before it, until it's totally naked? Oh yeah!). Also, the father is strange, the house is a wreck - everything should tell Magruder, "hey, this is too weird for me, I'm not here!". But not Magruder, he sleeps with her, and then, motivated by its history and sex, he attempts to engage his father. It all screams in the setting! <br /> <br /> Then, being on the top - he is an aviation lawyer, and he is late in the office in the same shirt as the previous night (the fact that all women in the office). Is it likely that an effective lawyer will behave like a 16-year-old? Magruder has upset the police in some of his cases, so when he goes to the police claiming with sufficient evidence that his father is terrorizing them, the police ignore him. I could believe that reluctant help. in general - unlikely! <br /> <br /> It's unlikely.
