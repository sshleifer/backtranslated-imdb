Prior to this issue, Neil LaBute had this to say about the 1973 original: "It's surprising how many people say it's their favorite soundtrack. I'm like, come on! You may not like the new one, but if it's your favorite soundtrack, I do not know if * I want you to like my movie. "<br /> <br /> Neil, the word. You can also sit for it; as Lord Summerisle says, shocks are much more absorbed by bent knees. You see, Neil, the thing in the original, is the fact that the soundtrack of Paul Giovanni is one of the most well-known things in this topic. The creators themselves consider this a virtual musical. Together with Richard and Danny Thompson and Bert Jansch, he practically started Folk New Wave in the 1970s. Undermining it is similar to imagining a Jaw without John Williams. Or The Buddy Holly Story without Buddy Holly. The result is one of the most breathtakingly arrogant, meaningless modifications of the British iconic classic from the time of Get Carter Sly Stallone. <br /> <br /> The original apparently left Nicolas Cage "disturbed for about two weeks". So alarmed, during this two-week period, he suggested the idea of ​​revising one of the most subtle films about the struggle between beliefs ever invented for a writer-director previously known from the most impersonal representations of male chauvinism. It's like a social game: what would you do if Sam Peckinpah took care of Bambi? Or Gaspar "Irreversible" Noah has transformed Love, Actually? (Actually, I'd like to see it). Unfortunately, someone seriously treated this social game: all LaBute were successful, tearing original guts, burdening them with their own, hopeless interests Sex War. <br /> <br /> After an unsuccessful attempt to save a little girl and her mother, a deadly car crash, patrolling Cage's highway, turns into a medical torpor. He then receives a letter from former fiancée Willow Woodward (who pays tribute to kudos), currently living on the private island of Summersisle? that "extra" means "unnecessary"? and he wants Edward to help locate the missing Rowan's daughter. <br /> <br /> It turns out that summer is a women-dominated pond, conceived as a haven for oppressed women and refugees from Salem witch trials. Here the matriarchs follow Olde's ways, and the few men are almost silent. It's like a large scale Lilith Fair. The main export of Summersisle is honey? symbolic and literal headache for Edward because he is allergic to bees. "Beekeepers!" Edward cries. "They seem to be everywhere on this island!" Well, that's probably because the main export of Summersisle is honey. <br /> <br /> During his research, Edward eavesdrops on the upcoming Mayday ritual called "the time of death and rebirth". He discovers that previous year's collections have failed; almost dies due to bee stings; and finally comes to a conclusion (a conclusion that could not have been more obvious if the locals had tattooed a calendar of events on his hands) that the Rowan would be burnt alive in a pagan rite to provide generous harvests. He also meets Queen Bee from the beehive, Sister Summersisle (Burstyn), who has his own plans for him with the title of Wiklin: "The drone must die." <br /> <br /> First, good news: any fear of the Cage will be ejected from the fiery jaws of the Wicker Man at the last moment by a fleet of black CIA helicopters that can be put to rest: toasting. It's about good news. "This is a story whose chapters have been carefully written," Burstyna chants with sublime irony. Remaining in the basic assumption for cats and mice (and assigning typography), what remains is subjecting the original to the policy of scorched earth. <br /> <br /> It was crucial for the original Shaffer script that his Christian copper, according to the ritual, came to the island of his own free will? and most importantly, she was a virgin; perfect sacrifice. In reducing sexual affairs, in contrast to the religious struggle for power, LaBute presents the thinnest qualifications for harvest sacrifice. By the time Cage unfolded, he was the lure, honestly, you do not care. <br /> <br /> A Cage is one of the worst things in this area; lumbering, pulling donkey? arsewit whose language seems a bit too big for his lips. "Goddamit" he moans after he hallucinates the drowning Rowan, with all the psychological torment of the man who set the morning alarm clock half an hour early. Can you hope that his character often relies on the pills that led him to this state? alternately tired, then full preppy, overbearing vim. If so, this is an excellent representation of the unmatched IQ with the addition of antidepressants. If not, he does not think about it. Like Willow, the Beahan saucer is just as scary, presenting its lines as in competition with Cage for the most intense delivery. While Burstyn completely lacks the mercury threat to convince. Who is afraid of Naomi Wolf? <br /> <br /> Any element that made the original great? beautifully presented folk customs, ingenious result, dialogue (majestic "Lord did it beautifully!" replaced rather less attractive "You did it perfectly!" Whoah, old!) ?? have been replaced by a meandering sex thriller with occasional bang. Namely, bricked up women; it's finally a LaBute movie. Cage's Sister Beech's fight is just one of the embarrassing episodes; the helpless little people will jump out of joy as their well-behaved hippie chicks finally got what they came, hyuk hyuk. <br /> <br /> Coda closes by seeing how the rotten mess falls under the weight of stereotypes: in the bar, two guys bump into a pair of virgin maidies on the shore, fishing for fresh martyrs. When you receive them successfully, you expect women to turn away and exaggerate the blink of an eye to the camera. <br /> <br /> One more thing: keen observers of loans could see this film with an unusually high number of producers (up to 10 pieces), they seem to be not very policemen. Wicker Man has a total of 18 producers.
