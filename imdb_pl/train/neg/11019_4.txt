Fred Olen Ray is a poor director, even when it comes to directors B, but "Haunting Fear" is probably one of his better films. Yes, they sculpt the great tale of Poe "Premature Burial" and yes, it is badly moved and uneven, but it is also quite funny. Scream Queen Brinke Stevens is better than usual as a pretty, fragile housewife whose worthless husband (Jay Richardson) plans to get rid of her because she needs money to pay off the gangster (played by Robert Quarry). Delia Sheppard, veteran of many soft-core films from the early 90s, in fact gives the best performance in the film as a slutty lover. You will also enjoy the small roles of Karen Black as a medium, Robert Clarke as a doctor and Michael Berryman in a nice episode in one of the better scenes. The ending did not make much sense!
