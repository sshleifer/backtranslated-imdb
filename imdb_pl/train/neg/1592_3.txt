In order to raise the dramaturgy of this nasty story of a maternity ward, it is placed in a special branch for "difficult cases". The main story is Loretta Young; he is leaving a long prison for murder. Will doctors save their child at the expense of life or will they pay attention to the husband's request for the opposite? Melodrama and fondness prevail, and, most simply, they are not honest. For example, so that everything does not change, the hospital has a psychiatric ward next to the obstetric ward and allows the woman to hysterically get pregnant about the theft of children. <br /> <br /> There is just so much laughter and sarcasm to make it recognizable as a Warner movie, mainly from Glenda Farrell, who pours a gin out of a bottle of hot water while she waits for the twins to find her worries now right against sale. An example of her repartition: "Be careful." Farrell: "It's too late to be careful." Aline MacMahon is of course wonderfully authoritative as the head nurse, but do not expect him to get a dramatic moment. <br /> <br /> The main theme of the movie is that the view of the child turns everyone into mush. Even considering the obvious limitations, this movie should be better than it really is.
