The girl takes a shower, not knowing that the serial rapist is staring at her through the skylight. Detectives Martin Manners and Orville Stone are in the act, but they are not hot enough because they find him after killing, raping and eating a girl's nipple. One can hope that it will be the end of the movie. Not because it is too scary, but because the level of the game is terribly horrible. Unfortunately, this is not the end and months later the rapist is resurrected as a zombie by the Satanist Sabbath. So he continues where he left, with the detectives again, this time a child flying behind him (do not ask). There were VERY good VERY low-budget movies (to think of Street Trash and Filthy McNasty spring), but this starches the bottom of the barrel. Horrible acting, bad dime stores special effects, lame attempt of comedy and yes, and the ending sucks too. <br /> <br /> My class: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Theresa Bestul is naked; Anne R.
