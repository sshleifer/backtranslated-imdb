With a story and a script that seems to have been written by a high school student, "The Art of Seduction" does not provide a romantic, sophisticated experience that is attempting to address. The two main characters have the potential to be interesting - both male and female leading are "swinging singles" (or in the case of female leads, engaged) ", but" The Art of Seduction "does not even try. Waving from a sincere analysis of the personality of these two characters, "Art of Seduction" avoids everything that is important as the basis of a thin, lean stereotype. <br /> <br /> "Art of seduction" is offensive - offends heroes, insults men and women and offends viewers' expectations. It takes away the terrible beautiful people we all know and plays their painful interactions, expecting us to worship them. Ji-wan is an immature, spoiled, manipulative bitch. The viewer is expected to like her and forgive her defects because she is pretty. Min-Jun, well, it's exactly the same. Neither are nice people. "Humor" in this film focuses mainly on the bizarre rehearsals of Ji-wan and Min-jun, in order to outdo each other in the honorable art of lying and manipulation. There is no character development and we never know why Ji-wan and Min-jun are like that. We are expected to accept them as they are and do not ask questions - they are cute! Extensive references to famous major actors in Azn Cinema screenings can distract you from the shallowness of "Art of Seduction". <br /> <br /> If you're still in high school, you like Grease or you're a victim of yellow fever, you can like this movie. <br /> <br /> Despite the "Romance" tag, this is not a very good movie about a date.
