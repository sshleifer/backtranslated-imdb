I did not even bother completing the movie because I was so bored that I thought I was going to faint because I watched him in the movies, and my friends just got tired, so we got up and went to another movie if they ever have to sit for 2 minutes . I think again, I think I'm going to shoot myself ... and I know the whole movie because my friend told me what happened at the end and it did not surprise me. he intended to act properly and let him be happy, I mean that you would have to be a complete idiot to not know. I know I missed nothing and if someone asks me to watch this movie, I would say "over my dead body".
