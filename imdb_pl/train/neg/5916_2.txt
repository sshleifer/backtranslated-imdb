The extremely slow pace of this film was probably the director's intent to convey what life was like as an adolescent village in China. However, I found the combination of slow "plot" and general style of filming to be so impersonal that they completely deterred, especially the western audience. Sometimes I had a problem with distinguishing some characters, because they were filmed from such a distance. Two hours and I was completely out of the care. As someone who is interested not only in music, but also in China's history and culture (and by the way is not foreign to the Chinese cinema), I could not get involved in a single character and found nothing that could help me. This begs the question: did I not like it, who would like it on earth? Give me Zhang Yimou, give me Chen Kaige. Give me the job of almost every other Chinese director I have ever seen. This pitiful effort is not measured at all. I am sorry that Chinese cinema is rated on the basis of this benchmark.
