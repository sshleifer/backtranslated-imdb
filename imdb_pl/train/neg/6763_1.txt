God, what a terrible thing! Oliver Stone probably wanted to experiment or something (see the horrible use of music and photos here), but what exactly? Everything that is behind the "natural killers" seems to be a "smart" look at how the media can turn into complete garbage, but unfortunately the movie turns into garbage. Please, Mr. Stone, the next time you criticize Fascism on TV programs, using violence to get high stakes, avoid the same with the movie! Michael Haneke said quite cleverly about this film that he condemned the media fascism through fascist filming. How true ... Only he forgot to tell us about the huge headache that you got after you sat through that long load of nonsense!
