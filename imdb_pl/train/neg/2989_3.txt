Although the likelihood that someone will focus on this commentary among the other 80+ for this movie is low, I feel I must say something about it. I am not the type of film observer who draws attention to productive value, thought provoking dialogue or brilliant acting and directing. I'm saying, however, that this movie sucks. I do not know why I do not like it ... It means that she has almost everything I want from horror: blood, indignation, unintentional humor, etc. According to this proof, he should be my favorite. Nevertheless, Zombi 3 is a baaad movie. <br /> <br /> There are just too many things that force you to scream on the screen. Like when the girl leaves the army, when the car breaks down to find water (it does not spoil anything, so do not worry). It goes into what I see as an abandoned hotel or something like that. Did not she see that there was an icy lake in the middle of the building? Yes, he is looking for water and crossing the lake. Why? Because he wants to know why people (who are not there because they are abandoned) will not answer when he says, "Is there someone there?" Oh, it's just a small, irrelevant part of the big picture I paint. <br /> <br /> But there is a reason why I gave this movie over 1 star. This is one of those movies in which, if you forget how bad it really is, just like a few times, you will want to watch it again because it is the best in every respect. I called it blood in the first paragraph, but this movie has no blood, it has an ocean of gore. He also has quite strange creatures: a zombie-baby (with an adult-sized hand ???) and a magically flying head, to name only two. <br /> <br /> You know when you try to think about the worst and finest movies ever made, and come up with sci-fi movies from the '50s? I believe that Zombi 3 and movies like these should be the best. It has all the elements: scientists arguing with the government, warnings about the apocalypse on the radio, armies fighting monsters, and so on. This is the plan of the 980s! Although I will not say it is a waste of money, if you want to buy it, just expect the worst. And when you find out that expecting the worst, you do not appreciate Zombi 3, it will not be so bad. You may like it, I'm not saying it's impossible. <br /> <br /> Do not think I hate this movie, do not ... really. Oh, P.S. Rules for killing birds (aka Zombie 5)! (did I just undermine my credibility?)
