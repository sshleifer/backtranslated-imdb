I am a big fan of westerns, but this ... how stinking! It seems to me that what made me break away almost immediately is an illegible dialogue. I think I could write a better dialogue than when I was in eighth grade. And poor actors! Given this horrible dialogue, none of them came across anything funny. I'm really not kidding. Some of them are slightly better than what you can get in the Ed Wood movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest tragedy is Sterling Hayden. He was probably the "big" star in this movie, which, if you call him B-Western, would praise him. This may be called the western B-minus. Pity Sterling Hayden, who appeared at a different time with Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Frank Sinatra and other important talents. For him, to appear in a vehicle, this poor must have been something that he tried to downplay until the end of his life. <br /> <br /> One annoying thing about this movie is that all men look like they have not shaved a week and their faces are fat. I know that in the old West, the guys were not always cared for, but for a man it's a movie that makes you want to just "EWWWW!". Really, this is a bad western. Denver Pyle also had to live like that, especially after performing in so many great westerns. Bad, bad movie.
