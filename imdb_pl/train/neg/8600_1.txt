Low budget throughout history. this film must be one of the worst. The truth is, some movies are humorous, but in general it was just awful. I just can not understand what a person could not throw away with a handful of snails. That means they must be one of the slowest creatures on the planet. The only part worthy of this film is the close-up of snails trying to bite the man's finger. It was rather fun.
