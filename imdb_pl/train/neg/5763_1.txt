<br /> <br /> "Stand aside for the Hollywood veterans?" (the way the brothers were "asked") about what the hollyweird demanded and what he got. However, like many of his recent decisions, it was an amazing mistake. <br /> <br /> The director is so insensitive to today's audience, trying to restore physical pratfalls and gags instead of a funny dialogue is just a disaster. I knew that, the audience knew about it, and CAST knew it. <br /> <br /> What a pity, why did they ever consider changing directors? Not only that, but the two Wayan brothers played as two of the four main characters, without them it was just a farce and sad. <br /> <br /> SP <br /> <br />
