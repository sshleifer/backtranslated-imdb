I am a big fan of Ziyi Zhang and I will go to every movie to see her who led me to Purple Butterfly. Although I wanted to like this film, I have to agree with many others who commented on it. It is very confusing and very slow. Because the whole film appears to be recorded with a handheld camera, significant parts of it are out of focus. <br /> <br /> The film has very few dialogues, and what is there does not tell you much. There are endless scenes of people standing around smoking cigarettes or sitting in a room staring at each other without talking. The way in which film time changes are also very confusing and difficult to follow. Even after reading many reviews before and having a general idea of ​​what a movie is, I still had difficulty understanding what was going on. <br /> <br /> I knew earlier that the film is not similar to Ziyi Zhang's previous films, but I could not wait to see it in something else, but unfortunately I was finally disappointed. He never smiles in this film, although in most cases there is nothing to smile about. I could do it without sex scenes because they were more or less the same and devoid of obvious feelings between participants, as might be expected.
