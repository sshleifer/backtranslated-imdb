I do not like this movie, but I did not think about a book that, though praised by many as a "masterpiece," turned out to be a lack of character development and chaotic and illogical in the story, although it was much more readable than the terrible first effort of Fante "Road to Los Angeles "was not published until Fante became fashionable in the mid-1980s. <br /> <br /> I was intrigued to see what soup Towne would do with such modest ingredients. He worked hard to fix many of the book's shortcomings, but I did not save her money. In Ask the Dust there was never a movie while he always tried to stay true to the book. I am considering this movie of Towne's Madness. <br /> <br /> In a word: forgotten.
