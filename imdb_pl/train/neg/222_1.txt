As a lonely woman after the age of 40, I think that this film is extremely offensive and humiliating for single women over 40, not to mention every other woman, regardless of age. It was a sad, pathetic attempt to write and direct "chicks" by a man who failed. Andy McDowell is not an actress at the beginning, but given the non-existent "plot" (I hate to even call it a story), she did not stand a chance. There was no development of the character, no reason to feel sympathy / empathy for any of the characters and not try to make the movie in any realistic or credible way. And then there is a mandatory male fantasy about an attractive, simple woman who suddenly decides to try a lesbian - PLEASE. <br /> <br /> I wish not only to return the money for the DVD rental, I want to recover those 112 minutes of my life. What a rip off.
