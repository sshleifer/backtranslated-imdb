Creature Unknown is the right word for this movie. Or maybe it should be called Unknown movie. This movie is a piece from the very beginning. He has a really stupid "story line", really pathetic "action" and so on "special effects". <br /> <br /> Some thirty years old "post-teens" are trapped in the woods with a crazy, reptilian, rubber creature lurking forever. What you get with this movie is a lot of conversations and valuable small actions. The girls are walking in the woods, and then you have boys (with heavy mascara) walking in the woods, talking. The whole thing is boring! <br /> <br /> The creation itself is rarely seen throughout most of the movie. When it is shown, the image is distorted to mask the fact that it is a man in a rubber suit, and the movement shows that it is a suit, hence the cause of blurring and image distortion. <br /> <br /> This is NOT a good movie in ANY terms from this word, and those who praised him are probably the people who were chosen from the street to "play" in this really stunning movie! Skip this for sure!
