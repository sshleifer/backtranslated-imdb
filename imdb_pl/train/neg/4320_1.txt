First of all, let me say that this is not a movie for people who want to watch something thrilling and joyful for Christmas. This film is cold, brutal and even depressing. Mary Steenburgen plays a smiling mother who is dead at Christmas, because her husband lost his job, lost his home, can not buy Christmas presents for children, etc. You have an idea, happy things for Christmas. With him, Harry Dean Stanton as Gideon, a Christmas angel who in his dark hat and long coat comes out more like a pedophile who hangs around the children all day. What better way to instill the Christmas spirit in Mary Steenburgen than to kill her family and then offer to bring them back if she believes in Christmas again. Saint Nicholas is a blackmailer and his Christmas workshop is more like a haven for the Nazis. In the film, everything is so thick that you do not care about a happy ending, because the rest of the movie is so bitter and unbelievable. I am sure that this film wanted to be something like Capra, but it did not mention the joy and sentiment about what a holiday film should be.
