There is a good reason why Edison went straight to the video: he would hit the cinema with a crashing thud. The film lasted too long and was dangerously boring. Just a little above the low level (thanks to Freeman and Spacey, who apparently had free two weeks before the next movies), the bad guys are as funny and as non-existent as the actor Justin Timberlake. I hate to knock this guy, but the sooner he realizes that pop is his strength, the better. <br /> <br /> The movie is not so bad ... just mainly. I like the fact that LL Cool J received something that seems to be a shot in being a leading man. He deserves it. And, unlike his colleague and co-creator, he can act. Kevin Spacey is almost always pleasant (you can see him a few times when chewing the scenery), and Freeman has the ability to raise this traffic to three stars (out of ten ... is not so good). <Br /> <br /> When everything is said and done, the final mistake in this film is that it is a mundane and tiring piece of poppycock pseudo-action that does not let anyone fall asleep. It also fails to make anyone give good nonsense about any of the heroes. All in all, it's just boring. Having said that, rent it when you suffer from insomnia.
