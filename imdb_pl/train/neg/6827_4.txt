Dumb is so stupid, in this totally uninteresting, supposedly black comedy. Essentially, what begins with Chris Klein, trying to keep the profile low, eventually transforms into an inspired version of the "Three Amigos", without laughter. For a black comedy to work, it must be outrageous, which is not "Play Dead". For a black comedy to work, it can not be a mean ghost, which is "Play Dead". What "Play Dead" really is is a city full of musical memories. Fred Dunst, however, does quite a fair imitation of Billy Bob Thornton's character from "A Simple Plan", while Jake Busey does quite a good imitation, well, Jake Busey. - MERK
