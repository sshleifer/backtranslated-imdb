Because there was nothing wrong with acting etc., writing an episode is far away for this phantom or phantom. It was a waste of 42 minutes to see a Mars hunter. You must know that in the middle of the sixth series, regardless of what is happening, it is not true what is happening and really adds nothing to the story of the series, except to meet a hunter of Martian people and waste 30 minutes to do it. definitely another case of bad writing in the telenovela in smallville. I really like this program, but mainly because of casting and 3 good episodes every year, but who is on the cast, which works or is usual to work on soaps, must be maintained. It was definitely one of the worst. For the first 4 minutes you know that what is happening is false, and everything that happens is a dream based on Clark's task, of course caused by the phantom zone character, and when he woke up, he wins and blah blah blah so the writers they do not really have to create a villain who will develop the story this week. He can also add another villain who will die in the last episode in which he was a Martian hunter and told him to fly away again or return and tell Clark that he forgot his sunglasses to look closer to this episode and call it a day.
