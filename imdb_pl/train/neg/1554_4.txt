Cannon brought out the true visual beauty of the medieval epic, which seems fascinating (with the exception of dragon support). How did it happen that the long-gone studio, known from Chuck Norris's films, had a complete lack of knowledge at all? An example: an amateur actress and a terrible conspiracy is a sign that the revival of a medieval legend is not a remedy for a miserable execution. They did it and they made another cheap exploiter equipped with hundreds of lustful moonshowers to look even better. For the two "Barbarian Brothers" they certainly know how to make strange sounds, than to become brave warriors, so strong and brave, to save their homeland. This is the greatest waste of potential that I saw in the "expensive" low-budget film, and worse enough to let the toperman break through the magnificent print without mercy. All this happened after the advertising campaign, which sold T-shirts based on BARBARIAN! The movie itself is a great souvenir!
