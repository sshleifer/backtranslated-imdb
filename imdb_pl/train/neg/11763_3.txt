Yes. I admit it. I believed in all this noise around this work, about the trials and torments of six people living in Mexico City regarding their sex life. And in fact, I was expecting to finally see a Mexican movie (for centuries) that would be both popular and interesting. Unfortunately the movie was completely disappointing. History presents us two couples, both with very obvious marital problems. When a third person enters into force each pair, their problems reach a turning point. Or absolute absurdity. The conspiracy turns into a sex battle. The position of each group (yes, literally a group, girls with girls and boys with boys) is grossly stupid and childish (I think the mood was supposed to be there). And everything goes wrong. The performances range from good (Miss Zavaleta) to mediocre (Mr. Bichir), and Serrano performs a satisfactory job on his operatic prime. However, flat circumstances that make up the story, one-dimensional characters, very poor (if not stupid) perception of what sex represents in a mature relationship, cause the movie to fail. Miserably. SPyL has (impressive) good pickup at the box office. Believe in noise at your own risk.
