A really awful movie that made me feel sullen, watching forty minutes, or at least I could stand it. Not the fault of the actors, but the screenwriter / director, producers, financiers, etc. They need a very rigid conversation. Maybe he thinks he's deep. This is not. This rape and ultra-violence, unlike the central one for the Mechanical Orange, has nothing to say or add to the sum of human understanding. There are also no Straw Dogs, which I compared. There seems to be something that Pete Walker could point out, but even saying that I am probably a bit unfair to Pete Walker. <br /> <br /> Revenge is a powerful human desire, but the bedroom window has more to say about this and male emasculation than this pathetic effort. <br /> <br /> I do not think it is particularly misogynist, just too happy to present some details - the blood flowing from the GA leg after the rape, for example. It is neither a challenge nor a confrontation, although I am sure that the creators of the film consider themselves very "bold", simply deeply unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Is it as high as we can? Is that why the involved wanted to make movies? (I've written a Latin phrase here that translates as Oh the Times! Oh, customs! But the new IMDb spell check did not let me write until I removed it.) I had to remove the square brackets, sorted IMDb.) <br /> <br / > Where are the lofty aspirations? Noble impulse? When you look at a British movie - happy comedies by Ealing or Boulting Brothers; Carol Reed's work with Graham Greene in Fallen Idol, Our Man in Havana or the lofty The Third Man (a movie that has much more to say about evil than a thousand Straightheads); the work of Powell & Pressburger; or if you want to talk about sex, violence and masculine emasculation, look at the "The Offense" regime by Sidney Lumet from John Hopkins' original art, check out "Tunes of Glory" to find out something worth attention that has something to say. <br /> <br /> Unlike the above, Straightheads is, unfortunately, a completely hateful waste of celluloid.
