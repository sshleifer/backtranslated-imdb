The story is about the life of ordinary people from Antwerp who live their lives. I said this and there is nothing more to tell about this story. The movie is fast, like MTV-flick and well photographed, and we feel that the director is talented and should make more films. Let's forget about it and let's hope for the best with another picture of Deus-Barman.
