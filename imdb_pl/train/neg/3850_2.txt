I saw this movie in SXSW with the director. A lot of people came out, and the audience could barely gather even polite applause at the end. Of the 60 or 70 films that I saw at this festival, Frownland is one of the worst. <br /> <br /> After 106 minutes, it's at least 95 minutes too long. You can watch unsuccessful and drawn attempts to contact the main character in extended real time. The same grimaces, mouth movements, kinetic and feverishly repeated words and syllables over and over again - WE GOT A POINT. <br /> <br /> One page actually compares this work to the early Mike Leigh. What drugs would you have to have to declare? Considering that Frownland is a Captain Beefheart song, you may have to enjoy the Trout Mask replica during heavy rotation to appreciate the movie. Incredibly, it won the jury's award at the festival. It can be assumed that he did not win the audience prize.
