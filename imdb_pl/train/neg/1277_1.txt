This film still chills me, thinking about it. This movie was not as bad as in the case of a low budget, poor performance, etc., although it was certainly all these things. The problem with this movie is that it seemed to deliberately annoy the viewer and do it with great success. I want to know if it's going to be a horror movie? I mean, it's scary, but not in the way horror movies should look like. I saw the first segment trying to be frightening and disappointing, but what the hell is the other segment? It's just annoying. The third segment is like watching an artistic student film that surprisingly makes it the least painful segment. It's horrible that this movie is not low downstairs 100, so get votes (1/10) in people !! I know that some people gave good reviews, but well, they lie in a sadistic attempt to cheat. Trust me, you can not like this movie. The only advantage of this film is the amazing effect of prolonging life: it seems that you've been watching this movie for years after the first half hour.
