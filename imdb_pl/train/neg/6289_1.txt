This is the most banal and worst romantic comedy I've ever seen. Every scene is regrettable, and the two main actors - Corey and Danny are so annoying. Corey is very stupid and na√Øve and he should never have listened to Danny's false promises. <br /> <br /> Neve Campbell and the killer from Urban Legend are the only advantages of this bad film rehearsal. Danny (Dean Paras) looks thirty, and the girl she's trying to sleep - Corey looks like she's still in college. <br /> <br /> Here in Australia, this movie is called Too Smooth; there is nothing smooth in this movie. 1/10 Avoid
