Predictable, hacked and badly written. I was foolishly thinking that such an eminent caster would not be involved unless he would do it. I think that the competition between the actors is so intense these days (and it will only get worse) that you can not choose and choose a lot anymore. Early on we got the inclination that played a key role in the murder and we have pushed our throats away. The film lacked intrigue, giving us a small insight into the victim and only one possible motive for murder. Part of the discourse was, to be honest, embarrassing! It is hard to believe that anyone would even consider, let alone commit, spend tens of millions of dollars on this tripe.
