It was not a Trainspotting movie or Guy Ritchie. It was a great would-be. I wanted to be nervous, nervous laughter, a film that affirms life in the city, but it is a more violent, chaotic camera. It's much easier to imitate something other than to create a real story with real characters. From the very beginning, I did not care about the characters or what they were involved in. They always always beat, pee or cry. Only what they did did not make sense. The dialogue between the characters is supposed to be fashionable, revealing, instead comes out trite, and one scene after another is predictable. I know there are viewers who really liked this movie, so I can be wrong.
