I would put it on top of my list of movies in the category of unreadable junk! There are films that are bad, but the worst are those you can not watch, but you are likely to like them because they are meant to be good for you! Sex sequences, so shocking in their day, could not even raise a rabbit. The so-called. The controversial policy is a Marxist amateur student in high school. The film is consciously artistic in the worst sense of the word. Photography is in raw grainy black and white. Some scenes are out of focus or taken at the wrong angle. Even the sound is bad! And some call it art? <br /> <br />
