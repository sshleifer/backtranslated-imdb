The funniest scene of this movie is probably that our saviors received medals, plaques and anything else. The basic idea is that the police outnumber those gangsters by one million to one, but it is powerless because the weapon of the villains is a little bit bigger. My guess is that police ammunition just bounces. They decided to make this film in a documentary style with fake interviews and seriously, what's wrong with these guys? They say as if they were armed with rolled-up newspapers. Okay, I admit it's probably still dangerous to be in the line of fire, even if the situation is in your favor, but do not be annoyed. And why the hell did it take 44 minutes? I would say it is a very long time when you have them surrounded and you can shoot. They're like ten feet from them, they're not hitting anything. Then they go and buy bigger pistols to increase their heroism. And then yes, you have it, one of the cops really hits someone. Bullet probably was directed by a lantern or something like that. I think I was laughing.
