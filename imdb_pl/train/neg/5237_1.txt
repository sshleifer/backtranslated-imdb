One of them, if not the worst movie from Great Britain in the 80's. <br /> <br /> This cheap middle-aged story flies, which "seduces" two teenage scrubbers who look after him and his fictional wife, has nothing to redeem. , childish, uncouth and unrealistic, this film explores the depths because it fails to be funny, provocative, intellectual and controversial. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the worst thing about this movie is the way George Costigan's strong cast, Michelle Holmes and Siobhan Finneran were completely sewn together by such a lame script. No wonder it is the only work of the late Andrea Dunbar, which appeared on the screen. Complete and complete garbage at every level.
