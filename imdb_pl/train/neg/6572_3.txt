In my opinion, the title of this movie should be changed from "Only the Brave" to "All About Lane". A few months ago, I went to the screening of this movie and was very disappointed with the result. Although I appreciate that the director made a movie about men from 442 - a topic that has long been deserving of attention in the film industry - acting in some parts of the movie was quite outdated. The performances of Marc Dacascos, Tamlyn Tomita and Jason Scott Lee were great. However, the director NEVER should be the main character of the film. I'm sorry Lane, you're not a movie actor. Hold on to what you're good at - theater acting. Gina Hiraizumi's performance in this film was also terrible. She should never have played the role of speaker, and her appearance was not appropriate to play the role of Queen Miss Nisei. There were other young actresses in the film that were naturally beautiful and whose performances were great ... Why were not they cast in this role? Another sequel to this movie were action sequences. Japanese-American soldiers do not look like they were fighting German soldiers ... let alone anyone. Granted that it was a low-budget feature, but because it was a war-based movie, is not it important to show some really fighting? This movie was a worthy attempt, but definitely not worth the big deal.
