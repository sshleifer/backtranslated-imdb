Okay, this is a short and sweet review ... Something the film should have been practicing made his life shorter and sweeter than it was. <br /> <br /> This movie is $ ^ @%. There is a good reason why a petition with over 40,000 signatures has been submitted. EVERYTHING demanding, Uwe Boll stops making videos of franchises that people like. Blood Rayne is a big fan there. <br /> <br /> The jokes are good ... if you've never heard THOUSAND times before. Acting is a descent, but you can really blame only the script. I wonder for even a few moments if they even use the script. <br /> <br /> The movie has little to do with the original games. HI, if you played games, you know that the main character has no real motivation except for murderous drives, such as mass murders, because he crushed his toe or the like. There is too much history for such a stupid movie. As I said. I would not even like to steal this movie. And for the person who says that this is "The Funniest Film of 2007" .......... must look around, the news is better than this.
