After seeing the first 20 minutes of Blanche (sorry I could not take it anymore), now I confirmed that I did not. <br /> <br /> Essentially, this "movie" is an insult to real French actors taking part in this farce. It starts with a concept successfully used in French comedies ("Deux heures moins le quart avant Jesus Christ", "La Folie des Grandeurs", ...): a historical film with an anachronistic tone / dialog. It can give great results if it is supported by genius actors and the "finesse" of the direction, avoiding the terrifying stigma of "heavy comedy". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Lou Doillon is ruining everything face to face and Blanche, instead of a comedy, just turns into a horror movie. Horror for movie fans who want to be surprised and shocked to watch great actors such as Decaune, Zem or Rochefort fighting in the middle of this flashy burlesque kitchy-prissy farce.
