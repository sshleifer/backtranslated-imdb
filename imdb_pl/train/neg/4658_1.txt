BRIEF ENCOUNTER is a ghostly and pointless remake of the classic David Lean from 1945, based on the art of Noel Coward "Still Life". The doctor removes a piece of gravel from the female eye at the train station, is in an unhappy relationship, is a happy wife of a social worker of Italian origin. They meet by chance on another occasion, create an immediate attraction and organize meetings every Wednesday. The couple fall in love, but after spending a few afternoons together, they realize that they have no real chance of happiness and agree to break up. Coward's original one-act play concerned two ordinary people who fall in love. Sophia Loren and Richard Burton, two Hollywood Hollywood superstars and veterans, are nothing more than "ordinary people." In particular, Loren is mistaken - Sophia Loren in full make-up, looks like a million dollars, and working as a part-time social volunteer in Citizen Advice Bureau simply does not sound. Burton, looking haggard with dyed hair, too much make-up and wearing shoes on the platform, is not considered an average GP. Having said that, you really can not blame them for having an affair after seeing their spouses. Burton is married to a literary critic who spends evenings writing poisonous reviews and treats her husband with complete contempt. Lorena's husband, Jack Hedley, potters at home all day and he is inexorably boring: the most exciting thing he has ever done is romance from six years ago. Their final scene together will cause nausea ("You were far, far away", etc.). This great British actor, John LeMesurier, has three minutes as a friend of Burton and seems a bit drunk, speaking his words in a barely audible voice. It is a sad and unforgettable performance in the grim, horrible processing of classical cinema. Avoid at all costs.
