A strange film from producer Charles Banda. At the time of the greatest success, Full Moon Band said he would never do "real killer movies" because he felt that little dolls and big monsters added a fantasy element that made the movies better - people killing each other are so real and less funny. Nice philosophy and a real shame that the band, destroying Full Moon studio through cheesy business transactions, became so desperate in home theater profits that it started to create exactly what Blockbuster wanted, and that's why they sacrificed creativity and originality. The team behind it also worked on "Delta Delta Die!" And "Birth Rite" - both equally bland by Full Moon standards. Debbie Rochon is usually on top, as a novice among guys and dudettes, who decide to come up with a story about a "club of murders". She - as it seemed - does everything in her power to join, and then panic begins, because it was not a real story and stupid Mrs. Rochon believed it and now everyone will have to run, bloody and perhaps killing each other or not. The choice is yours and it's yours for this video ... not recommended, but not entirely bad.
