"Cut" is a film about film students who make a movie. It's a lot in the form of "Scream", an ironic, self-correcting horror that at least falls for me, because despite all the irony it is still a horrible horror movie, just like the movies it refers to. br /> <br /> But it was not without charm. Well, one charm anyway. Molly Ringwald was fantastic as a spoiled, strange American actress who hates every minute of work with an amateur Australian film crew. She was so convincing that she was tempted to believe that it was not an act, although everyone involved in "Cut" said she was wonderful to work with. :-) <br /> <br /> Seriously, every scene of her sulking, sulking or snatching was great. However, everyone else hesitated between being OK and being very wooden. <br /> <br /> In any case, "Cut" has some laughter, a few buckets of gore (some of them are surprisingly macabre), and finally ... another bad horror story.
