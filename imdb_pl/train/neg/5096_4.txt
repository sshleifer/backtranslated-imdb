Kurt Russell (as Steven Post) works as a mail-box for the UBC (United Broadcasting Corporation); He does not go to work anywhere, offering funny studies to the management of the studio, such as "Dr. Abraham Lincoln dog" - because Lincoln, doctors and dogs are popular. Program director Joe Flynn (as Francis X. Wilbanks) wisely rejects Mr. Russell's proposals, but has no idea how to choose a hit TV show. His secretary, Heather North (as Jennifer Scott), who doubles as Russell's girlfriend, has a chimpanzee who digs out Russell when he wants to watch TV. It turns out that the monkey watches all popular programs and can easily choose hits. Russell discovers the chimpanzee's talent and uses it to develop his own career. Understandably, things become HAIR for Russell and the cast! <br /> <br /> Raffles chimps (operated by Frank Lamping) work well; Raffles look bored and / or scattered during a few scenes when the chimp is supposed to look interested; they could be improved thanks to re-execution or editing. There is a gentle satirical edge - imagine a monkey who has chosen hit TV programs! And, this is a monkey who gets a BEER during commercials (he drinks in a Disney movie)! A look through the cast will reveal a lot of funny TV actors who will recognize and try to put. You could create a game drinking in honor of drunk Raffles beer, guessing the actors and where you saw them before. Here's the beginning - Hey, is not this "Dr Bellows" from "I Dream of Jeannie"? Down the hatch! <br /> <br /> **** The Barefoot Executive (1971) Robert Butler ~ Kurt Russell, Joe Flynn, John Ritter
