Unfortunately, I have to agree with the critic written by halopes. <br /> <br /> For a short movie the pictures, costumes, sets, sound, editing and everything else is very, very good. At the beginning it may seem surprising, but I was told that the technical team working on this team consists of professionals, so you should expect quality. As always, the problem is in history itself. <br /> <br /> The thing is, this is not history. To tell a story (or in the case of cinema, SHOW the story), you need a plot and conflict. You need things that happen to the hero: events. These events take place because the hero wants something and for some reason can not get it. Tim Watcher has no problems or goals. It is a kind of supernatural being who observes humanity. this is it! So we have a clean exhibition. Instead of showing the story, we just learn something about the person with Tim Watcher. Of course, given the specific nature of Tim Watcher and the short duration of the film, it is difficult to give enough information about him, so the film tells the story of Voice-Over narration. In this case, it is used in the worst possible sense, which aims to provide information that we would not otherwise find. In fact, if it were not for VO, we would think that the character was just a weird old man who looked at things. To make it worse, VO also explains what's happening on the screen! The images we show are just a decoration of the text we listen to. <br /> <br /> I can say that this short film would be a good movie for the band or something, but because the pictures are not stand alone, you can not say it. What is left is of course a value as a measure of the technical capabilities of the crew (not amazing, but good), but it does not entertain, does not entertain, does not excite, or at least does not show history.
