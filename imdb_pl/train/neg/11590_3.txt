It's getting worse, the series is going through a serious fall. The first two parts were acceptable and since then we have seen a lot of really terrible films. Robert Englund gives another great performance as Freddy, but the rest of the cast can not work. The story is that Alice, who survived the previous part of the Nightmare series, finds the deadly dreams of Freddy Krueger starting again. This time the mocking killer hits the sleeping mind of Alice's unborn child. His intention is to "be born again" in the real world. The only one who can stop Freddy is his dead mother, but can Alice free her spirit in time to save her son? Check the first three, miss the next three, then look at the last one.
