**** Do not read this review if you want the shocking conclusion of "The Crater Lake Monster" to be a complete surprise **** <br /> <br /> Claymation plesiosaur rises from the depths of Crater Lake to wreak havoc on the local rednecks group , not to mention the fast scroll button. Calling "Monster from Crater Lake" an amateur is overestimating the obvious. If you're not a fan of low-budget drive-in movies, you probably would not be looking for it first. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is that there is no monster action, it really sucks and is nowhere to go. The scenario is very Ed Wood-ish, because it is completely invented in the way it sets the main sequences of action. Nothing is too fancy for "The Crater Lake Monster". He explains his dinosaur by colliding a meteor in Crater Lake, "overheating" the water to the point where he incubates the dinosaur egg, which apparently rested on the bottom of the lake for millennia. Even if we could accept the fact that the egg could have been there for so long and remained exposed and able to live, would not "overheat" the water to such a high temperature evaporate the majority of the lake? In addition to some symbolic fog in one or two scenes, we can not see evidence that the water is hot, except for a few lines in the script. <br /> <br /> The script is rather completed in a few sequences, and will do everything to let the figures near the lake be threatened by dino claymation. A couple experiencing problems with the car and while servicing the car decides to rent a boat and go to Crater Lake. Hmmmm ... do you think that strangers in this story may be there to get our title monstrosity? In a sequence that is simply bizarre, a drunk robs a liquor store and decides to murder the cashier and observer instead of paying four dollars for a bottle of alcohol. A car chase follows and you would not know about it ... they end right at the lake. Time for a snack for Cratey! Yes, it is not difficult to understand, and you are so far ahead of the script that you are annoyed when these scenes last for another ten minutes. <br /> <br /> The shamefulness of it all is endearing, and I really want to like "The Crater Lake Monster". I just can not do this. There is not enough space here, and this is more of a movie that you can put on during the party because you can talk about it and it does not matter. <br /> <br /> The film has a narrow list of things that concern it, the most important of which is the dinosaur itself, which appears in three forms: a shadow puppet, a large model's head that is dragged along the water and a fully-made claymation insole that looks pretty good. There is also a pair of cute hicks that contain most of the intentional humor in the movie. The end of the downbeat leaves us mourning the death of both the monster and one of our beloved hicks, so every good thing about this movie is dead at the end. Why did this matter to me? Was it a pathetic song over the final credits? Or maybe I just cried in spirit for the time when I lose watching such films?
