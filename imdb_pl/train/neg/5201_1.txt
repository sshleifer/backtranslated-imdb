History has already been seen, but it does not matter if you can create the right storyboard. It is clear that the director has not spent his work on a storyboard. In addition, the cameraman spent too much time tilting angles that do not match the film's message. The funniest thing though is that if you look at the movie's website, you can read that the director decided to make a movie with the wrong camera angles. Because it reminds us of hunting. But I have never heard of hunting with bad camera angles ;-) He will have one star because the story is fine. It is a pity that Ti West did not spend more time reviewing his story. It's like the movie is more important than planning. Since you have a camera, it does not mean that you should immediately make a movie ... come on. Anyone can make a movie, but not all will be just as good. So Ti Tiada advises: stop and mark the label with what you want. Use your time to start planning and not to film until everything is on the storyboard. You certainly have the skills and desires - so do not overuse your talent.
