The past creeps into a rehabilitated addict when he rejoins his sick brother and ex-girlfriend after what he hopes was the last detoxification. "Dramas of Life", presented here in the most simplified way (even the letter has no bite or wit). The cast consists of attractive looking actors smiling grimly to each other, and music and photography are pathetic (a few visual effects are funny, indie-clich√© touches this shadow of a meager budget). Though written and directed by a man, it was created by a woman and I'm not sure, but I think it can be a clear reason why this picture about two men, brothers away from each other, ever closer, never completely chewing, never feels naturally or seems to live in. This is an attempt to enter a male relationship, but a careful, sterile presentation is a scam. Nobody has a heart in it, is dead, does not breathe or bleeds with this material. "The Perfect Son" is quickly distributed by too many chefs in the kitchen.
