For those who have little time, I will summarize it quickly, in a word ... pathetic. There are many good examples of why this movie fits perfectly with this description. So much so that you can barely walk for 2 minutes on the screen without seeing anything completely stupid and pointless imposed on you. Do you want a full naked woman in the first 10 minutes? You got it! The reason why he appears is so pointless that he really sets the tone for the rest of the nonsense. You can almost see the deceitful minds of twelve-year-old boys who wrote this piece of junk just watching that shit they expect society to pay! ?? !!! <br /> <br /> I watched many movies from the series that have fallen over the years but American Pie; Beta House must be one of the worst criminals if you consider that despite the average nature of the original movie, it is still a thousand times more fun than this thrill. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable, and sometimes you really feel that you are watching school play. The things that have happened in this movie are so unrealistic that watching it requires a lot of disbelief (we're talking about Star Wars suspensions levels like those you have to convince yourself Jar Jar is real) <br /> <br /> it is paper thin and usually the events that appear are only to show another pair of breasts or set another pathetic joke. There is no acting talent that you can talk about, the only thing you can get is a bunch of pretty boys who are trying to make us laugh. And ohhh, if they fail !!!! Every gag falls, and the only thing I laughed about was how screenwriters are socially ignorant. How else can you explain bulls that they try to convey as a story? <br /> <br /> They disappear from every opportunity to do something valuable and amusing in favor of the wrongly written, lowest common denominator of nonsense. The heroes must complete a set number of tasks before they are accepted as Beta House members, but this mainly deals with a series of very short photomontages that suggest that they perform the task, but we see little evidence that it is actually happening. This is a very lazy way of telling stories. He also longs for the possibility of being funny (imagine that the Wizard from the land of Oz, where all important events took place off the screen, not on it, and all we see, is Dorota the courageous Scarecrow every now and then saying: "Oh my , it was definitely a great adventure that we had then ") Lazy. Lazy. LAZY !!!! <br /> <br /> Female characters have little or nothing to say. Everything they do is naked for no apparent reason and is used as a visual prop for most of the movie. You braindeads who are only looking for T & A, you will not be disappointed, but for that reason you will embarrass you. If you buy it on DVD, you will contribute to the fall of society in your own way. Congratulations.
