The film had good acting games and good moments (though of course a low budget), but a bad rating due to poorly developed basic assumptions. The main point of the conflict between the two leads is not really realistic. There are a few scenes where they disagree about it, but there is no discussion about some great depth that would explain how they can be together seeing the world so differently, especially since Glenn's employment is so locked in this part of his life (and Adam is so active that he supports him with time and money.) Also, several times Glenn is presented negatively for being what he is (he apologizes to Adam for his past), while Adam turns out to be steadfast and "traditional" "Which movie announces as" good "in the end. I do not like that I like it. I took part in a discussion session with the director after watching the LTR, and he said he presented this conflict between them because if he was in Glenn's shoes (and said he's doing it in real life, he refers to Glenn's view) that he would never know contact someone with Adam's views. Well, I think he should have done a much better job explaining how Glenn can do it in the movie. The director also said that he directed his first film after reading (Directing For Dummies). The direction was not so bad, but far from the highest effort. I've seen worse, but I rarely leave films with a sense of frustration.
