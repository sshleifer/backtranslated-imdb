Doppelganger has its moments, but they are few. <br /> <br /> Essentially, it's a mix of pop-psychological thriller, ghost stories and horror stories. Drew Barrymore plays a young woman who is haunted by the demons of her past (most of her family was murdered, and she was, at least in one case, the main suspect), or is she just having a really bad case of multiple personality disorder? George Newbern is her new partner, and most of the action focuses on him. <br /> <br /> Newbern's character is very nice and both he and Barrymore do a decent job (though not quite well). The medium to (sometimes) completely frightening scenario and unbelievable direction seem to combine to drown the rest of the spectacles in oblivion. The character of Leslie Hope is unforgettable, but so irritating that you will want to forget about it. <br /> <br /> The plot eventually breaks down into a split (one theme is psychological realism, the other is a supernatural horror) a bizarre climax that is so badly conceived, preserved and photographed that it effectively counteracts most of what the film has reached earlier . <br /> <br /> In general, the film has the impression of what may be the result of the first M. Knight Shamalyan's Bachelor film class. Acting and the script for the two leads are just good enough for you to take care of them - at least until the movie completely puts you out of balance. <br /> <br /> My recommendation - send your doppelg√§nger, but avoid first-person meeting.
