Once again, the same familiar story about a man (writer here) who sells his soul to the devil in order to have the most desirable ambition in life: success. An amazing scenario (we should "go home and write better"), funny lines to understand the "strong" message of "Christianity" (our only aspiration in life is to find love, respect and good friendship) and a very long process scene at the end, where Agent Hopkins defeated the devil (Jennifer Love Hewitt is not sexy or evil at all) for all the bad things she did for this unlikely form. Great effort of actors (Baldwin also as a director, again Cattrall in the role of "Sex in a big city", Aykroyd with a few funny lines in his limited role). P.S. Also try the not so popular Greek movie "Alloimono stous neous", the brilliant adaptation of this myth (old man gives his soul to the devil to regain youth)
