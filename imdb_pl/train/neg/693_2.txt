((Note: Spoiler warning, like this!)) <br /> <br /> First, it's a "teen slasher" - Spam-in-A-Cabin genre, like Joe Bob Briggs with a smile he put it. If you are looking for Roshambo, this is not it and it will not be. Desperate, they do not impress me with cinematography, directing and acting. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it was not Zunigi's first horror, it was her first time on screen, cinema, TV, whatever. What is it worth it for; neither is Daphne Zuniga Susan Sarandon nor Katherine Hepburn. <br /> <br /> Third, you have to give even bad props. Sure, this is due to the profoundly offensive formal message of his genre: every young woman with or having interest in sex is beef on the hooves, and the harvest time is now. <br /> <br /> Except this one gives you a sweet, virgin heroine chop! Now THERE is a mediocre movie of death teen who has the courage of his beliefs! Interestingly, it was the only film role in Ingenue. Another hit "Wonder Wonder", with the difference that this term gives too much credit. <br /> <br /> (On the other hand, this movie probably has one of the highest percentages of actors in a single movie in history.) Of the nineteen recognized actors, thirteen never appeared in any other film, three appeared in another film by the same producers and only one other than Zuniga has six movies, what was it, Society for mutual help was never?) <br /> <br /> It's true, I've seen it a long time on the cable late at night, when I was bored and never I expected to be bored again in my life, but I see no reason to chase everyone involved and throw them into the incinerator with Joanne. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
