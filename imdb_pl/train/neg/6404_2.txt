Spoilers ... if something like that is possible .... . . . . . As a furious fan of Robin Williams, I felt that it was necessary to buy this film as the first look on the screen. Wow ... I could not imagine a more paralyzing movie mind. Basically, the movie has one bad joke after another that your Uncle Artie would tell you after dinner and dramatize them. Robin Williams plays an attorney in a 30-second sketch. <br /> <br /> I am for naughty humor, but this humor was not pleasantly vulgar or insensitive ... it was just a numbness. This film has no advantages, except Robin Williams fanatics, just like me who just have to have every movie.
