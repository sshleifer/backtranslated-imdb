An interesting change from the first. this movie was more mysterious than the first. Even when the question ends, what happened, who the killer was. There are a few good parts in the film, the first half begins slowly and then accelerates in the last half. The whole film is pleasant. The story is 22 years after the events that took place in the first film, Norman Bates is from asylum and back to the Bates motel, but when a woman appears, claiming to be his real mother, things start wrong. Perkins plays good old Norman again, and the stage at the end was great.
