Like most comments, I saw this movie called The Witching, which is the title of the re-edition. Apparently necromancy, which is the original, is better, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> Most witch scenes still contain most scenes of necromancy, and these are still bad. In many respects, I think that the extra witches' nudity has at least added some entertainment value! But do not be fooled - there are only 3 scenes with nudity and people standing around the variety. Without diabolical rumpy knickers! <br /> <br /> This movie is horrible by nature, it is difficult to know what to criticize first. The dialogue is terrible and straight from the Troma cabinet. At least Troma is with a pinch of salt. It's the epitome of a boring face. Acting is variable in the case of Pamela Franklin (Flora of a possessed kid in The Innocents, what would you believe in!) Worst of all with her high, screeching voice. Welles seems only to wait for a check. The other woman has a frightening face, so I do not know why Pamela thought she could trust her in the movie! And the doctor is also very bad. It also looks disturbingly like Gene Wilder. <br /> <br /> It is not very well filmed with scenes changing for a reason, and editing is uncertain. This is because the witch is a copy and paste job, not a subtle one. Only the lighting is fine. The sound is also horrible and it is difficult to hear it with a terrifying new soundtrack that never closes. The "spiritual" mother is equally ridiculous, but the actress is so bad that she acts so that at least she gives me unintentional laughter. <br /> <br /> Really this movie (at least a witch) is intended only for the unwary. He can not have many healthy fans because he is quite unobservable, and I really think it's a boring feeling! <br /> <br /> The best thing was that the loans were over - that's all it said simply better after this weak excuse for LIKE THE PLAGUE!
