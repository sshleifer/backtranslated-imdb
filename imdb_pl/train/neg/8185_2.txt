Oh my. I decided to go to the cinema with a few friends, wanting to watch one of those gentle, good Christmas movies, and go out in disgust. The film was not successful. Full stop. Paul Giamatti, whom I consider a good actor, played his character and rolled terribly, as well as Vince Vaughn, who has always been my favorite. They're trying to turn a Christmas movie into a new style. A bit bad, mixed with good, but everything turned out to be very bad. The first ten minutes were not so bad, but when we saw Santa Claus, it's over. It was not better, the rate remained the same, there was no development of the character, and it is certainly one of the worst Christmas films. Do not watch what you do.
