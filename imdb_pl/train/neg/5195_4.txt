I heard (and read) so many good things about Weeds that I could not wait to drop into another great cable series (like Entourage, Sopranos or Mad Men), but slowly eroded along with every episode I watched from Season One. (failed to exceed the first six episodes) <br /> <br /> Writing was unoriginal, invented and portraying embarrassing Blacks. Dialogue was forced, as writers are trying too hard to be wise and fashionable. It was a rare moment when I actually emitted an audible laugh. <br /> <br /> Characters have never developed enough to deal with them, they were selfish and unattractive. I absolutely HAD ALREADY added that adding a brother-in-law (which should have been pulled back to To Catch A Predator) and removing Hodes' daughter Quinn from the cast, sending her to a boarding school in Mexico, was so unusual and trivial, I had to come to the conclusion that the writers were testing viewer's loyalty. <br /> <br /> I liked the episode less episode less and I could not avoid many technical flaws in the story. <br /> <br /> I added that I heard that the second season was not so good, so I lost all motivation to continue watching this game. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of good casting and writing, I suspect that this program will be a challenge for you, unless of course you are stoned, and then all bets are turned off.
