Wow, I paid Â£ 3.50 to see the movie at the cinema. I can not believe I wasted my time. Acting is worth attention at best, and special effects are primitive. Probably the worst case scenario in history, some unusually embarrassing quotes I've ever heard in my life. I swear that God "swept away" is better than this. Madonna should win, and Oscar compared with those guys. I want to go back an hour and a half of my life. Honestly, people do not see it, even a toddler would consider this film an insult to their intelligence. this movie was very strange to me, because it was difficult to say who is more wooden, here are real doll guys. the guys' requests do not waste time on this movie, you will regret it.
