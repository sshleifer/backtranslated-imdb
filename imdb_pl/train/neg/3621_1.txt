I hated the show when I was a kid. It was at a time when children show that the characters have accents, not just a mindless, general, general American dialect to which we are accustomed. Jack Wild had a British accent, and Pufnstuf was southern. However, as I mentioned one of the others, I never quite understood what is happening to a witch who wants a flute. It always seemed strange to me, probably because the flute just made me nervous and I would not have any problems to take it! <br /> <br /> Just a comment about the similarity of the McDonalds ads from Pufnstuf which others have mentioned: Pufnstuf broke up McDonalds. At the peak of McDonalds' popularity, the TV show (or rather their creators) tried to get a license for McDonalds, but when McDonalds refused, the television program changed some of the characters and passed them on as their own. They even employed former employees of the McDonalds advertising agency and voice actors to create television programs. McDonalds sued and won. Look for a lawsuit by Pufnstuf McDonaldland, and you'll find many articles on the subject.
