It scared me when I was a teenager. Now I think it's more fun than frightening, but with a few disturbing moments and with some poor quality that I like. And, thinking about it, the plot is rather disgusting ... but treated with some taste. If there is a problem with this movie, it is that there are HUGE gaps in which nothing interesting or interesting happens. The ending also lasts forever, making the potentially tense climax seem stupid after a while, and Barbara Bach screams and screams. "Monster" after its unveiling is neither scary nor unfortunately. The somewhat monotonous appearance of the film also works against it, making it appear in the television film more than in the cinema. But this is an example of films that are currently rarely made, so I encourage horror fans to watch it and feel a bit nostalgic ...
