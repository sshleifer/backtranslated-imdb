The only thing I remember from this movie are two things: firstly, as a twelve-year-old, even I thought it stinks. Secondly, it was so bad that when Mad magazine made a parody of it, they gave up on the first page and wrote a caveat at the bottom of the page, saying they rejected it altogether. <br /> <br /> If you want to see great contemporary comedies from this period, try Animal House. It's so stupid and vulgar that it goes down to high art. Another good choice would be Caddyshack, classic with the late Rodney Dangerfield and Bill Murray, before he became annoyingly charming, with big lines such as the green keeper Carl Spackler. I'll lock me up and throw away the key.
