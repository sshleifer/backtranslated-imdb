This movie was bullshit with a big capital "C." The opening scene was promising. But this "promise" was broken shortly after the viewer found out where the story was going. <br /> <br /> And the wooden figure, Morty, who was quite frightening in the original movie, looks stupid in this form. It was such an obvious guy in a cheap plastic outfit. (By the way, who else thinks that "Morty" is one of the most terrifying names on planet Earth, this rank is there with "Jimmy" or "Fred" when it comes to the value of the horror. -Kissinger. "Run, it's Dr. Kissinger!" That would be as scary as "Morty." <br /> <br /> And then there is a scene where the "hero" hits his father's gravestone with a "sledgehammer"? "Could you guess -" two out of four? "Someone would take a chance, no, he beats his father's gravestone with a twig --- a bizarre branch, worse when the heroes leave, the tombstone really and inexplicably bleeds ... O bratie! <Br / > <br /> There's also an indigenous American who lives with the main character's grandparents, but apparently does nothing but Keep Morty, captures Morty's horrifying legends, warns those who mock and even mends Morty's arm, when it stays behind done during a child's joke, but for all his respect and tenderness towards Morty, does Morty make the rat hairy? No. <br /> <br /> The film stretches and eventually some people die in a way that suits their worst fears (type). This film is a real expert. Do not rent it.
