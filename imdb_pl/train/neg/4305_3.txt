I saw this movie some time ago on the Video CD. <br /> <br /> First, I will mention good sites. <br /> <br /> At the beginning the movie at least tries to seem like it is not biased, like not showing one character as black and the other as white. Both main heroes are friends and co-exist very well in the country and economy, which does not flourish, and at the same time does not disappoint. Their families meet and organize parties, and they practice their favorite sport, shooting from a sports rifle, as companions, not as competitors. <br /> <br /> But after the first 15 minutes the plot runs into a fork. It is expected that the audience will believe that for some unknown reason these friends must hate each other. It is for some unknown reason that Bosnia is now on the path to conflict. Sure, the script adds TV material that appears to watch characters live in English, but the clips come from 1993, And not from 1992, When the war began. <br /> <br /> History, elections in 1990, people who caused the war, are not mentioned. The film tries to blame Karadzic, who was the presidential candidate and the leader of the 2nd largest party of the Bosnian Parliament (SDP). According to the Bosnian constitution, the SDP was supposed to hold the presidency in 1992, but in January a coup took place. The Bosnian Islamic Democratic Party took full control and carried out a segregated referendum in March, in which it declared itself law in Bosnia and declared Secession. <br /> <br /> The history of IDAP begins with the Bosnian Muslim Alija Izetbegovic, a man who is suspiciously absent from the "STtH". He was a disciple of Nazism in World War II. He even wrote his own "Mein Kampf" in which he stated: "It is not possible for any peace or coexistence to exist between" Islamic religion "and non-Islamic social and political institutions." <br /> <br /> In 1990 he lost the IDAP election to "moderate Yugoslavia" Fikret Abdic, a Bosnian Muslim who worked with Christian Serbs during the civil war and treated his supporters as brothers. Abdic was prevented from taking power by Izetbegovic, who lost the election, but took over the seat of power. <br /> <br /> The film lacks events in advance, but these are the actual events that led to the war. <br /> <br /> There were also problems with props. Serbian soldiers in the film wore Soviet WW2 helmets that they did not use. Also one soldier was holding a M-1944 WW2 rifle used only by the USSR, not Yugoslavia. <br /> <br /> Directors and screenwriters had a chance, but they decided to write the story again.
