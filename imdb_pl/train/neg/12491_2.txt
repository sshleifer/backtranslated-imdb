Hm. Although it's a nice movie where you can poke holes in the story, point to horrible acting, primitive (at best) special effects (which caused me to watch this movie three times in the last six years). seen. I'm never sure who the heroes are, I just know that the killer uses a portable guillotine, as you can see on the dance floor on the dance floor. To sum up, I do not like this movie, because only the first 30 minutes are pleasant, the rest is a mishmash of confusing dialogue and images that do not go to a logical conclusion (I do not remember that anyway).
