*** SPOILER ALERT *** <br /> <br /> I love Tim Roth, I really do it, and he does everything in his power. I see what a movie is like, which may look good as a script, but it is intricate, unlikely and ultimately stupid. I saw a false death ending a mile away. Rene Z. tries hard to get a guaranteed part, just like Patricia Arquette. Detective, whose name I do not remember (the one who is not Chris Penn), is a great sweaty actor. Look, if you're not smart enough to distinguish a film so clever that you can not follow it, it's so confused that you can not understand it. See if you like cheesy camera work that makes you have seasickness. See if you like to watch how Tim Roth works with a cumbersome script. See if it appears late at night for free. Otherwise, hire Suspicious Ordinary.
