Wow, it was a very bad movie ... as we read in other comments, this movie has no story, no character development, probably have some script, but it is difficult to tell based on the actual final result. <br /> <br /> Editing this movie really did not exist, it tends to jump from stage to stage without any connection or anything that could help the viewer determine what is actually happening. <br /> <br /> In total, this is just a low-budget zombie movie that has not been thought out at all, has bad acting, bad dialogue, bad everything. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves this movie from 1 or 2 is the gore factor, I think it must be the place where they spent all the money they had to try to justify. <br /> <br /> If you're not (like me) dedicated to searching and watching all the zombie movies you can find, do not watch it. Dot.
