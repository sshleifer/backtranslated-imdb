From the beginning of the movie I had the impression that it is a film about another Jason from the 13th of Friday. And this is ... A controversy about the fact that the film is starting to get interested. But over time it's just a senseless movie about a quiet, supernatural, silent serial killer. It means that he is walking under the guy's bed, without sound, not seen by anyone. He was to be blind after an unsuccessful execution, but he walks and kills people as he once did. I'm sick of it. For me, the same applies to the same. <br /> <br /> In other words - unrealistic. Too many mistakes and misleading information. <br /> <br /> Well, the scene with the tidal woman looked impressive, but for the first time:} For an intriguing intro of 2 stars.
