This week, I thought it would be nice to catch up with Corey Haim by simply watching the two Lost Boys movies last week and all of them. Not that I was a fan-boy - definitely not - but I liked the two Coreys in some of my early teenage years. <br /> <br /> So I prepared for three films with his participation. Unfortunately, I chose the "Dream Machine" as the first (I've never seen it before) and it was so terribly horrible that I decided to shut Corey back in my closet and let him sober up before I jump into something else. But I was able to deal with this film first. I had the impression that he desperately wanted to play in the same league as "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" (1986), but he fell into delusion. Virtually, the whole movie wants to be a comedy, and at the end hopelessly trying to be a thriller. The only advantage of "Dream Machine" is the assumption: a dead body in the trunk of a Porsche. All the rest fail so badly that it is embarrassing. Even the most for Haim. I can dig it out by being young, full of enthusiasm, but at least when it comes with some form of directing guidelines. This of course did not happen in the "Machine". So we have an excellent car, yes, this black Porsche. The ideal Haim girl? Just a blonde who almost does not have any lines in the movie. A perfect murder ... almost? Some guy who falls flat on the ass as a villain of the movie, trying to steal the whole body from the trunk, never really succeeds, and at the end of the movie thinks it's Michael Myers (without white William Mask Shatner) and Corey Haim mistakes for Jamie Lee Curtis. Do not think that they could do this flutter if they tried. A stupid, unhappy movie with a story that leads to nowhere directed by a director who does not know how to lead his cast. A great achievement! <br /> <br /> Last question to Mr. Haim: Who was the idea that you would smile directly at the camera in this last shot of the film? Yours or the director? I did not do that.
