I've rarely been so irritated by a leading performance like Ali Ali McGraw in this movie. Is God troublesome or what ?! He speaks everything in the same tone and is terrible, so terrible that Ryan O'Neal is brilliant. <br /> <br /> There are not many stories. He's rich, he's wooden, they both have to sacrifice a lot of love. His father is Stonewall Jackson, her name is his name, in case you did not notice the difference in Two of them that they defeated in the name of love. <br /> <br /> Oscar nominations for this film indicate that it was a bad year. John Marley is okay as Wood's father, but as a supporting Nomination? At least Ali did not win. <br /> <br /> I still think that Katharine Ross should have been playing at Jennifer, but on the other hand, if it was up to me, Katharine Ross would have been a lot more movies. He is certainly a better actress than McGraw. <br /> <br /> I did not even cry when she got sick, it never occurred to me that I was sad. <br /> <br /> It was nice to see that Tommy Lee Jones looks like he was about 15 years old and the result is good. But he is so old that he has a beard a mile long, and the sin is not so old, but he feels it.
