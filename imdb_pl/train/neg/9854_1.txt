This documentary (or rather mockumentary) is a great example of how funny people can be when they are enthusiastic about something like that. Honestly, I hate cryptozoology. It's ignorance, it just destroys it. However, something positive about this was the visual effects (the dragons were beautiful), but some of the information in the mockumentat was completely false, and it is really disappointing because it came from scientists, which is why it deserves 10, not 0. An example of false information can be the idea of ​​hydrogen: It is true that according to Chemystry hydrogen is produced in the stomach, but it can not be produced in such proportions, so in this case, you need a good explanation of what really happens in the dragon's stomach. In nature there are many substances with hydrogen, but it is not necessary to loudly tell the animal to fly, and hydrogen does not come from anything, so it is impossible. Anyway, there is something worse, the idea of ​​platinum: this element is more difficult to find than gold, and I can not explain how dragons will survive depending on it. It's ridiculous, they present dragons like creatures with low chances of conquering the planet Earth, but at least from explaining why they have gone extinct. Probably cryptologists call themselves scientists, but it is not. People like them say lies as in this mockumentarium, and worst of all, some buy them. But I do not think that the person who cares about learning believes in the dragons after seeing this. These false scientists are wasting their time.
