What a boring movie! In conclusion, in principle only Nana Patekar beat her daughter-in-law Karisma Kapoor, while she tried to escape from the village with her son. Can anyone say BORING ?? The concept was not so bad, but it was badly made. Canadian places and some of the scenes from the village were nicely filmed. Overall, however, the cinematography was short. The story could have been great, but the movie just seemed to be pulling. There is only so much foolishness a person can do, let alone three bloody hours. <br /> <br /> The best part of the whole movie was the song "Ishq Kamina", which lasted only five minutes. Besides, this movie was a bit of bullshit.
