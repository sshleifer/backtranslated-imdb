Faith Domergue (better known as "Dr. Ruth" in THIS ISLAND EARTH) is the only reason to watch this movie. The story is very thin, and when the Air Force buddies return to the United States with the Cobra curse, the action is just a waiting game. See Faith the Snake Woman and try to pretend that the rest is not happening.
