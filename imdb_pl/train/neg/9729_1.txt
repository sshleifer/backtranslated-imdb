Seriously, what is THIS? Hooper made such classic films as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and then he made a god-awful movie out of it, what happened? Was he too immersed in crack? This movie is about a guy named Sam who can fire everything, (Firestarter, whoever?) Acting was terrible, the plot was nonsense, and the special effects were very mushy, they looked like something from the '70s. Van Damme should be glad that Derailed is no longer the worst film in history, but what about the end? he began to glow in blue, turned into a glowing blue drop, sucked fire from the girls and the movie ended. WHAT WAS THAT? HUH? when the movie ended, I was hoping that the Spontanious Combust DVD would save me from the pain. <br /> <br /> STOP FROM THIS FILM. <br /> <br /> DO NOT THINK, OBEY, you will thank me later.
