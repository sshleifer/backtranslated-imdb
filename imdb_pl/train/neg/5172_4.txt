This is the second movie that I saw in Horrorfest last weekend, Gravedancers was the first. The gravediggers were better. I can only guess at the fact that the production had to be quite limited. I admit that the story started interesting, but in the end it was finished for me. We really did not have time to sympathize or understand any of the characters that made each of their unpredictable features even more annoying. I must mention that there was some misunderstanding with a 12-year-old boy acting as a sheriff. The only reason I was sitting in the whole movie was to find out what the big secret is, which turned out to be not very interesting. It would help a bit more information about the family, but they did not really look like family at all. <br /> <br /> For me, this movie is so amateur that I could not even see it on DVD. The four assessments concern the initial potential that this story could have. It was one thing to go to a horrorfest.
