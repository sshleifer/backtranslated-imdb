These writings write about the end of the plot, so do not read it if you have not seen this trash. <br /> <br /> I found this garbage movie in the horror section that made me think it would be a horror movie. If I were the owner of a video store, I would place it in the BORING section. This movie is so indecent that it will make you feel like you lost your socks. <br /> <br /> This video contains endless shots of people leading, as if it was frightening. Almost every day I go to work and back (sometimes to the store or visit my cats) and I trust that it is not frightening. It starts even for 20 minutes of driving some people. Even a small child does it. He goes around and never stops. What's so scary about watching a small child riding a bike for an hour? I think that NOTHING and if you look at it, you will not think like that either. <br /> <br /> The family in the car comes to the big castle and takes a trip, walking endlessly around the kitchens. Then the man walks for an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason. It all happens and as you can see it is rubbish.
