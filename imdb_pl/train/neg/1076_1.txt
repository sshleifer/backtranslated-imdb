It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Branaugh seemed to have so much trouble remembering his accent that he could not deliver the line. The plot was definitely not worth the name of John Grisham. No wonder it has never been published as a book or released in cinemas. I did not even see the whole thing. I decided that I did not care who did it, and then realized that there was no "criminality" that he would care for!
