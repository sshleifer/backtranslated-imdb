I have heard rumors about the upcoming "Leonard Nimoyu, who is showing a Blu-ray disc". Thanks to the advances in the last 25 years, from Steady-cam to CGI, it will be interesting to see if the franchise can be renewed. I only hope that it will help to remove the bad taste left in my mouth through the entire Magnavision demonstration fiasco. <br /> <br /> And so ... "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates Betamax VCR" was a brilliant milestone in the history of entertainment. After the initial "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates a compact cassette" and even noisy "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates an 8-track cassette", who would expect such a great piece of cinema? Now I'm crying just thinking about it.
