The original "Vanishing Point" was a great move. Subtle motifs, characters that seemed real and spontaneous. The remake was terrible. Preachia, obviously obvious; it lacked the meaning of why the original was a classic. The black charger was cool, but even it could not save this move. Why stick with the white Challenger? I did not think it was the best choice in '71. Some parts of the movie were involuntarily funny. Like when Vigo stood on a cliff overlooking the canyon after the "Dream Quest". His Indian buddy stood next to him. Vigo was wearing only white pants. I'm sorry - it just looked stupid - he was looking through the perspective in his Owo Loom. At the end was the next scene - after an explosive collision with the bulldozers - the announcer said that the impact was at 180 miles per hour. Then he mentions that the cops said his remains were not found because he had evaporated, but some people believe he jumped out and was hidden by friends in the crowd. Then he shows how he left the car at 180 miles per hour! First of all, you can not open the car door at 180 miles per hour. Secondly, the car will not continue traveling in a straight line for 100 yards. do not control anyone. It would turn around around 30 times. Third, if you hit the pavement at 180 miles per hour, you will end up in various squishy pieces. Never mind, we see him at the end standing with his daughter. All in all a movie that would offend one's intelligence.
