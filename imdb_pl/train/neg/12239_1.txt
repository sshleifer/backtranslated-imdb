Since I was eight years old, I was a huge fan of stocks. It did not matter which federation I watched. WWE, WCW, USWA. For me, the action is everything I watched. <br /> <br /> May 23, 1999. This was my 19th birthday. I ordered Over the Edge and expected another pay for the view. But this time. I was wrong. Instead, she was one of the best wrestlers who left Canada, and the real humanity fell to death due to a stunted unsuccessful stunt. Little can be done to change the situation. But what happened after Owens's death really pissed me off. <br /> <br /> Instead of ending the pay for watching and doing what is human, WWE decided to protect what is first, and it was money, keeping pay per view goes as if Owens' death never happened. <br /> <br /> I have to tell you. Vince Mchmaon made some stupid decisions in his life, but it was by far the stupidest decision he ever made. <br /> <br /> And it's absurd to say that Owen would like the view of benches to continue. Give me a break. When someone dies on a bench in a bench, his sense of compromise to stop him. It's like a policeman shooting a robber or bandit with an escape, then simply leaving the man to die so he can go home and call it a day, as if the man's life never meant anything. <br /> <br /> But no matter what happens. Owen will be omitted and thank you for all the memories you gave us.
