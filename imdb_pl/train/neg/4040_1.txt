I think I'm a bit of a snob about everything, and although cinema experience is more suitable for explosions than drama, I can also be very busy with movies. <br /> <br /> However, not all artistic films are better than King Kong. I would probably give Kong two stars, he drew the film twice. <br /> <br /> I guess people were so excited because it was almost identical in style to what you see in the game. For a less demanding art-buff, a movie that looks like art is "great art". <br /> <br /> However, this movie was useless. <br /> <br /> There was hardly any history, so he relied on drama. The only drama in this movie was whether the cat would fall off the roof or not. So a deep and meaningful dialogue? No. Great acting? It's hard. <br /> <br /> To be too honest: some landscapes were interesting: communist apartments, views of the city (St. Petersburg?) and still used Soviet trams.
