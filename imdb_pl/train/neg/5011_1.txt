... And I never thought that the movie deserves the 1st prize! But this is honestly the worst movie I've ever watched. My wife took this into account because of the cast, but the plot was right, because the DVD box seemed quite predictable. It is not a secret or a movie about youthful paws. It contains no sensuality if what the title could remotely suggest to one of you. This is just a total no-no. Do not waste time or money unless you want to watch a group of young people in a gothic scene for adults, where the killer is chasing them. Nothing new, nothing interesting, nothing worth seeing. Max Makowski is doing the worst thing to Nick Stahl.
