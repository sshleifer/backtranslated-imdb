Oh, my God, what the hell happened? !! I will not say it more, but what is a backward movie? Dubbing in this area is much worse than dubbing in "King Kong vs. Godzilla", Linda Miller had to be the worst actress in him, and the suits are really bad. a gorilla who has the same strength as King Kong, but when this robot breaks down, he builds another, and then tries to kidnap the Congo. . Then Dr.Who sends the robot behind him. <br /> <br /> Later, when I watched the movie, I got a headache when Linda Miller and the other clowns started moaning. As I sat through the misery of watching a DVD while playing, I hoped that the madness in the film would end up until the fight. The ending must be really bad because they could show Kong their fight with the dinosaurs on the island again. <br /> <br /> Do not watch the movie under any circumstances or if ... watch out for the disappointment you get.
