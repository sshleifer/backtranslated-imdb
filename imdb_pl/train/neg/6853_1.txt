Another cheesy quickie from the fertile Albert Pyun. The 13-inch Clint Eastwood patrolman, Tim Thomerson, chases an ugly flying head (!) To Earth and takes part in the South Bronx gang war! Fortunately, short but deadly boring, with the most outstanding effects since the Attack of a 50-person woman. They should also release the guy from continuity: notice how Thomerson's sunglasses disappear and reappear every second shot. It's funny, but that's why we watch these movies, right? Sequel'Dollman Vs. Demonic Toys is reportedly even worse if possible. <br /> <br /> 0 (z ****) <br /> <br />
