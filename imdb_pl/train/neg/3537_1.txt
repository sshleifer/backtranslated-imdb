Convincing the world that he does not exist ... <br /> <br /> This is a line that many people probably remember. Of course, from The Usual Suspects in relation to Kaiser Gold .. I mean Sose .. <br /> <br /> I got another one: - A stupid trick that the director ever tried to convince the audience that he actually had a plot - <br / > <br /> This movie is one of the saddest movie pieces I've seen for a long time. It starts so well with really fantastic photos, great acting and a very smart assumption. But unfortunately the only way the movie is going is the self-destruct course. And not by a single blow, but by making small cuts in the wrists. <br /> <br /> Do not pay attention to comments that are astonishing that they have found a way to explain this donut. With enough alcohol in my brain, I would probably be able to explain the existence of mankind very credibly. I saw and read about a dozen completely different ways in which people explain this story. And they differ from a story completely embedded in someone's head, playing chess with themselves, the clever way in which a criminal can play enemies in a way reminiscent of chess. <br /> <br /> And it's all fun. But at the same time it is a painful hand that something is wrong in this story. In addition, it is in any case a dull movie with many movies and books, such as "Fight Club, Kill Bill, Casino, The Usual Suspects, Snatch, Magnolia and Shachnovelle. it is a gross theft. <br /> <br /> In this movie, it ultimately goes wrong, that the plot revolves like a drunk hobble at speed. If this movie was a roller coaster, you would fall into attractiveness and it is short after taking off. There are so many twists in the movie that it will never be resolved, that if it was a cocktail, you would need a bucket of life to drink after working with nausea after drinking Nothing is ever explained, and when you finally understand the direction in which you think it goes, you are drawn into another one. <br/> <br /> I guess that this story has not gone anywhere on paper and Ritchy probably thought it was a great idea to make a movie out of it, being the next David Lynch or something like that. <br /> <br /> 1/10 f or completely violating your own work (Ritchy: look for professional help). What could easily be a jewel becomes an invented work of art, food for pseudo intellectuals to discuss in the Sunday afternoon discussion clubs. <br /> <br /> Save your soul and stomach, avoid it at all costs!
