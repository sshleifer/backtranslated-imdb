Most college students get lost in an academic bubble, cut off from the community in which they learn and live. Their conversations take place with colleagues and lecturers. Steven Greenstreet's documentary is the best example of a disappointed student who evaluates the entire community based on limited contact with a small number of its members. <br /> <br /> The document focused on a small group of people who were represented as representing large population groups. As usual, people who shout the most, attract the most media attention. In addition to misrepresenting the community in which the film was made, the document was well made. My only argument is that the feelings and hubbub presented in the film have been attributed to the whole community, not to the few people who have expressed it. <br /> <br /> It is of course important to investigate such controversy and make us aware of the differences that exist between political points of view, but it is ridiculous to start a whole community of people in the activities of several radicals.
