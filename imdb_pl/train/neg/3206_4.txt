I was thrilled to hear that Cesar Montano decided to make a film in Cebuano. (Not the "dialect", as most Filipinos will mistakenly describe as. As Cebuano and Tagalog are just as incomprehensible as French and Spanish are for each other.) But I was very disappointed when I saw this movie. Being a Canadian, a parent from Cebuano, I was optimistic about the revival of the Visayan film industry when I heard about this film. I was even more excited to hear that it was not another stupid action film or melodrama because the Filipinos love this type of movie. But unfortunately I was changed. <br /> <br /> Panaghoy serves as the ego's journey for Cesar Montano. Of course, Montano plays the hero of the movie. And when I say "hero", I mean the most stereotypical manners; his job is to win the girl's heart and lead the Bol-announcement to victory over the Japanese. His character has no depth or complexity. It just fits the hero's form. The rest of the form is one-dimensional; they all match their cookie roles. <br /> <br /> I am for slowly moving / meditating films, but this movie was just slow. It really did not meditate on anything. Just because the film is historically themed, drama and slow motion does not make the film well made. <br /> <br /> Particularly annoying is the American actor Philip Anthony. His performance was embarrassing. <br /> <br /> If Montano wanted to revive the Visayan film industry, he should have thought about it. He said he wanted to make Visayan films that could compete in Cannes and Toronto, etc. But in fact this movie would be booed and hiss at such festivals. To transfer Visayana films to the mainstream of consciousness, he should at least make a film that will attract the audience, even if it would mean sacrificing quality. Of course, he did not think or get information about what films win awards in Cannes, so a movie that attracts the audience would be at least a foot in the door. <br /> <br /> I am afraid that now the Visayan Films will not be produced for a long time due to this film. If I ever told the Filipino that I wanted to see more Visayan films, I would of course get the answer: "Visayana do not make good films. Have not you seen Panaghoy Sa Suba? "Of course this is ridiculous because it is one of the examples of the Visayan film and probably the only example that everyone can see today. <br /> <br /> An example of meditative movies, not just slow ones, are Tagalog Blackout or The Straight Story by David Lynch. I hate to promote the Tagalog language because it is infinitely and unfairly promoted and pushed into the throats of Filipino non-Tagalogs, but because of the name of a spading spade I say that Blackout is a VERY good movie. These films rely heavily on what Hitchcock called "clean cinema." Images without words are used to convey history. But I am slightly defining the definition of these two films because these films use images without words to convey the mood of the movie. and they do it very well. Panaghoy thinks that if they just make great pictures of the landscape, they set the mood. <br /> <br /> And what about so many Filipino movies with a dying mother or grandma?
