After the brilliant performance of Mr. Brosnan as a cad in "The Tailor of Panama" (which I rate as 10/10: casting, acting, script, story, editing, tempo, music, emotional influence, etc.), I was enthusiastic about this film. I was very disappointed. It is a screenplay that reads not a film, vulgar for being vulgar, bankrupt in every respect, that "Tailor Panama" is rich and satisfying. Blame it on the writing and targeting screen. I sat in the theater waiting for the "good part"; never came. I did not laugh or cry, although one line of dialogue made me smile. Worth 7 dollars? Hardly.
