First of all, I'm not a fan of the genre of "things eating meat in a disgusting way", but I'm a bad filmmaker, so my neighbor from the neighborhood said he has the worst film ever. This. So we start to watch it. First of all - it is recorded on the camera without a tripod! The other voice of a lean white doctor is called by a big black man! Thirdly, no dialogue makes sense. Fourthly, the zombie scenes, though unconvincing and stifling bad makeup and tomato paste, lead me to believe that the director (and my neighbor from the neighborhood) need psychological help. It's fun for about 5 minutes, but it's aging fast. It's as amateur as watching a poorly dubbed school video ... with zombies. A note for everyone who is involved in this movie - I want the 20 minutes of my life that I spent watching it before I fell asleep, back.
