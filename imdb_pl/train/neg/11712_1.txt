The only reason I remember this movie is that it was (and still is) the biggest waste of time and money. I was 17 years old and my friend was 18 years old. We were at an age when action movies were our thing to enjoy the most (about the 2nd place). We left feeling so insulted, we wanted to get our money back, but time will never be recovered. <br /> <br /> Editing is what killed this movie. When a truck is attacked by more and more vehicles with attached rocket launchers, the movie completely offends the intelligence of the public, having these dishonest bad guys in VW 4x4 bumps shooting rockets into the truck. Please, missiles on a truck that is known to carry a platoon? To make matters worse, these VWs manage to get 15-18 shots from 4 rocket launchers. You would see VW with 4 rockets firing 2 of them, cut the truck with the last one attached, come back a second later with two rockets attached, launch the second one, then go in front of the truck and now return to the full set of 4 rockets. <br /> <br /> We shook it out hoping for a big ending that never happened. It looks like they ran out of money and stopped. <br /> <br /> Just funny.
