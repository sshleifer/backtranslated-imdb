When the theater employees find the old roll of the film, they decide to show it at the northern show "Night of the Living Dead," assuming it is an old spinning wheel. Unfortunately, this is an old Nazi mind control experiment that turns the audience into a horde of thoughtless shuffling zombies. <br /> <br /> I do not understand the hatred of this movie. It is an independent low-budget production with a lot of camps, but it does not deserve "1.1" here at IMDb. It's so much fun. It is obvious that the creators of the film have a reasonable knowledge and love for old horrors, and have created a funny tribute to them, drunk with references and tributes to many of them. It feels like Night of the Living Dead (in many ways, very similar), Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness and many more. <br /> <br /> I liked the explanation of how zombies, though really hypnotized, think they are zombies, in fact they have the physical characteristics of living dead, maybe unbelievable, but I appreciate the writers' effort to explain this . The gore effects were decent for the budget, the acting was fine, and the story was fun. <br /> <br /> I liked it.
