What a horrible movie! The idea of ​​robots fighting with each other is nice, but the plot is funny, the real human action is funny, the acting is non-existent, and the special effects (from which this type of movie must depend) are archaic. I thought it had to be done around 80-84 and I was amazed to see it was 1990. It's 5 years after Aliens! OK, many people have said that it is good considering the low budget, but I just think "what's going on?". it looks absolutely unbelievable. I would not mind seeing a remake with modern special effects and a completely remade history, because I still like the idea of ​​huge robots fighting each other.
