This movie is a great example of wasting huge resources in the film. In the future you have SNL and SCTV stars such as John Candy, Chevy Chase, Laraine Newman, Al Franken, Tom Davis and Joe Flaherty, which makes 70 minutes of rude, boring jokes and racism. The concept of a network from a future refutable society could really be taken up in interesting extremes, but instead, through the gate, he makes a lame, juvenile proktology joke and stays in that style of humor all the way. a much more subversive and witty Groove Tube or later, a funny Kentucky Fried movie. This movie is intended only for those who want to see the time capsule of bad comedy movies from the 70's sketch.
