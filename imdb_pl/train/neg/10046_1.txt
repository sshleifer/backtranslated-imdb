I was not so impressed with the offer of Dante's first season in Homecoming, it was not too much of a horror movie, but rather a wise political statement with undead. The Screwfly situation is a story about a virus unleashed in the world that causes the male sexual drive to be replaced by murderous tendencies towards women. The episode starts well with a short film explaining the way the fly is killed by scientists. Then there is a short scene in which the man is arrested when women's bodies are discovered in his home. I assume that this is to point to the beginning of an epidemic, but it is unclear because it never returns. The episode lasts for a while, introducing the characters blah blah. It seems to be cool and mysterious, but the episode is getting worse and worse as it rushes forward to its sad and unsatisfactory end. Worst episode. Well, with the exception of chocolate.
