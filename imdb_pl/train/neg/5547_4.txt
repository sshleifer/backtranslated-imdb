REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES (2 out of 5 stars) No, this is not the long-lost ancestor of the classic zombie movies of George A. Romero. This is a low budget potboiler from 1936, which probably seemed very nice to the public at the time ... but now it seems terribly routine. At the beginning there is a pretty good scene when a soldier fires a pistol from a horde of zombie soldiers approaching ... and bullets are approaching in the bare chest of one of them. The effect now looks hopelessly false, but in 1936 I'm sure it affected the audience. The story is about seeking the mystery of mind control ... supposedly to create an unstoppable zombie army ... but later as a means for one character to win the woman he loves. The film lasts only an hour, but it moves at a snail's pace, so it seems to me that it is full-length, believe me! There really is not much to recommend ... you can have fun with fake studio shots of a star wading through the "swamp". The ending is interesting ... so I would say that the film is worth seeing at least once. More than likely you will see this as an additional feature in some cheap "4 movies on 1 DVD" at Wal-Mart for five bucks. Hey, it's worth the money ...
