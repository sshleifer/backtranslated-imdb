This movie reminds me of how students protested against the war in Vietnam. As if hearing that some children are making cheeseburgers at Cow Dung Collehe, the president immediately changed all American foreign policy. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that although politics are dangerous, the concept of politics based on whether the USSR and the US went to war would mean the end of the world, WORKED. The US and the USSR NEVER READ THE WAR. <br /> <br /> If we only had conventional weapons, the concept of another war, a "victorious" war in Europe and Asia was not unthinkable. <br /> <br /> No, I think they should get rid of this movie. Film students should consider this a great example of "How NOT to make a movie". <br /> <br /> It should be 0 stars, and maybe black holes ...
