It touches some interesting points .. But! - Does not show evidence of all "exclusive" studies shown. Who are the "friends" and "small groups of scientists" who have collected this data? - What's up in Al Gore's biography? For example, how he liked to play with cows at a ranch or that his child was hit by a car ... it's a pity, but ... what does this have to do with the ozone layer? MUCH better things, in a much shorter time, on the Discovery Channel .. I really do not understand why it has such a high score on IMDb. If you have not lived under rock, this "document" should not be new to you ... this is an old message ... And all that Al Gore is trying to do is gain popularity points. P.S. I am not an American, so do not even try to say that I am a fan of bushes: p
