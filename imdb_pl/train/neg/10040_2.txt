But at this point I would like to ask the director: Lord, what did you burn? <br /> <br /> I'm sure that this movie will be remembered in the chronicles of making Bollywood movies - for what you can never do - it offends the intelligence of the most dead brain of movie viewers. <br /> <br /> Probably the only option of redemption in this matrix Desi plus desperado plus grindhouse caper is music ... watch movies ... hear the recordings and you will not be disappointed. Vishal-Shekhar invented extremely boring melodies. <br /> <br /> How would I want the director to spend money to create something more ... <br /> <br /> When I sign, I want to really, I know how Akshay's bullet wound disappears in a microsecond .. What were the editors doing? Tashan, maybe ...
