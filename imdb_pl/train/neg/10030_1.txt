Tashan - the title itself explains the nature of the film. <br /> <br /> This type of movie is actually created on the flop. It is a pity that Yash Raj Films produces films that are worthless than class C films. Even some C-rated movies have a better and more enjoyable story than Tashan. Very awakened and confidently promoted Tashan poorly bombed at the box office, which he deserved. <br /> <br /> In my opinion it is the worst film ever made of the honorary banner of Yash Raj Films. How did it happen that they dealt with such a heavy project of the new Vijay Krishna Acharya, who does not have a real sense of doing the action? He tried to imitate the way Sanjay Gadhvi was doing like Dhoom, but eventually he suffered. Action scenes are more like comics or animated films created to exhaust the audience. <br /> <br /> The story also loses the meaning and substances to fondly win the hearts of the audience. In most scenes Anil Kapoor reminds me of the southern Tamil star Rajnikant in his body language and verbal expression. I'm not a fan of either Saif or Akshay, but Kareena's prize should finally go to Saif's hand, not Akshay. Just from the starting point I expected from him, I did not like what I said at last. Saif is the main character of the whole adventure, while Akshay joins in the middle. In each film, the final should be evaluated with the whole figure of the whole story, and the prize or prize should be given to those who deserve recognition. And Tashan gets lost in this way and unexpectedly did not become a hit. <br /> <br /> Akshay has nothing new to show off his comedic talent, but he still remembers his previous films. I seriously need to create a new image for my fans that would impress them again. In the meantime, Saif did a great job in the race, and now he has returned in his funny nature through this movie. But he has fully developed in the field of acting. And finally at least about Kareena. It looks really hot with a bikini dress, which some people complain about when she became too skinny. But I do not think so, instead she has become slim. So slim !!! it is a good factor for women to attract the main people (or, say, men). Besides them, it is nice that Saif's son, Ibrahim, appears at the beginning and continues as a young Saif. I hope that now he will also lean forward in the pursuit of his acting to become his career. <br /> <br /> Those who like Tashan are either mentally immature, or still want to return to their childhood or say they want to be admitted in asylum. Thumbs down to debut director Vijay Krishna Acharya, who misinterpreted the Yash Raj Films project. In the future, he should experiment and study the script for a minimum of five years before going into practical tips. <br /> <br /> Excuse me, I do not like to judge good stars for this type of junk movies.
