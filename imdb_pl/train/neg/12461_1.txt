Unlike most other comments on "Syriana" on the IMDb website, along with my family, we found that watching this movie on DVD at home is a complete waste of time and space. <br /> <br /> In short, it was a movie based on a script, whose writer was definitely too clever. Instead of trying to tell a complicated story in an intelligent and clear way, it was assumed that constantly throwing vague, difficult to combine with each other 30 lines of various feature lines from a dozen or so "lines" in the audience made watching great. No, sir, it is not. What makes watching great is the total clarity, precision, storyline and plot lines - and characteristics - that have a beginning, middle and end. <br /> <br /> This type of film presentation - similar to the Dim Sum experience in a Chinese restaurant - is pretentious and unintelligent in the extreme. <br /> <br /> Thank God for the TV and DVD presentations of Hollywood and British Noir films from the 1940s and 1950s, whose writers, directors and actors knew the value of a clear story telling, diction and acting that meant something. <br /> <br /> This is one DVD on which this family will not sit again.
