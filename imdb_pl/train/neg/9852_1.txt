Discovery Channel / Animal Planet must be ashamed. This fantasy is modeled on the "Walk with Dinosuars" series. Although it is 100% fancy, it is presented in the same, factual and archaeological way. Even mixing fantasy dragons with T-rexes and extinction of dinosaurs. Added to the screening on the educational channel instead of saying Sci-Fi gives true authenticity to this show. <br /> <br /> The program itself is 7.5 / 10 far away as entertainment goes. But the way it is presented, I have to give 1/10. Do not get me wrong. I have no problem with fantasy, but the way they put it is so bad. I really see little children and slow adult believers that found a dragon and that it is real. <br /> <br /> I also think that this weakens the wonderful series "Walking with Dinosuars", because now you have to see it thinking about how much fantasy this mini-series has.
