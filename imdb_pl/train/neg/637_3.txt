Good Earth is not a great movie in any way, it's ordinary. Perhaps it was different in the thirties, but who would like to see the life of a farmer. This is not interesting to me. Yes, Luis Rainer and Paul Muni do a great job, but the movie has lasted too long. I could tell you about the end of this movie in the first act. In short, Wang Lung (Muni), a small farmer who does not want to be like his father, turns out to be exactly like him. They both fall in love with their wives as they are on their deathbed. The film makes a complete 360 ​​passages from generation to generation. Also, this movie did not have good actors or funny moments, only depressing things about durability as a farmer in times of crisis.
