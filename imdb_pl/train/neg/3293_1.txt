What a snore. <br /> <br /> Of all the chunks of nostalgia Hollywood has decided to rewrite and update, this is definitely one of the most pointless. First of all, it was a completely senseless concert and REALLY we do not need a "modern" update. <br /> <br /> No matter bigotry and sexism stuck in the system from the very beginning, so many progress has been made socially, because the show showed that the whole program point (if it ever had) was lost. <br /> <br /> In addition, what is the point of having a character named Boss Hogg, if not overweight?
