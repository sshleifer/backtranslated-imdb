No, no administration GWB, Decider / Strutter / Smirker - but the mini-series "Monarch Cove". Lifetime had to realize what kind of dog it was, because the series was burned into two episodes at once, most of them were issued between 11:00 Friday nights and 1 morning Saturday mornings. As to why I looked at the whole thing, I can only ask for weekly sudden convulsive masochism attacks. <br /> <br /> Most casts are unknown and will probably remain unknown. The only two recognizable names are Shirley Jones and Rachel Ward, who perform only decent performances (Jones will not survive the whole series - a happy woman). By the way, Ward is getting old pretty well from the time of the "Bird of Thorns". <br /> <br /> The only main storyline - who murdered the heroine's father who was wrongly convicted for his father's murder, but is freed after six years in the slammer - is so long drawn and ended so hastily that you will not be bothered whoever kills him. There is a lot of "steamy" sex, a few murders and all kinds of naughty behaviors - practically none of them is either interesting or credible. Most casts are not particularly attractive and definitely not talented. The writing and direction are on par with the cast. <br /> <br /> If you stay to the end, the postcard is (very tiny) hoot. <br /> <br /> BE CAREFUL TO BE WARRANTED!
