This is Bartleby's scary production, though not, as the second reviewer puts it, because it is "unacceptable", but rather because this version does not support the spirit of the book. It tells a story, almost painfully. Looking at it, I could turn pages in my book and follow what's not so funny when I'm adapting. See rather the version of Bartleby from 2001 with Crispin Glover. This version, though humorous, introduces new details to the film, preserving the spirit of the novel. The spirit is important, not the trifles of things like setting, character names, and costumes. The difference between these movie versions is like night and day, boring and funny. This version is a lesson on what can go wrong if the adaptation is treated poorly, painfully, and paralyzingly.
