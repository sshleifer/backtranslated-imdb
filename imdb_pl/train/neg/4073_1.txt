NO SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> I love horror movies, but it's probably the worst attempt to do it. Calling this "movie" is also a summary. This "random clips with obvious-false and malicious violence-and-ugly- women trying to act-sexily assembled-poorly together" is not worth watching. <br /> <br /> Watching this is as interesting as watching random family photos, and has the same quality you would expect when you send your ten-year-old son to the forest with a new video camera and tell him to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Horrible.
