102 Dalmatians (2000, directed by Kevin Lima) <br /> <br /> Regarded as cured, Cruella de Vil (Close) is released from prison and embarks on a new beginning in life. For Cruella, who is busy helping homeless dogs from the street, everything goes well. When the clock hits Big Ben, things get broken. The hypnotic remedy is reversed and Cruella returns, and this time she is determined to make this mottled coat she always wanted. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close returns to the role of Cruelli de Vil and once again is the main attraction of the film. Every scene worthy of her is worth seeing in this boring continuation, which is more like a repetition of the previous movie than a new story. <br /> <br /> She has changed. ?? Ken Sheperd (Ioan Gruffudd)
