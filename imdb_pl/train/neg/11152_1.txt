Why watch this movie if you have great movies to watch. It is a total waste of time and money. The movie is so bad that I felt bad to watch it. Everything in him is BAD. The actors were angry. The script was REALLY bad. History is stupid. And the worst CGI EVER. The only good moments are the first 60 seconds of film in a strip club. The interesting thing is that there is a sign that we would like him to die because he is so stupid that we have enough of him. /> <br /> NOTE: If you want to see a good movie, this movie is not the right choice. 0-stars at 10
