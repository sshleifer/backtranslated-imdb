A great mini-series television completely ruined by a 45-year-old woman who is desperately trying to leave as a 16-year-old ingenue! No exaggeration - this is the REAL age of the character played by Ali MacGrawa, when the film begins just before the unexpected attack in Pearl Harbor. This mini-series of television really is the most classic example of the title of this post and the one I refer to when this topic appears. <br /> <br /> It already makes it completely unobtainable, even though it is one of the best-filmed "global" dramas from World War II. If you have a stomach - or a decent quick scrolling skill - you can enjoy the late Robert Mitchum in a very strong performance. <br /> <br /> I am surprised by some comments related to the love story (pun intended). Did they watch the movie with their eyes closed? Or are the demographic population aging, who never ceases to amaze me with their "selective memories" and "selective vision". I'm a Boomer myself, so do not think for a moment that I'm some die-hard young punk. 45 ALWAYS LOOKS 45. Get used to it. Deal with it. Graceful damnit. <br /> <br /> The winds of war could have been ... so good. How much more could we talk about this mini-series today, about 25 years later, if the REAL ingenue was cast in such an important and critical role? At the moment, with incessant, devastated, old distractions, the same cancels most of the great aspects of The Winds Of War.
