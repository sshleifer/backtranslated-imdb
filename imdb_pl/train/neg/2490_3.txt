What a sad sight of these TV stalwarts, running out of the clock about their careers, stumbling over a little rusting ship hull, may be more appropriate. The whole production seems cheap and miserable, and the star of the "big name" does not help her, who barely can spit out several lines he gave in a credible way. <br /> <br /> At no time supports the casting growth over the material; they clearly watch the clock here. Release the scenes, check the payment, go home and try to forget about it. <br /> <br /> It is not specially written or filmed; there are no real clangers, it's just completely anodyne and filmed in a very limited number of tight sets with a small amount of accessories. The pace is a bit strange; Embarrassingly insecure the romantic story begins only after the start of the main action, which makes him feel irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Maiden Voyage scores a few points for skillfully scoring points and for having fun, look out for Kiwi players'; the majority of casts are graduates of Shortland Street or Xena: Warrior Princess. The saddest thing about this production is that this movie is probably their big break.
