This may be unbelievable, but this movie earned $ 888,128 in Russia! It is shown in almost all theaters and still works! Well, I have no idea why distributors pay attention to this particular "movie" that has hardly been shown around the world. It's a puzzle! Ha ha! Perhaps it was based on the fact that the next movie "Pledge This" from Paris Hilton, which was equally well released on DVD almost everywhere, had large shows in Russia and earned over $ 1 million. In addition, both films had a large promotion, such as banners throughout the city, TV commercials, etc. Speaking of film, I would say that it is boring and absolutely boring. It can really be better. Even if he has Jessica Simpson.
