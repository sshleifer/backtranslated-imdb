Early film directed by D.W. Griffith; he has a gloriously happy king (Arthur V. Johnson) and his queen (Marion Leonard) - but wait! When the king leaves the stage, his queen creates music with the palace Minstrel (Henry B. Walthall). When the king discovers his lovers, he decides to take revenge on the terrifying revenge of Edgar Allen Poe. It is hard to believe that lovers can not hear those who plot against them; although the actors try to look alternately noisy (lovers) and quietly (concrete mixers). Sets make "The Sealed Room" look very staging. The performances are fine and the story is easy to follow. <br /> <br /> *** Sealed Room (9/2/09) D.W. Griffith ~ Arthur V. Johnson, Henry B. Walthall, Marion Leonard
