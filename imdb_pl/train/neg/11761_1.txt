A complete drivel. An unfortunate manifestation of a hypocritical, toxic culture from ten years ago. In this film, the regrets of pedestrians for slavery go hand in hand with colonialist overtones (irritating redhead feeding Shaka rice?). Forget about historical reality. Are most Western slaves not from West Africa? An American slave easily catches Shaka with a handful of men? Finally, David Hasslehoff could not be more unbearable. One can only think about how he would handle the miniseries? (Most likely fast impaled). Miniserial was great and it is unfortunate that DH should get something special and mundane. (I tend to think that he had a hand in creating this fiasco).
