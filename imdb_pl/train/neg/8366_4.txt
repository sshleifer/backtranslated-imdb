"SherryBaby" is a rather painful and dingy melodrama in Jersey, the story of a young mother who left prison after a drug survey and struggles to keep her clean, to find a place in her life, and especially to regain the love of her daughter, which she looks after her brother's family. The only reason the movie is to be watched is Maggie Gyllenhaal, an actress at the top of her career who fits the role very well and wears the whole movie on her shoulders. This is not enough, because the plot is too simplified and expected, and emotional emphasis is placed on the wrong place - all the time I ask myself whether I should regret the former and possibly the future drug addict, as wanted by the director and screenwriter, or about an innocent kid, which is inside. Even the acting of Maggie Gyllenhaal could not convince me that I should not worry about the child.
