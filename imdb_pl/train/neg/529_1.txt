This is undoubtedly the most offensive "chick" I have seen for years, if not ever. Writing and make-up are so permeated with stereotypes that the film borders on parody. Before leaving the theater for an hour and five minutes for this disaster, we were subjected to the following topics: having a child will solve all your problems, "types of performers" are unhappy messes, and musicians can not be good mothers, unless they throw their dreams into a more conventional lifestyle . What a waste of talented cast and great-looking sets and costumes. When Natasha Richardson told Toni Collette that if she would not live more mainstream, she would end up - shivering - "alone!", I felt sick. I can not believe that this movie went to the cinema version. This is the type of fee that is expected of these "female" cable channels that I always go through when I surf the channels. I am a woman and I am over 35 years old, so I should be part of the target group of this film, but boy, "Evening" does not hit the target.
