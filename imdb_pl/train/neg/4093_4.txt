The plot and characters are funny and barely qualify as "plot" and "figure". The biggest problem is that everything is dark, out of focus and blurred. The fact that Fulci filled the whole film with fog does not help. On the other hand, the whole thing is completely bizarre and full of sex and violence. Inconsistencies are quite funny, one of the main characters says that there are no friends, but he hits a new guy in a minute of time on the screen and has a whole herd of women on the side. Although he shows his anti-social tendencies, accidentally putting an arrow in the poor who just cares about his own business! . Maybe it ruined his career, but it was not much stupid than Zombie. It is worth renting if you like bloody Italian movies or are desperately looking for a sword, spells or something strange. How do you sleep through someone sucked to the bottom of 2 feet from your head and shouting for help?
