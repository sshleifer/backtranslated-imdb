This comedy has some funny things, surrounded by many uninteresting things. Almost every scene with the castle's servants and their stupid antics is a waste of time. And the conspiracy is so sloppy that it makes you wonder if they actually had the script ready before they started shooting it, or if they just did it all along the way. (* 1/2)
