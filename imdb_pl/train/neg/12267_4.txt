Speaking only as a movie, I did not like it. not because there were no FX effects or because we had a screenplay for the whole movie, that's exactly what I was watching. <br /> <br /> I did not like it, because the acting was shady, his "friends" are all happy and then they are crazy, but you have no idea why; then they take on different roles, one is a believer, the other is an antagonist, but they never really get to it! also the lighting was terrible and I only mention technical problems. <br /> <br /> in a few words, a thing that could have "ok, I'm going out of here!" from some characters. like a lady who does not want to hear his version of the Bible. <br /> <br /> about the story itself, everyone can write about what he wants and history is proof of good writing and imagination. I give the author a book for this, which is why my 4/10. <br /> <br /> so, in the end, hear how a man's story believes it or not, just do not spend all the time acting as you believe and shaken by what he says, while moving and joking, if you did not believe him. <br /> <br /> Consistency. <br /> <br /> thank you for reading;)
