This film was extremely badly conceived from any angle, with the exception of technology. I stood and watched as everyone left the theater, their faces exhausted, as if their lives had flashed before their eyes - eyes going to their neighbor, wondering if they were alone. I mean, how a movie can be really bad. Nobody will admit it, it's a classic case of The Emperor Wears No Clothes. "Who am I to interrogate a movie containing a guy who stops a plane?" But the fact remains that every member of the audience thinks about what I write. I actually plagiarized their faces. <br /> <br /> Of course, Lois is just agitated by power, she will not even have a cup of coffee with Superman wearing glasses that does not stop jets. It can not be a look "in his" eyes to the depth of his soul or anything. In old Superman she had some connection with him, of course he was not number one priority, but he strengthened her character, she was "torn." I bet Henry Kissinger would even win this Lois in front of Clark Kent. <br /> <br /> And now it's official, Kryptonite is doing what Superman does with McDonalds doing with avg. person. <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN "ONE" He loses his earthly father, and then finds his true super father, history captivates with every step. He is a man, he refers to people and he feels love for people, he refers to high school students, he refers to people who feel different. He refers. Superman Returns Superman seems to refer only to Superpeople and it looks like he just "does the job" when he rescues people. <br /> <br /> There's something in Clark who likes Lois, he's really in love with him, but maybe I admit, and when he appears in the picture as Superman, he throws himself in love with stones. Without Superman, she would fall in love with Clark (at least that's what the movie indicates, whether it was intention or not). Superman Returns is a love story between a woman and SUPERMAN, Clark is like a pile of horses to Lois. Literally. <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN TWO I just watched it again. As a child, I "thought" that I liked the action, but now I know that it was also HISTORY, which kept me there, watching it over and over again. If I saw Superman Return as a child, then I would also hate him. <br /> <br /> In this movie there is so much heart, soul and superpower that he is sick. Superman gives up his powers to love when the world story is happening, and meanwhile, MEANWHILE, Lex Luther has something fantastic up his sleeve. <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN THREE Now there is a three-way love story between Superman and Lana and Clark, only humanity wins, and Clark's inner nature beats Superman's power, because when his SUPERmoral nature disappears and he is SUPERHUMAN (who does human things with his superpowers), he sees that it is not superman power, in which he falls in love, he is not SUPERpowerman, but SUPERMORTALman who loves - and who is really SUPER. And when he tells Clark that he "prefers" him from Superman, he is delighted and re-established contact with him. He wants to be accepted for who he is, not only for his ability to bend steel. THIS IS A TYPE OF HEAVY TRAIN WITH RETURN SUPERMAN. <br /> <br /> Clark super-kicha to help your child strike again - humanity again. Plus, it's INERESTING the use of superpowers. He not only uses simple brutal strength. <br /> <br /> Crushes coal into a diamond for your woman, because she had to sell her, love is the only thing that makes him use other powers than to save. <br /> <br /> It looks like nothing is at risk in Superman. Even in Superman Three, we see damage caused by the global plot of nemesis dominance. We see suffering, we see how it affects Pryora and others and the people inside. There are no damage, especially. emotional from Lex's plot to sink the US. We see a globe of a crystal thrown into space ... Superman had to become very creative in the first three Superman, to stop the plot against him, he could not just "get access" to his superpowers. In the first he had to stop two bullets going in different directions, and then break his universal mandate and erase the story to save Lois's life ... (it was THIRTY YEARS!) In the second he had to outwit three men who were already MUCHLY than, but in combination with Lex's genius and immoral tactics of villains, overwhelming Superman was not enough, he had to work one above the other and outwit them ... In Superman III again, his superpowers were not enough to win. He had to outwit the computer that had calculated everything he saw, could not use simple aggression on the computer, because he calculated it from above, so he had to use a mild acid that would only let the computer become fatal if the computer responded to aggression and discovered this acid earlier when he could not just use his superpowers to tear the fire because it was a chemical fire, so he had to use his superrains - he could not carry water, so he froze the lake and dropped it in the fire ... Now in Supermanach Return, he just throws the island into the external space, like the night temperature for UPS. He does not need to discover anything, he just uses his "super strength". Lex Luther's excellence was shown at the junk's premeditated level, which lacked junk. <br /> <br /> Not to mention the fact that he threw this island into the outer space after he was stabbed Kyrptonite on the right in the bloodstream And the island itself dripped on the face kryptonite spores, but just turned his eyes and nose, if he did not look at Gray Poupon.
