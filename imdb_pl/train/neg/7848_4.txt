this movie was just stupid, I do not think it was frightening. I went in the hope that I would be shocked and scared, but mostly we laugh, some scenes were just fake, and the blood scenes were very scary, and some mutants were ridiculously homosexual, they looked sucking too, because acting was just awful, you think they can get good actors, and most of the heroes that I hated just because they were stupid and poor, they behaved, even though they were supposed to be in the army watching movies for free and I saw many people leaving the house guessing because it was so stupid, I'm glad I did not have to pay for it in short DUMB ASS MOVIE I do not see it ... but this is my opinion again
