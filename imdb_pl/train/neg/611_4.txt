Ok, "enjoy" is quite a relative term, but flexibility is fine when you're dealing with the filmmaker James Glickenhaus. <br /> <br /> McBain is really one of the most absurd action movies I've ever seen without the nasty edge of The Exterminator. Other reviews have commented on the suspension of disbelief in heroic middle-aged commando films, but what about a film in the Philippines that takes place in Colombia? All add-ons are Filipino. In fact, the only character who looks remotely on Spaniards is good Victor Argo as a hideous "El Presidente"! Oh, yes, we also have Maria Conchita Alonso, who turns into a mad leader of rebels. Everywhere tons of explosions and bodies in this funny pagan for the glory of American imperialism.
