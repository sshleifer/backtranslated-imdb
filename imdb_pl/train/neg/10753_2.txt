Del - "You are the stupidest smart person I've ever met." <br /> <br /> Calvin- "Well, I had a brain, but they lost it in the rules." <br /> <br /> I think the most scandalous in This bastardization of Asimov's work was how the figure of Susan Calvin was presented. In the books she was one of the first strong female protagonists who could solve the problem. Here she is just a lady in danger, waiting for Wilnak to save her. <br /> <br /> There are fleeting references to Asimov's robotics laws, but they are an addition to CGI and action scenes. <br /> <br /> Smith is sympathetic, like most of his films, but to be honest, the story is not very good. You understand it long before the brilliant characters do it.
