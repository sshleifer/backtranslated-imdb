this movie has its good sides: people from hot chicks die <br /> <br /> problem ... hot barley chick naked and you can not see many people dying, mainly a lot of fast movements and shouting, though there were two good scenes of homicide. <br /> <br /> also for those who watched it for JENNY JAMESON, is just a side district with a very small role and smaller naked scenes. <br /> <br /> What this movie needed ... script and story would be nice, but I will not complain about it ... it just requires more nudity and better scenes to kill, because let's face it, that's why we watch these movies ... <br /> <br /> I would not waste money on it ... and if you must, wait until it is on the OLD shelves at your local video store
