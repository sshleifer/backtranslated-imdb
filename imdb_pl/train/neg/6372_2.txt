Do not worry. A bit of prosciutto can go a long way, but all we get is pure ham, especially from Dunaway. The plot is one of those episodes of the car bumper ... the vehicle bounces in another and everything changes direction again until we scratch our heads wondering if there has ever been a conspiracy. Gina Phillips is really good, but it's hard to play with the mystical Dunaway who plays Lady Macbeth lost in Marx's Brother's Duck Soup. Ah, Raven ... now is the actor. And there is a relative who just lies and lies and looks ghastly. Or Dr. Dread, who is full of darkness and has no countermeasures. I'm one of those suckers who just have to see the movie until the end. Quaven the Raven, "Nevermore".
