Ok, I wrote a scathing review b / c the movie is horrible. When I was waiting for the next review (for Derrida), which appeared in my store, I decided to check the old reviews of this horrible movie. Look at all the positive reviews. EVERYONE, I say EVERYTHING, come from co-workers who have not rated any other film besides. Crimminy! and wait for the "rosebud" [sic] review. <br /> <br /> Check out the other videos that Rosebud reviewed and recommended. Oh, shoot! They happen only for other films by two writers and a director. Holy Window-Wipers Batman. <br /> <br /> Joe, Tony, sow as writers and Tony, you can not direct from the wrong script. No job for you! <br /> <br /> ALWAYS CHECK POSITIVE FEEDBACKS FOR LOW ASSESSMENT OF THE FILM!
