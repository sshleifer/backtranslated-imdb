This film is mostly mushy, and the only reason why this movie is worth watching is the fact that Jean-Claud Vam Damme plays in this movie. There are good action scenes in the film, and the best ones are at the end of the movie. > <br /> Acting in this movie is so bad and his worst acting I've ever seen, and 2 actors Bill Goldberg and Michael Jai White can not act at all. And this movie must be one of Jean-Claud Vam Dammes's worst movies he has done and if you watch him in one of his great movies, you should watch Blood Blood, KickBoxer or Sudden Death. <br /> <br /> Throughout this movie is g√≥wno / OK and my rating is 4 out of 10.
