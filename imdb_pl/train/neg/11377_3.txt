well. At the beginning the taxi driver is amazing. This is not a taxi driver or an amazing one. what is wrong. but I thought it was funny, which means it had some advantages. like a dialogue ... wow. there was no conspiracy, the characters were stupid and the film was preached. there were a few places where I thought that the movie would fall into the violence of a taxi driver, which would make the message at the end of the film much more difficult. I can not even believe that there are 20 other people who have seen this movie. yes, it's worth watching if you're bored and want to confirm the fact that everyone can make a movie, or at least can try it.
