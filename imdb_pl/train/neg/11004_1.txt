It really makes an impression on me that it has been done. The director / screenwriter / actor must be really charismatic in reality. I can not think of any other way of passing scripts, etc. What I want you to consider ... while watching films, I felt sorry for the actors. I felt like I was in a comedy club where a guy dies on his feet and you sit there, not enjoying it, just feeling really bad for him because he's trying. I'd really like to know what the budget is, I think it must have been low because the quality of the movie is really low. I want to write "I did not like jokes." but the reality is to appeal to you, you would have to be the man who wrote them. or delay. So imagine that in the form of a script ... and this guy has this green light. It's impressive, right?
