All of David Prior's films are horrible in every respect: bad writing, bad acting, bad cinematography, no budget (the director's brother is usually cast as a man). But they all have an incredible entertainment value because of their unintentional merriment. The plot of almost every "film" by David Prior (as I like to relate to them) is basically the same. Valiant American commandos are united to blow up communist villains. But in contrast to other Cold War trash, such as Red Dawn, Prior films are actually fun because of their top spaces and activities. The best part of Jungle Assault is the scene in which General Mitchell summoned Becker (was he the second guy?) On a secret mission in South America. The funniest line in the film is then delivered, which is the effect of "this is my roommate, I trained him well". WHAT. Have you trained your roommate? And apparently it will be their solution to avoid eviction. <br /> <br /> If you find these gems on video used anywhere, buy them. They are all fun and even more fun after a few beers. Watch them with a group of friends to get a real MST3K experience. So far, my friends and I have managed to get Night Wars and Aerobicide aka "Killer Workout". But what I recommend the most is Final Sanction with a weird looking Robert Z'Dar.
