Despite the somewhat provocative quirks in the script and the overall value of the film's curiosity, Fury of the Wolfman emerges as a boring, uninteresting trip to lycanthropy, saved only by the statuesque presence of the villa Perli Cristal. The rest of the players, including Naschy's ham, is a complete write-off (although none of them is supported by often terrible dubbing). Although the script contains enough variations on the subject of Werewolf / Frankenstein / Dr. Moreau to create several films, the plot is so unevenly developed, the characteristics so weak, and the dialogue so absurd (at least in the English version) that the hidden interest in stormy proceedings is soon abolished. <br /> <br /> Zabalza's direction seems violent, even amateur. His staging is clumsy and ineffective. Bright lighting of Villasenor does not help him. Even promising sets are so immaterially photographed that several attempts by the director to give the audience fear are signaled well in advance. ridiculously primitive, completely primitive special effects deserve special condemnation.
