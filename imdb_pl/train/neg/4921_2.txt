Blaming the executive producer Wes Craven and the Weinstein financiers for this huge budget defeat: a thrash-metal upgrade of "Dracula", with a patronizing word stab at Bram Stoker (who probably would not want his name to be there anyway) and nothing for the rest of us, with the exception of jerky styles and gore. Christopher Plummer looks as crazy as Van Helsing in modern times - not only the descendant of Van Helsing, but real; he is holding on to the leech obtained from the body of Count Dracula, who is exhumed from the coffin after the theft from Van Helsing's treasury and transported to New Orleans. That's what New Orleans needs in the 21st century! The film, well produced, but without one original idea (with the exception of multiracial victims), is both loathsome and lazy, and after about an hour begins to repeat. * with ****
