I hired her, so shoot me! <br /> <br /> A decent assumption creates an awkward story without a real payout, but at least it's well done. Director Jon Keeyes adopts the simple idea of ​​a false haunted house with real danger inside. In most cases, it should be slam dunk, but this little smelly gets spoiled quite quickly. Pictures are above average, and acting is mediocre at best, but history and writing are simply awful. The slower scenes go on forever, and the horrors are too small and too distant not to lead to the climax of the film. The amazing mood is set at the beginning, but it loses its glow before any horror appears, and I found myself bored to death and making another sandwich ... The cover is attractive and I suppose it is worth renting it if you are looking for a mindless low budget dreck, but if you like a good story and ending events, reach for something else.
