I just ordered it on my pay-per-view at home because I was bored and needed laughter. I must admit that I giggled a few times, but I do not even remember what parts they were on. I do not understand why this movie was made. He claims to be a comedy, but seriously, I do not find a singing penis or a naked 70-year-old woman very funny. This movie tried to fit into comedies from recent years, such as American Pie and Road Trip, but it just failed. It was a way to do a lot of abominations, it was a comedy. Also, why the devil Cameron Diaz attached her name to this movie?!?! The only thing I liked about this movie is that Dave and Angela were in the pool. I thought it was sexy, nice and well done. Also, avoid this movie. 3/10
