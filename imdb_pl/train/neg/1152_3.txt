I understand what this movie tried to portray. How old are often ignored and treated as a problem, which means that they end up undervalued and how their lives are empty. <br /> <br /> I have no problem with this news, but I just feel that it could have been presented in a way that is not so painful to watch. I am happy with a good artistic film, but when the film becomes too deliberately artistic (as in this case), the result is often frustrating. Turning on the shots of the person packing the suitcase slowly, which takes 5 minutes, try to point to something, but just annoy the audience. <br /> <br /> The female characters are very weak and in the end you want to tell them, download them together. It is a movie that you think should be enjoying or judging high and certainly has its advantages, but I was too frustrated watching it to ever recommend it to someone else. It may have a deeper message than other Roger Michell movies (for example: "Notting Hill"), but at least it was a movie that you can watch.
