If you thought the original from 83 was bad, try this modern masterpiece. How can it be worse, what are you asking about? Well ... at least at first you had Ally Sheedy's yoga in a sport bra. In addition to updated graphics, contemporary themes (such as terrorists), modern weapons and a sexy new voice for Ripley, unfortunately this is the same sad tired story. Anyone who saw the first one could see exactly where the next stage / line is going. And for anyone who has not seen the first one, consider yourself lucky that you only watched him once. Maybe in 23 years Hollywood will try again.
