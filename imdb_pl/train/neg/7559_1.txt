It must be one of the worst fillings I've ever seen and seen a few. It is slow, boring, amateur - it is not even consistent in its simplified reading of the story. Actors do not work. I can not blame them - they got a scenario of such complete banality that they can only go through her with pain behind the eyes, which has nothing to do with the bad deeds in SummersIsle. /> In this movie there is not a single moment that would call - it is not a fair line or one moment when someone moves. The figure of Nicholas Cage is so terribly drawn that you do not feel a bit of compassion in all his torments. I have no doubt that I saw a suffering man there, but it was Nicholas Cage who was well aware that he was in the worst film of his entire career.
