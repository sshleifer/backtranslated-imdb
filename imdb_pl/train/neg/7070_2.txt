Chłopcze, oh chłopcze, och gee, <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about the film was the gaiety of the blue screen effects used to create Mom's "invisibility". They looked like they were shot on cheap movies, and they look completely unreal, and even in a bad way, where it's so funny that you love the movie ... I love this movie. The steadicam test shots were also very pathetic. I mean, hey, if they had a low budget, that's good. You can still create a great movie with a low budget. But bad movie and low budget and effects. This causes a bad combination. In this case, such a doomed combo created a capricious movie "Invisible Mom". If you have children and your children do not have a taste, maybe they do not sleep all this time.
