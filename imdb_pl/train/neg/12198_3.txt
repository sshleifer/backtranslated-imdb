Growing up with Beast Wars transformers, I was not very familiar with the original Transformers, and now that I've seen this amazing movie, and now that I've seen the older cartoon I'm building on, I have to say that I like the original drawing and the live action movie more than Beast Wars. <br /> <br /> Not that I do not like the character of BW, I think that characters like Optimus Prime are better than Optimus Primal. <br /> <br /> I mean "AUTOBOTS TRANSFORM AND ROLL OUT!" sounds much better than "MAXIMALS MAXIMIZE!" The voice of the original Optimus Prime still makes me believe that it is a real commander, more than Optimus Primal . <br /> <br /> In addition, the Powermaster Optimus Prime is much more powerful than Optimal Optimus. Just look on the net! <br /> <br /> Megatron in the form of BW seemed a more humorous version of its more evil version in the original series. <br /> <br /> In addition to what's more fun, robots that turn into animals or change robots to vehicles and spacecraft? Give me the original Transformers every day during the Beast Wars!
