Warning: Galore Spoilers! <br /> <br /> Tim Burton, making this film sui generis is more or less as sensible as changing Psycho - oh, it's true, some idiot has already done it - I'm resting on my case. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a chimpanzee wandering in a simulation, proving that he is not so smart from the very beginning. Marky Mark appears in the frame without showing the characteristic panties, then he is rejected by a simple woman who prefers the touch of chimpanzees. <br /> <br /> An unfounded shot of a space station orbiting Saturn for no apparent reason, the interior of the bustle of ships with genetic experiments on monkeys. Do we have to run 1300 million kilometers to Saturn to carry out these experiments? The Special Effects team decrees it. <br /> <br /> Marky's chimpanzee gets lost in this basic science fiction movie from the 1960s - Time Warp. Marky demonstrates the amazing inability of the space station's security by stealing the capsule without noticing anyone, and at the same time demonstrating its extreme foolishness in conducting a space rescue mission in the test chimp worm, with a $ 1 vehicle limited supply of fuel and oxygen. <br /> <br /> Before anyone can say "A senseless remake" Marky surfed the hole, crashed on an alien planet, took off his helmet without any thought about the mortality of the atmosphere and is pursued by the sound stage, which almost resembles a lush rainforest, if it were not for highlighting plastic trees with keys. <br /> <br /> Surprise! APES is doing chase - or at least * would be a surprise if nobody saw the Planet of the Apes THIRTY THREE YEARS AGO. <br /> <br /> Because Marky Mark did not show his pecs, take off his pants or spoil his lame white boy rap, he was without character. The crooked teeth of Gorilla, Michael Clarke Duncan, helped tremendously in * his * lack of character. Helena Bonham-Carter (aka an annoying chimpanzee activist), without Shakespeare's script, did a great job, beating both Marky and Clarke as Bridge Cardboard Cutout. Paul Giamatti, an orangutan slave trader, assured himself the role of whimsical comic relief and interspecies Klutz√≥w. Although I started to be afraid to hear words related to this film, one of the headlines of the review captured the essence of this "Planet of the Apes" "re-imagination": "The Apes Of Roth". While everyone else was milling, looking for supplements from Million BC or Greystoke, Tim Roth, Chimpanzee Thade, chews huge amounts of scenery and throws great cocoa. Just as funny as his psychotic Thade character, his character did not have a behavioral bow: Thade is angry when we meet him for the first time ... and he's almost at the same level crazy at the end of the movie. Nice turnaround. <br /> <br /> In the original POTA (1968) appeared the main character, Taylor Charlton Heston, who was so disappointed with humanity that he left the earth in space, without regret - but as the film progressed Taylor was unconsciously in the fight for proving the value of humanity - as their only master! The original film was ultimately a story of humiliation, not salvation: when Taylor discovers the Statue of Liberty, he is forced to realize that his species has NOT won. Is there anything like brain or irony for Leo Marky Mark? Or Thade Roth? No, but there is a lot of running. <br /> <br /> Keywords are calling: Take Back The Planet. But this is the planet APES. In this movie, humans and monkeys land here together, and people degenerate to become human, letting the monkeys acquire speech and sensual armor; monkeys wanting to inherit the planet! Marek Mark comes in a real anthropocentric arrogance, assuming that people MUST be peak predators simply because they are there. "Taking him back" is just as absurd as the monkeys landing here in 2001, complaining: "A planet where men evolved from APES? and then causing trouble with their abuse and hair. <br /> <br /> Heston was cast in POTA 1968 because he gained an independent reputation: he was Ben-Hur, Michelangelo, Moses! Manning him as a silent, stubborn animal in a foreign society was stupefying the audience's expectations: how crazy must be the world in which our man Charlton can not command respect? Marky Mark has now determined that he has tight pants. <br /> <br /> Though Heston was constantly maligned by the advice of the monkeys, he dominated the screen with his charisma and astounding hyperactivity. When Marky Mark tries to instill Mongoloid people, it's just that an unpopular guy in school suddenly becomes a class monitor that tells you to stop drawing penises on the board and throwing shoes at him. Burton tries to raise Marky to the icon of humanity, but he comes down as an upset deviant. In the original movie, monkeys recognize Taylor as a pervert, but he was an icon of humanity for the audience and monkeys. This irony again. <br /> <br /> It was right that the man who raised the stage for chewing with the acting technique - Heston - should play his father primo scwer-scene, Thaddeus Roth. As Roth's monkey dad, Charlton utters his own immortal lines, this time he turned against the HIM: "Damn them! Damn it to hell! <br /> <br /> The movie becomes stupid and stupid at the end. While Thaddeus gives Marky a lesson in the beating of the ass, the pod descends from the height with Marky's chimpanzees. The monkeys demonstrate their hebetuda, bowing to this extraordinary creature, while Marky proves his hebetuda, murmuring, "Teach these monkeys about evolution." First of all, they are not monkeys, you monkey! Secondly, it was the genetic manipulations and immoral plots that brought monkeys to this point, not evolution. And what you intend to teach them by blowing them away with a hidden laser weapon is called misanthropy, not evolution. <br /> <br /> Putting the end of the sprain would only confuse the viewers with the conviction that the role of Estella Warren was in fact integral with the plot (or still my pants.). <br /> <br /> Notwithstanding that he was the last hope of humanity; in the end, the policemen monkeys take Marky to prison at Plot Point, where he recently heard a wailing: "This is a madhouse! MADHOUSE !! ... "
