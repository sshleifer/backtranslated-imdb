I must admit that I have seen some of the views in my time, but this one is there with the worst of them. Intrigue difficult to follow. Sex and violence thrown away to confuse and divert attention away from a really poorly connected film. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine that the cast will look back at the final product and would like them to collect dust on the shelf so that they will not be disturbed by a generation or two. Unfortunately, in my case I have a DVD. He will sit on the shelf and look at me from time to time.
