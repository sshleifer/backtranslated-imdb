** TUTAJ BĄDŹ SPOILERÓW ** <br /> <br /> Summary: Mia (Helin) returns home from the capital of Stockholm to rural Rättvik to celebrate the 70th birthday of her fathers. He is definitely the youngest child and has two sisters Eivor (Ernst) and Gunilla (Petrén). Eivor has a family and still lives in Rättvik, and Gunilla has divorced and moved the city. Mia is still single and concentrates on her career. There is a lot of jealousy and almost hostility between the sisters, and conflicts arise around when they confront each other and everyone has personal problems that are difficult to deal with. When the party goes on (and alcohol is consumed), more and more secrets are revealed and there are more and more conflicts ... <br /> <br /> Comments: To be the work of a new scriptwriter / director, I was disappointed to see this movie to follow the exact same songs that old Swedish comedies / dramas have been following for a long time. There are really no new elements or ideas. This film is based on three basic areas. 1) Embarrassing humor based only on characters who make fools of themselves. 2) Sadness and 3) Anxiety. This movement focuses on the last one, almost forgetting the first point when the movie goes on. No loss, because the humor that is there is not funny. It seems to me that cast performances are good, though they are lost for all suffering and soon forgotten. I was hoping that new ideas and influences would emerge, but they were gone. In summary, there are better ways to spend time than watching it. <br /> <br /> 3/10
