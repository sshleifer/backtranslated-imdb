OK, history - a crude whore enters the life of a bored young girl and her child's brother and wreaks havoc in their lives - is slightly interesting. Anyway, ideas are nothing (everyone has ...) - performance is everything. <br /> <br /> That's what bothered me in this move. And it disturbed me very much. The rhythm (directing, editing) was slow, the tempo was uneven and the culmination was expected. We saw these icy roads five, six, seven times - why? Norton's troubles were seen as a childish game, not deep enough to understand his problems / soul / bla and root out for him or against him. Is he a coward, a manipulator or just a madman? References to "Taxi Driver" were absurd and unnecessary, and certainly not conducive to this film (or in this case E.N.). <br /> <br /> And IMHO, this is the end of a cowardly one. Cheap emotional tricks for teenage lovers somewhere in Central America. This guy should kill a child, blame his father, cause real devastation. Either the kid should have killed his father at the end, etc. But no, we got a tacky ending, when the children long for idiosyncrasies, the father is intrigued with his own life and relationships with them, and the madman of course dies. Happy, dysfunctional family is intact, safe and happily bored, so that we can enjoy our pop-prints, undisturbed. <br /> <br /> And the scene in which the madman enters the movie, oh my God, I would have to think long and hard to find something stupid! You do not shoot such a scene with a hidden camera and a hidden crew. The creators of this movie probably thought it was a good idea, but it was more than annoying. Again, if you're a 16-year-old girl somewhere in Kansas, wherever and anywhere, and you dream about having sex with a mad man twice your age, OK, then you can enjoy this movie and its "message".
