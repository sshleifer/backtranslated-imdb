Spouses Bennie Fields and Blossom Seeley were huge celebrities in vaudeville, but they did very few films. As with some other artists of their era (George M. Cohan, Fanny Brice, Gertrude Lawrence), the most accessible piece of footage for Fields and Seeley is the biographical About them, in which they are portrayed by other actors: "Somebody Loves Me", with involving Betty Hutton and this unique man who sings and dances Ralph Meeker. <br /> <br /> In their bloom, Fields and Seeley were so popular that the next act of husband and wife - Jesse Block and Eve Sully - achieved almost as much fame as the almost identical game, becoming in fact 'the second team "Fields and Seeley. However, off the stage there was a big difference in the living conditions of couples. Fields and Seeley lived in hotel apartments, paying for room service for every meal they eat, and eventually they ran out of money. Block and Sully lived modestly and wisely invested their income, ending with a comfortable retirement. <br /> <br /> The first 30 seconds of this short Vitaphone are occupied by two pianists wearing robes. Apparently these two men had in 1930. Their own, insignificant meaning, although I never heard of them. Finally, Fields and Seely get inside and start performing. They both have a lot of fun and she is quite attractive. <br /> <br /> I was irritated that both performers make moves like they should break into the dance, but they never do it until the third of the three songs they perform in this short one. When they finally start digging, the results are not impressive. <br /> <br /> I was delighted to see these two main performers who were doing their act. Now that I've seen it, I understand why they have never become stars in film musicals. My assessment of this: only 4 out of 10, and I will stick to Block and Sully.
