This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but I want to say that some of the critics I have heard have proved unreasonable .. <br /> <br /> When it comes to pure film technique, this director is competent. It is limited by a limited budget and a VHS camera, but the actual editing, camera angles, camera movements and scene staging are quite professional. I saw many films in which "directing" was much worse. At least the scenes flow in a way that is not misleading and has some clever photos here and there. Forest scenes also contained a decent atmosphere. With VHS camera you can do so much, and he does a good job when it comes to technical details. When it comes to artistic value, there is no. The scene in which the camera moves down so that we can observe how a guy urinates in the forest for 15 seconds, in a way he personifies the artistic style of the whole film. This is clean trash ... Total rubbish. <br /> <br /> Blood is decent for a movie in this budget range. , of course it's fake, but there are a lot of them, and it's very weird ... <br /> <br /> I've seen an American version with deliberately dubbed. It was a good idea (and that's the only thing that allowed me to go through this movie) ... Unfortunately, it's exaggerated, especially at the end. <br /> <br /> It's really a horrible movie, but I have to recommend it for its camp value. It is really hard to find a movie that is worse than this and puts it in a unique category.
