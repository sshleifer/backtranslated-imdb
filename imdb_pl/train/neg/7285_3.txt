The sun should set itself in this film forever. <br /> <br /> It lasts forever (which is not always bad - The English Patient, Schindler's List), but it is so onerous. The aging of actors is unbelievable, as is the prolonged endless plot that seems out of the blue. <br /> <br /> In short, a loss of talent and film.
