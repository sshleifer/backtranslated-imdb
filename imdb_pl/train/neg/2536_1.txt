My wife and I just finished watching BÃ»su AKA The Booth. She fell asleep during some parts of the movie. I really would like to have a nap with her, but the unfortunate fact is that the voice of the main character is so loud and jarring that I could not sleep. When the hero speaks, I want to hear Regis Philbin and William Shatner sing karaoke. It also has no redemptive features. I was hoping that five minutes later he would be hit by a bus. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love Asian horror movies, but The Booth is extremely annoying and full of scenes that really do not make sense at all. If you want good Asian cinema, check out A Tale of Two Sisters or Into The Mirror. Avoid booths like plagues, especially if you suffer from frequent migraines.
