I totally disagreed with the comments that said it was a good movie. It's a completely DRESS movie. I mean SUCKED - S.U.C.K.E.D. The development of history is strange. Mia Kirshner turned from an innocent girl into a chick looking for fun, without any convincing reasons. In addition, all the actresses looked too old to become students - students looked about 30 years - the rest you came up with. I only watched the first ten minutes and began to scroll quickly to search for sex scenes. all sex scenes are poor, hurried and, most importantly, they have no frontals. All sex scenes are funny, considering how many clothes they were wearing. Do yourself a favor - put it down and save a few bucks. Conclusion: History - 0, Sex - 0, Acting - 0, Score - 0 out 10.
