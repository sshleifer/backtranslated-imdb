This film is another Christian propaganda film on the Omega Code line. Not that it is certainly bad, but because most propaganda films devote sincerity and realism to the message they want to convey. If you like Styrofoam life in the streets and the way the Gospel can change your life, you might like this movie. I say: save money and rent a Cross and Switch Blade or Mission. When will Christian directors learn that sometimes people say bad words? It was frustrating to see criminals depicted who are not allowed to swear (huh? Criminals say bad words?) And flat figures that I really could not relate to. It would also be great if the movie showed a bit of RCP. I would like to pay something now. Who was the fool who compared this thin tale of communion about the movie from The Boondock Saints and The Sting?
