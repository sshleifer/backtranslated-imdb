I have never read Bradbury's novel on which this movie is based, but from what I've accumulated it will be interesting (when I finally read it and do it). My comments will be based solely on the film. As soon as I saw the trailer, I knew I had to see him and I was so excited, but when I finally did, I was so disappointed that it hurt. That's because the film itself was so amateur. The actors were not well manned (although Robards and Pryce are good actors - just not here). It seemed that the kids were asked to appear, put on the clothes of the characters, say lines and create faces. The set and props were cheap and unreal. The direction was surprisingly bad. I was so surprised by the awfulness of having to go online and see who directed it to see what work he had done. The editing was cut out and pasted, and the plot (script) was just that (although the author was involved in this matter, irony?). Building tension, fear and tension was so mild that it was ineffective when the climax finally came. <br /> <br /> I have read some of the comments for this film and it's hard for me to believe it. What hurts most is that the content is interesting, fun and intriguing. He had so much potential. Unfortunately, the film was so technically difficult that it deviates from the splendor of the story.
