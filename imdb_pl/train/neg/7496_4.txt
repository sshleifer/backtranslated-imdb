It is difficult to express in words the nearly bursting hatred for this film. But I'll try: <br /> <br /> Every other word was exciting, sex scenes were uncomfortable, drugs were going crazy and stereotypes were out of the norm, if not offensive to Italian Americans. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that acting was terrible because Leguizamo, Sorvino, Brody, Espisito et. al, he did well. But ... almost every character in the movie that I despised. Ever since The Bonfire of the Vanities did not like every character on the screen.
