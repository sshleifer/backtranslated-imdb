The back cover of the DVD (she missed the one that appeared) attracts Hitler - Rise Of Evil as "A Triumph" (The New York Post) and "Mesmerizing" (Newsweek). <br /> <br /> Well, no matter what the Post, but really, who ever wrote this word in Newsweek in the same context with this calm, ahem, art should be released. <br /> <br /> I do not know where to start. Why try to draw a picture of Hitler's evil in colors that did not exist? He was fine, but now his character is portrayed in a way that is often historically inaccurate (compared to his love of animals, the gentle and subdued way of treating women) and so on. <br /> <br /> The actors are good, so you have to feel sorry for them because they are trapped in their one-dimensional characters. A kind of curse here with Peter O 'Toole: This is the second time in his honorable career, when he finished playing the old and unsuccessful leader in the unsuccessful film (or in this case TV production to be exact). The first of them was of course the legendary Galigula. <br /> <br /> A list of historically inaccurate scenes would fill 1,000 words allowed by IMDb, so I think I will leave it here. <br /> <br /> This one is fine if it is on the TV and you have nothing else to do, but believe me - it's best to leave it on the shelf at your local Virgin store.
