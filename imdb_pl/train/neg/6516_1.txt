.... ripping a dozen or so better films. Especially "LA Story" by Steven Martin, who at least had such a grace to be of course fictional, even though he played in that movie his then girlfriend playing his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Yes, naive boys and girls "20 Dates" IS a mockumentary, although I'm not entirely sure that it was Myles Berkowitz's intention when he started. I have the impression that he started the project half-seriously, and then quickly realized that he would be pathetic and not funny, unless he made situations more and more ridiculous. As a result, the whole thing has a disturbing, cheap and insincere feeling. <br /> <br /> If someone noticed wisely, the movie has two dates that sue and impose restrictions on Myles, but they appear in the film, which would be impossible, because it would require a consent form. It also seems to me that most of the women who appear as "dates" are professional actresses (these are not famous, except for Tina Carrere) - they are just too beautiful, polished, thin and comfortable in front of the camera to be average civilians . <br /> <br /> Mr Berkowitz makes a classic mistake only by throwing this very thin actress instead of using different reliable women, which could make the premise (even in mockumentary) more credible and more fun. He also glides over what is probably his real problem, namely that both the film character and the real world Myles Berkowitz seem to be functionally unemployed (his actual IMDb credits are practically non-existent, with the exception of this film). Even in the film world, his ex-wife divorced him because he had never been employed. I think that the viewer (not to mention the real life dates of Mr. Berkowitz) deserves to be explained that he manages to live in one of the most expensive urban environments in the USA, in a luxury apartment, driving an elegant car and eating at expensive prices when he can not see he has no source of income. (Is he a drug dealer? Living with rich parents? No idea!) <br /> <br /> Most movies can get away if jokes are really fun. "20 dates" is painfully, embarrassingly un-amusing. Mr. Berkowitz's idea for a joke is that his character, while in the restaurant, announce to his companions how the food served can give him either diarrhea or constipation - the WORST kind of childish humor. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that Mr. Berkowitz has never made a film before "20 dates", and in the last 8 years he has not made a single film, appeared as an actor in someone's film OR had a letter or crediting of any kind . My instinct tells me that this movie was not financed by "Elie" (a man from gangster money who appears outside the camera), but rather by the affluent parents of Mr. Berkowitz, and perhaps constitutes a shocking abuse of credit cards. Regardless, we could all rest peacefully, because we probably will not have to see Myles Berkowitz or any of his creative efforts EVER. Alleluia!!!
