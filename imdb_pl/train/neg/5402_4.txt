This movie is so unbelievable; - the entire premise is a bunker; the fact that a serial killer (vampire or otherwise) could fly around and not kill as many people as the movie suggests is ridiculous. The vampire himself would not look out of place in Bela Lugosi's movie. Most of the actors are so wooden that the actors should be treated with dry rot. I am waiting for a day when someone will make a decent movie from Steven King's novel (except, perhaps, Stand by Me). This film suffers from what most of Stephen King's films do - lack of money for "special" effects, poor actors, frightening characteristics and dialogue. This movie is cheap, tacky and fails in everything it tries to do.
