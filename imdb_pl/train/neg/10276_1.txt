You may be reading some of the comments in this video and you can think of yourself, "Huh. Certainly, on December 30, several RAVE reviews were published. " The funny thing is that most of these enthusiastic reviews sound like they're from the same person, or at best from a small, coordinated group of "Open House" groupies.

If you're going to do a musical, whether in a movie or on stage, whether on Broadway or in a local community, you should make sure that (a.) Your actors can sing, (b.) Your actors can dance, (c. ) you have decent sound equipment, (d.) you have a well-written score, and (e.) you have lyrics that are witty and cute. Even Anthony Rapp can not save it. This is one of those unfortunate film experiences in which I really felt deeply embarrassed for everyone involved.
