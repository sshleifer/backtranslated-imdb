This is the worst performance. The rebellion of adolescents behaves like children without humor. Even Sesame Street has a better mood and is more grown up than friends "Friends" can be the worst thing I've ever seen on TV and sat in front of the lamp watching Friends just "do not fit well in other, today's lack of elegance" Seinfeld "And the great self-williness of pompousness, which is the hallmark of" Frasier ". Characters in "Friends" seem to be designed to make them disgusting mothers. . <br /> <br /> An unintelligent spectacle is completely devoid of any advantage. Characters are caricatures of cartoons, and writing is sophisticated - although deliberately yes (it may be interesting to watch writing sessions from writers may be forced to slavery to aim lower than their abilities, not to confuse loyal friends of "Friends").
