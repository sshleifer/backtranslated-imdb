Julia Roberts apparently makes a concerted effort to get rid of her Pretty Woman cotton character with this false spouse thriller, but it's hard to imagine she would end up performing so powerful and persuasive (and winning in an oscar) like Erin Brokovich on the basis of these rubbish. And do not do anything wrong with it, it's nothing more than the vehicle of Julia Roberts, but unfortunately her performance is not the most colorless in this matter. <br /> <br /> The plot has all the markings of late night - on the cable and do not have the impression that it will offer insight into the dark world of home abuse, because none of the characters is enough to really care. <br /> <br /> In the final analysis disappointing and unsatisfactory, without Robert's name on the title, I am sure that he would be completely deserved.
