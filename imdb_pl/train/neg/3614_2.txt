Schizophrenic escaped from a New York psychiatric hospital and soon teachers begin to throw away at the University of St. Trinity. New teacher Julie (Francine Forbes) is dealing with a mess of red herring. Despite the 78-minute operation time, this cheap-cutter goes on, until the lame end, in which the person you suspect is the killer of the trip, turns out to be such. Director Richard Haines hardly breaks the power with some poor stalk-n-slash staging. For all our amateur anthropologists, the film was shot in New Yawk in the early 80's, so you can check the entire culture, beliefs and practices of living people from this remote place. The film gains recognition for the discovery of "Final Girl". You rarely see it. It's always nice to see a horror movie in which the priest is a killer. Do not you trust the clergy, my beloved film industry? Fortunately, this is just a false priest and he is caught. However, he is still working on a high moral angle of the ground.
