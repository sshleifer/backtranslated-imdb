I'm so confused. What was this movie about in the world? What was the killer's motivation? He seemed very angry, but I still have to understand why. Nothing in this movie made sense. It had zero depth. Or less than zero depth. Which would probably make a hill. Or a stack. Nonsense. Acting was terrible. When I was looking for a few actors in this film, they were in very few things I heard about and that was not a surprise. I can not decide whether to repent them for being embarrassed about being in a film so bad or feeling that they should never be offered again. I'm starting. . NOW! (Seinfeld's reference.) But really do not waste time on it. There is so little substance that there is nothing there to just laugh. It was undoubtedly one of the worst slasher movies - NO, one of the worst films of ANY TYPE I have ever had the misfortune to observe and see a lot.
