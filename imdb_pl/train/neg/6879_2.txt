Rosie wasted a lot of time on television, talking about Tainos, as if they were very influential in the dynamics of the modern Puerto Rican. They were not. The truth is that Africans and Spaniards have known it. What's killing me is the fact that he stands on the screen, looking like an average fair-haired girl (with an obvious black dad, cousins ​​and aunt) pretending to really recognize the real essence of what makes them Puerto Ricans, but hardly ever recalls how Africans influenced on how to speak Spanish, food and music. She's so typical and I've lost a lot of respect for her and I will not support anything else she does. In addition, because he wants to dance around his African passion, he does not have to take more roles related to black (ie Lackawanna Blues). Next time we will find a proud Black Latina (thank you, Zoe Saldana, Gina Torres, Gina Ravera and Melissa DeSous). <br /> <br /> Puerto Ricans who say here that they are African, not "black." ...Thank you. We, "blacks", certainly have nothing to do with "you", so there is no love lost. But because you're probably in the US and you've been using the civil rights movement that we'd like for you, you'll refuse decent treatment of people, courtesy of blood, sweat and tears in the back of "blacks" with whom you do not share anything. <br /> <br /> If I'm right, the Puerto Rican people have a terrible picture in the media, but we black people do not spend time trying to disregard you because we know that the media love to use the low points and behavior of all minorities to preserve mindless generalizations . However, you have obviously come to the hype that someone is somehow white or better ... you are not. In addition, you somehow feel compelled to believe that black culture is FOLDED ... again you are incorrect and you have to go on vacation with a hood. Try to visit Atlanta, Ga, Houston, Texas, Charlotte, N.C. Trust me, none of the blacks either wants to apply for your "culture".
