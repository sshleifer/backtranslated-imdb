NATIONAL LAMPOON'S CLASS REUNION was a flop when it was released. He did not stay long in cinemas in my big city. Why? Because it's BAD !!!!! <br /> <br /> Not bad in a good way, but bad in a really ugly way. The entire cast of the actors was then largely unknown and remained unknown after this turkey. <br /> <br /> The idea is really great (parody of kitsch movies), but the execution is very poor in every respect. <br /> <br /> Just avoid this "comedy". Your time is more valuable than spending a nanosecond on watching this embarrassing disaster.
