This is one seriously disturbed movie. Even if the boys deserved what they got ... sadistic gruesome executions were "slightly" upstairs. The only figure showing some conscience at the beginning of the hunt was killed before he could help the sad plot. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie there was some promise of an average romance, but it was just a trick to lull the viewers with a false sense of security before the joy of what was to come. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could save me the movie was the fact that Jack Nicholson jumped out of the bushes and shouted: "where is the batman?". Kim Basinger could scream. <br /> <br /> Now it would be fun!
