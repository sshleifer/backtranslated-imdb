This film is exaggerated, predictable, pretentious and empty. Settings are faithful to the era, but they are aware of the enlargement thanks to long-term exposure. The survival of artifacts stops the action and cloys almost as much as an empty dialogue. Tom Hanks seems to sleep like Bruce Willis in Hart's War. Tom, you can not give your character depth by simply making your face empty! The content did not guarantee Paul Newman's histrionic activity. It's a dud wrapped in the atomic bomb enclosure.
