this film has been covered with a scandal so long that it has become a very sought after subject ... indignation, mystery, etc., all this was supposed to be a great film work, but it eventually fails in every way. it's a terribly bad comedy, pathetic horror, lame erotic movie. <br /> <br /> The 2-disc DVD contains a great brochure with photos, interviews, bestiality essays, etc., as well as an extensive interview more than a pretentious director. for those who have heard about it but have never seen it, the package will seem fantastic until you see the movie. Disc 1 contains an edited movie, poorly translated into English, but with good visual quality. plate 2 contains a director's cut, in a horrible transfer, in French. <br /> <br /> what can I say about the real beast? Kermit hand-held puppet would be more effective and shocking.
