Where should I start my story? Tonight I went to this movie with some friends who did not know more than the Actors who were in this movie and that it was supposed to be a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Well, I discovered that in the first 20 minutes, what a bad decision I made when going to this movie. The plot was nonsense, like the script. The lines were awful to such an extent that people in the audience laughed hysterically. <br /> <br /> The cast could not have been more plastic. Even some of the scenes seemed to be much faster ... as if they were dragging on without special reason. Very poor edition. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie was a huge waste of time and money. Whistle.
