Overall, the film is rated with a strong cast and clever dialogue and, of course, Dean Martin's songs. The problem is Nicholas Cage, there is no chemistry between him and Cher and they are the main love story. Cher almost makes up for it with his reactions to Cage's changing accent and lack of control of body language. Cage simply never goes into his role. He tries everything he can and becomes an actor, not a real person, and it is needed in a love story. Cage had the same performance problems in other roles that require more Jimmy Stewart characters. Cage still takes over these roles, perhaps because he likes such films, but his own energy as an actor is not suitable for them, although in this case he became better. He should leave these types of roles to less interesting actors who would be fully involved in this film and would release their energy and considerable talent for more rhythmic roles and films in which he could be his crazy, interesting self.
