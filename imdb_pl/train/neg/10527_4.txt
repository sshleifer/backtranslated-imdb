I discovered this movie at a seller selling OOP. And this is certainly OOP. A year after The Exorcist comes back to work with this movie, but what we've all known is that Blair's career has never exploded, never became a mega star. This is one of the reasons why many of her films are OOP. It gives a good performance in this film. It's a rejection that is not recognized by parents and has no friends. I played at the age of 15, playing a 14-year-old girl, it's fun. The film is also known from the scene of rapes in showers when they bury a virgin broom. In most editions it is cut out, why, I do not know, there is no blood in it, okay, Blair is naked, but nothing is shown, no T & A, so nothing offends people. But the movie is slow, very slow. Normally, I do not like it, but I almost fell asleep. It is the 14-year-old who becomes a rebel against society, but there is no blood flow, there is nothing without blood. Why this is classified as a horror movie is still a miracle for me. If you're a Blair fan, buy it if you find it in a different way.
