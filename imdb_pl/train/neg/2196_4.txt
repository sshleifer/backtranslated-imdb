The Brain (or head) that Would not Die is one of the more thought-out low-budget movies from the early 1960s. It is very difficult to imagine how this disgustingly sexist scenario could have been written without intentions of self-knowledge. Subject repeated many times by the leading woman, Ginny Leith - free head kept alive by machines, I-V and clamps - seems to confirm that the film was to simultaneously use and criticize gender stereotypes. Shades of Helena's underestimated boxing. <br /> <br /> Sex is abundant, and more or less as annoying as an army of angry ants. Dialogue is hyperbolic, overly dramatic and unbelievable, and acting is only OK (but not consistent). Why did I give this movie 4? Because a thought clearly came into this. I really am not sure at what point the film really tried, but it seems clear that it is striving for an extremely bizarre and harsh kind of horror (without the blood and courage that today's viewers expect). <br /> <br /> Another unique and interesting aspect of the brain is that there are no heroes in this movie, and none of the characters is particularly nice. <br /> <br /> Considering everything, it is a rather painful and disturbing look at the beginning. Sexuality of American pop from the 1960s, from the point of view of a woman kept alive, despite her missing body after a fatal car crash. Her lover threatens to sew on her a fresh, high quality body and force her to continue living with him. It is understandable that she is not supported and forced to make friends with a creature that is almost as monstrous as her boyfriend. Oh, there are also unclear references to the stereotype of the 1950s and 1960s about the evil of science conducted by amok. <br /> <br /> Recommended for B and SF lovers for master's students in the field of gender. O / w is not recommended.
