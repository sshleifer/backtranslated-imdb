What's happening with RGV? It seems to be repeated in every movie. Have you run out of creative ideas? If so, it's time to take the back seat. I went to see a movie with great anticipation - of course, I had imagined that it would be near the original. I knew no, the promos said everything. But even then I thought it would be a great treat for RGV, after all it's not the same guy who directed Sathya and the company? Is he? I have doubts after seeing Aaga. I'm not going to talk about the story or the story, because most of them come from the original, if you really die to see this, you can play a fun game with friends: identify scenes from the original one and give your own ratings! So Veeru becomes Heero (how trivial?), Guess that Heeru does not sound so great. Ajay Devgan is a disaster like Heero, the comedy is tense and the indistinct conversation that was really effective in the company sounds false. Chemistry between Heero and Gunghroo (Nisha Kothari) does not exist at all. In fact, the more adorable Nisha tries to be more annoying. It reaches the peak at the end. Paradise is not really bad compared to others, it's a guy to watch in the future. I was very disappointed with Amitabh Bachchan as Babban, it looks like a caricature of Gabbara Singh. There is a scene in which he drinks something from a bowl covered with a shawl, instead of arousing fear, he looks like a beggar with a bowl. The only spectacle that really stood out was Mohan Lal as Inspector Narasimha. I am afraid I have no patience to write more.
