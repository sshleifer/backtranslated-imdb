A decent animation and some manageable characters make this animated horse tale from DreamWorks at least to watch ... but it remains a bit slow, and the plot is a bit stupid. Interesting is the reversal of typical cowboys and Indian roles, but here it seems rather a tribute to political correctness than a proper plot decision. GRADE: C
