This movie is the worst I've seen in the last 5 years. It is surprising how brilliant actors, such as the two main characters of this film, agreed to operate in such a worthless garbage room. The film is a genre of rape / beating and revenge. The couple went to the party and hit the deer on the way back and went out to finish it when a jeep full of bad guys came. He did not go to his car, instead he was thrown out and well beaten while she tried to start the car engine that betrayed her and she was raped in gangs. Then she is in the house of her fathers, and one of those bad guys is her neighbor, so she took a rifle and wanted to kill him ... Such a stupid script! Bellow Hollywood! He was against this vengeance, but "She is raped" "They laugh at her", so he must kill them all ... But when she was home, she satisfied herself by pushing the rifle in the wrong aisle and went away when he went mad and the execution of the evil guy. Personally, I think the director ran out of money before the end, because the movie ends before they execute anyone else involved in rape and beating, which is not a big surprise, because the sponsor apparently saw it and wanted to get his money back. LoL This movie is not intended even for people who like to see rape, because they will not see anything they are looking for ... This director should be banned ... It's just the annoyance of this British cinema that has become garbage. Personally, I like it and that is the reason why I watched it. Do not do it alone, you have better things to do, watching a stupid screenplay film ...
