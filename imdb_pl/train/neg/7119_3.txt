* SPOILERY * <br /> <br /> I'm sure that when it was released in 1958, it was appropriate for his time. In those days, movies were slower to allow viewers to track and analyze stories. Here the man moves to the house belonging to his last wife, who mysteriously died with his new wife. Gardener Mickey (played by Alex Nicol, who also directed his film) is really an underestimated character. He gets a skull that indirectly warns Jenni that he's in trouble because he knew there was a foul in the first wife's death. He can not tell Jenni directly what happened, so he tries to scare her with a skull. We also learn that Jenni has seen her parents die, causing mental anguish that leads to institutionalization. Like many other recipients, I think that stimulation is a little too slow for my tastes. But if you like horror in slow motion without many gore, this movie is for you. <br /> <br />
