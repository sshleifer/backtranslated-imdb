It was the worst movie I've ever seen in cinemas. It was just a compilation of recycled material. People struck the head are not funny. People digging are not funny. For the third time, the guy was hit with bullets, even the youngest member of the audience did not laugh anymore. I got tired quickly. <br /> <br /> I went with my younger sister. Actually, he laughs loudly at King of the Hill, but it was a cinematic masterpiece that bored her. I'm not surprised. The story is pretty bad. The dwarf robber steals a big diamond in what was by far the easiest step in Hollywood history. Then he hides with his family pretending to be a child. I know it sounds exciting, but that's the whole story. Say these two lines over and over again for 1.5 hours and you'll get a photo. There was a lot of predictable jokes. I really felt cheated after seeing this. I did not expect much and I was still disappointed. I would like Keenan to simply hire decent writers to write jokes and / or his next script. It was even worse than white chicks if possible. I saw that high schools were better and cheaper. <br /> <br /> There was nothing positive about this movie. I do not like my entertainment to be subdued.
