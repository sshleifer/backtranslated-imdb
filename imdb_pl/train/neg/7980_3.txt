This service comedy, for which Peter Marshall (brother of Joanne Dru and later host of The Hollywood Squares) and Tommy Noonan were stunned as "new Lewis and Martin", is simply embarrassing: a few random gags of sight are inserted, everyone talks quickly and nothing works quite well - there is one scene in which Noonan angrily throws grenades at officers and politicians; they are about five feet apart, Noonan throws them among themselves, and the total reaction is that everyone is shuddering. <br /> <br /> In the midst of the horrors, only Julie Newmar was relieved, there are a few moments of magnificence: Marshall and Noonan engage in sporadic duels and arguments, and their time is close to perfection - apparently they were well-developed comedies. <br /> <br /> It is not enough to save this turkey, unfortunately.
