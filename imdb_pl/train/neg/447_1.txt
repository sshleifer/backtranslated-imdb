What can you say about the comedy series. It is often quite bad, it sacrifices morale and is simply bright. So this is the show! He got a boring cast, although A.Bynes is okay in his dear way, the rest is just stereotypical shit .... We've all seen this before and probably will see it again after canceling this program. Because let's face it, it's an average and fair show. As most sitcoms are .... <br /> <br /> In short. If you want to see good entertainment, you can do twenty minutes break in front of the mirror. Make a few faces and move on .... It's more fun than this show!
