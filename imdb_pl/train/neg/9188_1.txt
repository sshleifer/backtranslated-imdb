This is the only movie I've seen by Uwe Bolla. I knew he was probably the worst director who always makes movies based on video games. I still wanted to watch it because I'm a big fan of this game and I wanted to see what the movie has, which makes it so bad. After seeing him, I agree that this is nonsense, the movie has no history. In the first 15-20 minutes there was nothing but topless teenage girls who did not have any brains (for a moment I wondered if the zombies were dead? Are the girls?), Then the zombies disappeared at night and I started attacking people later, a woman she started shooting them, it means she takes you one place and the other takes you every 5 minutes. Is it supposed to be a comedy or a horror movie? or both? Before I knew it, I fell asleep in the second half and woke up during the final credits, so I could not see all that was a good thing! The film is a real insult to the classic game, Uwe Boll, please do not make more films. Thank you!
