I rented this movie just to see Amber Benson, although after reading this box I thought it sounds like a good story ... but the first problem was that there really was no history ... or actually there was a story but it's absolutely not it made sense. The second problem was that there were no settings for these characters ... Yes, I have that everyone went to school together, but within the first 3 minutes of the movie you realized that they had nothing to do and did not like each other. .. so why they met. Defect number 3 ... the director, although long breaks and tight camera shots, equaled tension (especially with typical, tense music, which was called) ... he was unfortunately wrong. It was painful when we watched a great actress, such as Amber Benson, who was wasting time trying to bring it back to life ... my only hope is that the money she made here was intended for the production of her own film.
