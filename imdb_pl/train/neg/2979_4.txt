"Gone With The Wind" is one of the most overrated films in history. It is a movie loved by mothers, grandmothers and people who go to the cinema once every five years. As a movie about zombies is blowing. There is no crazy corpse in sight, and it is extremely light in the blood department. "Zombie 3", on the other hand, is large on corpses and is generous with bloodshed - that's why it's better than "Gone with the wind". It is also not overrated. Most reviewers have no illusions that it is rubbish. However, this is not boring trash. After the terrorist steals the virus, he drops it, hunted down by the helicopter, and the chemicals leak into the ground. A terrorist who has been exposed to an unpleasant concoction, is hiding in a hotel room, where he slowly transforms into a zombie feeding on the body. One of his first victims is a cleaning lady. After biting, the hell brand Lucio Fulciego falls apart. As usual in the Fulci movie, the acting is terrible, the plot is full of holes in the storyline, and the gore is plentiful. It turns out that the film was directed by Fulci and Bruno Mattei, which explains his schizophrenic character. It's also badly shot, badly edited, and the sound design is flat. Despite this, he is saved thanks to the joyful adherence to the most magnificent murders and his impatient stimulation. It's definitely worth picking up if you're undead. Or you do not like "Gone With The Wind", without a doubt the worst zombie movie of all time.
