I am sorry to report that I have seen this movie several times. When bombed at the counter, it was repeated every night for about a month in HBO. And I watched it over and over, because television is so bad at all - or it was at that time. I do not watch anymore, so it can be great now - as Samuel L Jackson says about pigs: "I can taste like a sweet potato cake, but I will never know, because I would not eat this dirty kind." Let's see. Dudley plays Arthur wandering in the desert, always a few steps behind Moses. It came out right after Life of Bryan, so you can guess where the inspiration came from. A few mild toys run too long until you just close your eyes and grit your teeth. There is one scene in which Arthur and Dom Deluise meet in the desert, both stretched out and drained, dying of thirst. Then they meet like old friends who really did not know each other well, promise lunch. It could have been fun. <br /> <br /> But the scene I obviously remember is a meeting with Pharaoh, in which the pharaoh is a black street kid made in the full regalia of King Tuta. He had to read poems straight, because at one point before the release he overstepped his scene with the Hollywood equivalent of the black street jargon expressed by the would-be Jimmy Walker (Kid Dyno-wannabe). Or maybe it was Jimmy Walker - who knows? Who cares. They've transformed a boring scene into a very racist, very distasteful, very long excrement, one of those legendary things that just do not blush, no matter how many times you try, so you leave it for someone else to deal with. br /> <br /> Well, this is my review. If you're renting this movie (DO NOT BUY WHAT TO DO!), Get ready with a bottle of tequila and a six-pack Corona. <br /> <br /> Now that they've done the Poseiden adventure, one is probably high on the remake list. Maybe this time they will hire a comedy writer.
