I gave this film "2" to loooooooooooo because of attractive actors and semi-sexy love scenes. Otherwise, if you can not read like a speed reader, you will NEVER go through the subtitles that are trying to keep up with the Spanish speed of speech! And what the hell is happening on the story if you can not read the subtitles. Endless eyes and stupid eyes and constant rejection. Just boring after about an hour. Some good pictures, but also so DARK that your screen has burned out. How it got everything I could never understand. It is difficult to talk about "ACTING" because the main actors just look and look at each other with love when they do not repel each other. Geraldo's character is so attractive that it's hard to believe that EVERYONE will push him away. And what about his mother? I just do not understand GET IT most of the time, with the difference that there were three guys who all had a story with each other ... but they never figured out who the EX was.
