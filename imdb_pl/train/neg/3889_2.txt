I always wanted to see it, because I love bad horror movies and with such a title, I was sure that "The Incredible Melting Man" will be great fun. <br /> <br /> It really was not. My point is that acting was fun, the script contained classic bad lines, and the special effects looked like someone sneezed at the main actor, so I should have loved him. Unfortunately, between these attractions is really dragging. I decided to watch the last half of the movie when I was making a tax return. This movie is so boring. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, if you love bad movies, you'll like the dramatic output of Fat Nurse and the stellar game of a guy who plays Dr. Ted. In order to be honest with a poor man, he must deliver incredibly inept lines with a simple face - like the conversation he and his wife have on tracking down a man with IM: <br /> <br /> "I will find him with a Geiger counter. "Is he radioactive?" "Only a bit." <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot has Dr. Ted wandering after trying to find a super powerful machine to kill a zombie armed only with what looks like a mini-Dyson. He is a brave man. Unfortunately, his plan fails when he finds a large amount of goose on the tree. "Oh God, it's his ear!" Dr. Ted says to the audience. I'm glad he explained it. <br /> <br /> I realize that I am making this film rather funny. It would be like this if it only lasted 10 minutes, but unfortunately it lasts and continues, and Incredible Melting Dude just dangles to make a sticky mess when he should eat more people, in my opinion. I think if you were really stoned, you'd probably love it, they just did not have pop-tarts during the movie, because the main actor really resembles the one at the end.
