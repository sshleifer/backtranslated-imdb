Maybe I'm not sophisticated. This and Closer are two of the supposedly cerebral films I have recently seen, and both suffer from exactly the same problem in a severing degree. Dialogue is a false false fake. Nothing that comes out of someone's lips seems credible. Perhaps the way this movie is set up is what it should look like, but it could not be watched. And boring. I left after 20 minutes of boredom. <br /> <br /> I will stick to Sleeper and Bananas for repairing Woody Allen. If I ever come across teevee, I will turn around and try to find a section of Quincy.
