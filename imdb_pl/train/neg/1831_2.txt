I usually like comedy movies. I really like them. But I do not really understand "Envy." I mean, it has a boring content / theme and is not really fun. <br /> <br /> Although the game is generally good, it is not enough to make the movie at least a bit interesting. Stiller and Black do not show all of their talent in this film. <br /> <br /> So if you're going to hire a comedy, I suggest that you definitely do not follow it. Unless you want to be bored, and I see that I'm not the only one with this opinion, because even Jack Black apologized for that (look at Trivia).
