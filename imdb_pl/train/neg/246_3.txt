This is a blatantly futuristic adaptation of Julius Verne's "Mysterious Island". Editing the sound is very bad. You hear a dialogue on the set and hear voices recorded in the recording booth at the same time! It's an amateur movie with actors from Boston and shot around New Hampshire. For those who live in New Engalnd and who read this comment, he will be delighted with the big W. This film is full of flaws. You can hear the voice of the director, who gives directions and gives the actress tips. "OK, get up now." As for other characters. There's this guy who talks to his mind instead of the voice and the blue alien. The foreign guy speaks in a deep voice. When he yawns or grunts when he is fighting, you hear the voice of an actor. When it comes to special effects, man! It was Brett Piper's early work for loud crying! Creatures are good, but the animation is uneven. Really violent. A bit like the animation of Karl Zeman in THE JOURNEY TO THE BEGINNING OF TIME (1955). Special effects are ingenious. Thge's music is good. Bottom line: this movie makes EQUINOX or PLANET OF THE DINOSAURS look like the epic Ray Harryhausen. Did you know that MYSTERIOUS PLANET was a home movie and had a budget for shoes? Be careful about new movie makers.
