I saw this movie a few months ago in a city that appeared in the movie as Greendale, which is the only reason I went to see it. Another local who was there, just sent me an e-mail with a repetition of the show, because the first one was sold out and people were rejected. His editorial comment in his statements is a good summary: <br /> <br /> "Yuk." <br /> <br /> Unless you are a fan of Neil Young or live in / near "Greendale" (if you know the other one) real name), skip this movie. It's mainly the ego's journey for the filmmaker. There is no clear plot, the music is just right, and too many texts are incomprehensible, which makes it impossible to track what small parts of the story may be. <br /> <br /> I do not have to put a spoiler warning because there are no surprises to give away. <br /> <br /> I would give it 1.5 / 10, but it's just for entertainment, which is watching places in the movie. It was not worth $ 6. I could rent a video camera and drive "Greendale" and make a better movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a * good * movie with an environmental message without a storyline, go and hire Koyaanisqatsi.
