I am a person who went to the local library and read books on Babbage's differences mechanism, while my schoolmates played football, etc. So if there is such a thing as the target audience of this movie, it probably will probably be included. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just have to watch it again. A previous reviewer mentioned not watching this movie while being tired. Maybe it was my mistake. <br /> <br /> I've tried my best to enjoy this movie, and there are some aspects that I like, but overall I think it is amateur and quite clever. <br /> <br /> Being someone like a self-proclaimed computer nerd, I can not help myself with the exact time in which the movie was made, and how the graphics used reflect this time (ie 1997). Playing games from the era of c.f. "Mind Grind" to give one example, this movie can not escape the 16-bit multimedia explosion at the time. Now, fortunately, in recent years a bit has decreased in the world of games, for the real game. <br /> <br /> Must resort to watching this movie through the German satellite channel FTA (as I think it has never been broadcast on British FTA television, or at least not lately). I was slightly amused, seeing that Gottdog (God dog) had 4 people working on his project. Perhaps this means that I am excited that it made me laugh because ten years have passed since the film was made, but the end result makes the graphics from the eighties look good in comparison. <br /> <br /> But just like in the main story, I agree that the format is not the best idea. Like the others, I agree that Ada deserves a movie without a sci-fi angle, and a more direct biographical approach would probably be better suited to embrace the life story of this extraordinary lady. <br /> <br /> There are basic mistakes that undermine my pleasure with this movie. First of all, the idea that somehow lost information about the real world from the past, can be accurately reproduced through some extrapolation with the help of intelligent software-based agents, seems to be somewhat absurd. <br /> <br /> Also, the topic goes through a movie, which computer device can actually predict the mechanics of all things over time (eg, winds), is now unknown. <br /> <br /> OK, so the Wiktorians could have this view, but GÃ¶del's works from the 20th century proving that no mathematical system can be complete, Turing's work on the limits of computability, not to mention the theory of chaos and quantum mechanics, they undermined those ideas that seem to be of key importance for the modern researcher. <br /> <br /> Finally, clicking the mouse in the air means "programming" is also just wrong, as mentioned before. <br /> <br /> This film may have been OK, but at least some technical consultation would give the film a much needed recognition for credibility. <br /> <br /> However, I will not forget the film, as in the case of "Pi", it is clearly a unique work, but also with many fatal mistakes for me to really enjoy it, 3/10 from me.
