No, I have never seen any of the series "Santa Slasher", ie "Silent Night, Deadly Night", the original "Black Christmas" or this "Christmas Evil". I've heard everything about their reputation, or MADS (Mothers Against Deranged Santas). I thought I would rent this one because I heard that it appeared as a reference in the "Fat Guys At the Movies" segment. <Br /> <br /> Mothers should be against it, but not for ooooohhhh "killer" Santa, but this movie was just crappy. Boring, long? even after 92 minutes, shit. <br /> <br /> The little boy sees how Santa comes in a chimney in 1947, delivers presents, eats delicacies, and miraculously hovers over the chimney. The boy goes to bed, but returns to the living room to witness Mami and Santa (in a sense) starting. Apparently this failed the kid for the rest of his life, though the scene was as vile as when Ralph's dad got "Leg Lamp" in "A Christmas Story." He was so worried that he went to the attic and cut his arm well. <br /> <br /> Fast forward! It is now 1980 and the broken boy works in a toy factory. We sense that it is a bit uncomfortable, and keeps track of both children and parents. Who is naughty, who is nice, blah blah. It takes a good two thirds of the movie to finally break it? as if it was not announced from the first frame. THE LACK OF THE FILM should last for so long. <br /> <br /> I admit that this movie had its tension, but only because I expected it would do something to anyone. When finally, well, he punishes "who is naughty", it is as graphic as the "Garbage Pail Kid" card. And I did not mention the end of WTF. I think it was a metaphor, but in reality it is just as weird as the rest of the movie. (Kill a brother who annoys his siblings, and his solution is killing.) Do not open this mess, even on Christmas Eve or Evil. Again, I did not watch other Santa-Slashers, but this one was bad. He built the tension because of the nature of the film and never delivered a decent gift.
