Despite his flaws, I liked "Cigarette Burns", an episode of John Carpenter's first season in the "Masters of Horror" series. Yes, the story seemed a cheap combination of IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS and 8MM, but it was still quite good for the budget and the time constraints it was given. With "Pro-Life" however, the low budget and time constraints definitely show more than anything else. Carpenter always has a solid direction, but the magazine and the whole production have such quality that gives the feeling that it was done in complete and complete haste. The script is not always clear, the message is not clear, and the story is full of storylines when you look back at it. Maybe if Carpenter wrote the script again, it could have been an interesting episode. Instead, it is a mess that only fans of hardcore Carpenter will find the least pleasure. By far the worst that Carpenter ever did. 2/10
