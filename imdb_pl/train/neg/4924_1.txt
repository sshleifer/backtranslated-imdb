This movie is really bad. It can be difficult, but it is. It really is. Weak scenarios, every vampire stereotype in the book is used and has no compassion for the origin of the main character ... ie Ole Dracula. In the past there were some really great Dracula / vampire movies, but this does not even get into the dire. <br /> <br /> Take a few people who seemed to give up the teenager-slasher movement, add Dracula Lore's dribble and mix in a strong tone of religious / surreal dreams ... and you'll get a mess in the movie - Dracula 2000. <br /> <br /> I really can not find any good things to say about this movie, as if it was not bad enough that it was done in the first place, it seems that it caused Johnny Lee Miller to influence the English accent ... What I hear you cry with this problem ... Well, he is an Englishman, but he sounds like an American trying to make an English accent. <br /> <br /> In total you can just as well say your money (if you were thinking about buying it)) or rent it, watch it and see why it's as scary as Tellytubbies. <br /> <br /> PS Although La La is quite scary!
