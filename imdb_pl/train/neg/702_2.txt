Daphne Zuniga is the only light that shines in this sleepy strait, and the light quickly disappears. If not her, then some other reason to watch it. Five college kids signed up to prepare an old dorm for demolition. Problems arise automatically when a strange homeless man asks, and the group has few people. Then the killer is at large. I honestly wanted to say that I would enjoy it. He had a fair setting, maybe only Daphne Zuniga. The film is too slow and almost as silent as the library. Most of the actors are below average, and the moments of the "point of view" are so old. Recognized composer Christopher Young from such films as "Hellraiser" and "Entrapment" included it in a recurring cue line, better prepared for a television film. Nevertheless, it seems higher than the film deserves. So, apart from Young and Zuniga, he scrapes the bottom of the barrel.
