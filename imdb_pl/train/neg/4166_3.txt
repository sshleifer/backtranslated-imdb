A complete waste of time .... This movie is not a comedy, it's not a drama, it's not an affair ... at least even a teenage comedy !!! The story ... should be a bit late ... but it's so disappointing! When the film is over, I expect the film to be even better ("Fight Club"), but this phrase makes the film even worse ... When I watch a comedy for teenagers, and I do not do it too often, I expect bad jokes and traffic ... Jokes are too bad and no nudity ... You only have one ... very good looking I have to admit ... girl, and that's it! And she is fully dressed in the whole movie! The action is bad ... like a series of soaps ... Do not waste your time! There are porns with better history and acting! <br /> <br /> (sorry for my bad English)
