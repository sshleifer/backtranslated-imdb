It was the third effort of the director von Stroheim - he is quite primitive and does not show a unique talent for camera and montage championship, which he would show several years later with his masterpieces, GREED and THE WEDDING MARCH. Basically, we have a trio of griffins, pretending to be the Russian Count and two Russian princesses who have rented a villa in Monte Carlo. Their goal is to use fake money at game tables and get a fortune. Part of this plan is for the Count (von Stroheim) to insinuate between the visiting American ambassador and his "stupid" wife, soliciting her and the hope of getting money by playing on her weaknesses. He makes the mistake of also saving for the maid's life he promised to marry. When he sees them together, he lights the room (von Stroheim and his victim are on the balcony of the room). Here von Stroheim describes his personality for the first time as "a man you love to hate." He is completely angry, and his defects in character ultimately lead him to a very bad and deserved end. The film is primitive when it comes to photos and editing, and it is not worth watching, unless the director fascinates you. It's a sweet piece - when I try to meet the ambassador's wife for the first time, read a book - we see the title - LIVING LIFE of Erich von Stroheim. Originally, it was designed as a 210-minute movie, shortened to 140 minutes by the studio and finally released after 70 minutes. Restoration in the Video Cinema restores the preserved material (somehow damaged in most scenes) from the alternative earlier version to give us a 107-minute printout.
