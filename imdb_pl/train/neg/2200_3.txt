I love movies about the bad shark. really. I am laughing at them hysterically. and the sciFi channel had their marathon, culminating in the premiere of their new original image, hammerhead: shark craze. based on the announcement it looked like it would be VERY fun. basically it is a remake of the benchley essence. was preceded by a show of shark attack 3: megalodon, which at its best is a happy shark movie. I was in the mood; I was ready to work. bring it, crazy scientist-man-hammer! Oh, God, was this movie bad? <br /> <br /> bad, bad, bad. <br /> <br /> sick. twisted. MESSED UP. <br /> <br /> This is the theoretical reproduction in the worst case, my friends. when the girl removed from the drug is led out of the suspended animation and tied to the table, screaming that her head is torn off because the hybrid shark fetus, a completely crazy "scientist" deliberately implanted in her womb, wants to leave ... Jesus apes. that's what I call worrying. <br /> <br /> the story really works: hmmm, a crazy scientist thought. my son died of cancer, but I brought him back to life by combining the bottoms with the hammer shark, because the sharks do not undergo cancer, and more hammers reproduce through the placenta. look! perfect amphibious! I created another evolution of the human race! I KNOW! let's make him reproduce! but it is a pity that all these shark genes did not make my son bloodthirsty; instead of raping hot babies, I send him to his little jungle paradise, he keeps eating it. but check it out! among the random people who, as a result of the irrelevant twist of the plot, found themselves on my research island, there is a woman with whom my son was engaged before death! I bet he will do HIS! All this leads to an extremely touching and heartfelt meeting: a woman: will you impregnate me? crazy scientist: no. he is. (indicates the throwing of the shark-man in the tank), how sweet. <br /> <br /> DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM. always.
