I can not imagine anyone wanting to watch this film in a million years. Not because it was one of the worst that ever came into being (it was not), but mainly because it's about 20 years old and is from the mainstream. I tried to find out where I had seen the actor before, and it appeared. Yes, the child stops playing in a small league because he does not like atom bombs, which causes great media attention and a quick solution to the Cold War. End. A fantasy, of course, but so clever that it will make John Lennon red. Because terrorism has replaced communism as a -ism that frightens us, this film really does not matter, except that in those days (inaccurately) it looks back. Writing, acting and filming are similarly undeveloped. The reason I rated him as high as it was was that I watched the movie about 50 times when I was 5-6 and I still have a small place in my heart, but now I realize it's not cut mustard finish. So if the law of big numbers is true and someone finally decides to check this movie, realize that there is a much better way to spend time, but also much worse. (For now, I will refrain from the tirade of John Q.)
