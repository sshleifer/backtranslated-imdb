OK, I have been a big fan of Black for a long time and I was disappointed after watching this movie. Let's call problems ... First, this movie has a lot of the same crew that the two first had. He was also named PREQUEL for the original Black Stallion. Why can not they get the correct name for Shetan? In "The Black Stallion Returns" we learn that Sagr was the mother of the Black Identity, and in this movie is a gray mare Jenny! WTF? The action takes place in Africa in 1946 and 1947 ... I may be wrong, but the first one was set in the forties when the ship crashed. The timeline does not sound good to me. What's more, at the beginning of the film there is a hairdresser who is supposed to be the father of Shetan ... after you notice, he looks like a gelding. Ben Ishaak is the only person who has remained to make this film in any way. For some, it may be a nice family movie, but this is my biggest film disappointment this year.
