Vampires Vs. Zombies were not the original title. It was actually ... <br /> <br /> Nasty lesbian half-vampires and two zombies striking cars: special performances of Bob Lesbian Gypsie-Witch and her dog, a random woman with special powers and a Catholic school Zombie Choir Girl Short Skirt . <br /> <br /> Also in the box: Warning: no story - only the screenwriter and director will understand the end or anything else in this movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously though, I love bad movies. I love vampires. I love Zombie. Hell, I even like lesbians. This film combined all three with vague and confusing (or non-existent) plot, terrifying (I mean REALLY BAD) dialogue and random STUFF and PEOPLE that have nothing to do with anything (or do ... know what's going on in the world ). Oh, and I can not forget about green oatmeal "Zombies" in latex gloves (yes, the filmmakers were so cheap that they could not even cover their zombies with their hands in oatmeal and paint). Anyway, the effect was a bad movie, if you can even call it that. <br /> <br /> Was the end to make no sense? The vampire was really a nurse, and the other was a really patient mind? Where were the Vampires Vs. Zombies? Hell, where there were vampires at all ... you can not really call any of the vampire girls. Anything. <br /> <br /> Never rent or buy this movie. If you're REALLY curious ... okay, I understand. Seriously, even fans of BAD movies will not be able to stand it. It should be number 1 at the bottom 100.
