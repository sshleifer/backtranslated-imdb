Unfortunately, one of the best efforts in the field of special effects has become completely pointless, because it has been placed next to a heavy, stupid and equally senseless plot and an inappropriate stereotypical scenario. Hollow Man is a rather useless movie. <br /> <br /> Virtually everything we see here has been made for death - characters, ideas and action sequences (especially elevator windows!) - with the only really intriguing element the film is an impressive special effect. However, this is the same special effect, repeated many times and at the end of the film, which was also made to death. I was hoping that before watching Hollow Man the topic of Invisible Man, which is not original in itself, will be the basis for something newer and more interesting. It is not so. It does not take long before the film turns into a well-known bath of blood and a mass of inept histrionics - the mound of film clusters so fast it's almost impressive. <br /> <br /> And besides, Kevin Bacon does a pretty useless job, and his supporting cast does not try their best. Good points may be the good result of Jerry Goldsmith (but without rivalry for better efforts), quite interesting use of thermal images and special effects. I was tempted to give this film three out of ten, but the effects have raised the merit of Hollow Man to one degree. <br /> <br /> 4/10
