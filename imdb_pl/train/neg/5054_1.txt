We know that firefighters and rescuers are heroes: a few idée reçue would be a challenge. Friends and family of those and others who died in the attacks on the World Trade Center could be moved by this wicked art that became a film. A sweet, serious, although attached to the language, a firefighter remembers what a depressed journalist may lose with his colleagues who transforms his fragments into praise. They are considering the results. Mumbles a little more, composes another praise, etc., etc. Dreadful events that have provoked the need for several thousand praise are overwhelmingly sad, but this bland staging is disturbingly boring.
