OK director rewrites LOVE ACTUALLY Director Nikhil Advani after the debut with KHNH doing the other half and waiting <br /> <br /> Does 3:30 hours + movie that loses patience, time.etc The viewer seems to be 3 hours of sleep watching this movie <br /> <br /> They had 6 floors, so it was necessary, but why? 6 stories? <br /> <br /> We have a convincing story of Anil-Juhi, but the boring TV series do not show such stories? <br /> <br /> We have the story of Govinda-Shannon, which is fun and works well <br /> <br /> We know the story of Akshaye-Ayesh, but soon becomes boring and we focus more on comedy and this boring comedy boring <br /> <br /> We have the history of Salman-Priyanka, which is the worst, not only conceptual, it does not make any sense <br /> <br /> We have the story of Sohail-Isha, which will make you laugh and the trick sometimes works thanks to the boredom determined by most other stories <br /> <br /> We have the story of John-Vidya with a good story in every respect <br /> <br /> But then, when all stories appear in pieces n, the viewer is Bored and sleepy The climax, however, is not appealing especially the culmination of Salman-Priyanka's history. Nikhil Advani is doing well in some places, some stories are well treated, but weak in places Music (SEL) is good, but too many songs The cinematography is pretty, each the story is given a different look, texture and works <br /> <br /> Actors Govinda rock, after dismissive return from BB really makes you laugh and love him in this movie, despite his age and weight Anil Kapoor plays well his role looks out of style and tired John excels in his role, Akshaye Khanna abuses changes <br /> <br /> Sohail Khan is too exaggerated, and Isha has nothing to do Anjana Suknani is absolved <br /> <br / > Priyanka and Salman deserve the award for this film, which you are shocked by? <br /> <br /> Salman Khan does not just work, he just speaks as if he was in a dream and this false accent of God, Priyanka, he's so standard that you feel like throwing something at her, she's getting better at the end of Vidya Balan is good, Juhi Chawla is alright, Shannon is alright
