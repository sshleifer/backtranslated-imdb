For the first three seasons Fairly Odd Parents was just as tasty as hard candy, bright, sweet and addictive. Now it's as tasty as Pepto-Bismol. And unfortunately, Pepto-Bismol is what you will need after seeing the last episodes in which all the sweetness has been replaced by insults and violence, resulting in a lack of laughter. Cosmo, once one of Nick's more endearing characters, transformed into an abusive moron whose family Guy cast would not even want to know. Timmy became a selfish arrogant jerk that Bart Simpson would happily defeat the snot (and given Timmy's snottiness, it would require a lot of beating). And poor Wanda ... a real sorceress who has become a victim of her husband and godson, now she is called "naked" for caring for the good of others. Plus, Cosmo's stupidity causes pain for everyone else, but he is never punished for it, and no lesson is taught. What exactly summarizes Butch Hartman's attitude towards children: they are primitive, vulgar and not very clear. Thank God this rotting finger was canceled along with darling Butch Hartman, Danny Phantom. At least Butch got what he deserved - unlike Cosmo.
