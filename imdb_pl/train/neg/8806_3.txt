How has this "Being There" riposte ever been so loved? People say it is proof that a decent, honest person can succeed despite the lack of intelligence. They are wrong. The film is proof that happiness is everything: hope your friend will invest all the money in Apple, not in Atari; Hope your shrimp boat is the only one at sea when the storm breaks down; hope that you will not die of shock when, fortunately, you will be shot in the buttocks and not in the back; I hope you will not get AIDS from your wife. This film is also politically reactionary - all who rebel against social convention, lose their feet, do drugs, beat girls or die young. In addition, placing the product in this film (Nike and Dr. Pepper) is shameless. An emotionally manipulating film, very, very empty.
