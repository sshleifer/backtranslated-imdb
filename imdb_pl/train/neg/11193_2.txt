OK, I did not have high expectations, but this movie coming down into the depths that I could not imagine. <br /> <br /> The plot, as it was, concerned a priest from an unknown 2-person order examining the death of the founder of the order by Sin Eater. The eater of sins allows Catholics to achieve salvation outside the authority of the Church and is another immortal film with a lot of boredom. It does not matter if it does not make sense, since the Baptist can give you salvation ... we'll go further. <br /> <br /> I will spread the story without giving much: the priest goes to Rome with his buddy to invest. He brings with him a mental patient (I do not invent it) who shot him during eccentricity and who loves him (no explanation was given to licking this BTW), a drunk Irish priest and Peter Weller as a cardinal. They come to Rome, find some scary kids who do nothing in the film, meet with slaves S & M, pope who drunk Irish knows (he did not explain) and who gives information killing people (oh, BTW, he's a bad guy, so he has a path sound industrial / techno), and then ... umm, seriously, I'm not sure. the plot revolves around. Heath shudders from Sin Eater, flies to New York with Sin Eater for an overnighter, and then something else happens, and then (outside the camera) the antipope falls down and the movie ends. <br /> <br /> After 1 hour of the movie I really wonder if something happened. At the end, something happened, but you can not be sure it matters, and because most of the drama takes place before moves or off-scren, you really feel cheated.
