Although the film takes place at the "Ivy League" college, it was actually filmed in northern Arizona, mainly at the University of North Arizona at Flagstaff in the fall of 1976. I was involved in the theater department and most of the additions in the film are then members of the theater department. <br /> <br /> In this movie is a totally absurd scene (if you know Arizona's geography), which shows several cast members riding bicycles from college to brook. We, NAU'ers, know that the campus and the stream (in fact Oak Creek Canyon) are about 35 miles apart and while the journey is downhill, you literally CAN NOT ride a bike the same way!
