After a few lean years, 1968 was a quite swelling time for Elvis: not only did he create the famous "Comeback" TV Special, but also became a father and played in two quite decent movies? SPEEDWAY and LIVE A LITTLE, LOVE A LITTLE. Therefore, personally, I can forgive him for this error, which was STAY AWAY, JOE, which at best emerges as an interesting mistake and is not so bad considering it. Sure, Burgess Meredith and Joan Blondell are really embarrassing? as the stupid Indian father of the Elvis hero and the bawdy bartender who also has the eye on Mr. Presley - but he is happy that Elvis is surrounded by a leading Hollywood talent veteran, such as Katy Jurado (as Mexican wife Meredith), two Jones? Henry and L.Q. - and Thomas Gomez, who is particularly funny as the sarcast Stormtrooper, who is the stubborn father of Meredith, who still wears his old chief clothes today! <br /> <br /> While it is surprising (if not welcome, given their usual vagueness) lack of songs, it seems that there is no shortage of free events for all, when men Indians constantly hit the bottle, while Presley he practices his feminine skills behind his back! As you might expect, the typical "western" scenery of Arizona is a great asset here, and the sleepy, hoarse gag of a bull is not only a good one, but the main point of the plot. On the other hand, the culmination of the "destruction of the house" is one that we have seen too often and does not work very well here ...
