I love low-budget independent films and I have high hopes for that. But this movie is static. It does not matter the value of production, which is very noble for its budget, but the pace is deadly. I must admit that these people achieve a lot thanks to the small, but the movie fails at the most basic level. This is boring. The editing is post-glacial and the staging stands. This should be 65 minutes. The best thing about Dr. Jekyll is Mr. Hyde, who can hardly be seen. He had the most dramatic potential. Instead, we must suffer through the raging Britons of Baltimorean, crossing through an endless and tiring exposition. He feels like playing on the parochial stage, devoted to video. <br /> <br /> The noble efforts of everyone in production, but a story that was so tired, required kicking in the pants and funky new low-tech technology, should give her a fresh voice. Instead, this is just a lame retread.
