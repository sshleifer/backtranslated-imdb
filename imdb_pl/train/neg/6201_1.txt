I saw it. This is not "good" but interesting in a understated way. The boys in it are quite naturalistic, but ................ the graphic scene / unjustified final gang rape is repulsive and -oh yes-the arbitrary insertion of material from the Second World War is an offensive way, how he tries to compare a real horror with this misogynist idea. True cruelty is real - this movie is simply awful. However, the movie has a look that can draw you in. But it seems to me that this is the "New Emperor's Clothing", but in fact the opposite is true. The movie looks good, but the direction, history, content and final feeling you receive from this movie are empty. If the feeling can be empty - that's it.
