Because it's Jane Parker, whose long-lost father of anthropologist (Richard Harris, in the worst role in a very inconsistent career), is studying something in Africa. He follows him (how?) And he talks about the natives' stories about a giant monster whose nocturnal howling can be heard in the jungle. It turns out that it is Ape Man himself (Miles O'Keeffe, who has the best dialogue in the film) who saves her from bad people and falls in love with her, leaving them enough time in this painful two-hour nudity when the horny monkey looks and cheers. Usually I am very open to different opinions about each film, but this is the only exception. This is the worst film ever made. If you disagree, you did not see it. (Notes: Newsday called it "unbearable", which is the best one-word summary I can think of, and Maltin commented that they almost had to think about a lower rating than BOMB).
