I do not know where to start. This film seems very similar to one of those cheap shows of children on Saturday morning, which they did back in the late eighties in the early nineties. Like Captain Power or Power Rangers. It's full of bad digital overlays and really bad-sounding "secret agencies" and villains. <br /> <br /> Acting is so bad that it's not even funny. The direction is terrible and the continuity is small. It seems that someone just dropped a few scenes and forgot that there was to be a conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the most absurd scenes in the film appears early when several villains plant an explosive device in the agents' car. For some reason, although the device is clearly referred to as "remotely detonated", bad guys decide to race on motorcycles when they leave. This pursuit continues. all the time with bad people doing absurd and completely meaningless bicycle acrobatics. Standing on bicycles, riding on wheels and so on. At some point, an accident occurs and one of the attackers is thrown out of the bike, we see a bike (clearly cgi) thrown on the car of agents, but the rider has disappeared. Then, a few seconds later, the rider and bike come back ... apparently untouched by the catastrophe. At this point, although there is an explosive device in the car, the attackers choose to shoot the agent while driving and then blow up the car. Which was also clearly done with cgi. Sounds misleading? It is like the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I can point out that when I say cgi, we're not talking about Lord Of The Rings. We're talking about a cheap cheesy Power Rangers cgi, actually I think it would be better at Power Rangers. <br /> <br /> Why Savini and Todd made this movie that I will never know, I can only assume that he did for money, as a favor for someone or because they were blackmailed to him ... probably the last one.
