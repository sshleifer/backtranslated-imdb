As a child, I thought that the weapon used by the murderer was cool, but I was a child, so I was a bit stupid. Even a stupid kid, though the plot of the movie was stupid and a bit boring, when the killer did not use his light knife to kill people. It amazes me that the film has a really solid cast. What scenario they read, agreeing to participate in this film, because it is certainly boring and only a way to show a light saber on a very small scale. The story is sometimes incomprehensible, and the end is completely chaotic. The whole film seems to revolve around strangers and one weapon. The plot has two children and some guy who met with strangers, years later and it seems that there was a return in the mix. Dead animals and those that need to be investigated and for some reason one guy gets an alien weapon and uses it to go through a very light madness of killing. Seriously, you just have to think about why this movie was made if you're going to have a killer, have a good death scene, if you're going to meet strangers, show more than a strange light whirl and if you're going to have light sabers, then call yourself star wars.
