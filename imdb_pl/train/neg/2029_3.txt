I do not see a sufficient number of game shows to understand the attractiveness of SHOW ME THE MONEY, but I suppose that it attracts the attention of the less demanding recipients. Apparently the quiz show offers participants huge amounts of money to answer a few simple questions. However, its elements of the quiz play only a small role in the proceedings, which I consider to be complicated. For example, before answering, the participant chooses the question to be asked, choosing from the random options "A", "B" or "C". Is it for other purposes than slowing down the game? It would be much faster to start with "A." Players can ask questions, but they must answer one of three questions in each category. <br /> <br /> After answering the question, the participant is asked to "block" the answer - another delay tactics. The next task of the competitor is to indicate which woman from around a dozen go-go dancers in the cages is to reveal the card, which indicates how much the question is worth. The correct answer adds the dollar value of the card to the sum of the player's run; wrong answer subtracts the same sum. This time-consuming step has some entertainment value because it allows the audience to look at the scantily clad and evenly beautiful dancers. Meanwhile, the participant is reminded that the unlucky choice of the "killer card" will end the game immediately. This naturally causes the athlete to sweat and cause further delays because the nervous player is considering a sudden loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars. I suspect that the possibility of a sudden catastrophe is the main attraction of the audience. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the whole process is further slowed down by many empty curses between the host William Shatner and the player, along with occasional actions performed by the dancers in cages. All these delays burn so much time that the public can forget what the original question is before the correct answer is revealed. <br /> <br /> A typical 30-minute section of JEOPARDA often passes 60 questions. The first 30 minutes of SMTM, which I watched, filled only six questions (many of which related to other television programs). Nobody in their right mind would watch this program because it's fun to answer questions at home. This leaves three reasons for watching the program. <br /> <br /> A. To see how a player reacts to getting even a million dollars, all you have to do is lose everything with just one stroke. <br /> <br /> B. To look at wonderful young women performing sexually suggestive dance procedures. <br /> <br /> C. To enjoy William Shatner's brilliant teasing. <br /> <br /> My choice is "B", but women are not in the camera long enough to justify suffering for an hour of this concert.
