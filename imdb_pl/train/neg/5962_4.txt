Paul Naschy made a lot of horrors. In terms of quality, they range from very good to unobservable garbage; and unfortunately Horror Rises from Tomb is closer to the latter. The plot is just your average witch or sorcerer's story (or in this case) of a sorcerer who gets killed - but not before swearing revenge on those who did it ... etc. Then we get a s√©ance and one thing leads to the other, and soon the lost sorcerer is not good again. The plot is slow, painfully boring, and the film still does not make sense. Characters draw reams of diatribe and never serve the film in any way. Paul Naschy wrote the script, and if you ask me, he should stick to the game, because dialogue is banal in the extreme and only serves to make the film even more boring than it really is. Carlos Aured, who also directed Naschy in Blue Eyes of the Broken Doll and Curse of the Devil, provides here a boring direction that likes dialogue does not help the film. Sometimes such nonsense films have a certain charm; but horror movies do not even have it. It is a painfully boring movie that has little or no interest.
