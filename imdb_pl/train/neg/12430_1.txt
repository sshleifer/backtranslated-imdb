Home Alone 3 is one of my least favorite movies. It's a crop cream, or s ***, if you have a tendency to be more cynical, because it's down there (or down) with things like Battlefield Earth and Flinstones: Viva Rock Vegas. In fact, it could have been even worse than the two, because those two, at least on and off, were laughing at their stupidity. It just made me constantly scared of pain and clap when the loans began to roll. No other film forced me to pain. Now I will show you exactly why this movie is so horrible. <br /> <br /> First of all, the plot is ridiculous. It revolves around a chip in a remotely controlled car (?!), Which is lost and how these terrorists want it. Stupid things. <br /> <br /> The action that happened is similar to the other two Home Alones, with boobytrapami and everything, but watching these boobytraps is rather fun, unbelievably unpleasant. I did not laugh (or even smile as much as I did) once, and I was still cowering and hoping the terrorists would bump the child. The bird, instead of providing comic relief, was unpleasant and irritating. <br /> <br /> Acting, as done by a group without names, ranges from poor to cruel. There is no good performance here. Alex D.Linz is absolutely unlike himself and unaware of a child, while the terrorists are acting (and judging from their films, they look), because they were hastily elected from the street ... and well, that's all. <br /> <br /> I see that some people say: "Man, it's for children. Well MAN, children can like it, but they can get a lot more. See Monsters Inc. and Toy Story before you consider it. Hell, even Scooby Doo and Garfield (who suck - see these reviews for more) are better than this! <br /> <br /> In short, it's an incredibly horrible movie. This was clearly converted into money, because it almost completely breaks the first two; the only thing is that it completely offends the first two. No man, child or other should find any reason to see Home Alone 3. Ever. It's so bad. <br /> <br /> 0/5 stars
