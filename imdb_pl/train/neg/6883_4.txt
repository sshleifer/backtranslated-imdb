I am from Puertorican origin, had a mixed fill of this "document". At first I felt offended that Mrs Perez compared Senor Campos to Che Guevarra. Also just a fact, sir. John Leguzaimo does not come from Puertorican. His parents came from Colombia. Whoever conducted the research on this subject was not very accurate. I feel that the future of our breed is based on education. This message should resound throughout the movie. Education is our way to freedom and power. I think that any future efforts of this production team should make this their goal.
