It's very fun to watch "Beretta Island" as a kind of natural trash can. It's like an answer to the type of b-movie by Jess Franko. Bodybuilders are striking (! Face to face!) In pushers. A very, very stupid strike! : unbelievably bad scenes with fire (shooting) look even better than melee. Funny ridiculous scenes. Saving beauty scenes incredibly stupid. The erotic scenes are very non-erotic. t miss: Arnold Schwarzenegger's joke at the beginning of the film and Franco Columbu's list of relatives at the end. Special attraction: naked breasts. Unforgettable - Franco can sing!
