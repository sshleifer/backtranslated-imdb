This movie is one of the worst nonsense I've ever seen. I literally got acute pain in my head while watching this movie. CGI was terrible, and history was just a waste of ink. Dean Cain's character was Mr-Super-Intuitive-I-can-think-anything, except that it does not seem to work properly with his own helicopter. The biggest problem was working with cameras on a split screen. I felt like I was watching Brady or something like that, except that there were no different people in the boxes, only approximations and different views of the same. I can only say that the actors really needed money because this movie was not worth the movie on which it was filmed.
