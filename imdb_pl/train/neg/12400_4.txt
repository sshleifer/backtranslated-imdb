Matt Cordell returned from the dead for the third round, although I'm not sure if anyone cared about it, except the furious fans of MANICA COP. Cordell, who died in the last movement, was resurrected by voodoo, and now he is hot on the trail of several rogues taking part in the shooting of colleague officer Cordell, whom he likes very much. I missed being part of this low budget from the early 90s, but it was nice to see Cordell make up his body counting on various macabre ways. The problem is that the whole movie is quite static, and Cordell is simply not Jason or Freddy. Interest disappears quite quickly, even when this great B movie master, Robert Forster, is a doctor whose brain is mixed up. Stick to the first movie in the series, which is fun and frightening, and at the same time exciting.
