Spoiler !! I love Branagh, I love Helena Bonham-Carter, I loved them together in "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" - but TO - <br /> <br /> I understand the actor's desire to stretch to avoid a romantic stereotype. Well, they did, but really - the script sounded unconscious, Bonham-Carter's clothes were elegant, and sporadic accelerated "crazy" sequences could be the result of the Beatles movie, or the old Rowan and Martin Laugh- W. <br /> <br /> I never understood - other commentators say Branagh's character was a dreamer. I never felt it. He was a loser and not very bright, and certainly not endearing. The case of dressing up on bank robbers was simply painful. It is certainly not fun. <br /> <br /> Realistic (as it seems) Bonham-Carter's attempts as a realistic speech were harder to understand than the first 15 minutes of Lancashire's accent in "Full Monty." <br /> <br /> The poetic end, with him high on the hill with her buried under the monstrosity of his plane, was too arranged. Was there a chorus of angels or just a soundtrack? <br /> <br /> Return to the classics or something with your backbone and arch. Give this to PBS. <br /> <br />
