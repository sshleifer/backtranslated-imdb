Despite the fact that he was a huge fan of the films of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, only 6 years ago I saw "Follow the Fleet" for the first time. I knew all the songs from the old Astaire / Rogers album (yes, vinyl), but I did not know anything about the story. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, while the songs are catchy and the character Ginger Rogers is sweet and funny, I just do not like "Bake Baker". Trying to make up for a longtime partner, he is constantly sabotaging his career. His character does not have the usual humor and elan of other heroes of Astaire movies. <br /> <br /> It's worth to watch the songs and the great solo procedure of Ginger Rogers.
