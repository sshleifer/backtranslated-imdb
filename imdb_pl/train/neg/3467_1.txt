The cover of this movie is named Kyle Minogue, but it has the same purpose as Drew Barrymore in "Scream". This is the first thing that makes this movie bad; they try to launch a movie with someone who is in it for 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Of course, we must have this movie with young, trendy college kids who do not realize that a killer is around. On top of everything, Molly Ringwald from the 80's film celebrity is the star of this beautifully written movie. It's a good move for Molly to make some money for a shitty movie in Australia so she does not laugh at the states. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this stupid movie is about a stupid horror movie that was never over, because that stupid creature is killing everyone who's in it. We should guess who the killer is throughout the movie. In short, remember our little friend Molly, who saves the day ... is she? <br /> <br /> This move is just bad, borrow it if you want to torture yourself or just break it to the floor of your local video store if you see it on the shelf. Do not spread the horror movie.
