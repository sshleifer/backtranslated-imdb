Swayze does not convince Alan Quatermain. In comparison to Stewart Granger; growing up was my greatest hero in films like Scaramouche in 1952, Zarys Prison in 1952 and King Solomon's Mines in 1950; Patrick Swayze completely fails. Even the portrait of older Alan Quatermain Sean Connery in "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" was very good at another big flop. Also, Alison Doody has no grace Deborah Kerr as the lead lady, and the impressive Siriaque in the role of Umbopy makes it very difficult for everyone to fill his (shoes) !!! For someone who was disappointed with the version of Richard Chamberlain in 1985, now I highly recommend it if you can not get a hand in the granger version.
