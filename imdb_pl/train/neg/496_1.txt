Imagine you're a high school boy, at the back of a dark, uncrowded theater with his girlfriend. How bad would a movie be to make you feel compelled to leave the theater and return home before the end? This movie is so bad. Really. Films often become so bad that they are good; this film is beyond this stage of evil. This is painfully bad. Terribly, terribly, the crime against humanity is bad.
