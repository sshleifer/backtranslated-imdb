Acting was not great, the story was full of simplified phrases and transparent characters. It is about the repercussions of the struggle between right-wing Flemish block voters on the one hand and the Moroccon people living in the Belgian city of Antwerp on the other. Is this a political analysis? Is it some Belgian West Side Story or modern Romeo and Juliet? The film is simply not strong enough to answer both questions (assuming that these were also the director's questions). Nevertheless, some scenes could function as a kind of Ken Loach film in Antwerp. After all, this city was the starting point of an extremist right-wing Flemish party and is struggling with many problems and tensions between different populations and cultures. It is very difficult to make a film about this situation, which unfortunately is not successful. Nevertheless, he tells a story about a very real and complicated situation in today's Belgium. Few foreign viewers should try and enjoy it and realize that this is not a real movie that is important, but the social divisions behind it haunt Belgium, 10 million people in the country in 2000. <br /> <br /> Dries Van Dongen
