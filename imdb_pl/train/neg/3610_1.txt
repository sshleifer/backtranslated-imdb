The patient escapes from the psychiatric hospital, killing one of his guardians, and then the university professor after he goes to the local college. In the next semester the deputy of the late prof. And a new group of students must deal with the new homicide party. Dialogue is so trivial that it's hard to believe that I could predict lines in quotes. This is one of those cheap films that have been collected in the middle of the 80s slasher era. Although the heroine is killed, it is simply not the best garbage. Horrible acting, horrible scenario, horrible effects, horrible terrible horrible !! "Splatter University" is just a bit of a worry to put in a VCR when you have nothing better to do, although I suggest you watch your cleaner tape that would be more fun. Skip him and rent "Girl's Nite Out" instead. <br /> <br /> Rated R for strong graphic violence, profanity, short nudity and sexual situations.
