I just rented (yes! I paid the money to see!) This movie. OH MY GOD. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. As other reviewer, Mrs. Colagrande put it, leave the movies, PLEASE! Please, never create or appear in another movie! You have the charisma of a cantaloupe. No, it's not fair to the cantaloupe who probably has more to do. He can not act; it affects the disgusting look all the time (she reminded me of my always disgusted young brother-in-law from Europe). It is not cute; it's not pretty. There is no real story. 1st edition! There was no what I saw! It's bad when you watch a movie and just to go through it, push "forward" on the remote, and NEVER do anything! It means! ..... I involuntarily shouted "Cut! Cut! "What were they thinking? Well, of course they thought they would make a movie together and PAY to make love on the screen! Quite a good deal for them; fairly strict offer for the viewer! I think I will toss now ...
