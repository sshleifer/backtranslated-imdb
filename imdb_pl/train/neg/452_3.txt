I watched this movie for a project about love. tell Nicolas Cage to find out what it would be like to be his character, then read the lines he says again. My life can not go on ... I accidentally cut off my arm ... my brother was close. Of course, his fault. And because happy endings included a nice guy who looks after a sad and lonely mother. No closing, bad script, and there is not enough extension for smaller characters. Save yourself unless you laugh. The costumes were made accordingly, and the accessories did a fantastic job. I'm sure it would be a nice movie to do, but to be more specific to the genre, I can not recommend this movie to anyone I know, because it's not an intellectual film. This is not a chicks. This is not strict romantic. And I can not show children because of sex and questions to follow. All in all, this is not a good move.
