Oh man, this movie is bad. It's terribly flowing. The story of a racing car driver who is in love with himself and then has to promote a fast food chain for chickens and while he does not love himself. He tries to get out of the contract and comes to horrible, painfully unlucky gags. Jim Nabors looks like he's sleepwalking, does not work. You miss Burt's helpers like Dom Deluise and Jerry Reed while watching this smelly one. Loni Anderson's hair is downright frightening, which proves that tons of hairspray did not disappear in the sixties. Or maybe it was a wig. By the way, Burt's wig was not bad in this movie. His worst "day of the wig" was "Smokey and the Bandit 2". In any case, this movie is Reynolds' worst movie car ever with "Cannonball Run 2". The original "Smokey" and "Cannonball" (and "Hooper", which fortunately did not have a continuation) are great, funny movies. This one is not. Even Ned Beatty, who is a great actor, stinks. You will miss a villain like Jackie Gleason who is hateful. And remember, this is not one of those fun movies you can find. It's bad, clean and simple. Even the dumps at the end were tiresome and boring, and worst of all, indecent. At least I forgot that "Stroker Ace" was one of the first heavy nails that sealed Burt's coffin before its somewhat reborn years in "Boogie Nights", another film that, like "Deliverance" many years earlier, shows that a man can work quite well when he has a decent platform for it.
