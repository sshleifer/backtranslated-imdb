It's not just that it's a bad movie; not only that four of the "best" Mexican filmmakers are in this film; and it's not just that the script is terrible. It's just ... this movie sucks ... it's a great time. These people are wasting money in terrible scenarios. He's supposed to criticize the Mexican society, but we've got enough of that kind of movie. Is bad language supposed to be funny? I do not understand this. Mexican cinema is in big trouble if such films continue (and will be written and produced). <br /> <br /> Please, do not think that these kinds of movies are well received in Mexico: We hate them and do not reflect us.
