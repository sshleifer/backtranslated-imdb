This movie is frightening. A decent battle scene or not, the action is REALLY bad, how can you say that they read their lines from the card. With a painful delivery of the line by everyone in the cast. Think about watching the game in high school and leaning on the obvious lack of fluidity in the actor's interactions (strange breaks between the lines of different characters, combined with the speedy delivery of lines by others). If the movie was an action, it can be forgivable, but many movies contain a story configuration and Family Guy style, disrespectful cuts (Oh, wow, are they badly done). I assume that they tried to be funny with them, but again appeared as a group of high school / college students who went out in the afternoon, trying to create a fun clip on Youtube. <br /> <br /> Now for battle scenes. They are not so bad considering the level of quality seen elsewhere in the film. Nothing great, certainly not near the same level as other posters (Nothing like Drunken Master). Fights have a too staged atmosphere, and MUCH cuts at different angles with grossly different positions on the part of the involved. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the only reason for watching this movie is that you were one of his friends involved in this very, very cheap production. What guy can you ask? Oh, the same guy who wrote, directed, produced and looked at this masterpiece of high school.
