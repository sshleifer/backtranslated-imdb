The document revolves around Eva Mozes Kor, a survivor of the Holocaust, part of Mengele's experiments on twins, consisting mainly of her version of what happened at Auschwitz, and the comparison of the emotions of other survivors from twin experiments. The film, of course, had great reviews. This is one of those topics that nobody dares to say otherwise. <br /> <br /> I too, for the most part of the movie, drew in the emotions that the creator of the film so clearly wanted the viewer to focus on. One of the users' opinions on IMDb by Eric Monder (obviously having nothing critical to say about it on the public forum) could find only the sweetest nectar. "In one of many dramatic sequences, when a group of Jews argues with Kor in the Jewish center, the meaning of the word" forgive "is even discussed, but isolated and outnumbered Kor has his own" But until then dissatisfied with the fact that the film had mine dormant emotional repertoire, freed enough that once again I saw clearly. After "strong will" Eva Kor forgives "Nazi hijackers" the film begins to delve into what is at stake in forgiveness, at least from Kor's point of view. The film follows her, passing her public statement forgiving the Nazis and the new territory. For me it was the meat of the film, surrounded by the inedible fat of her "act of forgiveness." Of course, she was a very sick cow. <br /> <br /> During her mission to check her theory of forgiveness to heal the wounds of the past, she goes to the "Promised Land" to meet with some Arabs to discuss with them the problems they face and see if dialogue can not lead to a better understanding of the situation and strongly permeate debates and discussions with Jews in the USA about her forgiveness to the Nazis, including the Jews in the center of Chicago. From now on, anyone who does not have such a tearful eyes that he can not see the screen will have difficulty to skip the obvious contradiction in her statements. <br /> <br /> First of all, you immediately notice her body language, defensive and do not want to listen in a room full of Arab scholars and teachers. Her comments on how she feared they might be kidnapping her show how much waste of time, effort and money was all over. Pretty irritated, Dr. Sami Advan (professor of education at the University of Bethlehem) is right when he tells Kor that he prefers to sleep in his apartment. <br /> <br /> Finally, the debate in the Jewish center in Chicago, where it is "grilled" about the meaning of forgiveness and its right to it, following those who continue to suffer from the trauma of deeds. <br /> <br /> will go to the pursuit. At the end of the movie, I was hoping that I did not choose to watch the movie. The film was badly made, without going deep into anything about Auschwitz except purely trivial, it is enough to make sure that the Holocaust is refreshed in the memory of viewers and causes an explosion of tears. This showed that Kor, the subject of the document, was unable to engage in honest discussion. Her ability to discuss was limited to parroting her position on forgiveness (at best) for total dislike of listening or attending. <br /> <br /> Finally, are everyone so late that they can not see the difference between making peace and forgiving? To quote another IMDb user: "I do not think that her forgiveness is weak - on the contrary, she simply wanted to free herself from the soul, she wanted her suffering to end, so she let go." That would be a perfect definition of a layman for PEACE. <br /> <br /> I think that in the world of propaganda, blind faith and political correctness, there is no room for questioning those who "have gone through more than a human mind can explore." <br /> <br /> PS The dictionary should certainly be included in all the lists that everyone is buying.
