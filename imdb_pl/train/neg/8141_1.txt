Watching It Lives By Night makes you wonder who in the world shines this nonsense. Newlyweds steam on honeymoon, they are attacked by bats, and the husband starts to run in pajamas attacking different people. Where are they exactly? They are in the desert, then they go skiing, and then they are in a small town that looks like it has mountains nearby. The city is run by a sheriff, who likes to watch and has a personal vendetta against a wretched doctor. The ski hospital is run by a really dangerous guy with a nice thick mustache, and the wife looks like Mary Tyler Moore or Marilyn Quayle. There is no dramatic tension and the end leaves anger. Special effects and makeup guru Stan Winston made the effects of this film. You must start somewhere.
