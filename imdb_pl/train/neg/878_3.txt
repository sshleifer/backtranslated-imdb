I can only believe that Garson Kanin had to be two people. The one who wrote the brilliant "A Double Life" and the funny "Born Yesterday", along with his wife Ruth Gordon, and then the one who wrote and / or directed such a tiring, sad nonsense as "Bachelor's Mother", "Some Kind Of A Nut "and this. The cast tries, but the script is so tired and stereotypical that even the efforts of the always great Brenda Vaccaro are overcome. The script plunges into nadir in a truly offensive sequence in which Janssen's character tests the character of Drivas to make sure he is not gay. An ugly sequence, but unfortunately one that could easily be played in the movie today. The "Ethnic" jokes are now completely full, but the "phage" jokes are still "good, clean, family".
