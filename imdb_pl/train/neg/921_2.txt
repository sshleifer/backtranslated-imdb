I rented this one to see Vanessa Talor again. He can act, but he has no chance in this cluster. The opening sequence is a sophisticated shot of a crane from mountain landscapes. It must come from the action archive because the movie is recorded directly on the video tape. The production values ​​make _Blair Witch_ look professional. There is a really bad animated statue, but there are no other effects worth noting. This movie is bad, but not funny. Players would not say good about their lives.
