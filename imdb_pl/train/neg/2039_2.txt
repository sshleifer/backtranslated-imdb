This movie was almost unbearable. I can go beyond the fact that it looks like it was filmed using a home video camera and that this movie is supposed to last for a few weeks, but the characters do not change their costumes, but the acting broke my fourth wall. I saw better action in the fourth-class game. In addition, the plot is unrealistic. If a man suspected a man who would get him involved. I was also very disappointed that all the killings were done with a weapon, what a gore. This is not a copycat that the Zodiac did not kill, using a weapon that the authorities would know was not him. Another thing that really worried me was that they called Disassociative Identity Disorder DSM 4, when the name of the book is used to diagnose people with mental disorders, not the name of the disorder. Overall, I think this movie is not a kind of movie that could be done at a low budget, at least not as low as they were, or they could be sure they have better actors or more gore. Lots of people chose a low-budget tour without the use of horrible actors, see Easy Rider, which had Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson and a low budget.
