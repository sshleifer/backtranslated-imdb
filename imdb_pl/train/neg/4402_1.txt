I usually love lesbian movies, even if they are not very good. I think I'm biased! <br /> <br /> But this is just the bottom. Yes, the scenery and buildings are beautiful, and there is a short but beautiful erotic interlude, but otherwise the movie is just a waste of time. Annamarie is intertwined with sulking and getting drunk on any drug or alcohol is handy, and Ella inexplicably endures this disgusting behavior throughout the movie. At no time do we have any insight into why it is, or even why Annamarie is so depressed and withdrawn. <br /> <br /> If there was at least some closure (potentially romantic? "I do not even know!" the relationship between them could be some satisfaction. But even though Annamarie at some point asks Ella "Why do you love me?" Ella does not even say that It is never clear if it is more than (badly behaving) Lesbian on a boring expedition with a simple woman. <br /> <br /> Even the interaction between two women and local people they meet on a trip that could be lively and informative, it is rather flat, boring and usually incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> There is one good joke in the film, although I'm sure it was unintentional. camp, they have a huge tent, beds, sleeping equipment, and even a table, chair and typewriter, and when they board the ferry, we see stacks of luggage, probably h, probably worn in the trunk of a small Ford! <br /> <br /> And throughout the movie we never see a single gas station, or any place that looks like it was somewhere to buy gasoline. Mostly they travel through endless kilometers of desert desert. Where did they get the fuel from? <br /> <br /> There may not be too many lesbian films, good or bad, but there are many more, and very few are worse. Leave it in the closet.
