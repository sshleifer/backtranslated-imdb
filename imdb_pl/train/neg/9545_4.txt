Will Farmer (Lanter) play a computer game that simulates a terrorist attack, and Ripley, a super-government computer designed to profile potential terrorists, follows him because Will borrowed (by hacking) some money from his neighbor's bank account to pay a class trip to the game chess in Philadelphia. A neighbor from the neighboring house whose computer Will has been repaired has relatives in the Middle East who send money to their neighbor's bank through their bank, and Ripley sees the terrorist connection. Ripley has the power to trigger rocket strikes. Oh, oh! <br /> <br /> This version of War Games has a much faster pace and more aggressiveness than the War Games movie in the early 80's. Nowadays, the electronics industry has much more to do. Makes sense. So the movie dazzles us with a fantastic CGI on the screens of computers, and when Joshua, the forerunner of Ripley, is launched, we are left to watch the computer on the computer, and people flinch, hoping praying. ohing, OMG-ing, and more hopeful that everything will go their way. In other words, we now have a "TV-made-to-order" movie and this is Oh Hum Time. Return to the 80s and watch the original War Games movie. It's much better. <br /> <br /> But we really have to ask ourselves: do we make computers too intelligent, where they will rule us one day, in time? Hmmm ?????? .. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.
