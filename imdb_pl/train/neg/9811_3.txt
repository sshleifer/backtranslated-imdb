What can I say??? This movie was so stupid and stupid I thought it was a comedy Psychotic DRAG - they should change their name to "Bitching Pregnant Cat Fight!" What a stupid waste of time if you want to see (DIE DIE !!! "I WANT YOU CHILDREN DRAG QUEEN) Jennifer Tilly she's her weird, then just rent one from the movie "Chucky", oh, "The Bride Of Chucky. "It's more fun watching Two Ugly Plastic dolls (one of them Jennifer Tilly turned into a UGLY female version of Chucky) that had Squeaky plastic rubber sex and then watching Daryl Hannah pregnant, stupid and stupid, Husbang in Food Robots reminded me that my mother is trying to do a house of work, OK, it's just BAD !!!
