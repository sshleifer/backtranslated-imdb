This is one of those movies that has an amazing video box, but it has a built-in Camra camera and unknown actors who speak with a bad dialogue. It is so dark when there are murders, it is difficult to see them, and the film is difficult to understand. it's Vanessa Sanchez from WCW (Tygres in WCW before submission) and is a good actress. I like a low-budget movie, especially one that has errors, because it's cool to watch, but Severed unfourtunly is not one of them. This movie is fine if you like voodoo and cut off your head, but it's not a hit, but if you need something new to watch, then rent Severed.
