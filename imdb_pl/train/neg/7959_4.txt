Andy Lau plays the next policeman story. Daniel Wu plays Nick, who works for cops, and is at the top of the drug dealing group (Lau). The film begins when we look at the police trying to make a bust of drugs to see how it breaks. Then we get acquainted with the young drug addict mother and her daughter living near Nick, his buddies and cops, and 45 minutes later I turned off the movie and turned on the news. It works well and looks great, it is as little involved in the movie I've seen for a long time. This is not a bad thing, because you do not really care. I mean, I really did not care. Actually, I started doing something completely different, forgetting about the movie with subtitles, if I did not care. I would like to be able to hate this movie, but the movie is so irrelevant that it did not make any impression on me (it is not even something that I could sleep to ignore). Come to the box, which is called the Chinese Scarface, what after his death? This should be avoided.
