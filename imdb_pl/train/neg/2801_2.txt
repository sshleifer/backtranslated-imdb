After the quasi-Gothic, fruit music video, the film starts with Cassidy, the singer who kills herself. In a perfect world that would be like that, and end credits would be cast. We do not live in this world. The boring members of the team decide to go to a clown to contact her dead creature. When I say a clown, I mean a real clown. He tells them that everyone will die because of Cassidy's ghost (the ghost has Dora, one of her teammates). We did not care that all characters are boring, boring and extremely terribly preserved. Written by Adam Hackbarth (an incredibly apropos surname, if it ever existed) and directed by Corbin Timbrook (who, after the Service and the Blood Tower, must know that he is still making nonsense), this film is a constant battle between the film's incompetence and the viewer's need to do not fall asleep. Not enough blood to calm the gore-hounds, nor enough nudity to satisfy the pervs. This film really has absolutely nothing to recommend to anyone. <br /> <br /> My class: F <br /> <br /> Eye candy: Amanda Carraway robi siÄ™ topless <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Starz on Demand
