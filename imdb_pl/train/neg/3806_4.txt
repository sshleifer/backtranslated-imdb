Both my wife and I thought this movie was a diluted, TV-produced (BBC) version of Manhattan Murder Mystery ... which is good, but not great. The story has little interpersonal tension or chemistry and little plot. Woody Allen's character just wanders around his mouth, and Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johannsson do not have much more to do. I must say it is quite disappointing. The role of Ian McShane is just an extended episodic look. <br /> <br /> The first thing that occurred to me was: "I wonder how much the BBC had to pay Woody Allen for removing him from Manhattan?" He needed money and needed his appeal to expand his audience outside the youth market attracting two stars. I give this film 4 stars instead of 3, because it is an unpleasant noise in the background. If you ever want to knit or sort your stamp collection, you'll do it. I would not pay for re-renting.
