This direct video is another nail to Rick Moranis's career coffin. Like the Disney tradition, quality is sacrificed in the name of a quick deposit; it is a lazy tread with accidental shrinking of Moranis and several relatives so that they can repeat all the best scenes from the original movie. Immediate dated visual effects and a dark dialogue abound in this tacky lamer who did nothing, but made me become a pine in "Incredible Shrinking Man" days when these things were done properly. Shockingly, this is driven by the best operator Dean Cundey, who should either stick to his daily work, or next time choose better material.
