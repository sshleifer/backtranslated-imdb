VERY boring, obvious, arduous scorching exorcists with Dobermann with red eyes - this is the range of special effects in this cheap release. Richard Crenna is as animated as a chewing toy. The dress and music from the '70s only add torture. You should sleep almost as quickly as "The Corpse Vanishes" or "The Blue Hand". Practically worthless. MooCow says eaghhh what a smelly dog! : = 8P
