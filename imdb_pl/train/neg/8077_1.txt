I saw this movie a long time ago ... luckily it was free. I have to be one of the twenty people who saw this movie in the theater. I do not remember all this, but I remember that I was very bored, the plot did not make sense, and when I left the theater, the only thing I could say was at least now, I know what the worst film I've ever seen. I was simply anxious about one thing: if they can make the temperature approach the sun low enough for people to survive, why could not they bring it down to a comfortable temperature instead of being hot and sweaty? How are they stupid?
