The first noticeable problem associated with this awkwardly titled movie is casting. Ann Nelson plays grandma here. Three years later she will play in the "Airplane!" As a woman who hangs herself listening to Robert Hays's pine trees for Julie Hagerty. I could not bring this picture out of my head. <br /> <br /> Matt Boston is fifteen years old with problems. He has headaches. His mother had a nervous breakdown. His grandfather had a huge heart attack. A psychiatrist who smokes online decides to find out what the devil is doing with this family. First, he hypnotizes Grandma Nelson. Nelson tells the story in a flashback that fills the entire first half of the movie. <br /> <br /> She and my grandfather bought RV, cheap and went to all tourist traps in desert California. RV soon has its own mind, leaving the road and so on. Then big boulders start to throw at him. The older couple is afraid, but stays in the vehicle to move the story. <br /> <br /> In the end my grandfather has a heart attack after he has been trapped on the roof of the RV when he is going through another unplanned drive. <br /> <br /> A mom from Boston starts talking to the mummies of Native American women who were at home. She is considered to be the author and makes extensive notes on the musty body. The psychiatrist reads detailed notes and uses his imagination to fill in the empty space. We see a half-divergent mother, but her mental breakdown appears off the screen, just like the Gramps heart attack. <br /> <br /> Finally, patient resistance, little Matt. Matt goes under the hypnosis gun and tells his own story. She thinks my mother is spinning (it was done in 1977). Apparently mom makes the astral bodies of the Native American mummies fly through the air. One hits Matt as the bee hits the windshield, and Matt begins to act like crazy. <br /> <br /> The psychiatrist takes his grandma and Matt to the desert. Matt is now inexplicably in a wheelchair, and the trio confronts the invisible (and unexplained) forces. <br /> <br /> Flocker has no idea about the construction of the stage. One pro is that the RV has been stuck in a salt apartment in the desert. In the distance, the couple are observing the boulders rolling towards the RV. It is quite a scary little scene that is finally overflowing. As the boulders begin to roll towards the vehicle, the special effects become obvious. <br /> <br /> Scenes where RV runs from the highway and then come back again, last forever. Scenes in which the grandfather is trapped on the roof of the RV, when he goes down a dirt road, last forever. The conversations we have with the mummy last forever. Matt's out-of-body experiences last forever. This film lasts forever. <br /> <br /> I was tempted to press the fast scroll button at least a dozen times. As the scenes stretched, it was obvious that Flocker was full. Cut off the fat here, and it will take an hour. The final "explanation" that the ghosts of the mummy tried to kill their close ones, never holding water. Did they live in an RV? The creator never reveals the fact that ghosts are not good at their murderous ways, they never kill anyone! <br /> <br /> When I thought about Nelson in "The Plane!", I was also thinking about other films. Anything that will keep me from falling asleep during this. Boston is terrible like this kid, playing a fifteen year old as a pretty ten-year-old who has a wise line for all those adults who fall in love with him. <br /> <br /> Finally Flocker wrote and directed the mess. The title is just the beginning of this exercise, which makes the audience feel uncomfortable. It's not scary, and like the ghosts, you can still walk ... away from the tape in the video store. <br /> <br /> It is invaluable and contains some physical violence and mild vulgarisms.
