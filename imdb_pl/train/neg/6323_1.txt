This film is a bad memory from my childhood. This is one of those movies that show children on a rainy day at school, when you can not go out for a break and prefer to watch everything, ANYTHING. At least that was when I was in primary school. I just remember the BOOK of this movie. That's true, I have not seen him for about 15 years and probably do not use it on rainy days anymore, but I just want to warn everyone: it would be better if you used your son to sleep than to entertain them. Trust me, choose something else. Although the subject is controversial, the conspiracy is so familiar and slow that I can not remember anything about it, except that I did not like it so much that here, 15 years later, I felt the need to warn you all before.
