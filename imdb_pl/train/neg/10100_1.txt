I usually support independent art and try to be very versatile and tolerant ... I try to support everyone because their efforts are worth ... <br /> <br /> but this movie just goes away from understanding <br /> <br /> imagine the following situation: <br /> <br /> 1. think REALLY the worst horror you have ever seen in your life. <br /> <br /> 2. think about some great, attractive art for this DVD movie ... and a promising story ... <br /> <br /> 3. voil√†! you have ZOMBIE NATION. <br /> <br /> see it only if you really have nothing better to do. Everything is better.
