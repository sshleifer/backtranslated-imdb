"Welcome to Collinwood" is a kind of disaster. Considering the people involved, it should be many times better. <br /> <br /> Watching this, if you are at least a little attached to the belief that it will be better, it will probably make you cry. It's one of those movies that had the potential, but he was deprived of this potential thanks to the horrible script and the bad actors, not to mention the oddly annoying and unnecessary character of George Clooney and the guy who reminds me of Richard Dreyfuss, but who cares so not that I do not even want to know his name. <br /> <br /> The only salutary grace of the film is the strange vocabulary he introduces. From time to time I thought about it when I watched more criminal whims. This is the only reason I made film 3. The story is boring, the characters are neurotic, unnecessarily offensive and highly unlikely. They are in constant stressful stress and everyone is so annoying that I celebrated their obstacles. They shout at each other and curse. At best, dialogue is insipid and insultingly stupid. <br /> <br /> I think the blame for it is Steven "Traffic" Soderbergherabracadabrablahblah and George Clooney. They should be tried for war crimes if someone really remembers that nonsense long enough for them to care.
