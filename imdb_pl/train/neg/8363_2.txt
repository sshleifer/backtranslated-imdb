I gave him 2 instead of 1 because I think "Wild Wongo women" are worse. This is an exercise in patience. It's as if teeth were cleaned by an evil dental hygienist. There is no story. There is no logic. Certainly there are no activities (although the shark has a qualitative dialogue). We do not think about anything. We do not know how people got where they got. I am always amazed at how such things even come out. I agree with the previous writer that it is not even funny. I know. It's about 90 minutes that will fill up enough space in the DVD collection. It's like a paperweight. Or a bad picture you bought from hungry artists. Covers the slot in the wall.
