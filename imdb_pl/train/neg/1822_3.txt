Greetings from the dark again. What happened to the great Barry Levinson? He directed two of my favorite songs in "Avalon" and "Diner." He also had some great movies ("Rainman"), but he always provided something interesting ... until now. I think the worst thing you can say about comedy is that it's boring. "Jealousy" is the definition of boredom. I've never been a big fan of a pure smack ("Stupid and stupid"), I was stunned by how awful this movie is. There may be 2 giggles in all of this - if you can pay attention so long. The best part of the movie is the current gag of the title song by Redbone. If the film was written as well as the song, it would be livable. Rachel Weisz is a great actress and I realize that everyone wants to do comedies (even Julianne Moore), but the real world reveals one weakness. Amy Poehler, a member of the SNL cast, is usually above her in the role of a garbage dubbed the princess. The movie's disaster is Jack Black and Ben Stiller. The first job arrives at each other flashes with a promise, but then their chemistry disappears due to a weak scenario. This script is like most of the ideas of the character of Jacek Black - it is not a bad idea, but there is no hope of success.
