I know that nobody cares, but I do. This movie is historical for one reason. It is the unity of two heroes from two great sci-fi movies from the seventies. One is great and one is pretty bad. This wonderful one is really great, in fact it is the best. Bad is really bad, in fact it is the worst. Of course, I am referring to Star Wars, and this is Mark Hamill, also known as "Luke Skywalker", who is the hero of this film about a child who gets his Vette, and then goes to Vegas (at the helm) and after many adventures in the end it recovers. (Ever since he's been repairing cars, I think you can call him "Lube Skywalker"). Along the way, he meets a whore with a golden heart and ends the fight with the character played by Kim Milford, the hero of the science-fiction film from the seventies "Laserblast", which, as I mentioned earlier, the worst science fiction movie ever made. Milford plays the main thief, from whom Hamill must steal his car. I realize that nobody cares about this meeting of two great science-fiction characters, but I do. I must also say that this is one of the best / worst movies of all time. The acting of Mark Hamilla needs strength, the story requires intensive Jedi training, and the character of the whore played by Annie Potts may be the most annoying figure of all time, in every movie I've ever seen. But it is a funny movie to watch on weekends or on weekdays, late at night, very late. This is one of those movies that writhes, searches for something, but without finding it, while its goal is, just like free jazz, just to exist as it is. And so it is. What is not great, but you can not say it is not fun, because for an hour and a half you can feel cheated, but you will not feel cheated. So turn your mind off, relax and enjoy this tangled gem without any expectations and let your strength be always with you.
