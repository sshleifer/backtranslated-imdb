My favorite memory of this concert and band was that I met a group of my friends who are hating NBB and they had a big bonfire and we took a CD with their songs and a DVD with a movie and some photos of the band members and threw them into the fire and danced happy jig around burning things, singing "Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead." It was the best thing about this series, and this show is stupid with a god-capital that sucks. I hate it so much. Get rid of a bad car. You're really sucking! You really ruined the whole channel! No offense or something else, but you have to live, I mean, really, who's making a silly concert with a stupid vocalist who does not even sing! You really sound awful and you need life like a hobo or something, except Roselina. She is really pretty. But you're still praying!
