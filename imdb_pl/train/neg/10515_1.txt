Well, it's a typical movie "straight to the toilet". <br /> <br /> In short, a group of teenagers / young adults are trapped in the middle of terrifying forests and are hurt by naked nymphomaniac demons. <br /> <br /> This movie has all the basics of this modest phrase: <br /> <br /> -No women, teenagers or young adults are put in horrible scenes of death, survived being a well-built young woman who always shows your stomach, but never stand less, - a frightening, crazy man who knows about evil, - a lesbian kiss scene, - being a killer, - no story <br /> Even when it was a tacky movie, it was really awful. The atmosphere is completely dead. Nothing, not even sexy scenes and nudity, was enough to interest the male and lesbian audiences. Looking at it as if it was being watched with a nasty head-congestion or a nasty cold head. <br /> <br /> Give the demon ... 0/10.
