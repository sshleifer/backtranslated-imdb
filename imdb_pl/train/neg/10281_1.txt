Carly Pope plays JJ, a freshly promoted Food Critic, whose extravagant, overbearing mother moves with her. JJ, horrified by the turn of events, then blackmails the owner of the restaurant, Alex, to take his mother in exchange for "maybe" reviewing his dying restaurant. Alex probably falls in on her daughter while warming up to her mother. There are many problems with this movie, the characters are universal 2-dimensional. JJ is a selfish, hateful character, her mother is superficial and shallow. JJ's colleagues in the magazine are bizarre and opportunistic. The basic message of over 50-year-old woman who is unable to do it on her own, without male help, is bad, bad, and bad. The operation is uniformly boring, the script is boring. The only thing that saves is the surroundings of New York. I do not recommend this movie.
