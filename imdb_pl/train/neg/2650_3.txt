When I sat subject to this television mediocrity, I wondered why? Why did Dianne Keaton agree to this basket? The film uses senseless, sophisticated feature lines to deliver trash to thousands of homes. The film transfers the political program to a new level. The film was irrelevant and all credibility was lost due to excessive use of the stereotype. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that Keaton tried to make this film worthwhile, but in the end he must remember an old saying that can not be polished. I hope you have not wasted your New Year by watching another thoughtless TV movie. Now I know why the networks started broadcasting the series on Sunday evening to get rid of the garbage!
