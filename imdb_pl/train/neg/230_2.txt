That was awful. Andie Macdowell is a terrible actress. It is so wooden that it makes the rocking horse look better than it can. But then remember this turn in the Four Weddings, equally excruciating. Another film showing England as full of houses with bonbon and greenery. I mean school, how many schools, apart from Hogwarts, look like this? Your police station looked like a set from Heartbeat (a bland British series from the 1960s). This film simply could not understand what he wanted to be - a comedy or a serious study of women's friendships. If this was stuck in the first one, then the cemetery sex scenes and very stupid wedding assaults could just work (I only say). But these scenes simply did not work with the tragedy in the second half. I also think it unlikely that Kate would ever talk to Molly after her terrible behavior. One last note - what is a decent actress like Staunton in this heap? Not to mention Annie Chancellor. Macdowell should stick to the advertising cream for wrinkles.
