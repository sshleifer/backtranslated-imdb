You know the story. Pretty little children in the woods when BAM! Something is starting to cut them. <br /> <br /> Well, this is not a lot of nonsense. A few children return to the cabin, where the man leads the twin brother disappeared for many years before. Suddenly, "UNKOWN CREATURE" cuts the stars, and their only help is a doctor / motorcyclist. <br /> <br /> Saying that the movie is bad is an understatement, it's stupid! Acting was terrible. <br /> <br /> The creature looked very trashy. And because nowadays all movies are trying to bring you to the end, what they do not do! <br /> <br /> There is one bright point in this movie - LOST star Maggie Grace as a female heroine.
