This guy has no idea about the cinema. Ok, it seems that he did some interesting theatrical performances in his youth, and about two acceptable films that were more successful for political reasons, they deceived the communist censorship. All this is very good, but look carefully: DO NOT KNOW YOUR WORK! Scenes are unbalanced, without a proper start and with disordered content and full emptiness. There is nothing to say about it, so it over-approves the violence, nudity and language of the gutter. How can you keep such a rotten body that never understood anything from the cinematographic and art profession? Why will not they let him give up?
