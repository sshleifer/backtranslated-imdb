Power Rangers, a totally horrible program for children from the nineties, still disturbs young children in its complete cheesy and terrible surroundings. <br /> <br /> This show was not entertainment, it was a pretext to teach children the violence of children, how to fight each other to solve their differences. <br /> <br /> The toys were a further demonstration of how to promote a brutal television program and such. <br /> <br /> I have never been able to find out what was the purpose of this completely absurd show. <br /> <br /> As such, it remains one of the worst shows for children in history.
