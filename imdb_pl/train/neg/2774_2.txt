This is just a bad movie. With what seemed quite a good budget, it had the potential to be much better. It was almost. With a beautiful heroine almost like Salma Hayek, a hero fighting almost like Jackie Chan, battles and duels almost like a crouching tiger ... music almost like, say, Conan ... etc. Almost. But in the end it is simply boring and it is difficult to find something interesting in it. Maybe in addition to John Rhys-Davies flying in a duel like those warriors in Hero or the previously mentioned Crouching Tiger ... I'm really ashamed of poor old John. He is quite a good actor and deserves a lot more. Just like you - so if you still have a chance, just look at something else.
