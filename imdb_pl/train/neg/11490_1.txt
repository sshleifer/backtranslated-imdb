I have to agree with the majority opinion that this program was poorly produced as well as written. Acting did not exceed much lower production values, but I feel that an actor can rely only on the material provided to him and make the most of it. In line with this idea, I think it is important to emphasize that one actor has grown up and persevered far beyond this campus, so that distasteful production becomes a respected and quite talented performer. I mean Laura Harris, a Canadian actress who carved her way through a lot of poorly produced programs and movies to find a place in the HBO hit "Dead Like Me" in which she plays the role of Daisy Adair, and her merit in this role in an effective way . about the young actress in the series in which Ashley played a soft, yet intelligent seventh grader. I felt that if someone could "make" from this series, it would certainly be Laura Harris and loyal to her nature, she was the leader in acting to gain the respect of many producers who now recognize her as a talent, as well as a unique Nordic blond charm. If you ever have the opportunity to watch this series, I recommend you to take an epic look at such branches as "The Godfather" and maybe "Beaches", to remind yourself that there is a lot of real integrity of production and it's worth being there, and that the series is just a low-cost reminder of what Laura Harris can just say about her time at the show and I bet she'll quote a lot of young actors in defense words, saying, "This is the beginning!"
