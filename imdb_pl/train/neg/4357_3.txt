A group of friends meet face to face with a family of hideous cannibals while camping in the beautiful German countryside. <br /> <br /> The concept of the "mutant cannibal family" is almost as old as the hills where the innermost sings often call home, so any director trying to breathe new life into this genre has to come up with something very rough to impress. With Barricade, Timo Rose is trying to give the routed Teutonic bends, moving the action to the Black Forest and giving him a German low-cost splashing treatment. The result is a very bloody but completely unoriginal effort that becomes almost impossible to observe due to the terrible decisions of the director, in particular the constant use of fancy filters and irritating editing techniques. <br /> <br /> Did not Timo Rose decide to use all the tricks that his editing program offered him, and then Barricade could have been quite a funny gore-fest: his inexperienced cast is pretty good; The bloody effects are good enough; and there is one or two horrors, and even horrible moments well conceived. All this, however, is completely ruined by the terrible work of the camera, the frightening edition and the overwhelming barrier of the visual trick used to give the movie a discouraged look that is so inexplicably popular among today's filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I give Barricade 3 out of 10 only for the bizarre gore, which includes a clever scene where the guy is forced to drink acid, a lot of unpleasant wounds caused by various sharp tools and some pretty decent damage to the shotgun.
