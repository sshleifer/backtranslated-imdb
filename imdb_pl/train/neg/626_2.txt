The ghost of a murdered maniac from high school brings to life a scarecrow that will take revenge on everyone. <br /> <br /> This movie really irritated me. He has a great-looking monster, he has good low-budget effects, some atmosphere, but he manages to fasten good things with bad ones. Halfway through, I started to scroll forward, and then go through the chapters on the DVD. <br /> <br /> Problems with this movie are numerous. First of all, the cast looks about thirty, and yet they are supposed to be in high school. As a result, you do not believe anything. Scarecrow, great looking, is not otherwise. He speaks silly liners and moves in a more fun way than frightening. Is it a comedy or horror? This is a problem that goes beyond one line to most dialog boxes and configures. It seems that it resembles every stereotype more than an honest horror. I expect the film was created for a very narrow audience, horror fans who want to mock the genre and not embrace it. <br /> <br /> Despite the good-looking monster, this is a movie to avoid. Even if you pick it up in an opportunity container for less than five bucks, you pay too much. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
