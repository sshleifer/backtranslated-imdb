The repressed housewife (annoying lisbon Angie Dickinson, whose body doubles / frightens us with extreme closeness of her delicate) is sexually bored by her husband and decides to branch. This results directly from a series of murders that soon involve a high-class prostitute (Nancy Allen, apparently I'm in a bad deal, if she can bring $ 600 a night) and her psychologist (Michael Caine). If you intend to watch the rip off of De Palma (sorry, "pay homage") to Hitchcock, watch "Sisters" instead. "Dressed to Kill", being a charged style and technical skills, is one of the most difficult thrillers I could not sit down. The plot is absurd and tired. It contains surprisingly effective frightening jumps and nasty sequences of graphic murders that should please every fan of horror movies, as long as they can go through a stupid storyline that had to be dated back in the 1980s.
