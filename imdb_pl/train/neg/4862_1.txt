this program is one of the worst shows of ALL TIMES! absolutely no original jokes and are always late for a year. as in 2009, they will finally say something about the fights of Michael Vicek. all cast members are people who wanted to be on SNL, but they had to go to the lowest of the lowest, crazy TV.its hour of crazy jokes from magazines that are not funny at first, narrated by the terrible John Stewart who wants bees. so if you have a problem, please tell me that you love to listen to the opinions of 3 people who are watching this program. The family guy puts it well. "Osama bin Ladin hid in one place that nobody would look for, cast a crazy TV set. There is a reason why no one is watching the program.
