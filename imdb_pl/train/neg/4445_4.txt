Serum is a crazy doctor who finds a serum that heals all diseases thanks to the power of the mind. Instead, it creates a monster that must eat the human body and brains. Crazy doctor creates a few zombies from the corpse and has some problems. In the whole action there is a very long period in which many scenes become acquainted with the heroes. Mad doctor's nephew gets a car accident and a crazy doctor tries to use his new serum on the boy. The results are not good. This is a C-class movie with good behavior, but some problems with direction and some continuity errors. There are not many zombie actions in this game, and the effects, though sufficient, are not anything special. You can scroll the slow passages forward and enjoy the action scenes. Watch out for nudity and bad language.
