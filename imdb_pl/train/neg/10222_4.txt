In addition to great photos by the great James Wong Howe in the battle scenes, this movie is a real smelly. <br /> <br /> This is the second movie I've seen in the last days directed by Alexander Korda. The first was Charles Laughton's "Rembrandt". It was so bad that I closed it. The one I'm afraid of is not much better. <br /> <br /> Flora Robson is as ugly as Queen Elizabeth. Perhaps her performance as a virgin queen was good for the standards of 1937, but if you compare her to Helen Mirren, it does not fit. In a robotic way, Robson defines his lines. Her fighting message to English soldiers is so weak in spirit. <br /> <br /> Even the daring Laurence Olivier can not save this complete boredom. <br /> <br /> The future wife Vivien Leigh is an auxiliary role here, and she does not really communicate anything here. To think that Scarlett was 2 years later! <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the story with the Spanish Armada is so boring in this film.
