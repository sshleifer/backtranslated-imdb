Directed by Eric Stanze, "ISOYC, IPOYG," three men are subjected to torture at the hands of women who have all sexually abused. The first victim is forced to eat his own shit before being killed to death. The next guy ends up with a bullet in the crotch after refusing to have anal sex with the body of the first guy. But the third man gets the worst: he has to watch the strongly tattooed "star" Emily Haack naked and masturbate with a broom (oh, he also pulls the hilt to the ass!). <Br /> <br /> And, unfortunately, we too (let's see how you masturbate, I mean, do not do broom on the ass!). <br /> <br /> Yes, "ISOYC, IPOYG" is one sharp experience in watching, not because of its relentless violence, but because Haack, of course, is under the false belief that he has the body of a goddess (as opposed to that of roadie for Metallica), it still becomes naked for the camera. This is not a nice view. <br /> <br /> In addition to the constant nudity of Haack's ink, viewers can also see the horrible direction from Stanza (who thinks that endless shots of tombstones and trees are funny things), really bad acting and fat man's penis. <br /> <br /> Strange, I give "ISOYC, IPOYG" a 3/10 rating, which is actually slightly higher than the current 2.9 average. This is one point for an attack on an ax clash (which, as a gore-hound, I liked); one point for a piece in which a fat guy pushes his face into a chocolate mousse pretending feces (funny); and one point for pure nervousness to suggest that this movie may somehow be a continuation of the classic Meir Zarchi, "Spit On Your Grave."
