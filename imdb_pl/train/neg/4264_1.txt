this movie has let me down. it was a great idea, ruined by a terrible writing. History simply did not flow and was chaotic at best. There were so many elements to this story that were not explained or forced without any real thought. elements such as a love story could be extended to a bit more, and cannons must be saved better. the whole adolescent heroine needed more information about the training she received and less about. everybody likes a good story "a little guy overcomes" and this promise was promising, but because of the failure in the writing was not. While in the final sequence of battles she had several pyrotechnics, she was weak due to the lack of choreography. it caused a crazy boring watch <br /> <br /> could be so good :(
