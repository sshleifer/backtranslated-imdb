"Stella Dallas" from 1937 with Barbara Stanwyck did not quite age - it was thought that the half-updated version of the story is now a real mystery. Perhaps they thought jokingly, cheerful boldly Bette Midler could do something about it, but this frosted script overcomes her. Talk about a barmaid who gave birth to a child without a marriage, and years later she gave the young girl to a wealthy child's father so that she would have a chance for a better life, she can not escape from deceitful, old-fashioned traps and sentiments. Midler works best with a movie director who can control her excesses, but that does not happen; Stephen Collins is as calm as a man who changes her life, but Trini Alvarado is well manned as the daughter of Midler. This was called the "image of a woman", a wallet, but you do not miss it because it remains too faithful to the sources from the thirties. * 1/2 of ****
