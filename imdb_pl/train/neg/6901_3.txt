The most positive thing I can say about this dense local comedy production is that it is harmless. In fact, it is so amazingly bland that one wonders how many dozens of repetitions the committee has made to completely remove the personality. It's not funny, it's not funny, it's not insightful and it's not cute. It's just a carefree, bold progress of the four losers who have to change their attitude - and their attitude towards women - so that they can attend the wedding of their best friend. <br /> <br /> With acting it would be below the norm for local amateur dramatic society, the plot line so tired that it will make the forty-third season of Allo Allo look fresh, and the jokes of such a humorous character as watching rotting vegetables, after all Sione's Wedding has won ten (yes 10) nominations for the movie NZ Awards recently. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, someone saw the meaning and won nothing.
