Boring. The minimal plot. No character development. I went to this movie with high expectations for the book. It could have been an amazing movie. He could probably be an iconic classic. No, it was a huge disappointment. He was poorly manned and had terrible special effects. It was difficult to determine who the bad guys were: rebels, army, church or everyone? I'm still intrigued by certain mini-stories from the movie. I am stunned by certain aspects of this so-called "prophecy" that is never fully explained. I felt like I was watching a twisted episode of a mini-series on a science-fiction channel. It seemed very similar to a television movie. Do not go see this movie. It is a waste of time and money.
