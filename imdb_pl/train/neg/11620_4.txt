I gave it more than 1, because I thought that in this story there were a few moral lessons that provoked my wife and I. thought and commentary. Acting and dialogue were mediocre and I must admit that I left feeling, God was beaten over my head by God this is also Christ's our savior. The film and the story did not need it. If, like me, I am a Catholic or a Christian who releases it, you will avoid it. The film did a good job, showing a thin border between being a good citizen and how someone could become a potential persecutor focused on what could have been.
