The sun was not shining, it was too wet to have fun, so I went to the cinema, that cold, cold, wet day. <br /> <br /> "Cat in a hat" is the name of the movie, and when it was over, my stomach was sick. <br /> <br /> Mike Myers played the cat, his mood was poor, and the children do not have to see it, the humor was not tame. <br /> <br /> the movie was like drinking milk, from an angry cow, so it's great to have fun, but the filmmakers did not know how. <br /> <br /> This film, in short, is terrible. Acting was bad, the plot was too much improved, and the humor was surprisingly very primitive. <br /> <br /> It starts with Conrad and Sally, the rules breaker and the future sheriff. When their mother needs to go to work, she takes Mrs. Kwan to take care of the child. Perhaps the lonely funny part of the movie is when Ms. Kwan watches the Taiwanese courtroom, "la C-SPAN". Soon falls asleep and the Cat is coming. <br /> <br /> The movie is starting to get out of control. The cat came to try the children. Ma Thing 1 and Thing 2, who suddenly start to destroy the house. He improvises TV Infomercial and accidentally cuts the tail. And when Cat fills up Carmen Miranda, it's not funny. Probably his only funny disguise is a hippie activist. And there is a fish that tries to warn the children about the Cat. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that he did not warn us that this movie is as funny as sour milk or chopping the tail. <br /> <br /> Soon, the children are outside and are looking for a family dog ​​that has a key to the box on the collar. If the box is not closed soon, their home will be home to the cat's universe. Here, it gets a bit more interesting, but not enough to save a movie. <br /> <br /> Generally, acting is terrible. Mike Meyers brings his brand of Austin Powers brazen humor to Saying things like "You dirty ho" and imagining himself as a woman for the rest of his life after hitting the testicles, posing like a pinata. Spencer Breslin is great as a troublesome Conrad, and Dakota Fanning is sweet like Sally, though they are not enough to save this terrifying Aorty Stratification waiting to kill John Ritter (an accident waiting for it). Slick and slimey Alec Baldwin Lawrence Quinn is disgusting, trying to cheat the mother of kids, played by Kelly Preston. And Sean Hayes is Mr. Humberfloob, the mother's boss, and the voice of the fish. The latter three are also bland. <br /> <br /> In general, if I was a parent, I would not take my children who are in a nightmare, because there are many and more. Save your $ 7.00 and see something else. As once great dr Seuss once said, <br /> <br /> It's fun to play, but you need to know how. Really, universal, stop it! Theodore is already falling in the grave. <br /> <br /> As my mother always says: "Curiousity killed the cat." - Cat in a hat * with *****
