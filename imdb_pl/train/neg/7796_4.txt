Wow, not only this movie is "a new lesson of true bad taste", but also a lesson in "real bad movie". Do not get me wrong, I appreciated the concept of "Zombie 90: Extreme Pest", but at the same time you need to realize when the movie is terrible. If you missed the story, the story "Zombie" 90 talks about a government plane carrying toxic chemicals that happens to collide with wasteland, causing chemical leaks, turning locals into hideous-looking zombies. The next thing you know that zombies are all over the city, eat living people, while a stupid doctor and government agent try to discover a disease that makes these people eat each other - hence the name "Extreme Pest." From then on, all we see are zombies that have a day in the field of view of every local - nothing but extreme and disgusting eviscerations and splinters that are accompanied by endless buckets of guts and blood. Because it's a German movie, the movie had to be dubbed into English, and when you're not laughing at the voracious zombie madness, the teachers are quite funny and fun. As a user, he did not mention X * SPOILER * * SPOILER * * SPOILER *, there is a scene in the film that exceeds the limit of acceptability and inadmissibility, hence the scene in which the woman who is carrying the baby is wheeled in a wheelchair by some guy and a horde of zombies will disappear and attack them. One of the zombies grabs the child and rips them to pieces, eating his organs when you hear the baby crying. Wow, this is a new lesson of REAL bad taste. Cruel, I tell you, terrible.
