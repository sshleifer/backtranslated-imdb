Woody Allen did "September", proving that even a genius could break down. This is "September" by Mel Brooke. Essentially stupid, boring and indecent I have to admit that I did not watch it to the end. Flip is one of the few (eg "The Money Pit", "Out to Sea", "Spitfire Grill") which either lulled me or forced me to reach for the "scroll" button. And unfortunately I say this as a devoted Mel Brooks fan. He should stick to a simple comedy and leave a social comment himself. Like the same guy who did "Young Frankenstein" and "Spaceballs", he could have ruled out a dog like me. Avoid at all costs.
