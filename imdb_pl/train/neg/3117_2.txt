My husband is a big fan of Robin Williams. I like him, too, but overall I've decided that he should "stick to what he does best" and focus on comedic roles. My thoughts have been confirmed with this film. Throughout the movie, I was completely bored. History was predictable. I realize that the real story was the inspiration. But I'm guessing that some tension or intrigue could have occurred, even with the truth in history. None of the characters was well developed. There was an additional story about the main character and his partner. This relationship could be investigated further. More important, however, would be a deeper knowledge of the "boy's" mother. Her psychological profile would be interesting. Apparently, it has a long history that has not been addressed differently than in the most superficial way. If my husband was not such a big fan of Williams, we would leave 20 minutes for it. It is a pity that I can not recover my 20 or 2 hours.
