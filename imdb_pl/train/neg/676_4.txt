I wanted to see it for two reasons. First of all, it was a remake of High Sierra with Bogart, two, part of Bogarta played by Jack Palance, who can play dramatic roles with a certain subtlety, like in The Big Knife. <br /> <br /> But now I wonder why they decided to make this remake. The film tells the same story as Hig Sierra; only here the actors do not care, the director gets lost in thought and who knows what the producer thought. Jack Palance gets bored looking at Shelley Winters, and Shelley Winters asks himself what he's doing in this movie. I do not even want to compare her to Ida Lupino in the same role. And of course they had to use the dog's story again! Certainly they could come up with some different ideas. Perhaps the color makes it nice to see the same location where the High Sierra was filmed, but it definitely does not add any quality to the film. <br /> <br /> It's a waste of time if you've seen High Sierra before. Otherwise, why not see the pseudo-movie noir. As for me, I'd rather die than see it again ...
