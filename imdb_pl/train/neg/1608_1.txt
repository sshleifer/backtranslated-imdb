Che's charisma and appearance have as much in common with his iconic character as with disinformation disseminated by left-wing propaganda (such as this film) about him. <br /> <br /> I do not know what is worse: getting caught by one of Che's murder units or for 4 hours of this typical soderberian garbage. The question is not why this pet-project was made, but what took them so long. By "them" I mean, of course, leftist Hollywood and its "secret" love for Marxist tyrants (Lenin, Castro ... take your choice). I am fascinated that one of the least talented liberal directors of Tinseltown needed decades to finally embark on such an irresistible tendency to propaganda. Where was Oliver Stone all these years? Robert Redford? Tim Robbins? Warren Beatty? Alan Pakula? George Clooney? Barbra Streisand even? It's a secret. All these overrated "artists" often devote themselves to similar, one-sided political projects, but Che Guevara, who is probably the most popular and best known communist, was not yet their film subject. > <br /> "Guerrilla" has all the features of the American story of bending the truth on an epic scale; there are so many actual details that can be found here, as in other similar Hollywood political tales with a large budget, such as "Malcolm X" or "Gandhi", i.e. almost none. The movie star Del Toro as a famous Argentine revolutionary. Nevertheless, no matter how controversial and criminal the man's actions were, no one could take him away: he was an intelligent manipulator from a rich family - that's why Del Toro only fits the bill visually. Del Toro may be an interesting, charismatic actor and may physically resemble Guevara, but he does not exude intellectual qualities at all, which is why he makes Guevara too primitive. Throwing such mediocrities as Bratt, Philips and Frank Incompetente only underlines the director's lack of reasonable judgment. <br /> <br /> The film is mostly very slow (no surprise) and visually uninteresting. Even a director as brilliant as Kubrick would carefully consider the release of a film that goes beyond the 3-hour mark, so it's pretty clear that this Soderbergh, who only made one or two permanent films and at the beginning of his career, would have thought that His Oceanic Size she was able to cope with this task. If you think that the length of the movie indicates that most of Che's life has been shown here - think again. Soderbergh focuses on the last phase of Che, and many movies are boring nonsense in the jungle, full of Guevara's alleged idealism. (Psychopaths have no ideals.) I wonder what sort of mind this highly-valued director must choose to ignore some of Che's earlier life. Did he really consider it too uninteresting? The massacre of 600 people is not interested in the viewer, eh? Amazing. Some much better directors than this overly praised charlatan could easily fit one, but two complete biographies in a 4-hour movie. <br /> <br /> Soderbergh in a way becomes an accomplice, never turning to the negative, the dark side - over 90% - Guevara. Spreading this kind of historical inaccuracy, deliberately ignoring the ugly truth (God forbid, to blemish the sacred image of Che), Soderbergh proves that he is not a humanist - a false image that most Hollywood personalities and pop music struggle with all careers sustain - but vice versa: it cares only for ideas, never for people on whom these ideas are tested (as in guinea pigs). Soderbergh and their like are the elite of the worst kind; such people often have a hidden contempt for "proleteriatów" (what a stupid term) with which they allegedly stand. <br /> <br /> Half of all students around the world wear the image of Che in their red and orange shirts, but never knowing why. He has become an iconic figure for the unconscious, uninformed, very often young people who think that having the face of this man on the chest, which somehow makes them seem "irritated", intellectual, fashionable or interesting. In fact, wearing a Che shirt emphasizes only the general shallowness and total lack of interest in self-education. (DO YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT A PERSON BEFORE YOU START TO SELL YOUR FACE WITH THE WORLD?) Wearing an already stereotypical Che image has become just as common as having a Bart Simpson coffee cup. All those "Che-wearers" probably know more about Marge's blue hair than they ever read about Fidel Castro's dead ally. <br /> <br /> After everything that was done in the name of Marx, one would think that these mongrel "ideals" will finally be postponed. It seems that humanity will never learn. Stalin, Mao, Kim Il, Pol Pot, Castro, Milošević, Ceauşescu, an iron curtain, one hundred million dead, more than a billion physically and / or mentally ruined by this system ... so it does not matter what? <br /> <br /> The fact that Del Toro won the Cannes award should only surprise those who have absolutely no idea about how Cannes and other European festivals work - and vote. Hint: Sean Penn was at the head of the jury not so long ago. <br /> <br /> For my fans related to music, go to: http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/Fedor8/
