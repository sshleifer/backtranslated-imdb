I gave it to 1. There are so many twists and turns that you can never move out of. Total chaos. Everyone is dying or almost like that. I am tired of crosswords and changing views. I can not give up the plot. Curled and crazy. If I paid to see it, I would demand a refund. I would like the opinions to be more honest.
