One would wish that an idea as good as an "invisible man" would work better and be treated more cautiously in the era of fantastic special effects, but it is not. History, characters and finally the last 20 minutes of the film are as fresh as the movie of a crazy scientist from the early 1950s. There are some great moments, mainly because of the amazing special effects and the idea of ​​an invisible man who walks the streets. But unfortunately, we will soon return to the tight prison of the underground laboratory, which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable, but schematic. <br /> <br /> There have been many modifications of old films or TV shows over the last 10 years, and some of them have their charm. But for each film it becomes more and more brilliant that the idea of ​​placing huge classics under the nose of eager madmen like Verhoeven (who has his moments) is very bad. It is obvious that the key issue is money: the time and energy blended into the scenario are not close enough, as a result of which "Hollow Man" is seriously undermined by clichés, luscious characters, predictability and lack of any depth. <br /> <br /> However, the only thing that really impressed me, apart from special effects, was swearing. By creating these kinds of films, modern producers really want to let the children see them. That is why language (and sometimes violence and sex) is very subdued. When the whole world explodes, good guys go "Oh darn!" And "Oh my God." "Hollow Man" gratefully rejects this kind of hypocrisy, and the heroes can say what is most natural for them. I'm not saying that the most natural answer to something that went wrong is swearing - but it makes it more credible if someone actually swears. I think we can thank Verhoeven for that.
