The first five minutes of this movie showed potential. Then it came out of something that could be decent, some illegal comedy. The best part is that I could not stop thinking about Supertroopers thanks to Joey Kern. I recommend watching this movie to learn how not to make a movie. In this movie there are so many scenes that make you just stop and wonder if the entire cast and crew just stopped looking after. What's the most surprising thing about this movie is that he made $ 22 million at the box office and it cost only $ 1.5 million. Congratulations to LWO Wrota for being able to pull it away.
