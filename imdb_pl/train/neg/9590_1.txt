The film is based on a true novel from the 1950s. <br /> <br /> The journalist Colin McInnes wrote a collection of three "London novels": "Absolute Beginners", "City of Spades" and "Mr Love and Justice". I've read all three. The first two are excellent. Last, maybe an experiment that did not end. But McInnes's work is highly appreciated; and rightly so. This musical is the ultimate nightmare of the novelist - to see how the fruits of his own mind change into a brilliant, malfunctioning, soporic, one-dimensional apology of the film that says that captures the spirit of London in the 1950s and does nothing. <br /> <br /> Thank God, Colin McInnes was not a witness to this.
