This was recently about the live AMC movie classics and I had to laugh. I had high hopes for this adventure, which took place in the spirit of "Journey to the core of the Earth" and "Mysterious Island". I was very disappointed not only with acting references but with a stupid story that reads from a comic book from five years ago. Make sure you see the wires that hold the wings of Pterdactyl as they grab the "Hound" of a semi-idiotic pre-modern man who befriends lost adventurers. The ending left open the same effects again in "People that Time Forgot". Do not waste time.
