this movie is outrageous. outrageous, I mean horrible. I had more fun watching how the paint dries in my local hardware store on August day, suffering from migraine and heat stroke. the acting became worse and worse as the film progressed, and the use of euphoric drugs by the team became obvious as the last scenes approached. when the misty was shot, she decided that it would be wise to blink the fast with murder. it was not smart. truthfully, Stevie Wonder could have caught it with his eyes closed. If you decide to play with a nail gun in a drunk state and watch this movie, remember that the nail gun will probably give you a better story to tell your friends.
