for those who were desperate to find out what happened to Twitch in the original movie, hear your chance and then return to the real world. <br /> <br /> The guy who hid the gold in the first movie, said Twitch, so he's moved to another prison, where wrestling champions are spinning around, looking pensive. Twitch plans to leave prison for a month to get gold to start living with his woman. <br /> <br /> Then something happens and someone gets shot, and the movie turns into Die Hard in another prison. But the wrestler's daughter is trapped in all this, so he will shrink to find her and Twitch's woman. <br /> <br /> As you can imagine, acting is below the norm, it has many (really annoying) rap and poorly edited battle scenes. On the other hand, he has this Spanish guy who plays in every prison / action / thriller ever made, and closes the door. <br /> <br /> It is not too rich in events, but at least it is harmless. <br /> <br /> If you've been a big fan of the original, that's fine. <br /> <br /> If you have not, you have been warned.
