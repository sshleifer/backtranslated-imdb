Come on, what about the show, Power Rangers, anyway? I have always thought that the series, which was originally brought from Japan in better shape, took what was great in Japan and became one of the most absurd and pointless excuses in the history of toy merchandising! There is absolutely no point in this program. <br /> <br /> Bad hairstyles, bad costumes, earrings etc. - all this shows what was funny in the 90s. From two idiots, loose and skull, to "duhs", main cast, Jason, Trini, Tommy , Kimberly, Billy and Zack, I just want to say one thing: GIVE ME A BREAK! <br /> <br /> Saban brought it from Japan, and then Disney bought the rights to this program about five years ago. <br /> <br /> Now the audience has to endure replays of this program on the Disney channel and so on. <br /> <br /> Everything I can say again give me a break!
