Roy Rogers plays the role of Jesse James and his similarity, gambler Clint Burns. George "Gabby" Hayes is Mr. Rogers' former pal, Sheriff Gabby. Gale Storm (Jane Fillmore) and Sally Payne (Polly Morgan) are a noteworthy band because two reporters are looking for stories about an elusive, heroic hero. <br /> <br /> Of course, wrong identity / spoofing development, because Rogers writes "a double role". Rogers is charming, as usual; but there is nothing that would raise its performance beyond the usual - every potential to ensure Jekyll / Hyde's memorable performance is done by poor material. A better couple to watch are Mrs. Storm and Mrs. Paye as reporters from St. Louis Journal - this is the most important part of the movie. The tracks are fine, though badly synchronized. <br /> <br /> *** Jesse James at Bay (1941) Joseph Kane ~ Roy Rogers, George 'Gabby' Hayes, Gale Storm
