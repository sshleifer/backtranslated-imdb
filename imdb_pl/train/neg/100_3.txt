OK, this is not the best movie I've ever seen, but at the same time I could sit and watch it DOUBLE !!! the plot was awful and during the first part of the first story I wondered what the hell I was watching, but it was so horrible at the same time that I loved to chew it up laughing all the time. <br /> <br /> And Jebidia deserves an Oscar for the role in the film. The only thing that failed him was that he broke his stupid name. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was quite perfect, but if your cheap laughs and you see it in the pound land.
