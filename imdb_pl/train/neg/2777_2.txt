Unfortunately, it has been shown in Star Movies here in Thailand for the last week. It's a complete junk game. As another member said, this movie is a good example of "how not to act." For a long time I have not seen such a poorly preserved movie. Actors (can they be called "actors"?) Are completely flat and fit the passion of a dead dog. I would say that to really understand how bad acting works, you would have to see a movie ... but that would be similar to torture. <br /> <br /> I am cowering as a leading lady delivers her lines, and the rest of the cast with their accents (false or imagined) is equally shameful. Another actress with a false British accent was pretty, yes, but a good man was her terrible accent. Mix it with its (no) action and you have a catastrophe. She should just say nothing and I could accept her as a pretty girl. Oh, we just got to the stage where the lover of the leading lady says "Really me?". after a forced stage, crying from her. Funny. No, really, I was laughing loudly. <br /> <br /> Scenes and artistic directors offer some savings in the film. Some sets are colorful, and some scenes are rather nice (without actors). <br /> <br /> An old magic potion? What?! Another member mentioned the "modern" love song that was in the movie. Completely inappropriate for a song from 500 years ago. <br /> <br /> I understand that in Thailand the film was considered a "big budget" during its production. I would be seriously upset if I was the producer of this movie. It simply shows that money is not necessarily a good (and even mediocre) movie. <br /> <br /> I would give King Maker 1 in 10, but the costumes and sets make the film from such Rating. 2 out of 10.
