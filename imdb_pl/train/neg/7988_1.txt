Anita and Me seem to be just an excuse for Meera Syal, the author of the novel and script, to convey her prejudices, regrets and general dislike of the English. The general sentiment of Indian superiority over the English in this film is unclean. <br /> <br /> The English in this movie are portrayed as overweight, brutal, hideous, dissolute, engaging in the neglect of children, stupid, uneducated, racist, ugly, eating poor and depressing - clearly speaking, only turning to Indian culture, a local priest can be "redeemed" at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> In contrast, the Indian family is beautiful, smart, educated, able to speak many languages, is caring and loving parents and feeds for high school students. The film is so deviously harmful that I am surprised that the BBC has financed it altogether. If, on the contrary, the English family in the Indian community were doing this, the film would be perceived as racist. <br /> <br /> There were a few moments when my eyebrow shot so high in my forehead, I thought it would get stuck in my hairline. First, the gossip scene between women at the Divali celebrations - subtext: The English are dirty and disbanded - and men - the subtext: English women are prostitutes. Second, a meal with Anita, in which the Neemy family lies to her about cutlery - subtext: The English are so stupid that you can do anything about them. <br /> <br /> But basic contempt for anything English - even an English wedding is a contempt - it can be seen throughout the movie. Anita's figure has been drawn so frighteningly - almost like a fallen woman - that I finished the movie angry. <br /> <br /> This is not "bend like Beckham", where humor focuses on loving the exaggerated behavior and habits of the community in front of someone from this community and this is a film about two girls from different environments that come together. Instead, Anita and Me seem to convey that the form of cultural apartheid is inevitable, because the English are almost a version of the Indian invulnerable caste, which is emphasized by a thinly veiled series of attacks on the "other" film community: English. <br /> <br /> I felt that Anita and Me is a song full of hatred, based on complaints. On this basis, the BBC should not have financed its production.
