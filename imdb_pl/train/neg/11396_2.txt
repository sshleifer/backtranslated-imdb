The master of cheap erotic horror, Rolfe Kanefsky, finally makes a movie that does not go directly to the Playboy Channel. "The Hazing" borrows heavily from everything that came before him, from Nightmare to Elm Street to Evil Dead, but he still manages to do it with enough humor to watch it ... barely. The heroes are cardboard, the dialogue is wooden, the story is paper thin, and the actors can not get out of the shopping bag. Put it all together and you have a plump ball of litter on the film. Sometimes, when I'm bored, I like to eat paper. Watching this movie is very similar. Chew him for 90 minutes and you will stay with a strange taste in the mouth and no nutritional value.
