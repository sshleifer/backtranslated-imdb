This will be best known from Ferrari, which crashed when Eddie Griffin was promoted. <br /> <br /> The story of races and bets is poorly made by numbers that seem to have a director who has not seen the numbers. To a large extent, a point and shoot romance with a group of actors for payment. It's not a good movie, but it's not bad enough to be watched and end up as something you do not want to bother with a movie, no matter how you look at it. <br /> <br /> Misogynistic, despite the fact that one of the leaders is a woman, is a film that was clearly created to bring the producer and director closer to pretty girls. Do you want evidence? There are long shots of women who have no purpose, except that they can grow out of people who are afraid to rent a porn or a DVD with an illustrated sports costume. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie in: All costs
