Christ, oh Christ ... One looks stunned, disbelieving and perhaps mad, how this shoddy exercise in hopeless sadness develops with all the wit and agility of a paralyzed Galapagos tortoise. Can such things be? Does this film really exist, or was I the unconscious guinea pig of some dark international pharmaceutical company, sipping my coffee unaware that it has been enriched with a dangerous hallucinogen? I have seen many movies and many bad movies, but nothing has prepared me for it; at the end I was a gibbering, boring wreck, tearing the carpet with teeth like a dog scratching the walls, howling, until my lungs ached. I desperately begged for mercy (to which this appeal was made, I do not know) and I longed for the burning desire of the soothing balm of Ozu Yasujiro. Sweet Crying Jesus, memories ... sometimes they come back to me. When I'm the most defenseless when I can not deal with them. I shudder, I break down in tears, I bite my nails until my hands are covered with blood, but I can not completely throw away the terrible retrospection from my mind. I'm haunted. I'm damaged. I am the shell of a man. <br /> <br /> Other user comments suggest that I am not alone in this terrifying experience, which can only mean one of two things: a) the film does, in fact, exist, or b) I am only one victim among international legions conspiracy with really sinister proportions. What is quite surprising is the fact that some people like their gehenna, or at least they did not experience her trauma. Perhaps they are part of the operation. Let them fuck you, maniacs! Let them all curse to hell !!!!!!
