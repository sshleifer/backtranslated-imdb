I was hoping to see the adaptation of a classic story like Arabian Nights. Instead, I was disappointed with a movie that did not pay attention to me from the very beginning, even though I tried to watch it twice !! <br /> <br /> It was a bonus that Caradine was in this movie, but it was not much, because the actors did not have sympathy. For something similar, Zorro with Anthony Hopkins and Bandaras is much better for action, comic moments and general pleasure. <br /> <br /> OK, so Son of the Dragon has many possible fans, but if you're looking for something to worry about when it comes to martial arts and the storyline you will not get. If you want the kids to settle on a Sunday afternoon, then maybe it's for you with three ninjas.
