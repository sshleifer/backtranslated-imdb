I saw this movie with low expectations and I was not disappointed. It's so bad that it's really funny in a very dignified way. <br /> <br /> Gael is absolutely horrible, I mean it just can not work, period. He should give up now, because acting is not his thing. His starfishes are more or less the same, I'm sure my five-year-old cousin could do a better job than everyone else! The director should be ashamed that he put his name on something so funny. Somehow I do not think that Oscar is on this guy's cards. <br /> <br /> I never wrote a comment about IMDb, but this movie was so bad that I felt compelled to do it. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see this movie, there is 0/10, if it was 0
