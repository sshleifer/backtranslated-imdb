because it's the only way not to think that this movie is THE TOTAL waste of time and money. The remake of "Heaven Can Wait" (which at least was worth a look) is a bad excuse for a romantic comedy. It's more of a vehicle that gives Rock some time to make a movie about a weak comedy that does not work well on a big screen. Especially that his jokes should come from the body of an old, fat, rich, dead man, but they are shown from Rock himself. As he offends Black and White, chemistry is wrong. The film is not funny, poorly filmed acting is at best weak. Go to the "Heaven Can Wait" rental and watch a live movie at Rock, and you'll be far ahead of the game.
