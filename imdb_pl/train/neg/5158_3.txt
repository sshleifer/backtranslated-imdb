Sometimes doing something weird and modern does not always work for everyone's benefit. Although I admit that the set design and the concept of the film were quite interesting, the implementation of these ideas into one consistent story simply did not work. This movie was so disgustingly slow and meaningless that even Robin Williams could not have saved that trash. It is obvious that Barry Levinson's dream fell flat on his face, but he should have warned the rest of the world about this slop.
