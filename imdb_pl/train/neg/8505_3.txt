"Semana Santa" or "Angel Of Death" is a very weak film. Mira Sorvino plays a detective who tries to find a killer who shoots people. Mira has an Italian accent that weaken from time to time. Could not she just speak English? All other characters have a forced Mexican accent that distracts. The dialogue is very bad and its delivery is wooden. Pictures look nice, but it's not enough to save those tripe. THIS IS THE NEXT PART OF THIS REVISION CONTAINS SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> During the culmination it looks like the villain will run away, but then he goes back up the stairs to shoot and do a nice acrobatics on the handrail. This shows that this script has no originality. AVOID!
