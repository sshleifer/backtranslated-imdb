With the exception of the FAMILY, this new season is worse than the first season. I can not imagine what they think. As a fan of horror, he can endure many gore and mindless chaos, but with each performance this series gets worse. I can not imagine how discouraging actors and crew must be to go to work every day, working to throw away such nonsense. STORY! Is that too much to ask for? CHARACTER! How can we curse the fate of EVERYONE in these stories? If we are not engaged, who cares if they will be carved or anything? Almost every episode ends with the mindless release of blood, causing a huge shock without any revelation, conclusion or reason, why we have been subjected to an hour of bloodletting. Even Dante's effort this season has sparked a disturbing, sexist violence and has gone to a pointless conclusion. Ironically, production values ​​and performances tend to accelerate while the content is complete. I have great hopes regarding the VALARIE UNDER THE STAIRS from Exec Producer, but we will see.
