I wanted to see "Mr. Fix It "because I'm a huge fan of David Boreanase. I got a nap for 1/2 hour. The premise seemed pleasant: Boreanaz is Lance Valenteen, the owner of the company named "Mr. Fix It, "in which dumped men get his help so that their girls take them back. the film is a montage, script and acting. Although I consider Boreanaz to be delightful in other film roles (except what he did in the film "Crow"), it was disappointing. Sometimes his character was interesting, while others were flat. Supporting cast reminded me of the soap opera players. I realize that it was not a movie with a big budget, but some parts of the scenes and music just did not seem right. <br /> <br /> My advice: look at your own risk.
