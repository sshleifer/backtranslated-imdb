Eight Academy nominations? It is unbelievable. I can only think that it was a very bad year - even according to Hollywood standards. With Hustin as the director and Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner as the leaders, I would probably swallow the bait and look at it anyway, but Oscar nominations have really sold it to me, and as a result I feel clearly cheated. <br /> <br /> So this is a black comedy? Can anyone tell me where the humor in Hizar Prizzi is? It is certainly tasteless (shooting at the head of a policeman's wife is another allegedly comical cut-scene in this intentional farce about the mafia life), but with the exception of the joke about "your favorite Mexican cigars" (which, as I imagine, is an old joke for Americans who it has been officially banned from buying anything Cuban for the last 50 years) I have not noticed anything about a comic character - and tried it. There are many mafia stereotypes, but the stereotype is not humor in my book. <br /> <br /> Is this a kind of romantic comedy? Never. Characters and their relationships are so unbelievable and shallow that they are on par with Ben Afleckiem and Jennifer Lopez in Gigli. <br /> <br /> Is this cleverly invented parody about the mafia? Not in a million years. The plot is simply pointlessly absurd, not ridiculously absurd, and usually has the impression of a really bad (and cheap) mafia movie. He feels more like homage than a parody. <br /> <br /> Thanks to one-dimensional characters and a bit of humor for them, the actors make suspicious accents and draw faces. Well, that's not enough; even if the face is pulled by the master of a comic facial expression, Jack Nicholson (conforming to the inflated upper lip ... is this parody of Brando's padded cheeks in the Godfather? ... Oh! Who cares? ... I just know that this is not funny). <br /> <br /> Throw a slow, slow direction (this movie stretches for 2 hours), some hopelessly stupid and banal dialogue, such as; "Do you remember Camora? Well, we're much bigger, we'll track you wherever you go, "and stereotypical manners, and you'll reach for this quick scroll button before you can say" capiche ". Prizzi's honor is far from Huston's "masterpiece" and is a very weak last job. It is definitely one work in the canon of the great director, who should get a concrete coat and throw it into the Hudson River.
