Well, I do not think the picture is as bad as most reviews. . . but you can not deny that he has problems. <br /> <br /> Most problems occur in the script. There is a conspiracy - but not much history, certainly not one that could be called credible; it draws any number of consciously weird and / or stereotypical figures, lines, moments, anything and to the end, it just does not add up too much in this section. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry but I do not care what "social illness" Farnsworth can try to solve; there will always be a sector of the population that will want to do anything to destroy their brains, even if it requires running on cornfields, trying to steal ammonia, or whatever morons do. So, as a movie, you will not find me calling me "Iowa" "important". But at the stylistic level, the picture is more than interesting, and some of Farnsworth's choices in presenting the state of the raised head are beautiful, funny, disturbing and - yes, I will say it - inspired. /> <br /> Acting is uneven, but it can be a victim of the style that has been praised so far. Look, Rosanna Arquette is a great actress - but she's not very good here, so a fastidious audience member must ask, "What happened?" It's strange that Diane Foster manages the simplicity and grace that so few other actors can get closer. For example, I could seriously consider any explanations that Farnsworth could provide for supervisor Michael T. Weiss as probation officer, but I doubt I will ever buy him; It just does not work. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this is the most vivid and the moment I saw John Savage appearing for years. So go to the figure. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of work that tempts but does not promise - and it's good; neither Farnsworth nor anyone else is required to make films. So, if Farnsworth has a different movie in it, it turns out, but if it does, it seems quite likely that it will not be a bland slur. At a time when people are planning their lives around the latest part of the "American Idol," perhaps we could allow, and not despise, Farnsworth's legitimate and undeniably defective movie. <br /> <br /> Moreover, perhaps we could welcome, rather than rebuke, his energetic and sometimes blessed idiosyncratic imagination.
