Ever since the loving cinema of the universe has met a guy named George A. Romero, the word "zombie" automatically associates with horrified images of horror and constant acting sequences. It is safe to say that his "Night of the Living Dead" created a zombie movie that we now know. However, in the earliest years of cinema, the premise of lively corpses was used only in slow, almost inactive psychological thrillers. A great example is "I walked with a Zombie" by Jacques Tourneur, as well as "White Zombie" with Bela Lugosi. This "Revolt of the Zombies" could be another example, but unfortunately it is a defeat in the whole line and it's easy to be one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Horrible acting, a badly written script and a total lack of atmosphere and tension! The film lasts only 65 minutes, but the first half hour is completely wasted on stupid intrigue from love stories and uninteresting monologues. Setting up in the legendary Cambodian city of Angkor could certainly have resulted in a more fascinating history, but all we see are internal shots. The main actress (Dorothy Stone, a textbook blonde with curly hair and an ugly nose) irritated me a lot, and I still hoped that hungry undead would suddenly appear out of nowhere to devour her. Bad luck again? If you manage to wrestle for 60 minutes, you will get a pretty decent final. However, this is definitely not enough to give the film a positive rating, let alone a recommendation. Avoid! This is the type of film that you should only see in case you see everything else.
