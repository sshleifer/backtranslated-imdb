I am a huge fan of Steven Seagal. Hell, I probably weigh as much as he does, although I do not have the street idea to grow a pony-pony. After expressing his own attitude and sympathy to the favorite American hero of the stage and screen, with a heavy heart I must announce that it is his worst film in history. I'm not sure if he could make a movie worse than that. <br /> <br /> In his defense the main problems with this film seem to appear in post-production. It is painfully obvious that this movie was to have a different plot. This results in pathetic voices in which Steve's voice almost does not synchronize with the voice dubbed. Editing is pisspoor and generally starts bad, it gets even worse, and in the end you will want to instead use the Da Vinci Code again. Yes, it's so bad. <br /> <br /> Then I do not know what to expect from Steve. My friends are still laughing at me for listening to his records. Is it time to start checking some Van Damme nut logs? If you want to watch this movie, rip your eyeballs and drop them in the toilet. The darkness is better than 89 minutes.
