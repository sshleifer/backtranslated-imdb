I really could not wait for this movie, but after watching it I was very disappointed. The best was when Stephen King was in it. Rober John Berk can not act to save his life or any of the others. A few shows even made me laugh! The movie was not what I imagined, after reading a book that was amazing, I imagined it was darker and more frightening. If I was Stephen, I would be really crazy! <br /> <br /> I do not know why they changed the ending, I thought the ending of the book was very good. If you found out that the cake killed your daughter, did not you feed it to anyone else ?! <br /> <br /> The book was much better!
