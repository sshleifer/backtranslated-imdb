This TV movie shows that there are bad movies. The only reason I saw it was to cover KTMA MST3K. This is the Super Bowl at the Superdome in New Orleans. However, no football is played at all and we see that behind the scenes there is nothing to be seen. With many stars in this movie it did not matter. I really do not know why I watched it.
