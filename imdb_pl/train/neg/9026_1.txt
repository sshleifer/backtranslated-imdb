This must be the worst direction I have ever seen. The close-up can be a very powerful shot, but when each scene consists of close-ups, it loses all its impact. <br /> <br /> Tony Scott has a beautiful setting for work, Mexico's background, canteen, beautiful estate in which Anthony Quinn lives, and dusty towns where Costner is going through his revenge. Unfortunately, we can quickly see only these places before the camera goes to a large, gigantic head. Even the transition scenes in which Costner travels alone through Mexico are fast approaching approximation. <br /> <br /> The score is too dramatic and intrusive, it dictates all the emotions that we should feel. The story itself should be served much better. Among other things, too many people jump out of nowhere to help Costner - it's just bad writing. <br /> <br /> This is a typical plot of the thriller, but many others have adopted the same and did great things with it. Wayner Costner's No Way had a slightly similar plot, but it was a much better movie. <br /> <br /> The ending was completely anti-climatic and suffered from the most melodramatic cast of the film. This movie will never be great, but if we see more of Mexico and less gigantic heads, this movie could be watched.
