ET's obsession with Dannielynn Smith is vile. Leave the child alone. With all her constant attention, she will probably grow up psychotic, depressed or worse. Think about Princess Diana and how much she wanted privacy. Now the poor little rich girl, Ashley Olson, wants to be alone. No wonder Greta Garbo became a loner and said, "I want to be alone." How much ET does this little girl do? Is ET nothing better to report? I bet there are many people who really do not care about the color of her birthday cake and balloons. Incidentally, I have never heard that Anna Nichole won any of these court cases over the will and its downfall. Who pays for the lifestyle of Larry, Howard and little Dannielynna? Could this be ET?
