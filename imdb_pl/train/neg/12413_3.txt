I will not say that this movie is terrible, because I've seen worse, but it's not even decent. <br /> <br /> The plot is very misleading. I really could not understand what was going on and where it was going. When the movie ended, I was scratched over my head. I watched until the end of the loans to see if they had something after them, which could explain the case, but when the loans were over, that was it. I felt like I was shaken from one weak point of the story to another in the whole movie, with little or no transition between them. <br /> <br /> Character development is very shallow. I could not understand when someone was angry or had a grudge against someone. I could not say whether half of the characters were to be drunk, stoned, mentally handicapped, or simply had an evil actor who would portray them. It seems that this movie is based on stereotypes (in the margins, it's hard to avoid them when you're making a movie about a rock band singer) who SHOULD facilitate character development because many other movies have already illustrated the suffering of a battered child or heroin addict trying clean yourself. Stereotypes are easy to visualize, which explains why so many bad movies tend to abuse stereotypical characters. On the other hand, this movie uses stereotypical characters from the left and right, but then tries to keep them as incomprehensible as possible. <br /> <br /> Another problem with characters is that they seemed to be rejected without explanation. I think it's okay, because so little time has been devoted to developing characters that I really did not have the opportunity to meet any of them, so I never really missed any of them. <br /> <br /> And finally Sadie singing. It's terrible. The music on which she is based is not a prize winner, but she is usually drowned out by screams that are released from Sadie's vocal cords. I swear there is one point in the movie in which she sings the song for at least 10 minutes. I really thought I would have to turn it off during this howl. <br /> <br /> As a whole, this movie is misleading. Characters are underdeveloped, Georgian acting is wooden and stiff, Sadie's figure is torn from one bad situation to another, with no story or explanation. The music was unbearable and I can not think of any good reason to watch this movie unless you want to experience cinematic pain.
