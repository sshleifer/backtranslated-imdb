I can not believe that someone thought that there is something original or interesting in this film. I'm a science fiction fan, just like the next guy, and I can enjoy even old movies with funny houses, as long as they're written by someone other than a monkey. (See, for example, my great review of Altered States [1980].) <br /> <br /> A monkey could better explain why I should seriously consider the basic idea of ​​this movie for the second time. The problem is not that the producers had a low budget - that they did not care. <br /> <br /> Now to publicly humiliate worthless magazines whose glowing reviews appear in the box: <br /> <br /> Chicago Tribune <br /> <br /> San Francisco Chronicle <br /> < br /> San Francisco Bay Guardian <br /> <br /> (Actually, I like to read the last two.) Still their movie The credibility review went through the floor, but I know that if I ever make a movie with a handheld camera, tacky story and stupid effects, I will show these journalists and remind them what they said about Conceiving Ada.
