I was expecting the release of this movie in the same way as any Broadway fan. I waited and read reviews for many months about award-winning performances. I mean the stars of Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Danny Glover ... the movie can not be smaller than 4 out of 4 stars, right? WRONG! I was definitely disappointed with the finished product. The film did not match the commercial noise it received, and the only saving grace was Eddie Murphy, Anika Noni Rose and Jennifer Hudson. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy's James Brownesque performance saves the movie as soon as it hits multiple stops and Jennifer Hudson's performance forces you to pay attention every time it's on the screen. Her performance "And I Am Telling You" was the only moment in which I felt a well-deserved hum. You crouched when she begged her not to have a good man who would let her stay in the group and in his life. According to many reviewers, he steals the film from more experienced actors and deserves all the awards he receives for this performance. Anika Noni Rose was also a strong character with a great voice and comedic talent. <br /> <br /> In turn, Jamie Foxx and Beyonce Knowles held their performances. Foxx's acting abilities seemed to overtake his unusual performance of "Ray," and Beyonce Knowles was on a long photo shoot or filming, posing and flickering in the film. Her performance was not strong enough to take care of her at any point in the movie. <br /> <br /> The film was too excited, 30 minutes and 1 song (solo "heartfelt" Beyonce with Jamie Foxx) too long. <br /> <br /> DH - Vancouver, WA
