Nothing could save this movie, not even Superman. <br /> <br /> Ten years ago, special effects would be amazing. Better director could get more feelings and better results from the actors. But nothing but dragon feeding could fix him. Intrigue holes, bad lines, terrible pace, endless repetition of the same shots of the CGI dragon strolling in the corridors ... ugh. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs.
