This game was made by Sega. Made by Sega I did not expect too much, but I also did not expect this trash. For starters, the camera angles work against you in this game. A motorcycle is a way to get around. A motorcycle is the worst part of the game. Whenever you run into something, you just stick there and do not move. You never fall off a bike or ruin yourself. The main character hardly speaks, although he has a voice that suits him. The graphics are horrible. You ride through trees on a bicycle. The camera makes it impossible to fight the enemy. This game would not even be worth borrowing.
