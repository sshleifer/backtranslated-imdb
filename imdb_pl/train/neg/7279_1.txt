I just saw this movie on a local TV station (TV8 "Big Chuck and Little John" in Cleveland, Ohio). I have never heard about this film and decided to watch it. <br /> <br /> I do not know the thesaurus, it can even help me describe how the movie really is bad. The script is terrible. Acting, other than one of the two exceptions, is pointless, because in this material there is nothing that deserves a real effort. <br /> <br /> It looks like a few small ideas, leftovers from various sessions, where they were thrown into the mixer. It's not only funny. The aspect of "parody" is tense at best. Some references are almost outdated (even at the time of its release). No wonder I've never heard of it, it's really bad, worse than anything that happens in Saturday Night Live, MAD TV, or even In Living. it's a great example of how NOT to make a movie. Whatever you do DO NOT WASTE A CENT. <br /> <br /> Adam
