Poor Ingrid suffered and suffered when she went to Italy, tired of Hollywood glamor. At first she suffered from the torment of the volcanic island in STROMBOLA, an artistic failure that would have killed the career of a less resilient actress. And now it is EUROPE 51, another tedious exercise with a soggy sentiment. <br /> <br /> History does not do much for Alexander KNOX, in another ungrateful role of her patient husband, who tries to comfort her after the suicidal death of their young son. At least this one has better production values ​​and a more consistent scenario than STROMBOLI. <br /> <br /> Bergman is still attractive, but he is heading towards a more matronous appearance as a woman of a rich society. He is never able to cope with his son's sudden loss, despite the attempts of a gentle friend of a man. "Sometimes I think I'm out of my mind," she says to her husband. A bold statement in a movie that is completely devoid of humor and grace, but it gives us a sense of where the story is going. <br /> <br /> Bergman soon has the motivation to help the poor in post-war Rome, but being a social worker with poor children does not improve her emotional health and from that moment the plot changes to the worse. <br /> <br /> The overall effect of the movie is that it's not interesting enough to make a project for a major star like Bergman. The film loses its pace in the middle of the story when Bergman gets more and more distraught, and her husband suspects he is in two moments. The tale comes from here after he cherishes a stroller for his deadly illness. The last plot of the story requires her husband to put her on observation in a mental asylum. <br /> <br /> Ingrid suffers all this (overcompensation for losing his son), but that does not make sense. Not one of her best films, to put it mildly. <br /> <br /> Trivia Note: If she wanted neorealism with a mental illness, she could better accept the lead in THE SNAKE PIT, when the director Anatole Litvak was offered to her !! It would do more for her career than EUROPA 51. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: Another grim indiscretion of Rossellini and Bergman.
