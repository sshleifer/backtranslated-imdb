This short parody can be found on Elite's Millennium Edition's "Night of the Living Dead." Good, because I would never leave the road to see it. Changing zombies with bread sounds like silly, harmless fun on paper. In performance is another matter. The short one did not even make a giggle. I really never thought I would say, but "Dawn of the Son of the Bride Returning Revenge of Terror, Attack of Evil, Mutant, Alien, Body of Eating, Infernal, Zombified Living Dead Part 2: In Shocking 2-D" was a VERY better parody and wrong boring or so bad. <br /> <br /> My class: F
