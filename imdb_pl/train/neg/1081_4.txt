There is not a single sympathetic character in this whole movie. Is that the lawyer Kenneth Branagh plays for which we should pull? Well, let's see - we find out that he is the defender's servant who pushes criminals away from technical issues. He treats his coworkers like cattle, engages them in his own crisis (in this trial, kills one of them), threatens the safety of his children, threatens the new boyfriend of his ex-wife, tries to strengthen the police and school administrators - and all that for what? Because he was thinking with his little head! I really wanted my father and his band to defeat the lawyer and drown him in the swamp ... it would be a much more satisfying ending.
