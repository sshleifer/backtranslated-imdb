MAJOR LEAGUE: POWRÓT DO NIELETNICH (1998) ½ * <br /> <br /> Performers: Scott Bakula, Eric Bruskotter, Corbin Bernsen, Dennis Haysbert, Jensen Daggett, Screenwriter and director John Warren 100 minutes Rated PG-13 (for language i przemocy) <br /> <br /> By Blake'a French: <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, in the new comedy of John Warren, "MAJOR LEAGUE: BACK TO THE MINORS" is one funny scene. It consists of a sequence in which an angry trainer throws the baseball hard against the wall behind him to hit the cement and bounce off him, hitting him in the face. It's not much, but with the exception of a few one-liners, that's all that this movie has to offer ... enough to say. <br /> <br /> This film is not only structurally handicapped, characteristically undeveloped, predictable and badly written, but also simply bad. Even non-critical members of the audience will hate this movie with everything they get. He is so familiar that he is not funny. <br /> <br /> How many times do you have to do the same movie about sports? In recent years, we have seen the same material in the movie "Air Bud: Golden Receiver" and as bad as this movie, it's even worse. At least "Air Bud" was family-oriented. "Major League Back to the Minors" is too vulgar for a healthy family to see together on a Sunday afternoon. It's too childish for adults. Who is this film for? Teens? Elderly? People who are so desperate for entertainment would rent something like that? <br /> <br /> The film, like many others, has one basic point that it seeks to achieve: team work conquers everything. Yes, and it's a great moral to try and prove it. It is a pity that we have seen it already and so many times over and over we have so little talent and intelligence that their cheerleaders are men in ballerina costumes. Where stupid announcers create their own "routine comedy", muttering one of them like "They are sucking", "It's kids, a quick ball has time for an hour glass", "This guy fell off the ball for a moment find something he lost - maybe it was his mind "" Somebody needs a nap "and" you always see the sunset as beautiful as this game ". Where the heroes have so little significance for themselves that we never know them by name. And where the only honest lecture scene about teamwork is so unaware that it is almost funny. <br /> <br /> "Return to Major League for minors" is so bad; it stops its trite ending in the middle of a good closing sequence. A good baseball team is back, they are going to win and - the power expires. For a moment I thought this piece of rubbish had come to an end, but in fact its false final scene only exists to add minutes to the time of the run. The film essentially consists of a series of unrelated sketches that throw so many rotten jokes that they are not funny. There is another kind of funny dialogue line in which the trainer and player talk to each other, why a long-time wrestler is no longer wanted in this position. Coach response: "You're too old, too slow and too fat." The player's reaction is to die. But this scene certainly does not make this movie worthy of attention, and it certainly is not worth a cent of your money. <br /> <br /> Here is another horrible stop in this genre of the movie, another one who is doomed to his own scenario, who failed before seeing, and another who is so familiar that he seems deja vu again. <br /> <br />
