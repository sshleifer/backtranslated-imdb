I saw most of the RMFTM episodes as a teenager in the "Cliffhanger Theater" acting after midnight at a local station a few years ago, and then again when the Mystery Science Theater riffed on it in the early 90s. Time was not kind to him. <br /> <br /> I can certainly take into account the special effects that were quite impressive for a 50-year-old series (IMO Commando Cody's flying scenes were better than George Reeves / Superman in his TV show). I can also include "acting" and fighting choreography. except for the guy who plays the ruler of the Moon Men. He is incredibly unsuccessful. It looks and behaves like a guy who comes to repair your installation, not a despotic ruler of an alien race. Even the damned dialogue works well - everyone ratters like firecrackers, without wasting time or pauses for "thought" or "introspection." Because everyone is doing it, the viewer begins to draw after some time, and even to my modern sensitivity, it does not bother me too much. <br /> <br /> What irritates me is writing and drawing. I'm not talking about solar weather on the moon, or rockets fueled with baking soda, or about a flying costume with "up / down" and "fast / slow" buttons. I do not even care about the shame of the resolution for the fans who finish each chapter. I am talking about the fact that our supposed heroes are stupid than fence posts and have no accumulated memory. And the fact that although the dialog box rolls like an express train, the plot continues through the same movements. <br /> <br /> Dig: Commando Cody and his pal are the tip of a secret science lab, whose job is to protect the Earth (or at least the US) against the cunning invasion of strangers. But his office has no security guards or security checkpoints. They do not even have locks in the front door. So the bad guys walk in RIGHT and overcome the shit of Cody and his staff ... not once (probably understandable), but FEW times. They even move his assistant during the second attempt. And they are never smarter. To further prove my point, let me show you how Cody jumps into his flying suit and flies, getting into trouble and never seems to catch anyone. He does it over and over again. Cody is also flying his moon to the moon (the assistant comes to cook), he stays for about 30 seconds and immediately turns around and returns. Cody gets one of the guns of the Atomic Ray ... and immediately loses him again for the bad guys because he could not care about him. And so on. <br /> <br /> And you would think that if Cody's efforts were so important to save the US from the Moon Men, he could ask for several soldiers with rifles, a few helicopters and a tank or two to support him, instead of working all the time with the local police. It was supposed to be a military operation, but they behave like another episode of "Gangbusters". <br /> <br /> It's rather hard to bear. I appreciate that the creators were seriously limited by the scope of their history by the budget and time constraints ... and I appreciate the fact that Cody is actually quite a hard hombre (although he loses half of his fistfights). But I can not stop shouting "DOOR! BLOCK DOOOOR !! "when gangsters simply enter his laboratory or try to blow up a ship and there are no security measures at the landing site ... even fences (!). <br /> <br /> It's still OK. Of the three TV series of the Republic I watched, "Phantom Creeps" had a better storyline, and "Undersea Kingdom" had more atmosphere (hah!) And a better character than "Radar Men", but that's OK. <br /> <br /> BTW ... why do people "Radar"? They did not use radar, they used atomic weapons. Should the title not be "Atomic Ray Gun Men From The Moon?"
