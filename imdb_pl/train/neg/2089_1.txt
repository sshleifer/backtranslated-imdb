Of course I watched BG. I loved S1, I enjoyed Season 2, Season 3 was OK, and the last one I liked. Yes, there is a spin-off show! I did not know about it at all, one of my friends told me about it. I was very excited. <br /> <br /> I watched the first 3 episodes ... What a trash! A feast for teenagers. There is no science fiction ... well, almost none. At the end of each episode, we can see Cylon. That's all. Who cares? Have they decided that the target audience for the next program will be women under 18? Boring religious nonsense, talking, moans, complaining ... and a few others. <br /> <br /> It is sad that there is nothing to watch at the moment. Ruined gate, BG over ...
