Imagine a scenario - you're in the cinema just because you're in Washington for a weekend and it's raining and you're ending with museums. You think you can see the Sarah Marshall movie as a trailer, so you do not have to engage your brain. It's sold out. Options? - Work in a bank, in Bruges, The Leatherheads or Prom night. You saw Bank Job (a surprisingly decent movie about the robbery) and in Bruges (again quite good), so you have two. You do not feel like watching Clooney or the pretty office running in football uniforms from 1930, so are you going to see Prom Night? Wrong. Take $ 8.50, come to a stranger in the street and ask him to hit you in the face for $ 8.50. It would be better spent money. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's more like a comedy than a horror / thriller or whatever it is supposed to be. If I financed this film, and they showed me that in the end I would not know whether to laugh or cry. Probably both. Insulting someone's intelligence ... my roommate laughed loudly from the majority of the film, and as far as acting was concerned, they might as well have been able to throw robots (or maybe dogs) into roles, they would be more realistic. The detective must be probably the worst actor I've ever seen (Ben Affleck and Hayden Christansan (I hate his acting so much that I do not care if you write his name). <br /> So in short, "it's not good"
