When I heard that Dukes of Hazzard has to be reworked with current actors and a solid script, I was like "okay, I'll give him a chance, it will not be better than the first, but we'll see what happens." I saw what happened. I saw a great concert with In the late 1970s and early 1980s, which was a classic, essentially humiliated by Hollywood, it's very sad that Hollywood scriptwriters can not come up with something original today, it seems they're taking part in a great concert that has a great target group and they are trying " REMAKE "classic show, HEADS UP Hollywood ... DOES NOT WORK !!!! Anyway, more about the show, I think they could have played a better actor than Sean William Scott (Stiffler from American Pie) to play Bo. I'm sure that John Schneider is definitely disappointed with how his character has been depicted and exploited, plus, Get for real, Johnny Knoxville, as Luke Duke, how low can you go? an actor who played nice Luke, it disgusts me. In addition, I will give Jessica Simpson a beautiful woman, but her acting sucks. Catherine Bach, who played the original Daisy, was a wise, sexy, strong, stubborn and good southern girl IL. She was a model for every little girl who grew up! (I was the owner of a doll and a jeep - thank you so much !!!) Anyway, Jessica Simpson played a clever ass, 2-bit whore as Daisy Duke. Daisy was never blonde. Why did they have to quit. Jessica Alba would play great Daisy Duke. She can speak with a great southern accent, and she is great and would do a great job. In any case, I would like to say that this movie caused a violent explosion. I feel that I have been cheated by paying $ 8.50 for tickets and should give me back the money. If you like Dukes of Hazzard (original series), do not see this movie. It will upset you. CMT (country music television) plays Dukes replays all the way later at night. So set up your TIVO and go with the real thing, not the imitation on the big screen in Hollywood.
