This film is a twisted nonsense of a movie in Japan about a dysfunctional family that ends with a strange brutal visitor who is currently sitting and watching 4 family members at the worst possible time. In this movie, nothing is sacred, with sexual drugs and violence stretched to such a limit, I am surprised that censorship has passed. <br /> <br /> In general, I think that we will like only those who should not be more encouraging than any supposed basic message for the rest of us to consider. A movie that aims at the worst element in society and is, in any case, complete ... Disappointment from a man who has done sublime films, Dead or Alive and Audition.
