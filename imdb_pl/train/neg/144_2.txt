It is impossible to describe how really, really, this movie is really bad. It is a pity that I really sat in this movie, this very tiring and predictable movie. What's wrong with it? Action: There is not one show that would even be close to being sub-par (at least they are all very nice). Soundtrack (song): "If we get Orgy on the soundtrack, everyone will know that they are watching a horror movie!"; Soundtrack (score): Okay, but anyone with a keyboard can make a good soundtrack today. Do not even start with "What the hell?" Moments, here are a few: The killer can move at the speed of light - the door opens, the actress spins, no one is there, turns away, something sits in front of her; Now, where the killer appears with the drill, really great! The creators of the film get points for at least connecting it, but can I really believe that the killer devoted some time to find a socket where it can be connected. Where did you get the drill from? I can talk about how bad this movie is, but I only have 1000 words. I will give 2 out of 10 stars. One star for making me laugh and another star for the whole cleavage. Seriously, do not waste time on this one.
