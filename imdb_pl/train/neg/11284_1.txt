I usually try to construct reasonably well-founded critics of films, but I can not believe that this has passed the scenario. Dialogue is frightening, very suspicious acting, accents are just awful, and direction and pace are bad at best. <br /> <br /> I do not remember when I last saw a movie so bad. Joseph Fiennes, like him, might just have killed his career as soon as it began. <br /> <br /> Dr. Moreau's island was no worse than the trash.
