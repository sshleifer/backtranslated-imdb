It is hard for me to believe that someone would put this film in the same context as the Exorcist. Where the Exorcist was subtle and frightening, Stigmata was blunt, clumsy and too formula. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most visually beautiful movies I have seen for some time, but the images do not form up a spiral of patronizing exposure that makes it unbearable. <br /> <br /> My interest in this movie reached its peak when it was compared with The Exorcist, and my visit to the official website increased this interest. The website contained many stories about "real" stigmas throughout history. However, the stage by scene, the movie is so obsessed with the pursuit of "authenticity" that at first it becomes comic and then even difficult to watch at the end. I began to be suspicious when a priest who was entrusted with investigating potential miracles enters a beauty salon where our would-be heroine cuts her hair and apparently flirts with the priests. <br /> <br />. Story: A woman without faith in God begins to receive Christ's wounds (Stygmata) and is amazed and upset by this gehenna. The priest is sent straight from the Vatican to investigate. Is Frankie possessed by Satan or a vessel for Jesus Christ? <br /> <br /> The only miracle in this movie is that it eventually ends.
