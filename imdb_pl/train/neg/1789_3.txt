Although I liked Bing Crosby in other movies, I find this movie particularly furious. Maybe because I come from a different era and another country, but I thought that Crosby's continued reference to the Good Old US at the beginning is pleasant, banal after a while, then finally annoying. Do not get me wrong - I'm not anti-American at all - but it seemed that the English could not do anything good and / or needed this brave, so clever American guest to show them the way. This is the story of "a fish out of water", but unlike most of these types of films, this time the "fish" has the advantage. To be honest both for myself and for the film, I watched him several times in a few years' interval and I make the same impression every time. <br /> <br /> (I watched another film by Crosby at night - The Emperor's Waltz - and it also caused the same reaction in me.) And to my surprise even my wife - for what is worth the American - recognized the attitude "in "Crosby's face as irritating." Roosevelt, as she put it. <br /> <br /> When it comes to starting a movie, it's special enough for the day, and the supporting cast is of course very good. The scenery and music are also good, as are the great costumes - although I agree with the previous reviewer that the wig on William Bendix looks awful (photo Moe of The Three Stooges). <br /> <br /> In total, it would be a much more pleasant picture for me without the attitude of Bing Crosby, but because it is practically in every shot, it's hard to sit in this movie.
