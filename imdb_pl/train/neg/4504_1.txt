A slow, boring and one-dimensional movie! A good casting with a banal dialogue, boring story and soulless direction of the Marshal! The conventional and predictable history of the most famous form of prostitution from the Asian continent lacks heart, new insights and depth. The main character looks out of place due to her tiny contact lenses and stunning contact lenses. The lexicon used by geishas is forced and a bit too sophisticated due to the limited exposure to education. The story lasts and lasts many hours, trying to convince you to this little, boring, flat, Asian girl with a chest that is the best Geisha, they really say in the movie "She's going to be a legend." The film is just boring, it is beautiful to look at, it has very few interesting moments, how much you can find when going out for cigarettes. Essentially, if you do not believe the messenger, you will not believe this message, and this girl has not filled her shoe! Borin, boring, skip it!
