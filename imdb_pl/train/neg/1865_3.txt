What can I say, there are class B movies and there are class B movies, and this definitely belongs to the latter. However, it is obvious that even the filmmakers know that this is not a reliable movie (look at the credits), you can forgive him. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy is basically killed by the convicted psycho killer. She accidentally mixes her genetic material with some experimental acid that connects and gets lost in the snow. The killer now takes the form of a snowman - if you can believe it. The snowman, Jack Frost, is in the village town of Sherif, who put him behind bars. In this way Jack Frost kills half of the city. <br /> <br /> This film lacks real horror, and the same effects remind me of movies from the 1950s. Only this makes it worth laughing. Film to kill time.
