As the front cover says "Village of our times, for our time". <br /> <br /> I had to study this film version of Hamlet right after watching the Keneth Branagh version and it was a really disappointing experience. <Br /> <br /> This version has a different approach to several aspects of the game, including sexuality; one very VERY homosexual Osric and an interesting interaction between Hamlet and Ophelia. I think that for this time (1960s) it was a very well made version of Hamlet, but it can not match the full version of Branagh. <br /> <br /> just note ... I found a video in my local video store (in Australia) and I'm actually looking for a DVD Keneth Branagh to buy if there is such a thing. If anyone knows about one, tell me.
