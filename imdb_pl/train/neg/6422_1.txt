"I just watched this movie last night and I do not think I would ever think the same about any of the actors involved because this movie will stuck in my head." <br /> <br /> The above video statement can be considered good or bad. I mean, every time I see Tom Cruise or Demi Moore in the movie, I think about "A Few Good Men," which is a good thing. Now, every time I see Ron Perlman or Kristy Swanson, I'll think about "Tinseltown", which is a VERY bad thing. <br /> <br /> I picked it up, thinking it could be something intelligent, or at least chuckling me, and with Arye Gross and the mentioned Swanson and Perlman I thought at least it would not be bad. It can be said that the film was made in the size budget of Wheeling, Indiana (Where? Exactly.), But maybe they used every dollar to make a good movie. WRONG. <br /> <br /> This movie is NOT funny or entertaining in any sense. It's just there and there are 84 terrible, slow minutes. <br /> <br /> Characters are paper thin. You almost care about ANY of the heroes, and because the host is two Hollywood-fighting writers who have two struggling dream writers who wrote it, you need to know about them. Ok, two REAL writers know everything about the screen versions of themselves, so they think the audience does. They do not even think about character development, except to try to connect this story with "Gilligan Island". <br /> <br /> The plot is not original. Two guys live in a warehouse center, where one of them stores a bed, and there are about twenty other people living there. The rest of the story is made up and stupid. Have you seen "National Lampoon National sins"? The second story with Joe Mantegna concerns a television writer who can not find a good story about a television film, so he creates one. Now replace the screenwriter of the television writer, transforming Mantegna into annoying actors in the middle of his century, and take the comedy and you have this movie. <br /> <br /> The actors are trying. Kristy Swanson is in the movie for maybe 10 minutes and still gives the best performance in the film. It's still hot, but it would help if she actually played in the movie instead of constantly creating CAMEOS. As for everyone else, I do not think it's the actors' fault because they have BAD material. <br /> <br /> Go to see the movie National Lampoon, but stay away from this movie.
