Absolutely fantastic. <br /> <br /> Now, before the legends of cinematic purists choke on their lattes, let me expand. Although I liked it, it's just one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and it's definitely the worst movie I've seen in the cinema (an impressive claim, because I remember seeing Daredevil on the big screen). The two leaders (Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert) were unconvincing at best, and at worst even horrible. Of course, they were not helped by the script that had as much emotional depth as the single Daphne & Celeste and the characteristics that were as convincing as the defense of OJ. The plot (to stretch this term a bit) was thin to nonexistent, and the "gore" scenes, though undoubtedly brutal, were irrelevant and ridiculously exemplary. What conspiracy revolves around the twenty-something model (Cuthbert) who is kidnapped, imprisoned and subjected to various internal tortures, both mental and physical. Torture scenes look like disconnected fragments, and the emphasis was on shocking rather than frightening the audience. Although there are really very few positives to derive from this film, its salutary features are the disadvantages that make it such a scary movie. I have never heard a more loud audience in the cinema. Within twenty minutes, all the cinema was at the seams and it remained so. For my part, I left, flushed with laughter, supported by a film that rose to the top of the terrifying filming. Regardless of how you look at it, it is a truly cinematic achievement and a plan for future directors who want to describe in detail how not to make a movie. <br /> <br /> P.S. I did not mention that I was able to get to the movie for free ... so I can afford it. I was still tempted to ask for a refund ... it was really that bad.
