I really wanted to like this movie because critics were rude <br /> <br /> (to put it mildly) ... but it was awful. Really terrible. Poor <br /> <br /> worked, flawless scenario, cack passed the direction ... Watching this movie was <br /> <br /> like watching a car accident - you want to look away, but keep watching <br /> <br /> because you want to see how sloppy it will happen. The car is broken <br /> <br /> and there are no survivors. On the plus side, the photos <br /> <br /> were nice, made me want to go on vacation, even to clean up the damned <br /> <br /> of this damned
