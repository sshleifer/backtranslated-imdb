With Knightly and O'Tool as leading, this movie had good opportunities, and McCallum as a bad man after Knightly, maybe a bit of a strain. But they threw it all out on the stupid evening frill and then on the festering remnants of the war. It was, of course, a completely superficial, beautiful English country and seaside, or not. The mistake number one was to throw Knightly out early in the movie, when she could easily play someone a few years older, instead of choosing someone older by ten years to play the role. They missed all the chances of a great conflict between the cast, and instead stupidly pulled out simple and cheap elements of the heart.
