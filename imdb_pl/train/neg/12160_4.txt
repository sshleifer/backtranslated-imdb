It happened to me on a rainy Sunday, intending to tune in to something else. Out of curiosity, I used the comments here and saw that I was watching them until the end. I really did not do it with intention - it was one of those movies where you're "fascinated" and you watch it for "the next few minutes" until you finally just look at the end. And accusing him in most of these comments made watching more fascinating. One comment, in which a person really liked, seems to be only the result of the likes of Ladd and Spano and their previous roles. But nowhere to be found anywhere magnificent - history, performances, and especially absurd courtrooms. We all know that Perry Mason (before Raymond Burr passed the Â£ 300 mark), and Ben Matlock, have some freedom in making a robbery in the courtroom instead of being a boring confinement to the dashboard. And Matlock especially admits the privilege of joining often to exhibits, simply going to the jury and showing them before the judge and prosecutor were even informed about them or shown. No real judge or prosecutor would agree to this. <br /> <br /> Both Perry and Ben almost always finished the proceedings by twisting the confessor's real confession. In fact, Perry almost always did, but often Matlock would simply present the overwhelming evidence of the real culprit, make "reasonable doubts," and then leave the cops and prosecutors to act against the guilty party - sometimes in cameras, sometimes alleged at the end of the concert. <br /> <br /> But having said that, Holland Taylor's histrionics and the amount of freedom that was provided to her in the judicial part of the story made Matlock / Mason's actions more like slow, often boring details, such as those seen in Court TV and real courtrooms. <br /> <br /> Every character in this presentation was either bland, unpleasant, unpleasant, boring, unlikely - or any combination of two or more of them. <br /> <br /> The ending was the most banal, absurd, and even stupid, possible conclusion - but again fascinating for that reason. Ladd and Spano are attractive people, and t.v. movies would look like the best forte - probably best in the roles of the second leader (probably better if they were "3"), even in this place. Taylor could be cast as an aunt or the mother of one of them. Give 1 star for the story / performances and 3 additional for the fascination factor.
