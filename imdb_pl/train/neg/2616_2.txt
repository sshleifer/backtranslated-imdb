Remember the name of Kevin Lime - and please, never let <br /> <br /> refer him again. Timing, pacing, editing: everything is hopelessly wrong. <br /> <br /> Three or four decent professionals (next time, guys, get away from the set <br /> <br />) can not do anything to save this movie from amateurs like Alice <br /> < br /> Evans and the type of production standards that you can expect from <br /> <br /> youth programs for children on British television. <br /> <br /> The biggest mystery: music. Score so inefficient, unsuitable and <br /> <br /> badly matched to the tone of the movie, we seriously wonder if this is a <br /> <br /> case of sabotage. Add an acoustics that apparently roar <br /> <br /> uncomplicated from one microphone, and a director who only <br /> <br /> remember to add sound action off screen, and we <br /> <br /> have at best a ratio of money to the result of <br /> <br /> recent years.
