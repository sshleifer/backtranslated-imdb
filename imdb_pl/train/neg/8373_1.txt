I was not impressed by this film, especially since I went to the cinema with my family in good faith to see a film that was 12A certified here in the UK. To my horror, this movie was full of embarrassing sexual jokes. (Which is not a problem for me as an adult, but it is not good to watch with children). This movie was sometimes very primitive with farts jokes, crotch, etc ... and for the most part of the movie it was not too funny. <br /> <br /> The premise of the movie is that Calvin Sims, who are a 2-inch dwarf, get out of jail and steal a huge diamond size, but then they are forced to put it in a woman's purse. The rest of the movie shows him as an abandoned child entering this house for women so he can get back this diamond. <br /> <br /> So far, I've enjoyed the majority of Wayans Brothers production - but this movie certainly takes biscuits. <br /> <br /> A little good advice - wait for a TV or cable
