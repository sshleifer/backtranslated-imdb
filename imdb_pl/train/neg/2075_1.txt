I must admit that when I went to see this movie, I did not have too high expectations. But despite my low expectations, I was completely and completely disappointed ... <br /> <br /> Basically, Luke Wilson is a hot shooter who has a tendency to go out with slightly crazy girls. There is a slight reference to a girl who persecutes him, but this is largely for this character. I do not really think about it, because it would probably be as underdeveloped as the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> So in the Rainn Wilson subway (which I liked before this movie) convinces him to talk to the "hot" girl, Uma Thurman. This is at least weird because everyone can clearly see that Uma Thurman is not in the "hot" category. <br /> <br /> Rainna Wilson's performance is also not "hot". Usually I am in favor of his acting, but even he can not save this movie. His character was nervous, unrealistic and quite annoying. You never know if the writers tried to make him a comic token in a gay closet or just desperate. It was almost painful. <br /> <br /> But in any case, someone stole her purse when she leaves the subway, and Luke Wilson, who is a charming savior, runs after the robber. Now we all know that Uma Thurman is a superhero or "G-Girl", as they like to call her in the movie. I am still surprised by what "G" means, but we will leave it to the debating forum. <br /> <br /> The sex scenes that I assume are supposed to be fun, but I'm finding out who has such sex? They almost throw a bed through the wall because of Umy Thurman's "passion", let's say. It makes my head hurt, but I do not think "it's really hard to understand". <br /> <br /> When Uma offends Anna Faris, calling her a "whore", I did not have a debate about it. Besides that he can not choose movies properly, he can not act and is based on the fact that he is blonde and typical. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would have left the theater if I had not paid $ 8.75 to see it. The characters are typical and have no chemistry, especially Uma Thurman. Someone should let her know that just because you move your head a lot does not mean that you are playing. <br /> <br /> Also the screenplay and plot could use a lot of work or match and some lighter fluid. I began to be ashamed of the actors and their dying careers. In general, if you value your money, and your self-respect does not waste time on this pathetic film attempt.
