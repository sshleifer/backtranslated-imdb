The vampire supporter wants to call her after falling in love with a five-dollar bitch in this extremely low-budget horror comedy. I can not explain all the positive comments for this movie. I am scaling it for mass hallucination, but it is still disturbing. The only redeemer (and here I am extremely generous) may be grandfather, who is the only half-liking figure in this mess. Do not waste your money or time. In fact, it's one piece of advice if Troma puts it on a DVD, but it will NOT do it alone, most likely it's nonsense. <br /> <br /> Troma DVD Extras: comment with Omar and Kirk; the second comment with cast and crew scenes removed; pipes; troma interactivity; radiation march; Clip from "Terror Firmer"; Theater trailer; Trailers of "The Rowdy Girls", "Teenage Catgirls in Heat", "Cannible: The Musical" and "Toxic Avenger 4" <br /> <br /> My class: D
