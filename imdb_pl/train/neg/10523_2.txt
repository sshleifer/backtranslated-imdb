For the first forty minutes, the Empire is really shaping: it seems to be a strong, confident and relatively unknown gangster. At the time I did not know why, I thought it was good - but now I'm doing it. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems of this movie is that it is completely and totally unpalatable. I do not mind movies with psychos and other things to prove a point - for example, Jackie Brown - but they're all so terribly shallow, but it's obviously entertaining. You literally feel that there is a knot in your stomach. Another hero is a serious problem. He is pleased with himself, arrogant, and yet - ironically - not so bad. He does not seem tense enough to be the killer of a drug-dealing woman. The fact is that at the end of the day this movie is completely pretentious. Not clever, not clever, just boring and meaningless - this colossal mess should be avoided at all costs. <br /> <br /> * with ***** (1 of 5)
