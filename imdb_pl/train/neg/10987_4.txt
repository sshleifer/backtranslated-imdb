I loved Margaret Atwood's novel "The Robber Bride" and was delighted to see that there is a movie version. The woman hangs the policeman's boyfriend for her own murder, and his buddy, a former policeman's journalist, tries to clear his name by checking the crazy female friends. It is fortunate that the script of the film is being repaired by Mrs Atwood's clumsy conspiracy, focusing on the history of these two men, the victims of intriguing women ... <br /> <br /> Heh. Okay, you have me. If these guys are listed in the book, and I'm pretty sure they're all composed for the movie, I'll eat a cover of dust in my hardcover. Apparently, the three main characters in the novel are not enough to move the film. Manipulations of Zenia are not interesting, unless we see that they happen to a man, and the life of a man is fucked up. Roz, Charis and Toni tell their stories - a man. Because it does not matter if the man hears them. <br /> <br /> I liked characters from the book. It hurts when they see them pushed aside to tell a man's story. I do not usually look for feminist angles in the media and I tried to enjoy the movie the way it is. If I did not read the book, I could enjoy this movie much more. So if you like a policeman and a former policeman, and want to learn more about them, you have no luck. Read the novel if you want to enjoy juicy prose, and the characteristics subtly translate into the story. It's the same plot: the movie dug it, ironed it and sprinkled it with masculine anxiety. It's like Zenia's revenge on Margaret Atwood.
