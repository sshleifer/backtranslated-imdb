I had the misfortune to waste 10 pounds by buying a new SS movie on DVD: Attack Force. Now I can usually suspend my belief by watching such films. A pinch of salt and a few beers on dark evenings on the sofa, watching a noisy shooting late in the evening, is perfect for one alpha male like me. I bought this movie thinking that I would see cool martial arts and shoot them. <br /> <br /> Did I burn. Segal is old and distended, the conspiracy was ridiculous, even according to SS standards and excluding him from acting Segal (as at the beginning) is extremely tragic. It is so horrible that half of his voice was named by a man who sounded HOW THAN HIS HIM. Either the SS can act no more (the point of dispute) of the crew was so terrible in their tasks that they could not record the sound correctly. The voice would leap between Mr. Whisper Segal and the man who is speaking in Honda ads! <br /> <br /> A wise topic is not a problem, because most action movies work according to the same assumption as this, nothing new. An ordinary mixture of heroes who will die horribly like cannon fodder and stereotype bad guys waiting to be torn. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie, as if you were avoiding walking in front of a speeding train or a dose of H5N1 flu. <br /> <br /> Total rubbish. <br /> <br /> 1/10 <br /> <br /> That was a warning for public health.
