One of the worst movies I've ever seen with Robert De Niro, The Fan is a senseless stereotype of making movies. Trying to turn or twist this genre with the absurd plot lines of a crazy fan who has become psychotic - the movie revolves around nothing. (spoiler) We believe that an idiot wielding knife has access to and killing a baseball player in a luxury hotel without a witness, security or cameras? The film is nonsense, trying to tug our strings of hearts through a baseball hoopla, ending in derisively crude and fun. I'm not sure what all the actors thought, when they got on that razzie. This is as big a mistake as it appears. Stay away if you prefer to think in your movies
