While others may argue that by looking at Bilal's other works, it is better to appreciate this film, but it fails in one major way. It does not work alone. The plot is a mish-mash that confuses symbolism with the substance. Here's an idea that starts with a specific story. Then, the symbolism of the craft around him. We start with two different narrations, the female who somehow becomes a human, a "god" who is judged for some reason, but will get the last wave to Earth and this mysterious hero John, who seems to develop a "center" just behind city ​​limits. Why? None of these questions are given. But do we care, no. There is no development that would like us to feel into any form in history, the closest we get to Jill and even then the development is at best uneven. Unfortunately, the film is drawn into the whole impressively visually (what it is), but at the expense of motivational development. I would like to see it prescribed by someone who could walk away a little away from the material and did not have to feel that every picture must be in the picture.
