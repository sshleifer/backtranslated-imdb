If you want to make a movie, the threat will be real. Do not surround your patsy band Bonzos. There is no credibility here. The story is boring and unbelievable. Acting is even worse. I thought I was watching Arthur Lake (Dagwood), who is one of the worst actors in history when I saw the main character. Well, at some point, he has to face the music and fight furiously. I do not care. Do you? All these long scenes take place in this raw office (furniture made of cardboard or masonite). People talk, smoke and do nothing. Most of the action takes place within five minutes. After this end. Do not worry.
