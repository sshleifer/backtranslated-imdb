Title: Zombie 3 (1988) <br /> <br /> Directors: mainly Lucio Fulci, but also Claudio Fragasso and Bruno Mattei <br /> <br /> Starring: Ottaviano DellAcqua, Massimo Vani, Beatrice Ring, Deran Serafin < br /> <br /> Review: <br /> <br /> To review this move and get a good background, I have to start from the beginning. And at the beginning there is really George Romeros Dawn of the Dead. When Dawn appeared in 79, Lucio Fulci decided to make it an indirect continuation and call her Zombie 2. This movie is what we know as an ordinary Zombie. You know the one where a zombie fights a shark! OK, after this movie (called Zombie 2 in Italy) came out and spent a lot of cash, the Italians decided the hell. Let's make even more zombie movies! These things are playing a cake! So was Zombie 3 born? Confused yet? The story on this subject is simply a reworking of the stories we've seen in the many American zombie movies we've seen before, the best comparison that comes to mind is Return of the Living Dead. Let's see ... the government is experimenting with some toxic gas that will turn people into zombies. The canister is released into the general population and shebang! We get a lot of zombies missing the human body. A group of people are starting to escape from zombies and go to an old, abandoned hotel. They must fight the zombies to survive. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of trouble when filming this movie. Above all, Lucio Fulci, a beloved godfather from Italy, was ill. So he could not finish the movie in the way he wanted. The film was then presented to two lesser directors Bruno Mattei (Hell of the Living Dead) and Claudio Fragasso (Zombie 4). They did everything to spice up a movie that was not so good anymore. You see, Fulci himself, who did not really have the heart and soul of this movement. He was disappointed. He switched to the producers and basically said: "Do what you want, damn it!" And God loved them, they did it. <br /> <br /> And that's why ladies and gentlemen have such a bad zombie that the great Fulci is considered his "director." The main problem in my opinion is that it is just a senseless bore! There is no content in it! After the first few minutes in which some terrorists steal toxic gas and accidentally release it, the rest of the movie is just a handful of empty, soulless characters, without any personality running away from zombies. Now, in some cases, it can be fun if # 1 zombie makeup and zombie action is really good and fun, and # 2 is involved. <br /> <br /> We do not get neither! There are some inspiring moments, for example when some eagles get infected with gas and start attacking people. It was cool. There is also a scene with a flying zombie head (which by the way contradicts all logic and explanations) and a scene with a zombie coming out of the pool of an abandoned hotel and crushing the legs of poor girls. But other than that ... the rest of the movie just falls on the butt. <br /> <br /> Endless scenes that do nothing to move an already existing plot. This was my main problem with this movement. The sets look unfinished, and the art direction is practically non-existent. I hate it when everything looks so damn unfinished! I like my movies b, but this one really went even below it! It's closer to the Dump level if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Zombie is getting better? Clean nonsense. All zombies are Asian actors (the film was filmed in the Philippines), so you get a group of Asian zombies. But this is not a big problem, because the film has been set on the Philippine islands anyway. It's a zombie look that really sucks! For some reason, everyone died with the same clothes. And what suits the creation of zombies is the bunch of black make-up (more like streaks) on the faces. One or two zombies had a slightly more complex makeup, but he was still not good enough to impress. It's just a bunch of nonsensical splattering on the faces of the actors. So this movie is not only slowly turning around, but the zombies look like nonsense. It's supposed to be dead people! In any case, for those who expect a normal cold in fast traffic, do not expect it here, because it is usually someone else. And the two involved (Mattei and Fragasso) did not really put heart and soul into it. In fact, when you see the DVD add-ons, you'll see that when Fragasso is asked about his memories and feelings about the movie, he does not even take it seriously. It can be said that he is ashamed of this and repeatedly says that "they just had a task to do and they did it". And that my friends are the last nail in this movement. There is no love and no heart in creating this movie. Therefore, you get a half-broken, crappy zombie. <br /> <br /> Only for the most complete or people who want to have or see any zombie movie that has ever been made. Everyone else, do not even bother! Rating: 1 out of 5
