A miracle is actually quite possible to look at. I mean, it's bad. It's really bad. But while the original was so bad-it-ruined-my-bad life, it's so bad-it's badly entertaining bad. That's right, that's enough weak praise. Production values ​​are broken on the whole planet, acting is excruciating, and the satire Romero-wannabe can not think of which side of the ecological fence is mocking. Internal logic takes the place of the back of the head, throwing itself out of the refrigerator, the time of virus incubation varies depending on the "plot", zombie-acting bullets or not, zombies with the power of speech or not. Gore is a draw, of course, but the frameworks are so miserable that it's annoying. The dialogue sounds like it has been translated by the same computers that control the user's manual, and the scale of the zombie invasion has nothing to do with the ingenuity of Romero's films. The whole is complemented by a terrifying synthesizer note. Absolute garbage.
