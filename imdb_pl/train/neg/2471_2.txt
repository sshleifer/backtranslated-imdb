I remember how small I was when I was in the camp and crashed under the stars. There was always someone who had a good story to tell, which included the forests that surrounded us and always frightened me. Well, when I found Wendigo in the library, I checked it, hoping that I would be one of those movies in which supernatural beings visit people in the forest, as well as the stories told in the camp. To my horror, I was so far from the truth. Wendigo is really angry. The story begins when a family of three goes to their winter cabin, which looks like your normal suburban home and does not look like a cabin in the woods and falls into a deer. Well, it looks like the local reds have actually hunted this deer and are very upset about our urban people. The film devotes a lot of time to tracking the everyday activities of families, not the movie. Only in the last 15 minutes did we actually have some action involving "wendigo". My suggestion is that you stay away from the movie very much. It will allow you an hour and a half.
