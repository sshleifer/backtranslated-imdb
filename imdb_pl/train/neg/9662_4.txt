I usually read reviews before watching a movie. Guess what, I did not do it before watching TLB and I have to say that I was very surprised to see the above average rating on IMDb. I discovered that it has a complete lack of history. You just fell into it (and, unfortunately, not in the way Saving Private Ryan threw us into the movie), and this also has a sudden end that was very unsatisfactory for me. <br /> <br /> I have admitted, wounded soldiers looked quite real to me, especially considering the low budget. But be prepared for laughter ... Some guys are being thrown into the air after the explosion, as if they were Olympic gymnasts. A corkscrew in the air or somersault during World War I is a bit too much for me, especially when it is performed countless times during the movie ... <br /> <br /> But the parts that really made me laugh, I almost cried were the scenes containing melee combat. Screaming and screaming German voices ... unbelievably ridiculous. It seems that they are spoken by one actor / voice contractor, because they all sound exactly the same, and it just sounds like a "typical" German voice. <br /> <br /> I absolutely do NOT recommend this movie to anyone, except for people who just want to laugh a little because of their sad and banal quality.
