As a girl, Hinako moved from a small village to Tokyo, leaving her two best friends, FumiyÄ™ and Sayori. She returns as a young woman, surprised that Sayori died when she was a teenager. She merged with Fumiya and they are terrified when they learn that Sayori is mysteriously resurrected on the Shikoku island. Oh, boy. I hired it because I like Asian horror movies and I think that Chiaki Kuriyama is a great actress. Unfortunately, if I were to describe Shikoku in one word, it would be "fruity". This movie is stupid, boring, poorly filmed, devoid of imagination, and above all distrustful. Kuriyama has a minimum time on the screen, how resurrected Sayori, and her character has little work.
