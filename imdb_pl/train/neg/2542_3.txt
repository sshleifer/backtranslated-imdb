... not that all Disney movies are rubbish. <br /> <br /> In any case, I saw "Legend of Boggy Creek" and I loved this movie. When I heard that it has 2 sequels, I was delighted. I finally found a copy of it and watched it one night. I do not understand how they can create a sequel of a horror movie with the grade G. The original is a film / documentary about Fauke Monster and can scare everyone. "Return" is intended for children and should not be watched by anyone. I do not remember the story too well, because it's been a long time since I watched it and I will not watch it anymore, but ... It's about those hunters who come to town and want to kill Bigfoot. Three young children slipping out of the house to stop them. A great monsoon is coming. Hunters are wounded, saved by children. Then everyone is hiding in a boat with a large piece of tarp above and trying to wait out the storm. Then Bigfoot suddenly appears and does something really sick. I do not want to ruin any of them, but it's not scary. Well....
