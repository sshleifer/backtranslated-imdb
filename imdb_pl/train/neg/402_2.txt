Describing this movie as junk is unfair. At least cheering through rubbish can be an absorbing hobby. This film was neither absorbing nor amusing. <br /> <br /> Kevin Bacon can act brilliantly, with the chance, so he must have settled the IRS bill when he agreed to this horrible scenario. The tale of a mad scientist about the "Empty Man" has already been told, told better and told without resorting to so many absurdly expensive special effects. <br /> <br /> Most of these special effects appear to be built around the transparent anatomical dolls of men, women and dogs that can be bought in the early seventies. In Britain, they were sold as "The Transparent Man (/ Woman / Dog)", which may be the place where they received the title of the film. <br /> <br /> Clever special effects, horrible scenario, non-existent plot. <br /> <br />
