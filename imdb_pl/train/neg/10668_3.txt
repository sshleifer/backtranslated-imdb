This movie had great actors in it! Unfortunately, they forgot how to act. I was hoping that the movie would be better, but the game was done so that it was doomed from the very beginning. It seemed that the actors were reading the script all the time. Maybe it was a musical score or the director himself, but one thing is for sure - the make-up artist must get a different job! The powder was so thick that it was obvious that it was filling the faces of the actors! I would not recommend this movie to anyone, no wonder he never went to theaters. Cuba Gooding Jr. James Woods is embarrassing you that you did not give everything. The plot was great, she needed a lot more.
