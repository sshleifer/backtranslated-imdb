This film is about clay (Ching Wan Lau) trying to catch a super smart thief (Ekin Cheng), who is blackmailing the insurance company led by Kelly Lin. Basically, regardless of what plans a policeman tries a thief, he knows them beforehand. This film, in which handsome actors, beautiful acting actress and good shots from Hong Kong participate, really does not matter. Everything is flashing, and the flash quickly becomes boring. I lost all interests by one-third of the way to the film, and there is no redeeming quality, except for cinematography that looks good. Consider just watching this movie if you can do it for free. Consider also stopping the movie watching 20 minutes, because the end is the same: BORING. 6/10
