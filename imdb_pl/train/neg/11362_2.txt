"Fly Me To The Moon" must be the worst animated movie I've seen in LONG TIME. It says something since I took my son to see all the animated releases for 4 years. The story is to be generous ... banal. The voice works terribly, it sounds sweet too. Humor is a variation of the Romper Room. Animation is satisfactory for Nickolodeon type cartoons, but this one is released on the big screen, not cable TV. <br /> <br /> Gets only 2 because of its three-dimensional effects. Some of the scenes had a mildly stimulating picture, but in the past we have seen a lot better. I also question the insistence of filmmakers to make the characters detach themselves from the screen, not on most scenes. Although it is interesting at first, it has become exhausting after three or four years. It seemed that the creators treated me indifferently. <br /> <br /> I will say it, however, it was quite a nice soundtrack. And for me, my son was not too crazy either. Bad movie.
