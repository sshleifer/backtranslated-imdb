I watched it on DVD in the original language with English subtitles. Either the subtitles were very weak, or the actual dialog does not create too much history and gives the opportunity to develop characters. There are a lot of HK stars in it, but the movie does not need their presence to make it better or worse. Just bad. Bright and colorful scenes made in CG are attractive for pure colors and brilliance, but they can soon become overwhelming. If something like that makes me think about a child's film with its constant cg firewall, battle scenes and gossip. I'm sure I understood what was happening in the film, but the whole story was rather bad.
