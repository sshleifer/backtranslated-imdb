A wicker man. I am so angry that I can not write the right comment about this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot was ridiculous, poorly connected and completely - just bad. Nicolas Cage ... shame! I assumed that since you were in it, it would be at least decent. It was not. <br /> <br /> I felt that huge parts of the film were left on the cutting room floor, and even if it was complete - the movie was just bizarre and stupid. > At the end, you are agape on the left side, mind dazed and offended by good taste. I have never heard so many people leave the theater on the opening day with so much hatred. People complained about it in small groups in the mall, four floors below the theater at the entrance. It's so bad. <br /> <br /> I heard this in comparison with Glitter, American Werewolf in Paris and Gigli. My boyfriend was so angry that he did not even talk about it. <br /> <br /> Grrrr!
