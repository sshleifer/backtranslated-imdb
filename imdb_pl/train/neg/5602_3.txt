"Pandemonium" is a parody of horror, which is more stupid than funny. Believe me, when I tell you, I love comedies. Especially comedy parodies. The 'Airplane', 'The Naked Gun', 'Blazing Saddles', 'High Anxiety' and 'Spaceballs' trilogy are some of my favorite comedies that impersonate a particular genre. "Pandemonium" is not there with these movies. Most of the scenes in this movie made me sit there in stunned silence because the movie was not that funny. There are a few laughs in the movie, but when you watch a comedy, you expect to laugh a lot more than a few times and that's all that the movie aims at. Geez, "Scream" had more laughter than this movie and it was more of a horror movie. How strange? <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of four)
