I saw it at the premiere in Melbourne <br /> <br /> It is shallow, two-dimensional, unmoved and hard to believe, considering the subject, boring. The actors are tolerable, but they did not have much to do, given the very restrained and impressive script. For those who might be afraid that Ned Kelly will be over-intellectualized, you can comfort yourself with the fact that this story-telling is completely devoid of any literary depth, narrated completely on the surface and full of central cast standards. However, it also does not work as a popcorn movie. His stimulation is too distant, and his craft is too weak to satisfy even at the level of the mundane actor. <br /> <br /> I very much doubt that Gregor Jordan could sit back and say, "this is the best I could do with the material. <br /> <br /> Ned Kelly is a fascinating character, just like the national reaction to him. Probably a folk genius, perhaps a class warrior, perhaps a psychopath and probably all these things, has dominated true Australian mythology for over 120 years. Once again his story failed on the big screen. <br /> <br /> That's life.
