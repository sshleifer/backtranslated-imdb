In the UK, a DVD with the HRGD002 code from 2002 was published. On the cover, no ASIN, VFC 19796 on the disk, no IFPI code in the inner edge. <br /> <br /> Probably a simple transfer from VHS. <br /> <br /> There is no point in commenting on an adult movie. But this contains a minimal storyline, and the characters are reliable. He was shown in the United States in ordinary cinemas. <br /> <br /> I saw it in Pensylvanni in 1975. <br /> <br /> As such deserves a place in the Encyclopedia of Films. The DVD has no special functions or subtitles and was probably made using VHS tape as the source
