It's horrible that some people can get away with this stuff ... It's one of those overrated things ... And I hate things that are overrated, which are not good ... Why can not we have more TV shows and movies that have a story and excellent music that is well-written and really concern something? It takes a lot of people to make this movie, the series and the band possible, and these people are wasting their time ... It seems that the bands are getting younger ... I watched how small they were and I thought they had 5 or 6 years. It's sad that kids are playing so young ... They are still too small ... Performances require a lot of work and they have many other things that they have to do with their lives ... The idea of ​​having a very young band is awful ... They have to stop having such bands ... I do not like this idea, nor the children themselves ... They are very annoying, very young, and their name is "The Naked Brothers Band" People who are involved in it, and people who support it , everyone lost their mind ... When this band is shown on TV, change the channel, and ask for bans ... <br /> <br /> And I know it's a very boring commentary, but rozumiesz ... <br / > <br /> This team sucks. . Receive Rid Of It ...
