Why did I go to see this movie? To be honest, because Jim Carrey was in it and used to make funny movies that made me laugh, so do you really blame me for having expected it again? In addition, the premise, funny trailer, Jennifer Aniston's involvement in the star and the fact that it was a huge state hit encouraged me. <br /> <br /> However, as my "summary" suggests, I was disappointed. For various reasons. <br /> <br /> Reason 1: It was not funny. In a 2-hour movie, I laughed for about 5-10 minutes ... all together, I spent the rest of the time thinking, "I really should have some ice cream." I admit that it may be wrong to judge Jim Carrey in his previous films, but what he really expects when he creates Gem, such as "The Truman Show", "Liar Liar", "Me, Myself and Irene", "Dumb and Dumber "," The Mask "and movies" Ace Ventura "produce in Bruce Nolan's words such an average movie? <br /> <br /> Reason 2: The role of Jennifer Aniston has been guaranteed. I meant hi! He's been in the public eye for about ten years, and in this movie has about four lines to say. Wrong. <br /> <br /> Reason 3: One word - Clich√© <br /> <br /> Reason 4: Accidental placement of specifically American references - Jimmy Hoff, Walter Cronkite "sweeps the week" - is a clue specific to the native charm of the film. "The teenager says" no "drugs and" yes "education - it's a miracle! Do you want to see a miracle soon? Be a miracle! God tells Bruce that this is a heavy fondness that seems to plunge in the US, but it may be met with harsher resistance in markets that remain subtle. In addition, I still go to school and this statement suggests that all my friends are miracles ... or maybe we just have brains? <br /> <br /> In this movie, there are enough funny moments for Carrey to make you giggle and stop Bruce Almighty from total misfortune, but we advise you to start lowering your expectations.
