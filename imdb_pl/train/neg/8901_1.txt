I will make this short and sweet ... this movie was sucked !!!!!! <br /> <br /> I watched part 1 earlier and thought it was one of the best films ever, I released it 9 10 stars. So I thought that the second and third part would be good continuations, I was wrong. This movie bored me to death and it was so different from the first that the plot was continued and that's all. It was like bad results from part one or something like that. <br /> <br /> I love Walken, but here I felt sorry for him. I was very happy that Glenn Danzig is in this movie, but do not blink that you miss him. There was a full cast full of shit actors and people I do not like, such as Eric Roberts and Jennifer Beals. However, it was a breath of fresh air to see Ethan Embry, he is one of the funniest people in the world. <br /> <br /> This movie will make you like the first bit less, so do not watch it because you feel you owe it to him, being a fan of part 1. I will be waiting a few days before watching part 3 and I'm praying that is better than this crap. <br /> <br /> The last scene of the movie with lightning was one of the most beautiful things ever shown in the film. Scroll forward or go to this if you can not stand the first part. <br /> <br /> 1 in 10 stars - it was awful!
