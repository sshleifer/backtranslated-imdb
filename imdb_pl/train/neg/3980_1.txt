No, I'm not kidding. If they ever propose a film idea, they should be expelled from the studio. I'm serious. Their films are exactly the same in each of them and rely only on traveling to foreign locations, with a problem that they easily solve, hoping for popularity and acquiring new boys. Think about it. If you've ever seen a movie with a different story, please contact me and give me his name. These "movies" are bad excuses to be on television and go to other countries. There is a reason why films never go to theaters. I'm sure when they were really young and they did a little O.K. movies, some studio boss bought all his rights for 15 years or something, so now that they are 17, they can make films in other countries whenever they want, using the studio money. Let me advise you, STOP FROM MARY-KATE AND ASHLEY! IT'S YOUR OWN GOOD!
