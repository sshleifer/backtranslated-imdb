This is the first Guinea Pig movie from Japan and in my opinion is the worst. A group of guys torturing a girl for a few days before she finally kills her. At this point, I will say that these films are NOT real! There are fake horror movies that try to be as realistic as possible. <br /> <br /> Scenes are disgusting, but in many cases unrealistic. For example, when they kick a girl on the floor, we can clearly see them kick and pat the floor near the girl! And how stupid it looks! The sound effects are also unrealistic and do not make sense. Other scenes include animal intestines cast on a girl, a girl exposed to loud noises for many hours, nail breaks, worms on the wounds of a girl's body, an eye pierced and mutilated in frightening detail and the like. A very sick and vile movie and there is absolutely nothing valuable or significant to the film. This first entry is the most sick and most amateurish guinea pig, although it is not as bloody as the next part, Flowers of Flesh and Blood, which tries to be as shocking as possible. <br /> <br /> Guinea pig: The Devil's Experiment is probably the worst thing I've seen, and the nearest snuff is. It is still (of course) faked s (n / t) uff, the only difference to the real "snuff movie" is that no one dies or hurts in this film. I can not recommend it to anyone because it is so very and loathsome. Those who consider this a great horror do not understand anything about the cinema and its true meaning. I saw it as a curiosity (like other parts of the series) and now I know how insignificant this trash is. They only work at the level of shock and it is not a very valuable film achievement. Devil's Experiment is probably the worst movie I've seen, and Mermaid in a Manhole (Guinea Pig 4) is probably the most disgusting movie I've seen. In my book, they are very extreme, but that's all they are.
