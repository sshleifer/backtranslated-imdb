I was one of those "few Americans" who grew up with all the wonderful creations of Gerry Andersen. Thunderbirds was a great series for this time and he would make a great action / adventure movie if only the authors could figure out where to direct it. <br /> <br /> I expected it to be a romp, do not expect it to aim for such a low age group. Like Lost in Space, it could be both stunning visually and exciting. He should have focused on the greater action / adventure and purpose of the original series ... saving people in trouble. <br /> <br /> Instead, he focused on Alan saving the day instead of his brothers (who were too young in spite of everything in relation to the original). The breakthrough part was Lady Penelope and Parker. I did not really care about the characters from the original, but I was grateful to them in the film. They stole the show! <br /> <br /> I've always liked Thunderbirds more than high-tech than stories, and even that did not give me enough time. I would like to see more cool gadgets. <br /> <br /> But then I'm just a big kid ...;)
