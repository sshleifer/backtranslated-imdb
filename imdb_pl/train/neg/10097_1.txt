I stopped at BB and picked up 4 zombie movies that I watched over the weekend. Now I understand that the effects will be tacky, the action will be sub-par and the sets will be suspicious. So I do not expect much. But he should have at least a story. Stories do not cost anything but time ... apparently they did not have time. <br /> <br /> "Zombie Nation" had 5 zombies that appeared at the end of the movie, and all looked like new prostitutes. The zombie image on the front cover will NEVER appear in the movie. Watching him was absolutely exhausting and had nothing to offer. <br /> <br /> The running time is only 81 minutes, but it felt like 2 hours. According to my wife (who could have heard the video only since she was on the computer in another room), it sounded like a zombie porn .... what if you think, sounds a little disgusting ... but it was not even that good. <br /> <br /> The only suggestion I can make is that the writer tried to do too many things and ended up with inconsistent mess. <br /> <br /> I ended up with free rental and I still feel cheated. I rated this as 1 in 10, because IMDb does not allow me to use decimal numbers.
