EXTREMITIES <br /> <br /> Image format: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio format: Mono <br /> <br /> A woman is changing tables for a would-be rapist when she gets into an attack in her home and he is forced to decide whether to kill him or inform the police, in which case he could be released and attack again. <br /> <br /> Fans of exploitation who can expect another rough "n" ready fantasy rape in the style of DAY WOMEN (1978) will almost certainly disappoint EXTREMITIES. It's true that Farrah Fawcett's character is subjected to two unpleasantly long-lasting attacks before he has an advantage over his attacker (respectively slimy James Russo), but the writer William Mastrosimone and director Robert M. Young take these unpleasant scenes only before revealing the dilemma informs the moral core this production. Will their final solution be in court? Maybe ... <br /> <br /> Based on the stage play, which apparently left the actors after every performance of bruised and bruised, the movie does not try to open the narrative and is based on a limited set-up for the main action. Acing and technical credits are okay, although Fawcetta's overly-toned performance will not play effectively for viewers who can rely on it to ensure that outrage is outraged.
