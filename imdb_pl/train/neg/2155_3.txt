Good night, Mr. Tom starts in an unbelievably beautiful village in the south of England, where the sun always shines. Before we start to have an idea about the period, we hear a radio message about the declaration of World War II. Soon, a steam-blowing train brings children to refugees from London, and when shy William is tied up by a reluctant, harsh old Tom (who just turns out to have a golden heart), our story begins. <br /> <br /> And what a sentimental gadget. In fact, this is just an old formula of a buddy with a strange couple. Are there any new stories written? <br /> <br /> As suggested, there is almost no period in the village, and not much more in London except the strange, old ambulance. And certainly there is no sign of terror in Blitz, because the citizens of London politely report to the anti-aircraft shelters. Even if the local teacher's husband was considered missing, he was probably killed, and he is later brought back to life. <br/> <br /> I found "Goodnight, Mr. Tom" dressed and obvious, and John Thaw's accent conjured up the image of Ronnie Barker with Two Ronnies with a straw in his mouth doing the "country bumpkin" accent. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, my wife enjoyed this movie for reasons that I did not like and I was looking at fellow-imdb ​​reviewers who seem to me to be in the minority of one. <br /> <br />
