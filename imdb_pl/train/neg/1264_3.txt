This film does not have much in common with its predecessor, Robot Jox. This must also be the reason why its most common name is "Robot Wars" and not the alternative name "Robot Jox 2: Robot Wars". <br /> <br /> "Robot Jox" was just a fun movie to watch, because it had a good idea that giant robots are fighting each other in the near future. This concept has been abandoned for this film, and instead contains a completely boring story, which is not too original or cleverly written. It is a pity that he really tried to differ so much from his predecessor, because otherwise it could be a more entertaining movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Like "Robot Jox" it is a B movie, but with a big difference is that it is not very good. Perhaps it is also related to the fact that "Robot Jox" was created in the 80's, when films B still had a certain charm and class, although the film was released in 1990. It really can not say about this movie. It's just bad, badly done, it looks bad and it's not exciting enough. It also has an ending that leaves you thinking. "This is it? That's all? ". <br /> <br /> What the film lacks is really a clear main story. Perhaps a good main villain would be a good idea and a few other things, such as a real point in history, action or friendly heroes. <br /> <br /> Seriously, what they thought when they chose the actors for this movie. All of them are simply not sympathetic in their roles, and especially Don Michael Paul is annoying as the main character who acts as if he was a gift of God to a woman and Mr. Perfect, who can compete with everyone. Could not they just get the actors from the first movie? <br /> <br /> In the case of such a futuristic movie, with the concept of having large battle droids, this film certainly has no effect. If they put more and more actions into the movie, the movie would be at least more entertaining to watch. Instead, we now have a movie that does not impress in any way possible. <br /> <br /> You can better watch the episode of "Mighty Morphin" Power Rangers to get more action and sympathy. <br /> <br /> 3/10
