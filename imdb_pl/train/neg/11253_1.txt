Interesting visually, but falls flat in the originality department. This tedious exercise in technology weakens after the opening battle. Jude Law has the charisma of a burnt toast, but in his defense this movie contains some of the worst dialogues I've ever seen on a big screen. In fact, the script is so poor that it still takes you out of the movie and makes me think about work, bills, my dogs, etc. There are many moments that scream in blue. Paltrow is as wooden as possible. It was possible to save it thanks to a quick dialog with noir film or in the camp. My only complaint with this technique is that the Black & White movie (sorry, computer) would help, because it looks like Turner is black and white. Just a big, dull mess. I would rather break my thigh bone than sit back in this endurance test.
