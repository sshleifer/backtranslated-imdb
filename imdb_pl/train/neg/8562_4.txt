CAMILLE 2000 <br /> <br /> Image format: 2.35: 1 (Panavision) <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> During a visit to Rome, a nobleman's love (Nino Castelnuovo ) falls in love with the beautiful young libertine (Daniele Gaubert), but their unlikely romance is opposed by the wealthy father Castelnuovo (Massimo Serato), and los zadaje tragiczny cios ... <br /> <br /> Sexy love story about the swinging sixties, adapted from a literary source ("La Dame aux Camelias" by Alexandre Dumas) by screenwriter Michael DeForrest and directed with the passionate talent of Radley Metzger who, like Russ Meyer and Joe Sarno, is recognized with redefining cinema parameters "for adults" in 60's and 70's. Using the scope format for the last time in his career, exploring Metzger's "la dolce vita" is rich in visual excess (pay attention to the emphasis on reflective surfaces, for example), although the sexual sincerity of the film seems disturbingly timid according to modern standards. The production values ​​are handsome and the performances are engaging and humane (Castelnuovo and Gaubert are particularly memorable), despite poor dubbing after synchronization. Despite being set in an unidentified future, the watery scenery of Enrico Sabbatini defines the film strongly in its time, and the score of the "wah-wah" Piero Piccioni has become something cultous among the exploiters. Ultimately, CAMILLE 2000 is an acquired taste, but fans of the elegant softcore eroticism of this director will not be disappointed. Another film for Metzger was THE LICKERISH QUARTET (1970), which many consider to be their best film.
