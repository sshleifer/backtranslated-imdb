After seeing Versus earlier, I had great hopes for Alive. The movie description on the back of the DVD jacket sounded promising. Alive did not provide. VERY slow development. Plenty of potential with cast and cool visuals. The assumption was intriguing, but the payment did not balance growth. Towards the end, I could do a lot more. Most of the movie simply "sits". Simply put, three of us were seated to sit and watch the movie, and for 50 minutes we tried to go to the end. He really needed more shock elements. If you're looking for Ichi the Killer or Versus fights, save some $ and a lot of disappointment.
