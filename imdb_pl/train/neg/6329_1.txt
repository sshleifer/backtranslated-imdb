I saw this cinema misery in the dollar theater with a friend in 1979 (When tickets were actually sold for 1 USD). This is the only movie I ever came out with (my friend, while the screen was idiocy, or the sketch of the "Laser Bra 2000"). Apparently, the reaction of my and my friend to the film was common. It's not that I've found a film offense (either as an 18-year-old or now), but rather that it is dumbfounded and clearly indecent, without even the unintentional humor that makes the Ed Wood movie possible to watch. This is the real reason why NBC refused to give her air, and not a failure to understand Mike's "vision" (unless his vision was to bring film supporters into bankruptcy). <br /> <br /> I was surprised by the fact that this movie does not seem to contain any published list of the "10 worst movies of all time". That certainly does mine. You have been warned.
