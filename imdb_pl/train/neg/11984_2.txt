Ugh! Another of the discs "cheated by the cover". I expected some kind of action with at least bears, cats and such on the cover. I do not have anything! Bad movie! it's because of the scenery; otherwise it would be useless. stump, threatening raccoon, crunching worms and (what a fool) digging a porcupine. And it will not be easy to pull out these feathers ... it sticks like fish hooks. He fought the bear at least several times (poorly). <br /> <br /> What was the flashback with this thing? This made the bad movie worse. I wanted to see a movie about survival, not some dramatic bs about a child suffering through a divorce. <br /> <br /> What else can I say? Well, maybe they should have eaten a bear or something like that. At least it would be more exciting. <br /> <br /> People, do not waste time.
