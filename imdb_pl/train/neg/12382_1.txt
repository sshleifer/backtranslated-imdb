Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn turned in graves if they knew that Guess who came to dinner was in theaters. Together with Sidney Poitier and Katherine Houghton, these four great actors made a great cultural statement from 1967 with director Stanley Kramer. This rip-off today is a joke. So a white guy from an excessively stereotypical Italian family on Rhode Island brings his African girl home (Insert GASP here) for his father's funeral. The reactions of his family members were obviously ... predictable. This movie was so painfully telegramsed from beginning to end that my girlfriend began to fake snoring to signal to me that she wanted to leave. Do yourself a favor and rent the original. Come to Wake.
