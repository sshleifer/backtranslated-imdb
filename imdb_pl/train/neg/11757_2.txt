Hi Arnold! it's a slow-paced movie and a bit boring. The story is not very creative. The figure of Paul Sorvino (Shenk) buys all decrepit, affordable buildings to build a giant shopping center, shopping complex and office buildings. This plot dates back to many films from the 1960s. This is boring. Paul Sorvino is not too exciting either, so the idea for him as a bad guy is not terrible. Gramps remembers something about a historical documentary, and the rest of the film lasts about 36 hours, when Arnold and Jamal have to find a document with Helga's secret help, whose father hopes to become rich thanks to Shenk's Mall. Children have to travel around the city by bus, so an exciting chase scene with a bus is not only stupid, but it emphasizes how this movie is written for very young children. Hey Arnold, TV animation is usually very funny and has enough humor to speak to adults. A TV movie is usually faster and more imaginative than the movie. Hey Arnold, the movie is about five times more calmed down and is a good way to sleep anyone, including children. Hey Arnold was difficult to stay awake until the predictable and completely boring conclusion. If you want to send your children to a totally offensive movie, that's it. I have the impression that instead of trying to make a 90-minute movie, producers began with a 30-minute TV drawing script and tried to extend it for 90 minutes. This story could certainly be described in the television cartoon. I hope Arnold will bet a better writer if he is ever continuing.
