Because this image is classified as "pure entertainment", and because there are many comments about it, I would like to deal with something related to the abuse of humor. We see that Marlon Wayans plays the role of a joker in this film. Certainly, as long as he was involved in the casting work, he always acted as a small man - the actor can change his usual outfit, but he can not change his physical appearance - and the latter can be an advantage when it is necessary. However far from what I expected, I saw a very masked picture pretending to have mistakenly revealed various aspects of a child's life through a forty-year-old criminal. And with a funny happy ending. So what's going on? Many of the elements are mixed up, some of them are violence, sex and criminal activities, the history of which is poorly composed and to some extent common sense: where is Vanessa, when the peace of her home is violated and her husband's life is being chased? In addition, the diamond is even bigger than Cullinan in the world! But the most nauseating aspect is the constant attempt to create a small man as a superman, showing his weaknesses. And they call it humor. The diamond is valuable, hard and delicate; you can not cut it with any other material, but only conquer the male goat with hot blood. Hence, there is no diamond anymore, but pieces of debris.
