I guess "Gunslinger" was not as horrible as most of the movies that the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" shows, but westerns are simply not the strong point of Roger Corman. A movie about Rose Hood (Beverly Garland), who becomes the sheriff in an old city in the west after her sheriff is murdered and has to fight the bad, the movie is quite predictable. John Ireland is Rose's new husband, secretly working for the shameless Allison Hayes (yes, a 50-foot woman). Dick Miller, star of Corman, as a postman also appears for a short time (currently Miller plays in the movies of Joe Dante). <br /> <br /> I want to confirm that you will probably want to watch the "MST3K" version really enjoy this movie. They had a great time with it.
