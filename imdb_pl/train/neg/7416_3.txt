The fashion designer stumbles over a cat and falls into the pool, hitting his head against something floating on the surface. With quite bad effects (it was a TV movie), it floats out of the body. It floats through a tunnel with rings of swirling orange smoke, and black stiff figures pass into its view (they look like mannequins in her apartment). I almost thought I was watching Jess Franco's movie ... When her friends make her come alive, the black arm grabs her wrist and has to fight to free her. When she is lively, she remembers everything and has an unpleasant bruise on her forearm. <br /> <br /> Shortly afterwards, the car is almost hit by an uncontrolled movement that appears on the pavement behind it. In Halloween, he decides to go to Mexico with his boyfriend. When she gets there, she is surprised that it is the Day of the Dead. They are upset by another American tourist who is following them, and he almost drowns them. <br /> <br /> The designer is encouraged to join a group of survivors who are close to death. Everyone has experienced the tunnel, but not black figures or repetitive ones that are close to escaping death. One of them is and is very restless. She also encourages her to meet her psyche. <br /> <br /> The doctor tells her about the people he calls "walkers" (the name of the novel on which he is based). These are people who supposedly died for one reason, that after the examination it turned out that they died for a different reason. So, they continued to walk after death, until they died again, but he blamed it for bad record keeping. <br /> <br /> I watched this in a 102-minute film and it was terribly long. I can not imagine that there is a 192 minute version! Perhaps if he were to be watched for two or more nights on television, it would be better to watch him in this way than during one sitting. <br /> <br /> I have read only one novel by Gary Brandner, Floater, and if so, it is representative of his work, he is not the most original writer. Floater had a common thread: he chose the child to kill people in revenge. Even the variation was quite common: she was chosen to die and kill people many years later in revenge for the grave. And in fact it has something to do with this movie, because the kid practices astral projection, and when he is drowned, he floats from the body like here. I do not know how From the Dead of Night follows his Walkers novel. I understand that Howling's films do not resemble his novels. <br /> <br /> It's quite a slow movie, and the special effects and photos are really limited by (presumably) low budget and created for TV disadvantages. There are many easily recognizable actors in the game. I also feel very outdated, more in the early to mid-1980s than in 1989. I think it is boring. A much better low-budget movie on similar subjects, which I believe was not so badly dated, is Sole Survivor (1983) (probably inspiration for films about the destination destined for 2000). It blows away from the dead night.
