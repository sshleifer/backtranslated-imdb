The magical, lyrical novel by Isabel Allende about the three generations of an aristocratic family from South America has been devastated. An extremely varied film that was made - mainly due to the great cast of Anglo actors, completely unable to perform the melodious Latin melody of Allende's characters, and the boring Scandinavian director's hand - was so uncomfortable in my own skin that I returned to the theater a second time to make sure that I did not miss something important that could change my opinion. To my disappointment, I did not miss anything. None of Meryl Streep, Jeremy Irons, Glenn Close and Vanessa Redgrave could get rid of the trap set for them by director Bille Augustus. They all looked perfectly stiff and resigned, as if, putting in the least effort, they expected to disappear unnoticed in the beautiful sets from the era. (Yes, the film was an art directed in the whole of his life.) It is interesting that the designer of the set design was allowed to place a blueprint of KFC products in the scene, which takes place around 1970 - before the KFC. It was then known under the original name: Kentucky Fried Chicken. Even forgiving what the hell is Kentucky Fried Chicken in a military dictatorship in South America in the 1970s? American fast food chains did not hit South America until the early 1980s. The "ghost house" should have been a 1993 movie event. Because he was so clubly and slavishly faithful to his vague idea of ​​what the novel represents, Miramax had to sell it as an artistic film. As a result, it was neither an event nor an art. And for this Isabel Allende should have been accused of rape.
