In any case, this movie is not as bad as "Perfect Stranger", but it just was not fun. He could not stick to one type of comedy - he jumped from SNL, to Adam Sandler-esquire, to a romantic, to a small guy who achieved a big score, to a slapstick, to a "comedy" type Loser. Although there were quite funny slapstick moments (falling from the hill), nobody was particularly funny or outstanding in any way. The Schindler's List was more fun (and seemed shorter). you never knew if Andy Samberg was going to be in high school, stop studying, or just lose at home with his mother - Sissy Spacek, in his worst choice of roles. And poor Ian McShane, a serious actor, if only I had to exchange only one, he got nonsense to read on the camera. The story stretches and is completely predictable until the end inclusive (without spoilers in the case when Adam Samberg's mother wants to see this). Do not spend ANY money to see this movie, or maybe Lorne Michaels will get a clue and start producing quality (Yes, Wayne's World and Tommy Boy are quality).
