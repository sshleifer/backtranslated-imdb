"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" is another "hi", so-called "warming up" and "out-for-rating" show that ABC had time to prepare. <br /> <br /> understand the problems that these families are going through. I'm sorry. But do not you think that the placement of four widescreen plasma TVs, three flat desktop computers, a swimming pool in the middle of a half-occupied courtyard and wardrobes full of expensive designer clothes is too big a BIT for any family? Of course, these families survived a lot. Of course, they deserve better things that they had before. <br /> <br /> But to be honest, the things that you and Pennington put into these houses are enough for the whole neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Another thing that really annoys me in this program is how you and his crew always have something good to say about every little thing that concerns family or family status. Storytelling to a person with a wheelchair that is "so strong" or "very brave" really is aging after some time. It may sound rude, but believe me; watch this program and you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> In total, this program is overrated. If you want to watch it, go ahead. This comment is just a headline of what you are watching.
