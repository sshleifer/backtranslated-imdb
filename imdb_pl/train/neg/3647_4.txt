It's good that I did not watch it when I was pregnant. I would definitely distort my eyes and / or vomit. It was terrible, mostly disturbing. Personally, I thought that the child was adorable in his own, twisted little way. But as my mother, I cringed when Beth stabbed her stomach and when Virgina kidnapped the baby during the third trimester with rusty utensils, no less. she almost cried when she scratched the cat's bloody pulp. However, as terrifying and sinister as a child, I supported him to survive. ......... ....... ......... ......... ....... ...... ... ..
