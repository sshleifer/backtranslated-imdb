It's a pity, I really like Kristen Cloke and Gary Busey. But the director failed to combine it. There is a lot of action, a lot of promises, but everything comes from hokey. The director did not do his job. The promising action comes out of the crag. That seems to have been invented in a desperate attempt to save the film. This version of "The Rage" (DirecTV recognizes it as 1996) is simply not worth the time to watch it. Another director would have done a better job.
