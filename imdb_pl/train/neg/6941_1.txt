This film is not only boring, but also very poorly made. The graphics are so bad that they are not yet the second rate - they are terrible. The characters do not show any facial expressions, the voice game is empty and soulless, and the story is absolutely gone ... well ... everything and everything. My 5-year-old likes it - but he thinks it's a bit boring. I agree with him.
