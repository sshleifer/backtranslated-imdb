The birthday girl does not know what she wants to be - is it a comedy or a drama ... she just does not know. What could have been a very funny or touching film ends on no man's land. The premise is so original that it guarantees a script full of interesting scenarios, but almost does not deliver any and ends up with peteria. It's a real shame if you look at the cast - it's very solid all the time, but it has no chance to shine. Very disappointing.
