After reading other reviews for this movie, I think high markers are probably paid studio footmen because the movie I saw was absolutely tragic, with wooden acting, poor scripting and predictable directing, one of the few pluses must be the stunning scenery, because in the movie you can see wonderful backgrounds with magnificent views and dramatic heavens and open prairies, unfortunately, when the most memorable thing in the movie is the part behind the actors, this must be a warning sign about the quality of the film, in total a very uninspiring addition to the western genre, which even at a very reasonable price can be obtained on DVD is best avoided.
