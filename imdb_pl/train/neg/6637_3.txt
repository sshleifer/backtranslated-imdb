They should call this movie ... Blondes who had to color their roots. Also the main character, geeze, too tight sweaters. Giggles. I thought the guy did a good job. I hope that this week we will find a good 8-star holiday film. Throwing darts. I had to laugh about it. We still have 3 additional devices to watch, maybe we'll get lucky. Oh yes, I quickly understood the guy and nailed him when he picked up the flowers, and then he left with his cousin. I told my daughter that they were on their way to the cemetery. How stupid was it that these two men followed them, spying on them? Frightening.
