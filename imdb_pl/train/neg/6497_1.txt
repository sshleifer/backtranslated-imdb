I had high hopes for this movie, so I took what was given with the grain of salt and hoped for the best. In about 1/3 of the movie I just had to give up, just the movie is a mish-mash of things happening for no apparent reason and everything is disconnected. I love movies that make you think, but this movie was just a collection of ideas combined and never really connected. <br /> <br /> Do not think it's David Lynch-esquire, as some would like you to believe, it's nowhere near that realm than some trippy. To say that it's an artistic masking of the fact that there is no apparent plot or story is just a way or justification for why you've wasted 1.5 hours of film. Acting was good, but it can not save the lack of history. I agree with one comment published earlier ... "it's like being in the head of another person ... when they're on drugs", in other words, nothing makes sense.
