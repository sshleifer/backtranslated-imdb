I just watched it. A few laughs, but nothing to write about. Jason Lee looked like he was having fun. The (long) reel of DVD gags almost exclusively consists of attacks of uncontrollable laughter. Selma Blair seemed to be hitting the time clock, but on the other hand, her character was supposed to be a stick in the mud, so "well done", I think? Jim Brolin was surprisingly funny. (Being married to Babs can not be a picnic.) The soundtrack was fashionable and eclectic. Larry Miller, who played Julia Stiles' father (funny), in 10 Things I Hate About You is also funny. He is great, but the best aspect of the film was to fill Julia Stiles. I could spend two hours watching her folded laundry and I feel like I'm doing it.
