There was such a buzz in the game show with Bill Shatner ... and especially in the wake of Deal or No Deal and 1 vs 100. So, of course, everyone had to tune in to see what the new game show was all about. What a disappointment! As Ben Stein says stoically, "wooww." <br /> <br /> The only sympathy in this program was the fact that you knew it would end in the end. Sitting for an hour was like going to the dentist ... you're looking at the clock in 10-minute intervals, just to find out that a minute has passed (but it seemed like an eternity) since you last looked at the clock. So why did not I just switch the channel? Well, probably for the same reason that most people do not ... out of pure optimism. I mean, no one really * wants * to think that a show with Bill Shatner can be so BAD. <br /> <br /> Personally, from the first 15 minutes, I never thought it was the kind of vehicle that will present the talents of William Shatner. My main complaint was that the set was so dark. Watching him made me feel depressed. You wanted to get a little excited, but there was no one like that. There was not even enough light on the set to feel the audience's energy (which you did not even see). <br /> <br /> Road Network: People do not watch quiz shows to heal their insomnia. .. watch the game shows to be excited and have fun. Do us a favor and lose it in the treasury.
