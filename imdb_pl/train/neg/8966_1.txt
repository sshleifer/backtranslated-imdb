The original "Cube" is a fantastic B movie rich in paranoia, fleshy characteristics and great performances at the highest level. It's terrifying, mysterious and cool. And perfectly in itself, without a stupid sequel like "Cube Zero". <br /> <br /> This third (!) film in the Cube series is partially retreaded (most traps are unfortunately recycled), partial aberration. To explain what a cube is is, it takes a bold step - something that has never been revealed in the first movie - but because the explanation is bland, I would prefer it to be kept secret. There are potentially interesting references to a society that exists outside of the cube, but never develop beyond the directions of a political and religious totalitarian state. So, what little social comment is flat and out of focus. <br /> <br /> What works? Basically nothing. Acting is a purely amateur hour, the pace is slow (how much of this movie consists of two nerds watching the screen?) And the effects of gore, while they rebel, do not convince. In short, "Cube Zero" reminded me of a fan of "Cube", a sloppy and sophisticated clone of a good movie that definitely did not need a sequel.
