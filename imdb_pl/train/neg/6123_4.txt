When I was a teenager, seeing this movie for the first time, I thought it was one of the best films ever. Of course, the reason for this is Bo Derek and her various demolition states in this film. However, now that I'm older, I can honestly say that this movie is awful. Remember, because Derek is absolutely unbelievably beautiful, and she and husband-director John Derek make sure you see her a lot. But when you take this aspect out of the movie, it will become one big boring ride. And Tarzan, well, he's all muscled, as you think he should be, but when he sees Jane (of course, Bo) for the first time, he does not know what to think. This is despite the fact that Bo is wearing a wet see-thru shirt and her chest is clearly visible. Tarzan would be the only primitive man on the planet who would have this problem. If you're looking for a movie that slips over a beautiful naked body, it can fill the ticket. If you're looking for a thoughtful, fun and worth watching movie, go somewhere else ... almost anywhere else !!!
