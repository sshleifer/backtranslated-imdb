The best in camp movies is that you know what to expect. It's like watching a professional wrestling match or a daytime soap opera or Jerry Springer's show: you can immediately follow the scanty plot, identify the cardboard characters and watch with satisfaction when all the plates are met. Sometimes, however, the director does something unexpected. It can be something extremely stupid or something strange, or something insightful. Director Makinen is there with the best camp directors and this is his best film. <br /> <br /> In Yon saalistajat everything seems to be together. There is nothing good about it, but it is still a coherent whole. The film never slows down - the action goes on and the blows are still coming. <br /> <br /> The strangest thing is that it does not make sense: some characters seem to be doing months while others only have spent an hour at the bar. This is partly due to the Finnish summer, in which the sun never sets, so you do not have the day to change into a night. <br /> <br /> Finally: there is a conspiracy somewhere. You may have to watch the movie three times before you know it.
