Another example of a complete waste of money is the British lottery. How commercial the movie was. The Film Council, which financed this unfortunate trash, should be immobilized on one of the closed stations in the London subway, for this stereotypical, gloomy figure could be involved in the film, a half-mutated thing of all the horrors that the director saw and felt able to imitate, especially Deathline. Among the many sins there is a fairly obvious failure that the main character seems to be compassionate until the last moment. A bit too late! Certainly all Development Directors at the UK Film Council could see this at the stage of the scenario. Add to that terrible acting and funny look of creation, and you'll get a perfect example of how not to scare you.
