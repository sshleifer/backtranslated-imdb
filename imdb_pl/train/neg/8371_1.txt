I think it's pretty safe to say it's the worst movie ever made. When I saw the trailer on TV, from the first moment I knew it would be a piece **** and it would be best to avoid it, but somehow I was drawn into it by some friends, I entered the cinema with low expectations, but I was hoping it would be a few cheap laughter, not to fall asleep during this movie. The so-called "jokes" in this video make the face nauseous, mainly composed of people who hit the face and crutches, the child looks strange and behaves like a horny gangsta and typical racing jokes that we see so often in today's junk comedies. The film is obvious, and history is not only impossible to believe, but also predictable and boring. The characters are very annoying and strongly stereotypical. I never want to see this again ******************************************** ************************************************** ************************************************** ************************************************** *************************** I would never like to see this movie again. If someone I see says he liked it, I'll physically hit him in the face
