This movie had something that sounded like a good premise: 9 people are facing their fears to win a million dollars. Unfortunately, it did not turn out to be a good movie. There are several scenes that are too long and really pointless, like a dance scene. A few scenes are just an excuse to direct the camera on the female parts of the body. Acting is bad, but some of them are funny in their horrors. The strange thing is that at the end of the movie turns into a 5-minute western, and finally the twists, of which there were several, do not make sense with the rest of the movie. It seemed that the director simply added things because he thought it would look great, while comfortably ignoring the movie's story to this point. It just did not make sense. The only horrifying thing was the old people dancing in the corridor, but it does not even come close to the rest of the mess.
