### Spoilers! ### <br /> <br /> What is this movie? In addition to editing controls and photos that fit the terrible story. The sad thing is that Denzel Washington's talents are wasted in such destruction. We have certainly been suggested how Mexicans can not save themselves, we need external, probably military, American forces. And we know that the father is a suspect figure, after all he is a Mexican, in contrast to his wife who values ​​Gniew more because he is an American. He killed them all, thinking she was dead. And she will not, of course, be a young child, and you should not hurt the sensitivity of a Hollywood fan. The only thing that prevented me from rating him below the "incredibly successful" (as one critic pointed out) was "Taken". The nausea of ​​such films will take time. It is in the assessment of such films that we must doubt the credibility of IMDb.7.7 for such a film and 7.0 for my own private Idaho. Conjecture! My will be in the range of 3.5-4.0
