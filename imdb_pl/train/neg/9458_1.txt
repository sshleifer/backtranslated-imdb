There are many comments that have already been published, telling me exactly what I felt about this movie, so I will not summarize it. <br /> <br /> "The Grinch" I thought it was wonderful - Jim Carrey is a really talented, physical comedian and being a versatile clever actor (in my opinion). On the other hand, Mike Myers laughs, annoying. I really liked him in the days of "Waynes World" and "So I Married an Ax Murderer" - but I never liked Austin Powers, and "The Cat In The Hat" just finished me off. <br /> <br /> This movie was awful - the gags were awful! unsuitable for children not only in adult content, but also because some of them were so outdated that they did not have fun for 50 years! The plot was sloppy, messy, messy! It is a pity, because the children were very nice, like "Mama". They probably could have chosen a better villain than Alec Baldwin - but he could have done it if it were not for the ugly, rebellious, over-performance representation of the cat by Myers. <br /> <br /> I mean - does Myers even look at the script? Was it written? It seemed that the other actors had one - but Cat just seems winged! <br /> <br /> On the other hand I would like to mention that the sets and props were great !!! But unfortunately they can not save this movie. <br /> <br /> Poor Dr. Seuss - the man was a genius! Do not ruin his reputation by adjusting his work in such a lazy, scruffy way !!! <br /> <br /> 1/10
