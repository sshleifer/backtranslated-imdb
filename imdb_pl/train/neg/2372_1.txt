An unimaginably stupid, unnecessary and humiliating closure of the series "Nightmare on Elm Street"! Part 6 is so incompetent that it seems that the director Rachel Talalay intentionally wanted to change the initial assumption of Wes Craven into one big bad and tasteless joke. This is not only the worst entry in the "Elm Street" saga; it is also one of the most embarrassing horrors ever made, and even offends fans of this genre! The story is stupid, figures are funny, the structure is cloudy and ?? primarily ?? special and visual effects resemble those from the Tom & Jerry cartoon. The sequences in which Freddy Krueger murders his victims are infinite and very uninteresting. Should we be petrified when the mumbling Freddy turned Breckin Meyer into a video game character and scooped him over the walls of the house? History takes us back to Springwood and it seems that Freddy has a middle-aged daughter. One would think that he would mention this in one of his previous adventures, but not? There is only one teenager in Springwood who survived, and Krueger uses him to make contact with his long-lost daughter. Another reason why this last part is so awful is the completely illogical structure. John Doe-boy is portrayed as the main character, but then he suddenly dies, and the conspiracy still revolves around two adults! What do you say: Freddy Krueger, who has spent five entire movies killing only teenagers, is finally beaten by two adults in 3D glasses! It's sort of ruin the whole essence, right? As for me, "Nightmare on Elm Street" has always been a scary series, but up to now, even the weakest entries have at least a few elements. "Freddy's Dead" is simply unbearable, and no one should waste their precious time watching it.
