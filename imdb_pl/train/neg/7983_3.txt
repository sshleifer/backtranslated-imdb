In conclusion, long and filled with more threads than Swiss cheese has holes! The director and co-author say that he wanted to mix genres - in this case, drama and comedy. Well, at least here, the two mix like vinegar and oil. For starters, the comedy is not too funny or a minor. In addition, the film is not really realistic. Freedoms are taken with regard to the legal system that obliges French citizens to their will and the apparent ease of resorting to drugs in French hospitals. I watched this movie on a big screen TV at home and shouted at the movie to go on. Finally, at the end, I quickly gave the last long speech of one of the main characters to the son of a former lover. At that time, I was exhausted by the ridiculous lost story that concerns a dead lover, a common sense marriage and a naughty ex-lover. Sometimes the story goes to the families of the two main heroes, and then returns to one of them - Ismaela or mainly Nora. To the disadvantage of the audience, the viewpoints change from Nora and Ismael, her former mistress, limited against his will in a psychiatric hospital. There are probably two potentially interesting films here, none of which are well-developed. The epilogue does not really close many plot lines, and it seems that he wants the viewer to believe that Nora will be lucky, although given the circumstances in life, chances are equivalent to the chance of a snowball in hell. The actors do their best and they are attractive, but this is not enough to overcome all the glaring errors of bad writing, editing and lack of focus.
