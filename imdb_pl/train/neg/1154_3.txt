May (Anne Reid) and Toots (Peter Vaughan) visit their son Bobby (Steven Mackintosh) and his family in London. Even when the visit begins, Toots suffers from a fatal heart attack, leaving May drifting, uncertain and questioning her life and future. Attracting the boyfriend Darren (Daniel Craig) to her daughter leads to inevitable consequences. <br /> <br /> Beautifully filmed, but because of its foretelling realism and appreciation, Mother offers a collection of mostly unpleasant, even repulsive characters and asks the viewer to get involved with them. Reid shines like May, and that's her skills and involvement as a wonderfully understated actor who saved the movie from a totally depressing mud, but Michell and Kureishi let Craig, Mackintosh and Cathryn Bradshaw create such disgusting characters that it becomes more and more difficult to worry about it what is happening in May. As it was written, the characters played by Mackintosh and Bradshaw are actually completely selfish and cold, he begins to wonder what exactly Kureishi wanted to say. As recommended, they either do not want to, or are unable to elevate Bobby and Paula over two-dimensional in their ghastly selfishness. <br /> <br /> It's worth to see Reid's performance, but not much more. Weeping shame ...
