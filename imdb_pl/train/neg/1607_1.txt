This "document" is proof that talent is used for specific purposes. The fact that it is financed by the Venezuelan government means that it lacks legitimacy in seeking the truth about what really happened in those terrible days of April 2002 in Venezuela, something that even the Venezuelans do not know for sure. /> <br /> There are ways of lying, and the directors of these things lie both by omission and knowledge. <br /> <br /> The political process of Venezuela is too complex to be easily understood by foreign audiences and use it. For example, * POSSIBLE SPOILERS * show Pro-Ch치vez demonstrators firing on an empty street (why the hell did they do that?) In such a way that they did not kill anyone, but did not bother to show the images that we have all seen here opposition demonstrators (and journalist) ) they fell dead or wounded on the other side of this "empty" street. They can not explain why the political police helicopter was the only one that was authorized to fly over Caracas that day, and did nothing against the snipers who were on the roofs of the buildings near the presidential palace. be security measures protecting the president. A few days after the "coup", the head of the army-led guard was asked by the National Assembly (our Congress) why they did not stand against the snipers, and he said "because they were not there to act against the president", is this not a confession? <br /> <br /> There is much more, the fact that the highest-ranking military announced that Ch치vez had resigned, and two days later said he had lied because "this is politics" and is now the Minister of Interior of the Ch치vez administration . <br /> <br /> There would be thousands of words to explain all the lies presented in this "document", made with the intention of selling the world the image of good old Hugo Ch치vez, who rules the poor and rich opposition who want him at all costs, when the truth is that 60-70% of people reject his government, and this percentage includes the poor. > <br /> I hope that those of you who have seen and bought will be able to see another version, which is created y group of Venezuelans showing no less than 30 lies. <br /> <br /> Nazi propaganda has come back!
