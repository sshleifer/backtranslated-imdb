I could not believe that I spent 14 USD on it. The only salvific feature is the outrageous blood. Dubbing was worse than any I've ever experienced. It looks like it was filmed with a VHS camera. I think that every fenig was released for special effects because there was a lot of blood and body parts everywhere. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but I have to admit that a big gore was not as disgusting as it could have been because the whole movie is so stupid and unbelievable
