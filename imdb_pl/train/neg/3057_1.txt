While "Saint Nicholas conquers the Martians" is usually cited as one of the worst movies ever made, this Mexican movie from 1959 is so bad that it makes "SCCM" look like "This is a great life". You have to wonder what the people who made the movie thought; perhaps it was a third world allegory about capitalist greed and visible consumption. No. . . They just were not very good. The same production company has created an even more disturbing version of "Little Red Riding Hood," in which the wolf's obsession with the subject of our heroine has clear traces of pedophilia. (Perhaps it was an inspiration for "Freeway".) Return to "Santa Claus": instead of the North Pole Jolly Old Saint Nicholas lives in a satellite on the geosynchronous Earth's orbit (shades "MST3K"); instead of the elves, his toys are made by children chosen from around the world; and he had sophisticated spy equipment to check which kids were rude and nice. The result is like an Orwellian store with later in space. All you have to do is visit us forever. This and other movies for low-rent Mexican children were named in English and prevalent in the United States in the early 1960s; no wonder that the sixties have become such a turbulent period in American history. People from the baby boomer generation who were forced to endure these "family" films as children would be too eager for a revolution.
