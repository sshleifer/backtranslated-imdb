I had the greatest enthusiasm when it comes to the initial screening of this film. In the end, it is one of the oldest and most complex stories known to humanity and it was one of the first epic stories that I read as a child (even before Tolkien). I must say that THIS was a HUGE BANK. They made a joke of it and turned the item into one long soap opera. Elements that were loyal to the story were splashed in such a chaotic way that the audience laughed many times out of a stupid scenario that simply drew attention to this battle in all battles. It was a huge disappointment to see a complex character such as Achilles (who has a strange combination of power close to the matrix, total ruthlessness and male lovers in the original poem), turning to "Fabio on the beach" in Pitt's disguise (which with a good script and more effort could make it the most complex and original warrior figure Hollywood has ever produced). The actors were decent, trying to make the most of the absurd scenario. In fact, it was a waste of so many talents (Peter O'Toole stole the show, and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean were pathetic). Compare this with LOTR or Gladiator and do not even hold a candle for them. Plenty of portions for women who can browse, but not enough battle scenes for a movie about one long battle and siege. I would not recommend paying anyone to see how this story drags through the dirt like one of the characters (at least they got that part well).
