I have a high level of tolerance for bullshit, so I could not wait. It did not disappoint. Apparently, on the basis of the classic Carmilla Sheridan Le Fanu follows a father and daughter hunting for a vampire who, fortunately, travels with them. Then we have Santa Claus (or General, as he likes to be called here) running after random zombies. Did I mention that a zombie epidemic broke out? The dead come back to life, but no one seems too worried. We have zombies of construction workers, zombie soldiers and even zombies from St.Trinian. Apparently, Santa is looking for his daughter who has been turned into a vampire. Oh, wait, there are no vampires, the girl is in a madhouse, and Carmilla is her nurse, is not she? Zombies are back, and Santa is crazy. Lesbian sex, I like vampires and I like zombies, but I especially like lesbian sex. Nothing like a simulated pan to make juices flow. When will we see vampires fighting against zombies? Is he a vampire or a crazy woman? Or both? Is Carmilla a hot sexy vampire, a lesbian or a nurse? More cunnilinguses, you'll never have enough cunnilinguses. Here's the St.Trinian zombie coming. The time of the chainsaw !! More lesbian sex is a zombie killing and eating vampires. I think the zombies have won or not? Thread? Who needs a story when you have lesbian vampires and zombie schoolgirls? And kunnilingus?
