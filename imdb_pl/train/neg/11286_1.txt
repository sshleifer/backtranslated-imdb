Where do you start the movie as bad as this? <br /> <br /> Do you mention the cast of dissimilar heroes? Actress from the top shelf? A scary script? <br /> <br /> No. You just say that anyone who pays money to see a movie as poor as this one needs their heads. I know yes. I respect those poor guys who saw him with little or no advanced word from mages like Empire (usually a bad sign if a preview copy is not available in magical movie magazines). However, the cinemas really should start thinking about issuing returns if the customer is not satisfied with the finished product. <br /> <br /> I went three days after opening with two other partners. The only other person in the cinema was one guy alone. <br /> <br /> And it was on a cheaper night. <br /> <br /> Either the advertising campaign was unsuccessful, or the word spread through most of the country what is smelly. <br /> <br /> Not since The Avengers (1998) I've felt so changed since watching the movie. If your partner views this on video in a few months, make sure you pay the electricity bill while watching it. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald deserves a reward for not breaking down - or descending from the set; Keith Allen retains dignity in the cinematic slaughter; Barry Foster should have been arrested on the set for his performance, Rhys Ifans is making a career without favorites after the success of Notting Hill, and only Dani Behr is halfway sympathetic as a busty secretary. <br /> <br /> Remember, considering she was once in The Word, the expectations of each viewer as to her acting skills must have been quite low at first. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are not bad, given the limited budget, of course, but this script is awful. If you want to hear a few unlike characters, say "Fak!" For a few hours it should be on your street. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, coupons are required. <br /> <br />
