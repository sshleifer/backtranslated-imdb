We went to the cinema with the group, because the art we intended was canceled. This is undoubtedly one of the worst films ever. It's not like I do not like iconic movies that I do. But nothing happens in the movie. You do not feel any connection with the characters. endless times without dialogue. And a car. How do they bring a huge tent and couches and clothes for every day in this car? It's a two-seater! I must say, however, that the scenery is beautiful, but not in the film, the director should have made a photo shoot so that we could skip about 80 minutes of useless time with nothing happening. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this because it is a waste of time
