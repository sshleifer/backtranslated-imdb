This movie really, I mean REALLY, sucks. It has such a big role-playing hole that it can fit in a 30-foot dragon. Not to mention the dragon itself, which is inevitably the worst computer-generated image that has ever been put on the film. I mean, when you see something like this, you have to think, "Wow, someone actually did this movie. Then he let him out. Whoever they are, I'm sure they are no longer working in the film industry. <br /> <br /> When I rented this movie, it was not on a DVD, so (reluctantly) I took it out of the video. The first thing that appeared was the Lord of the Rings trailer for the Two Towers. It was a very smart move, putting this trailer on the film. This justifies me (reluctantly) giving the film 1 star, otherwise I would give him zero stars. Perhaps the producers, even though the star is Dean Cain (I think you write that way), would attract crowds (to the video store that is). <br /> <br /> Then they used the split screen technique (as in Hulku) to (I assume) compensate for what is the cruelty in this film. On the cover of the box, we see a picture of our hero and dragon. Does the dragon look exactly like the one in the Dragon Heart or just me? Anyway, the dragon in the movie looks like Gremlin 2 rejection and has a CGI from the Nintendo game from the early 90's (maybe worse). Also, the dragons movement, which pursues its victims, is not the same as F ## cking monotonous movement - right leg, left leg, right leg left leg, home, house, house HOME, HOME F # $ king DOOOOOM! It pisses me off. Perhaps the creators of the movie considered it exciting and had the same effect as Jaws. Why not have a POV Dragon shot. Anyway, it was just fun, like watching Weeblen's movie. <br /> <br /> Dean Cain gives a lot of surprised looks during the movie (perhaps his coming to terms with the fact that this movie may end his career). Do not expect Superman here. When I saw the trailer for the first time, I thought it was an addition to the PS2 game. <br /> <br /> When it comes to history, it's so bad that my 5-year-old brother can come up with something better when he does not convince me why he lied in my room when I was not there. Oh, did I mention that K @ HING HATE HUMANS WHO HAVE ENGAGED THIS IMMENSIVE DEEP CRAPA DEPENDING FILM? !!!
