There are exactly 2 good things to say about "Fantazja" (both mentioned by the previous reviewer): <br /> <br /> a) unusual, inspiring poetry, the beauty of Bo Derek. She has pictures in this movie, where she even gives Catherine Zeta-Jones an escape for her money, and that's a really high compliment. Her nakedness is short and discreet, but just look at her face. <br /> <br /> b) A setting on a Greek island with the sun and crystal clear blue waters. <br /> <br /> Other than that, there is no history, the dialogue is terrible and sometimes involuntarily funny ("He touched you where you are a woman!"), and the figure of Peter Hooten is a slimy jerk. Because it overwhelms the naivety of his character, but then, when you have to work so badly with dialogue, it's unjust to blame the actors (the fact that she kept repeating the name Damir in almost every sentence is a serious irritation). Oh, and even though the movie is set on a Greek island, it's hard for a Greek word - apparently everyone there, from children to old people, speak English all the time. (*)
