It was one of the most boring movies I've ever seen? I really do not know why? Just your stories about the guy who is going to get married and instead starts to feel like someone else. The story has been told a thousand times. Nothing new or innovative at all. <br /> <br /> I do not know what was wrong with this movie. Most of the time, when these types of actors / actresses meet to make a film that was already done a million times before, it's really funny. Usually there are not many wise things in them that are not really in any other. For some reason, this simply does not attract attention. You can choose some fun parts or clever ideas, but for some reason they are simply not fun or wise in any way? It is a pity that I do not know how to explain it, but I do not know? Just do not waste time on this?
