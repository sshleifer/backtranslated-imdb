this is the result. A piece of a junk movie that does not even deserve to be classified as a movie is just a few things on film, which does not make sense at all. Returning to the actors who from the very beginning seem to be just a group of friends who thought they would get some money together and try to make a movie that would be a great horror movie. Well, it's a great horror anyway, it's never a movie. There are a lot of scary behaviors in "Hobgoblins", but the main guy named Richard is worse, who is much too weak to even root out. Well, when you throw a bunch of friends and try to scare the movie, with less than budget budget, no less, it will happen. Well, at least the MST3K version was fun. But this is still a terrible movie that deserves to be taken care of. 9 for the MST version.
