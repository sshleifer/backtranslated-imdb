Probably encouraged by admirers of her much better "Orlando", Potter here delivers the vehicle to himself in the worst way: he writes, directs, plays in the stars, and actually co-creates music, including the gypsy love song. The film is very similar to the design of a high school or college teenager who is convinced that her own intimate love and melodramatic obsessions are equally fascinating for us. But Potter's character is as unpleasant as the object of her romantic obsession is unacceptable, and the whole movie is an embarrassing display of narcissism masked as a celebration of tango. Maybe if she did not quit, it could work. It simply can not work, regardless of whether it plays alone or not. Pretentious, too ambitious, boring and stupid.
