After the already disappointing "Final Conflict", the series goes down with this very weak fourth entry. At least the third movie tried (unsuccessfully) to continue Damien's story, while he simply rewrites and copies ideas from "Omen" (animals are afraid of Antichrist, the death of one man is very similar to the death of the photographer in the first movie). But what looked exciting and creative looks stupid. The little girl looks just like a broken child.
