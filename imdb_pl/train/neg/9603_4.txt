"A young woman suffers from the illusion that she is a werewolf, based on a family legend about the ancestor of the accused and killed for allegedly being one of them. Falling in love with a nice man, her life seems to get better when she is raped, her lover is killed by a bandit band, again after traumatic events, the woman returns in her brutal ways and seeks revenge on the bandits, "according to the cover summary DVD. <br /> <br /> "La lupa mannara" Rino Di Silvestro begins with a full frontal, writhing, whining dance of a shapely blonde Annika Borel, who mistakenly believes he is a werewolf. The hottest part is the moment when the camera catches the background fire between the legs. The opening "retrospection" reveals that her hairy ancestor was (probably) a lycanthropic creature. Mrs. Borel, unfortunately, is not a werewolf; she is just a very strong nutty. <br /> <br /> As a movie, "Werewolf Woman" (in English) would be better if the character of Borel really was a werewolf; with her sexualization a bit of characterization. But when it comes to skin and blood movements in the 70's, it's hard to beat him. Bouncy Borel is naked or sexy dressed in an entire movie that contains a large amount of unjustified blood. Dazzling Dagmar Lassander (like Elena) and hunky Howard Ross (as Luca) are good supporters.
