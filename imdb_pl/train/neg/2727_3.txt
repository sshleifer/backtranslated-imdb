This peculiarity in the new DORIS DAY COLLECTION COLLECTION does not really have to be considered, because it is only in the film less than 30 minutes. However, what he does is shiny when it is on the screen. A film with a smaller story is just an excuse to present some of Warner's contract players. JANCIE RULE is promising and it's a pity she did not become a big star. RUTH ROMAN deals with the role of "go-getter" with panache. Better if it was in color. Locations of the Travis Air force base with some rear projections work well. The best in the film are great musical interludes. If you like THANK YOU STARS and Hollywood KANTEEN, you'll like this one.
