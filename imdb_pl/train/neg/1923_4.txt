It is ironic that the fairy tale Dr. Seuss emphasizing the non-commercialization of holidays should be one of the most stunning, sold and successful hits of the holiday season. The general theme of Ron Howard's adaptation is that Grinch's bane against Christmas stems from an early childhood incident and that they themselves are involved in the materialism of the season beyond Cindy Lou Who (played very well by Taylor Momsen). This film is an ardent, ambitious attempt to capture the craziness and sentiment of Seuss's story, but the end result is a movie that lies and never fills the emotional impact of the animated version of Chuck Jones. Jim Carrey is remarkable in his performance as a devilish Grinch, but regardless of whether it is about dialogue, pace or foreign threads at the beginning of the plot, the transformation from a bitter miser to a joyful benefactor simply does not ignite convincingly. There are some great visual effects, and the make-up work is amazing, but apart from technical triumphs, one or two elements are missing. <br /> <br /> Conciseness? <br /> <br /> The soul? /> <br /> And maybe Jones did the initial adaptation too well in his 25-minute cartoon, which Howard lacks in a film that lasts three hours. Howard, Carey and the team are very talented and talented, but what seems like a winning combination is simply weak and tweaks in the final product. If you need to see the full-length version, borrow it on video with the animated version of Jones, and you'll see how bigger and faster it is not always better. I give this film three Who-Hash cans of five.
