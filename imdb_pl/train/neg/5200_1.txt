This film is very, very poor. I've seen better movies. <br /> <br /> There was some tension, but not much to jump out of the chair. It starts slowly with the build-up of tension. What is not a success. At least if you ask me. Although in some moments or moments I have to say that it was a bit funny when people were shot and fell. <br /> <br /> They should have done something like Scary Movie, it could be a better movie. Because I watched only parts of the film, skipping the scene and bored the whole movie. I must say that I felt sleepy watching this movie, so I can certainly say that it is not worth it. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time thinking about doing something with this movie except leaving it where it already is. Somewhere very dusty ..
