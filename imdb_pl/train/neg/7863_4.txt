THHE2 is funny in that you laugh a lot and crouch and you probably say "oh sh * t!" And "put your face away from the damn hole you are fooling" or things that are in line with these lines, but I do not know if it's really worth seeing - I was very annoyed by the whole terrible military figure who does not seem to know the first thing about the fight. <br /> <br /> Yes, there was more violence, gore and a higher number of people than the first one, but I still wonder if this would cancel my feelings for the whole movie about how funny it is (and it's not funny ridiculous like Dead Alive or Feast). My time would be better spent watching the remake of Aji for the fifth time. <br /> <br /> So go for a bit of laughter, or go up, but do not go with the hope that you will leave it happy.
