Let it stink! As everyone knows, it's based on some of Geico's insurance ads; what no one knows why ?! These commercials were at best fun at first viewing; few feeds for the series. (Talking gecko Geico - this is another story, now it would be an intriguing series!) And why on earth ABC - as reported by the press - actually agrees to purchase the rights of a caveman from Geico? After all, the idea of ​​cavemen fighting in the modern world is not unique to television; Over a decade ago, Phil Hartman returned to the role of Nightlife as The Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer. And this is how this concept works best - as an occasional installment. But a regular series? Fuhgeddaboudit. (In the 1960s, the series entitled "It's About Time" also used cavemen in the concept of the modern world. It lasted for one season.) One of the directors of the series, who was also responsible for Geico advertising, was recently quoted as saying: "We were so excited when we were shooting our commercials because we felt we had something that was very special and we had more stories to tell." Wrong. <br /> <br /> In the chronicles of bad television it is to take place next to "Me and the Chimp" from 1972, as one of the worst in history. The main actor in the troublesome fiasco of chimpanzees actually hid after he was suddenly dismissed. No doubt our caveman friends will follow in his footsteps.
