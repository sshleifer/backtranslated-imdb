Edward Montagne's Tattooed Stranger is supposed to play like a crime thriller with a small film noir mixed with taste. Instead, it is a poor look at a low-budget and boring movie. The plot is absurd, and acting terribly rigid and amateur. John Miles, who had quite rare biographies in the industry, smiled and laughed all the time, and everyone else acted with the same verve as the characters in the movie about driver safety. The movie provides performances such as "Leave it to Beaver" and "Father Knows Best" in the unnaturally healthy view of New York in 1950. Why does not the viewer even see anyone smoking a cigarette until some graceful woman in the flophouse is interviewed in the middle of the movie. The only thing that affects the film (apart from its brevity) are the perfect photos from the location coordinated by William Steiner. The low budget of the film works in favor of the cinematographer, because the viewer is dealing with well-framed interior shots of New York and extensive interiors. If you do not want to enjoy the movie when choosing the settings and angles of the camera, I suggest watching virtually any other movie.
