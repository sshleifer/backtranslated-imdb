This movie is one of the most unique movies you've seen. This is due to the fact that you can not make heads and tails of this mess. It seems that this is a series of challenges to determine if you want to leave the movie and give up the money you just paid. If you do not want to feel neglected, sit in this horrible movie and feel real compassion for the actors involved, everyone has seen better days, but then you realize that they really got a lot of money to do it and you will lose pity on them, as you already did it's in the movie. I can not tell enough about this horrible movie, its almost something Ed Wood would do, and in this case it would certainly be his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> To start, you must sit by opening a dialogue that you have never seen / heard, this matter must last five minutes. In addition, it is a narrative suggesting that the viewer can not read. Then we meet with Mr. Slater and a terrible attack begins, as if he were acting only to put lines on the line of the movie poster markers. Soon we meet Stephen Dorff, whom I usually like), and he does everything not to drown in it, but in the end he does it. Then comes the final insult, Tara Reid plays an intelligent role, oh help us! Tara Reid is not a very talented actress, and somehow she constantly gains roles in movies, in my opinion she should stick to American type pie movies. <br /> <br /> All in all, you can just see it with your own eyes, when it appears on the video, I know I'm kicking it, I mean, let everyone be honest here, sometimes it's comforting to enjoy the shortcomings other.
