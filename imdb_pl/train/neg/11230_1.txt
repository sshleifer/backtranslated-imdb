In the sixth grade, every teacher who decided that it would be a great idea to make this film a curriculum for the whole semester. Each class had something to do with this horrible performance. We watched them in English and wrote in magazines as if we were one of the characters. In mathematics, we talked about charts and other nonsense. In science, we talked about whales (which was quite interesting, so it was not 100% time wastage). He was tortured all day. Not only this, but twice a day they would give us this horror, forcing us to watch it also in the research room. I could see if it was a new series or something, but it was like '93. I'm still trying to block it.
