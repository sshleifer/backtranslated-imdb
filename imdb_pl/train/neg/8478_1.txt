This movie was probably the biggest loss of my life. Acting was pathetic. Jordan Hinson was unable to show any disturbing emotions. At the beginning of the movie she was going to be discouraged. Instead, she jumped up and her lower lip stuck out. She sobbed pitifully without tears on the crying scene. I was almost angry that out of all the girls who wanted to be actresses, they had to tear her out. Everyone else also suffered from excessive activity. It was annoying. It is also an insult to figure skaters. Jordan needed a month for training and threw it as the person who creates the Olympic team. It practically spits out the effort of real figure skaters. A pitiful excuse for the film and a pathetic attempt to associate hockey and skating. Do not lose your life. He does not even deserve one star.
