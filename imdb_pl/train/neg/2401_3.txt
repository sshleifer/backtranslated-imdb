I've seen better teen movies about werewolves in my time, but this one takes a cake. More comedy than horror, "Full Moon High" puts "c" on cheese. The quality of the star in this film is not bad. It's just the way it's made that goes down. Adam Arkin plays Tony, an American schoolboy from the 1950s who is not aging because of a werewolf bug in Transylvania. The most annoying part of the film was the violinist. He has driven everyone crazy! Ed McMahon plays his ultra-conservative father who met with the end of his own ball. Adam Alan's father plays a psychiatrist who seems not to be the best in his game. After all these years Tony seems to be very out of place because of the attack, and then he will have a chance to get caught in his condition. More laughter than blood shed, this movie is just the beginning of the 80s, "Teen Wolf" was an improvement! 1 out of 5 stars.
