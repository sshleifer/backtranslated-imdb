I have seen virtually no advantages in this film. The only thing I saw was the crazy obsession of Quentin Tarantino on this topic ... There were some attractive women in this movie and maybe it's one decent quality. Overall, however, I found the film surreal and ridiculous. Hand-making movies combined with slow motion and other film tricks I found clumsy and stupid and even nauseous. In general, the music was terrible and repetitive to the extreme, reminding me of the psychological war of the American army against various malcontents. <br /> <br /> The various vignettes that make up a movie are accidental in their distribution and unfulfilled unresolved in the content and "conclusions". A depressing movie (not a real movie, the deadline I reserve for real art) that left me in a bad mood. Do not believe different people who are trying to turn it as a "romantic comedy", although there are certainly individual elements of both this film, which rejects in its content, form and conclusion, any connection with this genre. <br /> <br /> I suggest you stay away despite seemingly overwhelming positive feedback about IMDb and other sources of ratings.
