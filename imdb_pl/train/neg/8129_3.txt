Sometimes I do not know ... you try and be a charity for all B movies, but once in a while only the movie tests your patience until you want to count all involved. "Bat People" (which I saw under the title "It Lives By Night") is just such a movie. You can not watch it without thinking that it really should be an episode in the "Night Gallery", not one of the better ones. <br /> <br /> The movie has something to do with the doctor who is bitten by a bat and consequently begins to transform into a werewolf who drinks human blood. (Actually, you'd think that if it turned into a real bat, it would eat mosquitoes in a gallon bucket, but because it's a tacky horror, blood is the word.) Despite the fact that he has fits of convulsions when the hat falls, and the episodes of unconsciousness almost every night, his friend and colleague doctor, Dr. Mustache Aspen-Extreme, insists that he simply has an "allergic reaction" to rabies shots. Meanwhile, the most disgusting and stereotypical county sheriff in the world suspects that the doctor is responsible for the brutal murder and bleeding of several local girls (and one wine). In the meantime, the wife of the doctor decides that the negation of IS is a river in Egypt and alternately patronizing him and urging him to distract. <br /> <br /> It's not just that acting is bad - you can say that the actors make choices on a professional level and try to bring some juice and life into the script, even the guy who plays the sheriff. (Okay, it's pretty bad, but it's bad in a stereotypical, wooden, professional way). It's all about acting, the way you make scenes, the costumes, the dialog box, the script, and the plot in general sets your teeth on the edge and makes you want, well, count all the people involved. <br /> <br /> I think the movie had an outside chance to be a terrible, disturbing favorite, ALE: <br /> <br /> 1) The director had to beat Michael Pataki, an experienced actor, with the chair until Pataki disagreed on ACT, not just Dennis Weaver. <br /> <br /> 2) He also had to find a script that would make a bit more sense with regard to the whole scenario of "Bat Bites Human, Who Then Turns A A Bat". <br /> <br /> 3) He also needed an actor who played the doctor to find a more credible stage designer for his "episodes", instead of resorting to the "Man has an attack" page from the "Little" Clich√©d Book of Acting Manners. <br /> <br /> 4) He had to rework the whole character of "wife", make it both more intelligent, less penetrating and more attentive. <br /> <br /> I would never watch the movie again voluntarily, except for Mike and Bots. It's bad, but it's not bad in a stupid, humorous or interesting way. Still better than "Battlefield Earth" or "Waterworld".
