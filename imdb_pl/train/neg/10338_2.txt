This movie is simply stupid. <br /> <br /> From the cast of Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer to the stupid climax, the film is an exercise in predictability of wood. <br /> <br /> Mike Hammer is one of the true sociopaths of detective fiction. Unlike Marlow and Spade, who combine elements to solve the puzzle, Hammer distributes things to reach the truth. This movie turns Hammer into a boob, surrounding him with bad guys who are ... well, too stupid to get away. One is so poorly drawn that he succumbs to the attack of popcorn. <br /> <br /> Other parts of the movie come from the book Three Stooges. Velda dances, for example, in a barre or a bad guy who accidentally stabs the boss in the back. Breaks in continuity are embarrassing: Frau Blucher runs along the centerline of the road when the camera is close to her lower legs, but is already on the other side when the camera moves away to get a wider shot. The worst break precedes the attack of popcorn. A bad guy who hacks Hammer is a second after our hero, except that the clock shows that our guy was seven minutes. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there were some interesting angles and lighting, and the big finale is so bad that you have to see it, which is the only reason you get two points out of 10.
