A really terrifying movie. It feels like it was made in the early 90's by a simple person who wanted to show that gays are good, normal people aspiring to the mainstream. LTR suggests that monogamy and marriage are the preferred way to salvation for sad, lonely, sexually crazed gays. Wow! Who knew? Supporting heroes are caricatures of gay stereotypes (effeminate buffoon, bitter, lonely queen, baba, etc.), and the main heroes are milquetoast, medium-sized clones, medium size, not very interesting. /> When it comes to the romantic and ideological struggles of the main pair, there is not much to say: we have seen it before and we have done a lot better.
