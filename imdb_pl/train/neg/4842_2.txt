Who carried out the study of this film? His action takes place in Baghdad in 2004. However, all soldiers are wearing ACU and have all universal camouflage patterns. No one was wearing this material on 04. <br /> <br /> I just saw this movie while deploying abroad and can say that the overwhelming feeling of the audience was WTF? This movie did not make sense if the heroes would come and go without explanation, and people would do funny things that NEVER took place in real life. I realize this is a movie, but apparently trying to present something realistic. It fails, but tries. <br /> <br /> It's like somebody came up with some random ideas, he chewed and swallowed them and then vomited the movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I'm still not sure why I sat through the whole thing. GI Joe was one of those who really made you think compared to that. STAY AWAY!
