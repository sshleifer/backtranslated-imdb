I know actors and actresses like to try different kinds of movies - hey, nobody wants typography - but Danny Glover, Brenda Fricker (happy birthday, Brenda!) And Christopher Lloyd should know better. "Angels in the Outfield" is another movie in which everything seems lost until someone or something comes magically and can not save the day. Do I have to tell you how it ends? The film is simply a modest escapism (examples of high escapism are various science-fiction movies from the 1950s). If these films had a political touch - or at least offered us a new look at life - then it would be OK; this is pointless. Far more diabolical than angelic. The stars are Tony Danza, Adrien Brody and Matthew McConaughey. I suspect that they do not want to stress this in their lives.
