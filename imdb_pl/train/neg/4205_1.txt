THE ALARMIST is so horribly written that you thought for yourself why the actor David Arquette on stage agreed. It must be one of the weakest stories I have ever seen and without any humor, bordering on boredom. He staggers to a terrible conclusion, which seems to take place only because the director got bored and wanted to close quickly to return home for supper. Stay away!.
