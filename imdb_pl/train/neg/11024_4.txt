I saw the film first in the Soviet Union, and many erotic scenes were simply edited by the censorship committee. But then, in Poland in 2000, I looked at it in full form. So what? The plot is incredibly silly - 2 men are going through a genetic catastrophe and are on a planet full of feminist strong, simple and fundamentally stern women. Men are now trying to fight it, and then there is a whole bunch of extremely stupid stereotypes - sex drive, constant male desire for sex, feminists shown as complete idiots (you can agree with them or not, but the idiots are not), and so on. Even star stranger Jerzy Stuhr's performance here is wooden and strangely bad - he just pulls off unpleasant faces and repeats the saying "I'm in the elevator with a naked staff and I did not do anything!". It was supposed to be a comedy, but it turned out to be a gruesome farce, full of predictable jokes and insinuations below the waist. Do not waste time - it's just bad.
