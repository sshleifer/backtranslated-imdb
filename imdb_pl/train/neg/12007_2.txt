It's amazing how Nikhil Advani manages to attract people to the theater up to the very premiere. I mean ... look at the cast, the promotion is great, the songs are good enough, and the trailers are fine. This makes it a home full of the first day, but only when people are going to see a movie, they realize that there is no way to return money. A house full of the first day, the film is next week. <br /> <br /> This film, inspired by "Love Actually", is what they say, it did not cope with the entire cast. They tried to put big stars, but they did not even get to average performance. Stories are empty and bad, so the audience can not connect to any of them. This is a great disappointment for everyone who likes big stars or for Nikhil Advani after his great success "Kal Ho Na Ho".
