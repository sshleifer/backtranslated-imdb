Deadly Wake is a PERFECT FILM for film students ... to learn how to NOT make a movie! <br /> <br /> Let's see ... what did the crew ruin in this move? The worst music mix The worst edition The worst scenario MOST ALL DIRECTIONS The worst acting The worst choreography The worst photos The worst props The worst sets The worst lighting Itd ... would still be awful. All scenes are dark (lighting people call them "black"), often the score drowns meandering dialogues, which was okay, because no one ever uttered two whole sentences without long breaks for the effect. The "bad" robot was funny ... what was it? Jazz dance? Oh ... I think it was supposed to be tactical or something like that. I am sure that fear in the hearts of ... poor editors. And how do you edit so much garbage? Impossible. Garbage is rubbish, no matter how you weave it. How could anyone get it through Dailys ??? <br /> <br /> The conclusion is that I could not stand more than 15 minutes, it was so bad ... but I saw the whole thing (with lotsy breaks) just to see if has some good parts. NO! NO ONE! <br /> <br /> A great example of how not to make quick moves ... you have to see for every serious student of the film !!!
