I got this DVD over 2 years ago and decided to watch it only yesterday. I do not know why it took me as long as I like the Inspector gadgets, and even a new gadget and gadgets. Although it can have a bright palette of colors and all the technical sophistication of a modern animated film, it lacks some of the old things that flood the gadget right into the toilet. <br /> <br /> First of all, the classic Inspector Gadget theme song and music are completely absent. The composer attempts to compromise by making a score that sounds similar but is still not good enough. The mobile gadget is now a talking car, not a car that can turn into a van. In addition, it looks much nicer and more than ordinary cool. Penny no longer has her computer book, and she and Brain almost never appear. <br /> <br /> The plot does not exist. There's something in the formula of transforming and using Dr. Claw for some never-revealed evil, but that's all I have. What was the deal with a short / giant Italian I will never know. It had nothing to do with anything. <br /> <br /> And if the title has anything to say, its last case is not wrapped in any way. And it stays strong, so why it's called the "last case" is also a mystery. <br /> <br /> I was not impressed at all. This is an insult to a wonderful animated program that is strangely absent from the DVD, but do not let it make you buy any DVD with the Inspector gadgets. I sold it just a few seconds after I watched it. No child will like it and will not appreciate it, and no fan of the old program tolerates it.
