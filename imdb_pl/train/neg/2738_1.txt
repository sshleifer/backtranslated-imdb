Garbage / bad films are usually not bad, because I find them pleasant. This one is so bad that I have no words to describe it - its below is "bad". At the beginning of the movie there is an instruction that tells you what to do during the movie. Needless to say, the manual and a dozen beers could not help me through the whole movie. One tagliner compares this to KILLBILL, which is certainly unthinkable and an insult to our intelligent. Of course. this tagliner was about to tempt you to buy this DVD. <br /> <br /> If you are considering renting it, put it down! If you think about buying, do not think! If you are unlucky that you have this DVD, do not play it, put it in the trash can.
