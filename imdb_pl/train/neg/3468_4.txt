The film student chooses a B-class actress (great diva-ish MOLLY RINGWALD!) To complete the horror that her mother (terribly boring Kylie Minogue!) Tried to do 12 years ago. This is an interesting story choice, because every fan of Aussie horror knows that there are no female directors in this genre. The movie has a curse because Molly had to kill some psychic killer on the original plan. But she came back because she needs an exposure. Unfortunately, the curse still exists and people begin to die on the "plan". Cut is an Australian attempt of a modern "slass", but unfortunately it does not bring anything new or exciting. In fact, he breaks half of Wes Craven's filmmaking from the 90s. A lot of names from around the world dropping the movie "Scream" (except that it's Aussie-dropping names - Jane Campion ... see how it's not so much fun) and a lot of "it's real if it's a movie" "A new nightmare." The editing is bad, the music is annoying, the effects are funny, almost everything is bad. Fortunately, the film may have a sense of humor: at one point a well-dressed girl from the film crew says to the owner of the house they film: "Do not worry, we will treat your home as if it were our own" to which it responds, it's nothing for does not mean me, you look like you are living in a dump! Ha! And the ridiculous one-man Molly was enough not to regret borrowing it. "Do you have some diet coke here?" (How does he drive in the film professor's car) and "Does anyone know where I can buy tofu?" (The first thing he murmurs on the set) and "Where the hell is my agent?" (Oh, wait, that's what I was thinking about).
