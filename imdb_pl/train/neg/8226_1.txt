Considering that many horror movies are based on the assumption that one or more of the main characters are doing something stupid at some stage of the proceedings, the girls in this film would collect gold, silver and bronze at the Darwin Awards Olympic Games. A mentally handicapped baboon would make better choices than them and would scream a lot less by doing it. <br /> <br /> If you like movies with grainy pictures, intentionally amateur work with the camera (my 92 year old - grandma wields a camera with better results), exceptionally weak sound and lack of perceptible plot / narration, this is your perfect movie. Also remember that you should enjoy the following things: women shouting for no reason, women marrying for no reason. In fact, reason and logic do not appear too much in this film. For example, "we have to find Stephanie" "Yes, I can not believe I talked to her like last night" "she called you last night?" "Yes, she wanted to talk about some date she was asked about" "WHAT? Why did not she tell me? " Our friend is being chased by a serial killer with a rifle and a bunch of fearsome weapons, but I have a problem with not telling me he's going on a date. <br /> <br /> Okay, so the budget is low. It does not mean that you have to make it look like it costs half the budget. The "result" is interesting because all - except one - the songs were written and made by the authors / directors of the film itself. In fact, it looks like the whole budget has been torn apart by sampling the song The Duskfall, a death metal band from Sweden. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing thing in the whole movie is the ending that leaves us with the possibility of continuing.
