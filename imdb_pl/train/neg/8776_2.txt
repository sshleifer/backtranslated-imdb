Michael Keaton has never been a good actor; in Tim Burton Batman's films he always falls into the shadows of his great villains. In this case, she appears as a widowed husband who picks up radio frequencies that look like dead people trying to make contact with the living ... <br /> <br /> Well, this is going to be quite a shocking thriller, really does not hit every a place that shocks you. Because there are too many things that end unexplained, undiscovered and uninteresting. So where is the shocking excitement when the movie gets so bad that WHITE NOISE makes a fool of himself? Really bad acting and frightening editing, this movie has nothing to watch. Michael Keaton returns to the thriller, but ends more than ever.
