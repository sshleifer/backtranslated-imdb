I can not believe how bad this piece of rubbish is! I want to get back my $ 3.99! Words oppose the description of this bad piece of nonsense! Dubbing in no way is in line with the actor's lips. The film looks as if it was filmed with the help of an antique camera from the 1970s. I shot better movies using the camera on my mobile phone. Gore is funny because of the stupid incredible story. The action is what you would expect if you called all your friends on Saturday afternoon and started a complete break, then tried to play in the garage. Do not get me wrong ... I did not expect O'Neil and I love Zombie movies, but the production values ​​in this movie are so low that you can not watch it. Avoid!
