Closer to reality and more depth than the "Breakdance", "Beat Street" by Stan Lathan is still quite a boring show. Again, this photo really brings profits, but at least we have some entertainment from the plot that concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother growing up in Queens, New York. Everyone has their own unique talent. One is a hustler, one dj, another artist who creates "smokers", and the little bro "Lee is a hot dancer of" hip-hop ". <br /> <br /> Lathan is not able to arouse any viewers' interest in the story, however, and his young cast also struggles with their characters. As a result, funky music and "fresh" dance were almost entirely left to save the day. <br /> <br /> Choreography is hot again in both club and street scenes, but this is not enough to raise "Beat Street" to a higher altitude, unfortunately the movie really falls late after showing a flash of hope that can become interesting. <br /> <br /> Sunday, August 25, 1996 - Film
