As an avid fan of Flashman George McDonald Fraser books, I could not wait to see Flash on the big screen when the movie was released for the first time. Unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment, so I left it for 20 years before I came back to watch it again, but the second time it was not better. Mr. Fraser is an extremely clever writer, but I'm not a fan of his screenplay for the film with Richard Lester. Passion for the slapstick damaged my "Three Musketeers" and the same applies here. For me, the whole tone and atmosphere of the film is bad. Flashman's books are noisy fun, but they are adventure novels. There is a lot of seriousness in the way Flashman has - after all, he is involved in dangerous situations. It is transmitted in novels, but it does not appear in the movie at all because of its comedy style. It's a huge shame because it could have a great movie if it was a more faithful adaptation of the style of the book. When I read for the first time that the book was to be filmed, the article stated that the film was to be played by Oliver Reed. I was glad because Reed was the personification of Flashman. How much I would like to see him in this role. Malcolm McDowell is a good actor, but does not fit the visual image of Flashman created by books (too skinny looking! Flashman is supposed to be a great striptease). Even so, Reed was perfect as Bismarck. What kills a movie is that it is a comedy. The only scene in which creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene in which Flashman kills de Gauteta (Tom Bell). It's a shame, because production values, costumes, sets etc. are great, and casting is generally excellent - almost everyone in the film is well-mannered except Malcolm McDowell. Perhaps the direction of Richard Lester was responsible for the way the movie is, because the recent adaptation of Flash For Freedom, adapted by Mr. Fraser, worked quite well. Perhaps one day we will see Flashman on the screen.
