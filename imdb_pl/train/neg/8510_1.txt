When we were in junior high school, some of us boys went from time to time to smelly bombs. It was funny then. But the producers, directors and cast of "Semana Santa" ("The Angel of Death" in the DVD section of the local video rental company) are grown up and STAD out. <br /> <br /> Like the previous reviewer who wondered if the cast would like to leave the stage and come back home, I doubt if there was anything more than one scene. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino, hot in "Mighty Aphrodite" and other top rated movies, it seems that she introduced herself in this project. Her acting does not exist, limiting herself mainly to longing glances, which are supposed to indicate how "sensitive" it is to the difficult situation of various film victims. <br /> <br /> But let me warn you - do not be another victim! Move away from the DVD if you find it on the shelf. There are not many good shots of Mira (the only high points I could find in the film), and the supporting cast is of inferior quality, which gives the buzz of poorly realized dialogue with embarrassing "Spanish" accents worthy of the best secondary school theater production.
