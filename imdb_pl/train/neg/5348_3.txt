Inventor Wayne Szalinsky (Rick Moranis) is preparing to hand over his problematic shrinking / expanding machine to the Smithsonian Institution when he and his wife Diane (Eve Gordon) are preparing for a long weekend away from their son Adam (Bug Hall). Wayne's brother, Gordon (Stuart Pankin), his wife Patty (Robin Bartlett) and his children Jenny (Allison Mack) and Mitch (Jake Richardson), voluntarily take care of Adam while his parents are absent, but thankfully it ( and the title will lead you to wait), adults are accidentally pushed back by Wayne's shrinking ray. When children run in amok, their miniaturized people have to deal with monstrously huge insects, wrinkles on the carpet that look like canyons and other threats to them. It was bad, like most simple video fragments, Honey, We Shrunk Ourself was a bit funny. I had to laugh at the movie "cry" Stuart Pankin, and the party persecutors were even more ridiculous, look at your own risk!
