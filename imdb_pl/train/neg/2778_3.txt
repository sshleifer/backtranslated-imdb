It seemed like the movie had everything with good camera, sound, movie, sets, music, costumes ... but drums, Gary Stretch said! I do not know if it was his poor game or just a bad script, but he would say it was both. Given his cast in this role, it was hard for him to root out even to the very end. I would regret that he would not have been killed in battle, not one of the jerks of sword / knife. <br /> <br /> In that case, the conspiracy to kill the king was that the king did not eat dinner and did not have sex for the Queen? Pretty bad. And go to extremes to kill your son? And then push her lover as the King's successor? I see a thread or two here and there historical bytes, but the way in which it was all presented was farce. <br /> <br /> I do not recognize Gary Stretch from anything else, but he was terrible. I have read other user's comments about sound dubbing, but I do not think that his dubbing ... in the end he speaks English, right? It was really terrible. The lines were read from the coroner's table ... a flat line. Perhaps there is simply no voice that could transmit tonal variations. <br /> <br /> Besides, I watched it to the end, so the movie had at least "interest". There could be more if the script / lines and casting got more work. The set design and film crew together with a very good quality film made the film above everything else. The cast and story were secondary. I give film crew 10.
