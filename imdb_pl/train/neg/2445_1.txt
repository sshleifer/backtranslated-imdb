Hi, can anyone hear me? I do not know why you came to this site, but if you are a different viewer of this movie: join the fan club! This movie was so unbelievably bad that I could not stop laughing when I saw him. I think it's a must see, it's bad in a nice way. Each film made for horror can be seen here. I'm afraid it's very difficult to get a copy of this movie, but it should be in the top ten of the worst movies ever made.
