The NSA, CIA, FBI, FSB and all other snoop agencies in the world should watch this video to get information on how to spy on people. (as reported by MST3k Commentary ... "Sanata has dirt on everyone! Nicola's tentacles reach far! miles to ears that hear everything. It's amazing that CIA does not have Santa Claus on the payroll. <br /> <br /> Rutina Satan's dance is fun. Pitch ... is so useless. <br /> <br /> The cheese factor in this movie is huge. Very low budget, but it's cool to watch. I recommend watching the Mystery Science Theater 3000 for even more laughter . <br /> <br /> You even laugh at what is happening with good children. <br /> <br /> It gives me 1 quality and 10 for pure cheese and fun.
