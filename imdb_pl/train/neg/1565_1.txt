The film uses the most modern title for lame history. Kill Kill, it would be nice. The film contains taboo scenes so that the viewer would retreat to his chairs. Scenes are unnecessary and uncertain. A movie is something that a novice could conjure up. Just a loss of movie props and network money. I have to write 10 lines of text to criticize this movie when it is not worth 10 lines of my time, but I have to push people to avoid making nonsense. If people are counting on you choosing a good movie for a movie night, choose something different. If you have a soul, do not destroy it by submitting to this dirt.
