I remember watching it in prime time when I was about 7 years old. I was a great comic reader then, and everything about the superhero was highly anticipated. The end result was disappointing. <br /> <br /> I was aware of Dana's story about "Emma Peel" because it was only recently that Diana returned to her Amazonian form. However, there were so few actions that I was bored for most of the movie. The final costume was an interesting idea, but it looked more like a cheerleader than a superhero. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie again in my late teenage years. It did not improve too much. Cathy Lee Crosby was more familiar, thanks to That Incredible, but her acting was not better. The script had some good ideas, such as dishonest Amazon and a decent villain in Ricardo Montalban, but it just did not happen and it was still boring. <br /> <br /> I think they should have built the back a better story and built the show in a more epic climax. It was too similar to a bland spy movie, crossed with the story of a superhero written by someone who had never seen a comic. The elements of the Amazon were intriguing, but they had to be expanded. <br /> <br /> The film managed to force the producers to return to the drawing board and invent something more faithful, if a bit too camp and low budget. The budget here was also quite low, and superheroes are not cheap. <br /> <br /> It would be nice if the movie was available on DVD, even as a comparative and historical document. Even Superman 4 is available and there is nothing beyond this movie (except Chris Reeve and Gene Hackman). It's worth seeing because of curiosity and some inspiration and caution for future versions.
