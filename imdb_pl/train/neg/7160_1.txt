Well - when Jason Miller appeared in the episode (looking even more erosion than in Exorcist IV) is the climax of the picture, what have you got? <br /> <br /> It's a small country, a little rock n 'roll: mix two drunks with money, who drag their child across the area with a wet-dried mummy (have you already discovered it - DRIED in the swamp?) in the basement, Christopher Walken with a bad job coloring and a little girl who could be an interesting character if they developed it. <br /> <br /> I understand - in a sense - that they are coming back to visit their relatives. After that ... <br /> <br /> Problem: There are some interesting flashbacks to what I have to assume that her mother is killed in the bombing of the car (I think so). It is never combined with anything. <br /> <br /> Problem: why do we need a grandmother? Now my grandmother can be interesting. She speaks Gaelic, Celtic or something like that. Maybe you can do something about it. The best they can do is that they have a habit of smoking. That's all. <br /> <br /> Problem: they threw a real character with my husband. Is he the type of cast (will he sell his wife to the devil? Maybe he can look forward to the trust fund he manages for her), is he manned against the type (he finally has a good hairstyle and nice clothes)? He drinks, hesitates. He is not a bad guy. Not very good. But I do not like. Why did not they do something with him? <br /> <br /> No problem: an old boy appears. Her husband is knocking him down. He returns to bring down her husband. (It gets pretty stupid, but at least this character is motivated.) <br /> <br /> NOW - he is an alcoholic, he is an alcoholic; he could only marry her for money. Grandma is locked in the bedroom. A blind uncle takes our heroine to the basement to show her the mummy of the witch (are you following her?), Which can come alive. In fact, you know that it will come to life, the music swells. The little girl lives at home, takes her grandma's tea (opens the door) and gives her grandma cigarettes. Periodically, grandma leaves. But nothing happens. <br /> <br /> A husband and wife lose their child at home and then lose their bedroom. Uncle cuts his throat in the basement. The main lady has nosebleeds. My husband is drinking. They both drink. In the face of all this, the terrible truth that is mentioned in the first voice is - omigod - an abortion when the leading lady was twelve. <br /> <br /> In spite of all these hanging threads of ingredients, no one has been able to get history on the screen. No bridge between situations, no gradation from mild disturbances to horrible horror, just long, slow scenes that never go anywhere. grandma who can be closed because she is a monster, but no, her worst blame is smoking. He has great hair, good makeup. <br /> <br /> In short, there is no story. Just some accidental (predictable) violence in the dark library, with gushing rain and a soundtrack that draws us in. You need more than a few drunks and Christopher Walken to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​were good. A. Nice scenery, good wardrobe. The operator at least knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> I bought it. Poor me.
