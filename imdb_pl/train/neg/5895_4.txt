Does Miike like Chabrol change art from dreck, sometimes confusing the two? Does it match the fifty / fifty rate that he has a claim to Chabrol? Do we see too much or too little Miike here? I do not know. I do not know. I do not know. But I could easily fill ten lines, quoting only the thefts of Chakushin aria (One Missed Call), allusions and stereotypes. Others here will go to most of them, although it may not be Saimin (Hypnosis) Ochiai for a poor telecast mocking from supernatural things. Only once, when Yumi takes the mother in his arms like a zombie, did one missed call surprise me a bit? Ishibashi in the insulting tale of Audition, and Dead or Alive's Boss Aoki from a vat with sinking feces and more, may be the most convincing evil actor I've ever seen. So here is a cop.
