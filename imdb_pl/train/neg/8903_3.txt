The Prophecy II, what do you have to say about it? They completely abandoned the originality of the first film and just made Chris Walken's splashing film. This is not even written by the original author! <br /> <br /> If you've seen Nr. 1 do not watch Nr. 2 is a real disappointment ... <br /> <br /> If you have not seen Nr. 1 do not watch Nr. 2! Go see Nr. 1 to experience something original and fun
