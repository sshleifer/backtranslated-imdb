I got this movie from Blockbuster in one of these stands where you can get 5 movies for 20 bucks. I have to say that I have money for it. I was expecting horrible dialogue, monstrous monsters and trembling cameras. Well, Meatloaf said, two out of three are not bad. <br /> <br /> Acting is bad, though not as bad as some movies I've seen. Or maybe lately I watched so many low-budget movies that I lost perspective. There are a few bits in which acting is downright horrible, but mostly it is at least High School Play level. <br /> <br /> CG for Sasquatch in this movie is probably the second worst part. The first thing I thought about when I saw it (and I noticed that another reviewer agreed with me) was that a man in a monkey suit would be better. Clunky stop motion animation would look better. <br /> <br /> Maybe you ask why I call CG the second worst part. This is because the worst part of the movie are sound effects. They are loud, annoying and constant. I've been camping, I know what insects sound like in the woods at night, and though they can be loud, they do not stun like cacophony in this movie. Usually, when the sounds of "background" drown out the dialogue of the film, it is a bad thing, but from what I captured in the dialogue of this film, I did not lack much. <br /> <br /> The action was rare and boring. Tension did not exist, just like any sense of empathy with the heroes. Speaking of characters, they were all disgusting and bland. The only mildly engaging byplay was between ... actually, I can not think about anything. There were one or two lines that made me smile, but that was it. <br /> <br /> The pictures were decent, a step or two above what you would normally see in a movie like that. Still, he was characterized by the quality of "home movie", which can be obtained through films to change the pocket and prayer. <br /> <br /> If you're like me and get pleasure from the bad budget movies, and you see the one in the basket for dollars, think about whether or not to catch him. Otherwise, stay away at any price.
