In the afternoon I went to see the movie "Troy". Here's what I've learned: <br /> <br /> Contrary to popular opinion and general history, the Greeks were not gay. ALWAYS. This was clearly established immediately at the beginning of the film and reinforced every five minutes. So American guys can safely watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Helen with Troy has always had impeccable hair and makeup. She looked great in all her short scenes, which, though numerous, were probably filmed the same day, one by one, with the director saying, "Okay, look beautiful now ... well ... OK, now look scared ..." good ... now I look depressed ... well ... now I look interested ... well ... now I look beautiful again ... well ... "<br /> <br /> Most Greeks and Trojans they had British accents. Those with American accents could not act. <br /> <br /> The Trojans looked the same as the Greeks, but they tended to stay on the right side of the screen. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt does not flash the camera. <br /> <br /> The biggest line of Helen of Troy was "They come for me." <br /> <br /> Trojan music sounded just like modern Bulgarian music. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt's thighs go up. <br /> <br /> Achilles had a young male friend with whom he was very close, but it's OK. They were cousins. It does not matter what history says. <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole can tell the whole story in one word. <br /> <br /> Trojan gods apparently had Greek names, but their statues looked Egyptian or like Peter O'Toole in a draft. <br /> <br /> The Greeks never touched unless they fought, just like the American men did. <br /> <br /> All the thousands of extras in the movie had exactly the same skin color ... Light Egyptian, author: Max Factor. <br /> <br /> Troy had only three women. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of blond Greeks, which is good news for Brad Pitt, who otherwise would really stick. <br /> <br /> Despite the local desert location, the Greeks had the incredible skill of finding unlimited wood for building fires, funeral stacks, Trojan horses and the like. br /> <br /> British actors look stupid with Greek hairstyles. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt changes expression only when the sun shines straight into his eyes. <br /> <br /> Greek soldiers were constantly fighting, but their costumes always looked flawless. <br /> <br /> Greek soldiers wore underwear under their skirts. <br /> <br /> Apparently the Greek temples have always been in ruins, even when they were new.
