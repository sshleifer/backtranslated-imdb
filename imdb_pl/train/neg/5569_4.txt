I really tried to like this movie. Looking at this, I can only think: "This guy gives me creeps, I would get a restraining ban." Also calls CODEPENDENCE in capital letters. Was it really a conversation before making a movie? "Let's make a movie in which two chronically depressed, socially inept people make a relationship that deepens their isolation and encourages them to complain about how bad their lives are! From what I've seen in my life, the last thing on earth that we consider attractive at a potential partner is pity on yourself. <br /> <br /> The mood of the film is clearly 80's; thoughtful and slow. Do not get me wrong, the movie has its moments, only a few of them.
