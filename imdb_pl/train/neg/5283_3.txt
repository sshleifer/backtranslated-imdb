I was impatiently awaiting the first screening of this film since it was released on DVD on Christmas Day. After booking a special place for yesterday evening, I sat down to watch it with my daughter (at the age of 17 and a film studies student), of course with chocolates in impatient anticipation. We love Jane Austin. <br /> <br /> After the first two minutes we knew that we were immersed. Shaky shots and camera shots, general weak cinematography, direction and wooden performances have already made us feel flat and unhappy. Depressed, watched in. <br /> <br /> Anne, played by Sally Hawkins, looked strange and without a special purpose, directly at the camera on several occasions, interrupting our hard-won "fantasy of the moment" and drawing us directly in stalking fashion " I will find you". <br /> <br /> Poor Rupert Penry-Jones, who played Captain Wentworth, did all he could to write a script and direction, bless him. I hope, however, that they paid him well, because in one case he was practically sunk by a huge wave, which predictably broke the sea wave, sinking him and his companion. They were almost thrown out to sea. Health and safety would have a good day! Poor Rupert left the sea water to deliver his line. Probably in the kitty there was not enough money to re-shoot this scene. Anyone with any sense would not try it on such a date in the first place. <br /> <br /> In addition to Mr. Penry-Jones, Alice Krige gave the only convincing performance to Lady Russell, but her efforts soon became balanced due to the unconvincing image of Anthony Head annoying Sir Walter Elliott. <br /> <br /> Towards the long-awaited end of the movie, Captain Wentworth seemed oddly grateful to Annie for a visit every two seconds, trying to avoid the majority of the movie. It was as if he developed an obstacle in his memory that caused him to forget about his reason. In contrast, Anne ran, hyper-ventilating, from the pillar to look for a good captain, who in the meantime managed to summon almost all of Bath, which we were told, in just three or four minutes, even without sweat. <br /> <br /> We have not experienced Anna's charm on the screen. Indeed, we were wondering what Charismatic Captain Wentworth had ever seen in Annie's usual, thoughtless, unwise mind, and why someone, no one, said it meant, winging Sir Walter to just shut the hell out. > A key kiss, usually our favorite girlish moment, has been painfully drawn out. As they came closer, Anne opened and closed her mouth, which affected the screen, making her look like she was chewing gum before lips finally met. Eww! <br /> <br /> The most enjoyable thing last night was chocolates and a half-hour exchange of views between mother and daughter about how bad the movie was. <br /> <br /> What a pity to ruin such a charming and captivating story shot in the best scenes in England. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, Jane.
