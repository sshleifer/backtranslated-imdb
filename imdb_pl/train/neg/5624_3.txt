During the short 40 years spent on Earth, author Jacek London managed to piss off as many adventures and incidents as possible. This 90-minute film, allegedly a biography of a man's life, but obviously fictionalized, will not even scratch the surface and remains a story very mature to contemporary explanations. Here, Michael O'Shea, in one of his first roles, depicts London, and his performance is both rugged and sympathetic. He is not a problem here. There is also a young and very beautiful Susan Hayward, playing his future wife, Charmian, whose biography in London is the "basis" of this film. London's life has been divided here into a series of episodes through which the film passes slightly. So we have short incidents with London as an oyster pirate, seal in the Bering Sea, seeker of gold in Yukon and a correspondent during the Russian-Japanese war ... colorful events, for sure, but almost nothing so deep. The direction of Alfred Santella (he also directed one of Susan's first films, "Our Leader Citizen" in 1939). He is hopeless at best. Making the situation rougher is a very poor DVD quality, with a poor looking print source and a hissing sound. Perhaps the best thing about renting this movie was for me one of the DVD accessories: a catalog of all Alpha Video movies, containing hundreds and hundreds of full-color movie posters. Let's hope that these films will be in a better shape than "Jack London"!
