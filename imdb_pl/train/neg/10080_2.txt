I had to look for actresses to find the management of this film, because the title is now "Unexpected love." I really do not want to look, but I did not know both leads and I was wondering why they are playing lesbians on Lifetime. Everything is quite restrained and you have no idea who these characters are, so as a spectator I was not able to invest emotionally in the story. I do not think I am the target audience, but I'm not sure who it is. Everything is calm, soft focusing and shades of the earth ... nothing is interesting. I was glad that two women looked around, but it was so discreet that I was disappointed. Instead, hire the best personal.
