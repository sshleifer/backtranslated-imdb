We've all seen some endless epics in our time, but this one really outperforms them all! The film is so slow and so slow that in order to look at it from a perspective, I felt much older when I left the cinema room than I introduced it. With a length of almost 4 hours, it could be transformed into a tele-serial. <br /> <br /> What begins as a promising comedy slowly loses pace. Nikhil advani created a story around 6 love stories and can not do justice to any of them ... There is no connection between them, and the links shown in the last 20 minutes seem to be forced to combine history. <br /> <br /> The situation is aggravated by Silly dialogues (most of them have been repeated in the Hindi cinema for years) and silly photos. <br /> <br /> Priyanka does not realize that she really has to play her role instead of looking at glam on the screen ... Total waste of beauty without acting skills. <br /> <br /> And then there is the loud-humorous Govinda and my-faces-better-than-jim - Carrey Akshay Khanna, who is still rumbling in the lungs to irritate the tired viewers. <br /> <br /> The only good part of the movie is the love story of John and Vidya and the nice actress / comedy by sohail & Isha. But they are so good in their roles that only these two couples could justify the movie without confusing it with other groups of characters. Their brilliance is lost among other non-standard feature lines. <br /> <br /> I'm guessing - the director did two separate films (maybe more!), And some beginner assistant mixed all the records, except the point sorting them, so the director was left with no choice but to show it all as a single movie .. . <br /> <br /> Watch it only if you want to test your patience !!!
