This film is another example of the curse of East Asian cinema: two or more separate stories in one film. Other reviewers have also noticed this because there are several references to the "first part" and "the second part". How can you have any character development or a deep story when characters and history are described for such a short time? I enjoyed the first part until it stopped suddenly (it did not "end", it just stopped in what seemed to be in the middle of the story) to replace it with the absurd and totally unbelievable second part that seemed to focus around the girl depicting and cleaning guy's flat (wow!) I can not wait for the day Wong Kar Wai gets a decent script for work!
