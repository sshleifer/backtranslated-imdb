Bradford Dillman is a scientist who wakes up one morning in the middle of a bloody crime scene; with a partial amnesia (or "global amnesia", which one of the heroes describes as an elective loss of memory), the scientist finds a private detective in the phone book in the hope of gathering a life. A disgusting mixture very loosely based on Walter Ericson's book "Fallen Angel" (filmed in 1965 as "Mirage" with Gregory Peck). It was probably too primitive for television - what with drugs and hippies added to the mix - that NBC initially refused to broadcast it on television, in this way, this low-budget film went to theaters. Director James Goldstone is delighted with hyperkinetic visuals and camera tricks, while editor Edward A. Biery went mad with zigzag pieces. Unfortunately, their decently colorful tricks can not hide the weakness of this updated plot, and the acting is pitifully overridden. Dillman, under the pressure of remembering the events of the night, passes through the Actors' Seminar of tics, stuttering, handkerchiefs and crazy laughter, spitting out a dialogue like: "Dream ... sleep ... drugs ... yes, drugs ... this SOUND ... bells ... help! Pat Hingle, a wicked scientist with a smile on Cheshire cats, almost cursed Dillman in the Grand Thespian department, constantly turning to everyone in baby-talk, proudly walking like a middle-aged peacock and twisting his mouth in agony. Scientist / love interest Hope Lange is shortened, but no sooner than he yells at Dillman's indifferent lover: "What should I do, talk to Ape Man? Me want You! ". It's crazy "Jigsaw"! * 1/2 of ****
