Well, this movie is incredibly horrible. I was sorry about the actors involved in this project because I'm sure they did not write their lines. Which sometimes were issued with a slight sarcasm, which led me to believe that they do not take this film seriously, or anyone who watches this obscene bastard of monsters. While watching this "Creature of the unknown" I could not help thinking that there is not much budget or a competent writer in the team. But if you watch it for laughter, you'll be happy, the movie is shameless to make fun of yourself because I can not see how anyone could look at it and be proud of pumping it straight to DVD. a movie of fighting against the light.
