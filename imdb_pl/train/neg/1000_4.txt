The plot "Descent", if you can actually call it a story, has two important events. One at the beginning - one at the end. Together, these events account for about 5% of the total movie time. Everything (and I mean everything) between them is basically a desperate effort of the director to fill the minutes. I like disturbing movies, I like dark movies and I do not care about awkward scenes - but if you expect me to sit for 60 minutes of foggy / dark (literally) scenes with NO plot, you have another thing. Rosario Dawson, one of my favorite actresses is completely wasted. And no, she is not naked, even in the NC-17 version that I saw. <br /> <br /> If you have a few hours to throw away and want to watch "Descent", take a nap instead - you will probably have more interesting dreams.
