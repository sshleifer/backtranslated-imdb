Director Kevin Connor and the would-be hero / protagonist / romantic Doug McClure, re-collaborate in this ghost story taking place in Japan. In the seventies they were moderate successes, including from "The Land that Time Forgot" (1975), "At the Earth's Core" (1976), etc. Without the plastic monsters carrying the narrative, the results are miserable and derived in the most insidious way. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a nineteenth-century prologue in which the husband of the samurai kills his wife and her lover before committing suicide. The pursuit of the present introduces the marriage of Ted and Laura, visiting Japan and moving into the house where the tragedy took place. <br /> <br /> No surprises what happens next, with the spirits of a dead start to take over new residents with a friend of the family Alex (McClure), taking the role of a wife's lover. <br /> <br /> Everything shakes awkwardly with the elegance and grace of the charging elephant, to the unavoidable (but surprisingly slow) conclusion. The main points of interest are two weak decapitations ("The Omen" has a lot to say in promoting this as a standard set of horrors), as well as love scenes involving the sycamore, but extremely perverse Susan George. The first of them is a long one, inspired by the song "Do not Look Now" with her husband, with piano music; the second is much shorter (probably on her stubbornness) confusion with McClure, both look quite uncomfortable. In any case, each cloud has a silver lining and both scenes show its fantastic rattles, so everything is not lost. <br /> <br /> Generally, I can not decide if "The house where evil lives" is rubbish, nonsense, or fun in a masochistic way. If you're not in this genre, there's nothing here, but for fans of horror, it's probably enough to provoke a strange rye smile and a graceful bow in the direction of respect for effort. <br /> <br /> THE BEST SCENE - in every other movie - big, black, climbing trees, Japanese, purring mechanical crabs would steal the show. They are dimmed by the legendary family auxiliary scene, where a ghostly head appears in the soup of daughters. Seeing this phenomenon, he asks what is the soup (!!!!), which should be said beef and vegetable, before saying the immortal line "Ugh - there is a terrible face in my soup." If this is not enough, the answer is "Go ahead, eat soup for daddy." Laurel & Hardy rest in pieces.
