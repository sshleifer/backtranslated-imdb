OK, I knew it would be a movie in the back of the F (much below the B movie standards), so I thought, "Man, I could laugh, so let's see some beings kill each other. "Well, what I got could have been found in your local love toy store. Random lesbian scenes, very weak fight and no plot. <br /> <br /> For example, one scene I remember (only because of stupidity, I've seen better porn on ABC), where the two main characters (I do not remember their names right away ... great movie, what?) ride together as usual, and the driver was tired of driving and stopped: <br /> <br /> Driver: "Let's pull, I'm tired. Do you want to take control? Passenger: "Sure, I can go for a moment". (After pulling the driver begins to catch the passenger's tits) Passenger: "What are you doing? I'm not like that! "Driver:" It's all right, everyone is doing it once. " Passenger: "OK, so". (Continue to take off shirts, caress, kiss and perform fellatio) <br /> <br /> Now that I last checked, horror movies were not in the Hollywood Video porn section (unless you're in S & M, then you go somewhere else) and definitely it should not be in the mainstream of Blockbuster movies. Do not get me wrong; I definitely do not belong to those who hate porn, but I only watch it when it's appropriate and I definitely do not want to see it if I'm looking for a movie in mainstream stores because the one I hired was in one of the two retailers who I called (and probably also on the other hand if I went and looked). <br /> <br /> The worst film in history, no one should rent it, and should only be bought for a public burning ceremony. If I could give him 0, I would do it, but I can give him only * 10.
