Charles Bronson appears as Lt Crowe, a police detective who declares war on pimp to Duke (Juan Fernandez) who kidnaps the daughter of a Japanese businessman who is a sexual assailant for Crowe's daughter (Amy Hathaway) in this disgusting but stylish thriller of revenge. Kinjite may not be for everyone with slightly disturbing plot lines, but it is well made and really fun.
