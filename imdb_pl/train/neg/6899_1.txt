Have you ever wondered why the inhabitants of the Pacific islands seem to automatically adopt the sense of humor of Black Americans? regardless of their ethnicity? Well, this movie will not give any answer to this frequently considered question - but it will provide an excellent case study. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, this movie works as a kind of "Old School" for Pacific Island New Zealanders, which immediately raises the question of exactly what the task is. Is it intended to consolidate the rooted stereotypes of New Zealanders from Pacific Island? is it to take advantage of this potential market? The story is weak, jokes are devoid of humor and the ending is expected. This movie did not do anything for New Zealand cinema, because it is just the right romantic comedy, devoid of any merit.
