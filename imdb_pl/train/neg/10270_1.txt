"American Nightmare" is officially associated, in my opinion, with "It's Pat!" For the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> Seven friends (strangely reminiscent of the cast of "Friends" K-Mart) gather in a cafe to listen to the pirate radio show American Nightmare. A guy with a beard leads him. This is the most exciting aspect of his performance. <br /> <br /> Chandler, Monica, Joey and ... oh, wait, I mean, Wayne, Jessie and the rest of the bad gang with one ruler are showing their biggest fears about the bearded DJ. Without their knowledge, a mad nurse / serial killer listens ... <br /> <br /> A crazy nurse then tortures Ross and Rachel and ... wait, I'm sorry again ... making their fears come alive. These fears include such stunned as "voodoo" and descent down by older ladies with prostheses. <br /> <br /> No. Really. <br /> <br /> This movie was one word rotten. Crazy madness killing madness has no motivation, there is nothing that would cause the viewer to "jump", ending blows, and - again - voodoo? <br /> <br /> If you have absolutely no respect for your loved ones, hire American Nightmare "with them. <br /> <br /> If you care about your loved ones - even a bit - go to the local Blockbuster, rent all copies of "American Nightmare" and hide them in your freezer.
