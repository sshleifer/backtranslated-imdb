I remember reading all the awful, horrible reviews of the movie when it appeared. I wanted to see how horrible it was, but in three weeks it was not in cinemas. The only other film to manage is Gigli. <br /> <br /> When the movie was released on DVD, I bought it to see how terrible it was. I could not think of the pure terrible remark that this movie was possible. After seeing this I can understand. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say that this movie is not devoid of cool shots. At the beginning is a nice shot, which shows the shot from the inside of the gun, which I thought was satisfactory. And the way the monsters in this movie theater are cool to look at; but it will get old after the first visit. <br /> <br /> Let me start with the worst thing in this movie: Tara Reid. If bad behavior was a sin, then Hell would throw Tara Reid because she is so incredibly horrible in this movie that it is unthinkable. He plays a guardian of all roles. Now, if she played a silly, empty sex toy, maybe I could forgive her how she treated her character. Apparently, Uwe Boll did not realize it, although it seemed that if he took his shirt off the film, people would see it. He just did not realize that forcing her to do it in the middle of the movie at an absolutely bad moment just made the movie even more fun. Is it a Mexican song or something on the stage of dry humping? I could not say. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to my next complaint: Uwe Boll shows some of the worst directing skills you'll ever see in the movie. I mean, I would give House of the Dead F (and I only do it for very few movies), but HotD would have scored at least B in comparison to this broken piece of rubbish. The film begins with a very, very long narrative that causes immediate confusion (and read by the terrible narrator), and from there the pieces are really, very stupid. There is one point where Slater and Reid are looking around the building that has been destroyed and the screen is obscuring. When he returns, Slater and Reid shoot everywhere and suddenly a whole army joins them. What? <br /> <br /> And someone did NOT bother checking errors in this movie. At some point the team breaks through the glass, but the glass breaks before they touch it. Tara Reid's earrings change colors in the middle of one scene, and when Slater leaves the dead companion, you can see him getting up. <br /> <br /> Regarding the story ... I was really lost. Something in an old tribe releasing darkness and someone "opens the path" or something and all evil monsters pop out. It's just an excuse to have a lot of weapon scenes (technology is so advanced here that no character has to overload in this movie), which is simply NIGHT. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie with the hope that I would laugh at how incredibly stupid he was. I did not laugh, but I still think it's stupid. Very, very, very stupid.
