Perhaps this is the strangest show of Santa Claus ever made on any medium, be it a book, photo or movie. Saint Nicholas looks like a pervert who looks at children, and the twisted story of bringing Merlin to help him defeat one of Satan's servants, Pitch, does not improve the situation. It's funny, at least, with bad results, even for the standards from 1959. If a kid were watching this movie, he would have nightmares and never wanted the Holy One to visit. They will be wounded for life. Imagine that the child is in "A Christmas Story" when they start shouting after they have been placed on Santa's knees. It would have turned out if the kids saw this movie.
