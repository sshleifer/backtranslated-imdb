There are many comments to this film, but I think they are misleading. It is a cross-cutting, over-used scenario in which a normal human being becomes a partner in a crime against someone of the opposite sex for no apparent reason. The boy meets a girl. The girl is holding a boy at gunpoint for something funny. The boy is puzzled. <br /> <br /> You know the drill: the antagonist turns out to be a savage, free spirit instead of a sociopath ... Put in a few words of wisdom from Alice Drummond and you have a recipe for Love. Sheedy's "is she crazy or just needs a hug?" The role of the Breakfast Club is simply the role of the main character. And all that's left is a really weird turkey movie.
