I really wanted to like this movie - photos from the location were mostly filmed in Pittsburgh, and the trailer had a great photo. But even when it was filmed, it was a really bad movie. Continuity and pace were just awful. The best bits in the film are in the end points, so (almost) it is worth to keep them to the end (though, oddly enough, it's been up a bit in the last half hour). <br /> <br /> When the best movie in the movie is Andy Dick, you know that there must be a problem ...
