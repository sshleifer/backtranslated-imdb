I do not know what they thought. through them, I mean that everyone even remotely connected with this catastrophe. I've seen such bad movies, I've seen bad movies really, and then this is it. But I will tell one who wrote the script, changed to put on the screen what might be the most illegible dialogue. there is nothing good about this film, either from a technical point of view or from any other point of view. released should be immediately released. There are a few fairly known names in the film. In essence, I hesitate to use the word movie.it is more a collection of random scenes that have no relation to another and create less than 0 senses. I do not understand why anyone who has any dignity would appear in this file. I have it really cheap, and I was still ripped. Even if I got this movie for free, I would still be cheated. 0/10
