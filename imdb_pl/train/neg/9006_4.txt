<br /> <br /> When I ignored some of the unbelievable, it was actually quite a decent horror / monster. So first I will give some good points: - the dragon was quite convincing, especially when she was circling the tunnels in search of lunch (tip: likes people). - the action was quite uninterrupted, and after the weak start I was completely absorbed by the plot. - I'm sorry to say, I was cheering for the dragon - she was probably the most convincing and consistent character in the movie. <br /> <br /> Now unbelievable things ** maybe some spoilers **: - if you hunted a fire-breathing dragon in 1100 AD, would you load a barrel of gunpowder under your arm in his cave? Duh. - a female figure with an American name, blond hair and an obvious Slavic accent trying to pretend to be a Spanish woman? What? - the main scientist whose Slavonic accent can be cut with a knife, and supposedly he was born in Chicago, educated in the USA? - a military helicopter pilot who makes his own repairs, flies a huge transport helicopter without any other crew, and is a shooting expert and a soldier to fight? WELL. UH Huh. I will not even mention its 3 different call signs within 2 minutes during communication with the base. <br /> <br /> It's still better than some Japanese monster movies from the '60s, but not much. If we are lucky, we will not see Dragon Fighter 2, although the ending naturally left this opportunity wide open. Maybe next time they will hire a real director. <br /> <br /> After all, I gave this move 4 out of 10. Add 2 more if you rewrite the story, and Dean Cain will get eaten in the first ten minutes. <Grin>
