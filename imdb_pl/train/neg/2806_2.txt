The worst kind of film. Basically, the US Declaration of Independence has been replaced by a plasma screen and it has fooled the museum's security for several days. Eh? <br /> <br /> A plasma screen that would theoretically operate for less than 2 seconds from a battery, assuming it has enough internal resistance to deliver the required current, which it would not do. > <br /> It would be possible for a dozen or so large car batteries and an inverter, but this system would not fit the case. I'm sorry to be anal, but it's not even possible. The rest of the movie was not better and I wonder why the budget could not be donated to charity or me.
