This tiring, insidious Las Vegas casino movie is almost impossible to watch and join. This is something you "look at" if you have absolutely nothing better to do. Only two worthy things in this movie are related to the wonderful Stella Stevens, and one spends the entire program hoping to fall out of one of those scant tops she wears. Many great shots from Las Vegas in the mid-70s (when there was still a nice place to visit) and fashion for the day are also good for giggling. Otherwise, one big yawning. Rhino dvd has a very good panoramic transfer, but even under 10 bucks it is still not worth my humble opinion.
