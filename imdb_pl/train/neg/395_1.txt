When I ordered it on the Blockbuster website, I had no idea it would be as terrible as it was. Who knows? Maybe that day I forgot to take medicine for ADD. I know that from the moment the cast came in their station wagon, she put on wide collars in the style of the late 70s, bells and feathers of hair, I knew that this unjust jewel of the disco era was a glory associated with a garbage heap. <br /> <br /> The first prophecy of what it would be like to be was a narrative at the beginning, trying to explain what cosmic forces are playing to wreak havoc in the universe, forcing polyester and music with the quality of porn a would-be viewer. From the initial scene with poorly made effects to the "monsters" from another world, and then the house that jumps from the universe to the universe, it was as painfully painful as watching the basic production of "The Vagina Monologues". <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, a sure sign that something will happen will appear when a small ship appears. The Ship was suspicious of what looked like the old part of the VCR and the camera, and would attack anyone in its path. Of course, if he moved slower than Bob Barker's strikes, but he had menacing, pencil-thin features and the ability to cast a sinister green glow that could stop the bullets and equipped with a laser capable of cutting ordinary balsa wood in an hour or two (with some help) . <br /> <br /> Continuing ... When the weird and bell bottom goes on ... We found that they were caught in "Space Time Warp". How to get this little scientific material? Because the eldest man tells his son that in a more or less casual way it resembles the memory of "how you won the big game" over a cup of Joe or an ice-cold bottle of refreshing Coca-Cola. Was anyone a scientist? No, but he knew about horses and apparently intervened as an amateur in the theory of Einstein's strings and theories. <br /> <br /> The recording I watched on DVD was almost a bootleg. The sound was muddy, and the transfer looked as if it had been shot down from the theater screen using a VCR on a mobile phone, except that it was really, very, very bad. (It's not really "really" enough to describe it). <br /> <br /> I know that some people love this movie and compare it to other iconic classics. I have never seen this film in the original version, but even then I think that I would come to the same conclusion: this funeral quickly.
