My God, was this an adaptation of the "Run, Lola, Run" persuasion? That was awful. Bad enough that the "screenwriter" (and I use this term very loosely) cuts out and pastes dialogue from one character to another, often completely out of context, and hurries up with this story: but Anne Elliott runs from place to place in pursuit of Wentworth at the end the song was an abomination! Austen must swirl in the grave. No respectable young woman would do so terribly. And the actress who played Mary? Horror. Needless to say, if the rest of Austen's remakes are so bad, they will turn off the new generation of observers. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the impeccable version of this (different) great novel, get the 1995 version, in which director Roger Michell starred with Amanda Root (whose expressions speak for themselves) and Ciaran Hinds. It is wonderful.
