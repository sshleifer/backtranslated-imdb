A small minority who saw here, praising the film, FIRST. I know it's the end of the personal opinion of people at the end of the day, but anyone with more than a few brain cells can certainly see that it's a total junk. It's so bad that it does not deserve to be part of this series. I can only assume that those who say how great it is are friends with someone involved in the movie and try to give their career a boost. Poor in every way, do not swear, in other words. The plot is a slight refresh of previous entries, the script is similar. Attempts to hide the lack of originality through the use of a girl (WOW!) They do not hide the lack of ideas of filmmakers, and unfortunately there is no complete terror. Absolutely no salutary qualities, total stupidity. I awarded this pair of chancellors with one sign for being able to force someone to finance this shit. They had to put in more effort than in the reality of film making. Shame.
