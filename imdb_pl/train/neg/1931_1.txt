I went to see it with great anticipation. Quite unfortunately, the dialogue is completely stupid, and in general the film is far from arousing admiration and interest. Even a child can see the missing logic of a character's behavior. Today's children need creative stories that would inspire them, which would make them "dream" of events. That's what happened to movies like E.T. and Star Wars a decade ago. (How many children would imagine becoming Jedi Knights and lighting their own lightsabers?) Seriously, do not waste time and money on it.
