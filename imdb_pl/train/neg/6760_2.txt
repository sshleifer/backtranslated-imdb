Renowned writer Mark Redfield (as Edgar Allen Poe) tries to overcome old addictions and start a new life for himself as a publisher in Baltimore, Maryland. However, obscurations, delirium and rejection threaten his efforts. He would also like to rekindle an affair with an old beloved, a much flawed perspective, as it turns out. Mr. Redfield also directed the dramaturgy of the mysterious last days of Edgar Allen Poe. Redfield uses many black and white, colorful and artificial photographs to create a mood. Kevin G. Shinnick (as Dr. John Moran) is doing well, relatively speaking. It's not enough.
