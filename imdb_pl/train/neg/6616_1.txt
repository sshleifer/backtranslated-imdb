I must tell you that I am certainly not an authority on Bollywood films and I have only seen a handful. However, if you have never seen it, do not start with it! I really liked the ones I've seen so far, but I just could not stand it. I must also tell you in advance that I can not finish this movie - it was so annoying. So why was it so annoying? <br /> <br /> 1. In the movie there is a character named "Rambha". It's even more annoying than Jar-Jar Binks - which I would never believe. He is so # @ ^! # Annoying !! He spoke in a falsetto voice and I think it was supposed to be a comic relief. Instead, he just gnashed my nerves and wanted me to die ... slowly! His voice, manners and disgust - he just did not seem to close and dominate every scene he was in - and he had to die! <br /> <br /> 2. The heroes had an amazing ability to avoid AK-47 missiles. I'm not kidding - there was a scene where a few unarmed guys took a small army of guys with these assault rifles !! And again and again they avoided picking up a single bullet and beat the bandits !!! This made Stallone's actions in "Rambo II" look mundane! <br /> <br /> 3. The movie was so loud - damn loud, on your face and intense - it practically made my brain bleed !! It was as if the movie was made by people under the influence of met !! Crazy angles of the camera, INTENSIVE music and action, action, action ... this movie is clearly designed for someone who can not make a movie with a plot and wants almost 100% of shares. <br /> <br /> 4. The two main characters and their actions and motivations meant that they understood nothing ... nothing! <br /> <br /> Maybe, if you're the most passionate action and fan of Bollywood, you can stand this movie, but I see why it's on the infamous IMDb list below 100. Wow ... this movie is bad intensely bad !!
