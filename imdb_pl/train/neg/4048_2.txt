Maybe not, but it's awful. Even a fantastic cast can not save it. OK, I admit it started quite funny, but it seemed like it would fall down as soon as they jumped to the girls in the generals' home. Bill Murray turned from a quick, playful guy to a hole that shouted at the people on the street that just were not funny, as if he were trying to be funny. His character stole a weapon (RV? Come on ...) and ended up as a national hero after invading another country and killing God knows how many soldiers laugh. One good thing is that this movie shows the inadequacy and incompetence of the American army and shows how arrogant and insolent, though unintentional, are. In fact, I felt disgusted that this kind of propaganda nonsense could really be released.
