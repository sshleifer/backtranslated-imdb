A boring, predictable and uninteresting story about a man contaminated with a chemical substance (Weller) who goes all over the country to find his ex-wife and children; meanwhile, he kills everyone in his own way with just one touch of his hand. In his dangerous track doctor (Hurt) and a young reporter (Natasha) try to stop the man. The film has no original idea, but it can be much better. The final result is a film without moments of tension and tension. Even a good cast is completely wasted. I give it 4 (four).
