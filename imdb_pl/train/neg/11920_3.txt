Oscar Wilde's comedy of drama, perhaps the wisest game ever written, is ruined at the hands of a secondary cast. Sanders is, as might be expected, carelessly, lazily genius in the role of Lord Darlington, but the rest of the cast makes the whole procedure a waste of time. Jean Crain tries a stage accent in alternating sentences, and other cast members seem to believe that it is a melodrama, not a comedy; in fact, the whole production has props that reduce it to a tragedy - undoubtedly insisted Hays office. Preminger's direction seems to consist mainly in making sure that there are many servants, and even music seems banal. Hold on to the visually perfect, quiet farce, directed by Lubitsch, and even the screen version from 2004 with Helen Hunt as Mrs. Erlynne; or try to read the art for the pleasure of words. But skip this version.
