JESSICA: HISTORY OF SPIRIT is as the name indicates the history of ghosts. The theme is to be a horror movie, but it's coming to comedy! <br /> <br /> There comes a woman who was brutally murdered returns from the dead. This is what this movie tries to convey as a story. There is nothing more to it. The film consists of a series of loosely connected scenes with the participation of a guy who had an affair with this woman before her death. <br /> <br /> Right after the opening stages this movie has the appearance of "straight to -DVD" effort. In contrast to jewels such as VACANCY 2, the film has no sense of direction or creativity, and movies "straight to DVD" are bad! The direction is just as poor as the total lack of tension, fear and tension. Even dramatic elements are planted hopelessly and represent something more boring than even the worst soap opera that you can have the misfortune to survive. <br /> <br /> Acting is absolutely hopeless because no actor is involved in the show, even the smallest potential of a successful acting career. <br /> <br /> Many individual scenes are incredibly long, with very long breaks between exchanges of dialogues. I'm not exaggerating! <br /> <br /> The only reason I give this film a rating of 2 rather than 1 is that some weak acting combined with an even worse dialogue led to several unintentional laughter. I emphasize the word "little" in this sentence. This is not generally one of the films "yes-bad-is-good", such as CAMP BLOOD or THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE. If you want to laugh hysterically, watch these movies. If you want to see the right ghost horror, watch the LEGEND OF THE HELL HOUSE, CHANGE, RING, EYE (original Korean version), THE GRUDGE, ONE MISSED CALL or PHONE. <br /> <br /> I advise anyone who was lucky enough to avoid seeing JESSICA: HISTORY OF THE SPIRIT to keep a good job! Just forget that this movie exists. Do not think about it!
