I think the biggest disappointment in this movie was that until the very end I expected the casting instructors to stop and apologize for how weak the game was. If we take into account the powerful subject, brilliant scenery and effort put into creating a wonderful set and spectacular images, it is a shame that little attention has been paid to acting. <br /> <br />
