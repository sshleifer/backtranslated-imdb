A reviewer from Poland must be a feminist because she thinks that "Young Catherine" is a great film and historically accurate. Nothing can be further from the truth. As a practicing Russian historian, for many, many years I have taken the exception of YC almost at every step, in particular the politically correct presentation of it as the head, who alone moved Russia towards domination. Truth? She was brought to St.Petersburg to become a wife and mother, and discovered that in order to "survive", she had to "connect" with dvorian, boyars and the army. As long as she did not challenge them, she was able to afford her cultural wishes (filling the Hermitage with art treasures, etc.). There is so much evidence that it was not "great", but in this area postmodern proof of revisionism is not very popular. YC is just a costume drama, a bit of down from Ted Turner, who, like "Peter the Great" in 1986, is another example of how Russia is portrayed in the West.
