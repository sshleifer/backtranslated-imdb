When you go to the cinema outdoors in the Greek summer night, you usually do not care what kind of movie it is! Edison started very well, with a good effort of actors-singers who wanted to be and once again a great Morgan Freeman, but ... (In the film is usually a good start to catch the audience, done, a little boring but the story fills the middle of the film, which is more about characters, and less about the action, done, and the third part is something really good, so you can remember the movie ...) when you see 30 elite policemen (packed with a weapon that can demolish the building) shoot the guy behind the car, do not hit him even once when he kills everyone (but 3), and then the guy throws out the flame thrower (to kill the rest of 3), you realize that the Greek summer sky filled with stars is too good to distract him such a movie!
