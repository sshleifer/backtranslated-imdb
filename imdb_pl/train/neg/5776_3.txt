bad acting, bad southern accents, incoherent pictures, horrible scenario ... <br /> <br /> I could not wait for this movie at a recent film festival and I was so discouraged after seeing it. It contains a quote / talent to quote other people's names, but they do not provide. Of course, the basis is an uneven and uninteresting story that is told. <br /> <br /> do not worry
