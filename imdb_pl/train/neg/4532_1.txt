My husband and I bought DVD Old School Sesame Street for our daughter and I have to say that I do not let her watch new episodes on TV because I think ALL characters are annoying. Baby Bear And Telly? OMgosh, How angry and useless blabber can think about your "skits"? Elmo? Rest, not every child likes it once again, annoying and does not teach my child anything. Mr. Noodle? what a rejection. It seems to me that once, when I turned the "new" program for her, she and I were stupider than before. The concert definitely turned in the wrong direction. I remember Yip Yips, Kermit's Breaking News, 1-2 2 Little Dolls, Mumford the Magician, Bert and Ernie, Grover the Waiter, all BIG EDUCATIONAL sketches OLD SCHOOL SS Sesame Street suffered direct boredom and stupidity. Departure of Jim Henson in 1990. The program no longer has educational, fun and interactive skitches, which he was used to before. I think the new versions are simply unbearably annoying and full of useless, non-educational blabbers. Going towards producers / writers S.S. you have one more cardboard show for parents to sit there, not creative, do not exercise children in front of you to get out of your hair. Per Producers / Writers: I suggest you throw out old muppets and start recording similar content to the first Sesame Street. The Lord knows that I certainly do not want my child to talk like Baby Bear or Elmo.
