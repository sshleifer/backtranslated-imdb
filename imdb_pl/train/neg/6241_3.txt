Something that really does not go hand in hand with the theory of Al Gore (and his followers) is the whole about "concensus". <br /> <br /> If there was such a consensus, why "believers" "In the all-encompassing global warming, feel the unrestrained need to try and intimidate anyone who questions it. <br /> <br /> Why anyone who does not follow global warming is satisfied with accusations of being stupid or on the payroll of oil companies (apparently a professional researcher of global warming does not mean that you are on someone's payroll in in this wonderful world ...) Why is there a need to tell everyone how the whole question is resolved, the real nature of science is to question the assumptions fairly? After a few ideas for answering these questions, read Prey by famous cannabis Michael Crichton ... wait, he is rich, not on the payroll of oil companies. He just risked his career, not challenging the Green lines and other Kyoto followers, and he did not tell the truth how he examined it. By the way, did you know that compliance with the Kyoto Protocol would lead to an almost complete reduction in temperature, his supporters say? Just a few questions that Al Gore tried to keep away from not getting any penny from the community lobby if he decided to run again. <br /> <br /> So who is the puppet ...?
