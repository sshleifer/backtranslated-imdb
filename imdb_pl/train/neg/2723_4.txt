Claire Denis's films seem to fall into one of two categories: brutal and bloody or silent and intimate. "L'Intrus" definitely belongs to the first category, but it is not as horrible as "Trouble Every Day" or "J'ai pas sommeil". <br /> <br /> Now, since I saw "Chocolat", I made a point to see every new Denis movie. And I've always been disappointed. L'Intrus was no exception. She has not made a film as personal and as moving as her first. <br /> <br /> You get a lot of regulars Denis: older but still great Béatrice Dalle, who seems to be in the movie just to show her full lips, the gap between her teeth, her big cleavage and a few nice coats; black guy from "Trouble Every Day" and "J'ai pas sommeil" Grégoire Colin and this Lithuanian or Russian girl. The character of Michel Subor was interesting enough, but the camera remained so long that it frustrated me with that winding fringe of hair hanging from his forehead and I was relieved when, somewhere in Korea, I think he finally cut her off. <br /> <br /> There was certainly some action - macabre murders, a son's search for a man - and maybe even a conspiracy, but one watching was not enough to figure it out, and two views I'm afraid there's no way. First of all, the result was shocking and obtrusive (as in "Beau Travail"). Secondly, the seasons have changed too sharply, leaving even more confused as to what is happening. Oh, there were some nice shots, and if you liked Friday Evening with pictures of folds in heavy curtains and sheets, you can appreciate the aesthetics of L'Intrus. Otherwise, lower the steering wheel. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in French and it's possible that I missed something crucial. But the dialogue in Denis's film rarely has more than five pages, double spacing and large margins. In "Chocolat", silence is sublime; in "L'Intrus" is simply boring.
