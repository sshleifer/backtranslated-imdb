This movie was very bad. Sci-fi is usually my favorite channel, so I watch all the original movies that play on it. I really do not know if this movie can be called the original. Starting a zoo / amusement park on a distant island sounds quite familiar. What was it, oh yes, Jurassic Park. But instead, he has Sabertooth tigers inside. <br /> <br /> The film starts with a few stereotypical kids from the college on the island, looking for some treasure hunt. One of them ends in a gruesome death with the worst special effects I've seen. The blood looked like ketchup. Also at the beginning there is a scientist who wants to create as many tigers of saber teeth as possible, so that people can enjoy them. Three of them have already escaped and eaten around tourists or people invited to the island to see tigers first hand. It sounds like a Jurassic Park again. Probably the coolest thing was the 1000 pound saber tooth that crawled on the front legs, killing the mad scientist with a statue of a tooth that somehow shrinks and passes through the guy's neck. The funniest death I've seen on TV. <br /> <br /> Acting is extremely bad, special effects are terrible. CG tigers could almost go to clay models, and even some sounds were turned off. For example, when one student tries to escape, uses an ax to break the door, the ax enters the door and about 2 seconds later you hear the sound. This movie was very bad. Trashy deaths were quite funny.
