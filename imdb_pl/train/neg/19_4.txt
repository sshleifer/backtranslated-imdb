I am a big fan of Arnold Vosloo. Finally, seeing him as the star of the last movie, not just the part, made me happy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I took the recognition of the film in college and the only thing I can say that I did not like that the movie was made in an abandoned part of the city and there was no traffic in the background or lookie loos. <br /> <br /> I have to say that acting leaves a lot to be desired, but Arnold is a great actor, I have to write it to a bad direction, and the supporting cast leaves something to be desired. <br /> <br /> I love Arnold Vosloo who made the movie. Otherwise, I would write it as another bad movie. <br /> <br /> I think the rape scene is brutal and unnecessary, but the actors who escaped at the end were quite good. But the sound effects of the shooting were very bad. There are some glitches in the film (continuity), but they are overlooked, considering the low quality of the film. <br /> <br /> In total, I liked the movie because Arnold Vosloo was in it. <br /> <br /> Jackie
