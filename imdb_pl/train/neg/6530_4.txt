** Possible Spoilers in advance ** <br /> <br /> Gerald Mohr, a busy film actor B in the forties and fifties, leads a trip to Mars. Before we reach the Red Planet, we enjoy the romantic patter between Mohr and scientist Nora Hayden; resident doofus Jack Kruschen; and the sight of Les Tremayne as another scientist with a goatee beard. Outside of Mars, false backgrounds and shades from red to pink appear - the "Cinemagic" process advertised in advertisements. Real cool monsters are a giant amoeba, a three-eyed insect creature, an oversized Venus fly trap, and an unforgettable rat / bat / spider. The whole bizarre adventure was reminded by the surviving Hayden under the influence of hypnotic drugs. THE ANGRY RED PLANET is said to have a fairly iconic style and probably conquered most of his followers during the psychedelic sixties.
