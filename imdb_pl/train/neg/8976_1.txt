The first point that draws attention in "For Ever Mozart" is the lack of a summary of the plot in IMDb. The explanation is simple, because there is no history, scenario, plot or anything that could recall the minimal structure of the film. Jean-Luc Godard is one of the most overrated and pretentious directors of the cinema industry, and this senseless shit belongs to his most hermetic films. I believe that none of them understood what this story is about; but there are intellectuals who elucubrate to justify or explain this messy movie, and it's fun to read their reviews. <br /> <br /> My voice is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Para Semper Mozart" ("Forever Mozart")
