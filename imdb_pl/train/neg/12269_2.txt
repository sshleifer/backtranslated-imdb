The sense of Japanese stimulation, editing and score must be different than American, but certainly this movie could be something more with a bit of post-production work. <br /> <br /> Somebody in Hollywood has to shoot this movie again and I think it would be a big hit. The story is interesting and frightening. There is something in the outskirts of the city, lively policemen, earthquakes, sanatoriums and mysterious murders of salt water that are enough to charm. However, this story must have some sense and it can be about 40 minutes shorter. <br /> <br /> I must say that the effect of the "sixth sense" was fully in this film, and it was obvious from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> In its present form, only hardcore Japanese movie lovers should bother to watch this o-boring movie.
