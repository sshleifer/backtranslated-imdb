I tried to run the movie again twice. I put it in three machines to see what happened. Has Steven Seagal's voice changed? Did he die while filming and the studio must play with someone who does not even look like him? Is the sound on the DVD destroyed? After about 10 minutes you will finally hear the real voice of the actor. Although it sounds like the sound has been recorded in the bathroom for most of the movie. <br /> <br /> I would be ashamed to give you a copy of this Goodwill movie if I own the copy. I rented it, but I will never do it again. I will check this database before renting more movies, all of which were (more or less) good movies. You usually knew what you were getting by watching Steven Seagal's movie. I think that's not the end.
