It's "The F.B.I." starring Reed Hadley with a star cast of guests! The film begins with a random (convenient?) Kidnapping, which leads to one and the other - which does not indicate the main story, which is "Big House, U.S. A." prison story. History is at least unlikely. It's like a TV program, only more "violent" (for times). <br /> <br /> ALE - cast is a journey! Imagine this: Ralph Meeker is sent to prison; his co-prisoners are the following criminals: Broderick Crawford, Lon Chaney Jr., Charles Bronson (reading the magazine "Muscle"!) and William Talman (reading the magazine "Detective"!) Honest! You should know that the early scene reveals what happens to the "missing" boy by responding to the ending "voice". If you do not want to hang it, do not miss the first scenes between the "Iceman" and the boy (Peter Votrian is doing well as a runaway). <br /> <br /> *** Big House, USA (1955) Howard W. Koch ~ Broderick Crawford, Ralph Meeker, Reed Hadley
