Trying to compare or present this "swill" as anything "Hitchcockian" is an out-out attempt to mislead Hitchcock fans to waste $ 7 on this movie ... Poor acting. Weak story. Weak scenario. <br /> <br /> Lack of real tension, no emotions. You wait for the whole weakness of this movie for a great payout, or even any payment ... You're left to think what the hell was all about. <br /> <br /> And please, just move to create "alternative lifestyles" HIP and correct politically !! ... I can not recommend it to anyone ... Did I mention the weakness of acting? Williams did a better job as Peter Pan and "Mork". But these were MUCH more innocent times ...........
