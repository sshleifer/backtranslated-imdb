Watch the 1936 version. Personally annoying to me is the voice of Charles Boyer, who more suits the cosmopolitan, depressed Rudolf - I mean Omar Sharif, but not - too sweet and alive. Catherine Denueve (sp) besides being too old, she does not resemble Marie - nothing! He looks too sophisticated to even think about dying for love of this man in this way. <br /> <br /> The only actor in the whole film that passes the role he plays is Ava Gardner, whose appearance as Empress Elisabeth on the screen is appropriately concise (and see pictures of the empress is more than a fleeting likeness), because historically the empress El≈ºbieta was not so involved in Rudolph's life.
