It is a film of great attractiveness for a relatively well-defined group (which I am not a part of). I went to the preview of this movie, not knowing what to expect - I finally found it disappointing. The story of a terribly dysfunctional (often even "twisted") Hungarian Jewish family is not my cup of tea. This epic saga should finally give the audience something more. In the end, images such as this concern the human condition - this image does not cast almost any light on any of its more significant aspects.
