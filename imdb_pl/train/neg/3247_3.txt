I was looking forward to watching this movie because it seemed to me that it was really promising with upcoming attractions: Jim Carrey with divine powers was an idea that certainly worked for me. As a big fan I was sure that he would be in his element with such a promising assumption, and what could go wrong? Yesterday my bubble burst, boys and girls, because I saw the movie. <br /> <br /> The first act (where it is set that he hates his life, he is a dissatisfied worker and mostly an unhappy ax with an ax to crush against God) is useful, the second act (where God calls him on the phone and receives the Almighty ) is GREAT - Carrey is enjoying her new "toys" and watching is really nice. But the third act is unhappy beyond faith. <br /> <br /> Rotting begins after the dinner scene between Bruce and his girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston, who comes out EXCEPTIONALLY good in this movie, considering that part of it is just a plot device, even her NAME smells unsatisfying) - thinks he will drink the "question", but instead tells her (on the bent knee) that he finally gets his message anchor job and is not that so exciting? <br /> <br /> She does not think so. She wants her to marry her, you see, so she ends up leaving her, you see, even though she still LOVES him a lot, see, and the rest of the movie spends us hitting us with one pitiful, over-heavy pass of spiritual-sounding phrase after the next one, I also prayed until the end. . To end it. <br /> <br /> I did not mind the lack of subtlety in the first two acts (one example - in the second act, after getting his powers, Bruce runs into the room singing "And what if God was one of us, just a slob like one of us ", blah blah), and I was even prepared to overlook the incredible amount of contradictions that are being cast on us (for openers, Morgan Freeman - a / k / a GOD) - he tells Bruce that he can not violate anyone's free will but it does a lot). These choices were forgivable - this is Jim Carady's comedy directed by Tom Shadyac - this is not "Remains of the Day". <br /> <br /> Or maybe it was a comedy. When the script writers lose sight of it (in frightening act 3) and try to transform the process into something like (gag) Message Movie, we get hell on the ground instead. Bruce realizes the error of his selfish ways, he realizes that GRACE is his saving - he must say - grace, and his priorities in life have been seriously misinterpreted. However, all this could be passed in a much less complicated way. The film did not have to go to the tipper to get these points. Unfortunately, the writers and Shadyac apparently had no idea how to solve this story in any clever and light manner, so they went the way "hit the head" in the hope that we would not notice. In the end, they even found a surprisingly unpleasant way out, hoping it would reduce the bad taste. It did not work for me.
