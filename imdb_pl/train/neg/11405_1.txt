I had to watch it at school. To sum up ... <br /> <br /> Unmanned actors, a song without talent and a director without talent. <br /> <br /> This movie is a waste of your time. Do not even watch the movie. Do not worry. You will be so disappointed. My teacher said it should be good. How wrong she was. She even slept a little because of that. The actors of the movie were simply angry. The best actor was an old man, and that does not say much. He has a terrible plot with terrible characters. So unrealistic and I can honestly say that it does not make sense. The script was emotionless and misleading. There were points in the movie when I frowned and said, "What?" There were too many loose ties and holes in the plot. It was just absolutely scary.
