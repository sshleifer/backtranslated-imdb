This is a low-budget movie in the style of "Scream". "Maddy" is a new employee in the apparently unnamed office, where he meets and establishes a relationship with his colleague "Chris". During the party in the hot tub, Chris and his friends convince Maddy that they belong to the "murder club" in which everyone killed someone for kicks. When Maddy loses and kills someone seriously, the hijinks are happening. <br /> <br /> The film looks good, and there are requirements for this genre and budget level (nudes, gore, maybe a few scenes from slightly larger stars than cast), but after credits you ask yourself why you spent 80 minutes of your life watching them.
