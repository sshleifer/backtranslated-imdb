They made me watch it at school and it was awful. The movie is outdated. Episodes are confusing because the fact is combined with fiction to make the story more interesting. The teachers talked about it as a feast, but it was really a painfully boring experience. they do what they do in the film in real life. Very often the story becomes slightly outrageous and ruffled. I do not like the way some lines were written and I would like them to be more important to them. Although it was written that it is educational, funny, full of tension and fashionable, it ended up being boring, dry, stretched and old. I hope that no one will take the time to watch this movie because it will not be visible.
