Certainly no TV program for children on Saturday morning has ever been so bad. After all, these producers had to count on the return of the audience. In this terrible offer, they could at least count the money they saved on the sets. The screenplay could have been a recoil from some long-forgotten show from a space opera, with some slender lines added for the cool guy Gerald Mohr, who purred to Naury Hayden. No director could do anything decent with such a crazy plot, so the action just gets boring boring. Space ships are absurd - for example, the Bulova wall clock and a portable typewriter - but sets of planets must be one of the worst in cinema history. Most of them are primitive drawings and everything is bathed in a often poorly constructed red light. Even the nude hairy Mohr's chest is used as a prop. And it's bad - as thin as a rib. Any viewer who reaches the end of this movie will hear a message from the Martians - and he will probably agree completely!
