Dahmer, a young confused man. Dahmer, the confusing movie. That's true, I had a few beers while watching the movie, but that does not explain why it bored me so much. <br /> <br /> His retrospections are only confusing and annoying, and there is no real plot beginning and end, the only thing that made sense in the film is the explanatory text at the beginning and the end of the movie. Between them, or film, they are simply boring images and a waste of time. <br /> <br /> We never see actual murders, all just a few insinuations. Sometimes you even feel that Dahmer dreams about the whole thing, but you know it is not because it is <br /> <br /> based on a real story and that's what happened, at least for the most part. But what happened? It is not easy to say. <br /> <br /> I do not encourage people to waste time on this movie. <br /> <br /> I did not like it a bit and I felt cheated when it suddenly ended. <br /> <br /> * / *****
