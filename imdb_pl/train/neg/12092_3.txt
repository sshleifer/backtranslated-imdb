I do not omit Haneke's above-average film skills. For example, I appreciate his arrears in unusual, natural day settings, as a powerful way to force strong realism. However, as far as the content of this film is concerned, it is very sad to see that in the 21st century there is still a need to pathologize relations or feelings regarding the dominance of dominance (and / or BDSM practices). The problem the main character has with his mother is unbelievably topical, as is the alienation and misunderstanding felt by Walter (I do not mean the frustration of a lover who is not loved in the same way that is understandable, I mean that he looks at her, if she was crazy, or if he was a monk, come on!). I mean, D / s is not something new in the world and I think it is rather stupid to treat this subject as if it were something "bizarre" or pathological; This is not. In general, films dealing with this topic are really delayed over time. <br /> <br /> For me, I think that this movie ends as a program movie, disturbed by very outdated psicoanalytic theories (is not that almost embarrassing?), and this really does not apply to the real life and experience of people involved in relationships D / S (personal experiences, forums, irc chat rooms, even the latest scientific research will show this).
