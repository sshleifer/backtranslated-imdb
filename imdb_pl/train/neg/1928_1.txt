Like Christmas Grinch Stole was a wonderful little Christmas cartoon that everyone could easily enjoy, I never saw the reason for the remake. Not to mention the remake created with people, the cartoon was just perfect, what is the purpose of the movie? But Jim Carrey seemed a bit strange to be Grinch. I mean, he's a great comedic actor, but as a Grinch? It just did not make sense to me. His performance was slightly above the peak and at times involuntarily funny. Not to mention the added dialog, which was a bit childish and unpleasant. The whole story of Grinch and Cindy Lou-Who has been finished and not needed. In fact, they just destroyed history, period. <br /> <br /> Everyone in Whoville is getting ready for the best Christmas season, where everything is going to be perfect. But Cindy Lou-Who is curious and worried about Grinch, who lives above them, and that he will not be as good as Christmas. He throws her out and decides that he does not want Christmas this year and that he should just steal Christmas to show what his Christmas version is about. Soon, however, she realizes that those who may know it is a little more than a materialized version of Christmas. <br /> <br /> Like Christmas, the Grinch Stoles were not needed and were slightly better. I really recommend sticking to the cartoon just for the simple fact that it's quite a disturbing version, at least in my opinion. The make-up and presentation of the whole film were a bit finished, not to mention How Grinch stole Christmas! it was supposed to be a cartoon rather than a version with Jim Carry. But at least this version makes you grateful for the version of Boris Karloff, which is played every Christmas. <br /> <br /> 1/10
