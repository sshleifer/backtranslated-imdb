I saw this thrown stack of vignettes on a preview show today and was amazed at how bad it was. <br /> <br /> First of all, the film practically flared up with the gaping dark spots. There are no lovers of black or gay New Yorkers in love? Or who, let's say, know white people in love? I know it is not a love crush in a tempting way, but you can not pretend to have a New York movie without those fairly common members of society. Besides, you know that the people who produced it thought that Crash deserved this Oscar, so where are everyone? <br /> <br /> Probably worse than the bizarre and deliberate socio-economic ignorance, there were offensive chapters down (remember when you were in high school, and people were openly disgusted by pretty young women in wheelchairs?) I too.) This movie contained many ways to be the worst. Bad acting, bad writing, bad direction - everything that concerns every possible genre to interest rich white people who smoke cigarettes outside sophisticated restaurants. <br /> <br /> But thank God they finally got Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson back to the Jumper meeting. And, by the way, Uma escaped the bullet; Ethan Hawke looks ravaged. This is of course one thing when it comes to his appearance, but he added an incredibly frightening extra atmosphere of terror to his frightening scenario scene alongside the poor, charming Maggie Q. <br /> <br /> I had a terrible time choosing my least favorite scene at the end of the questionnaire film, but it must be a piece of Anton Yelchin / Olivia Thirlby for a pure lack of taste that makes me sad because I really like these two actors. I do not think I'm offended, but all I could do was mock and look around with disgust like a 50-year-old's aunt. <br /> <br /> A close second place in this extremely tough competition of horrible things is the hollow tone of Shia LaBeouf, which shows what the former Disney Channel's star is against Julie Christie. I do not mean retreat. Against it is the only explanation. Now I realize that the early sequence with Orlando Bloom is a relative attraction. ATTRACTION. Remember that when your brain starts to leak out ear soon after the initial credits, which seem to be a nod to the first New York in the real world. This film is embarrassing, strangely outdated, inarticulate, ineffective, pretentious and ultimately completely detached from the real idea of ​​New York. <br /> <br /> (An additional star is the sequence Cloris Leachman / Eli Wallach, because it is quite sweet, but it is only one bright point in what seems to be hours of senseless masturbatory torment).
