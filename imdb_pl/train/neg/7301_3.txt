There is a big difference between the release of the original, intense, extreme, terrifying, gore-fest, and the making of Eli Roth and his team from the "Cabin Fever" and they just behaved like that. The film follows five college graduates to the cabin in the forest, which begins to be mortal as one after another succumbs to this mysterious, fast-acting, carnal disease. You do not have to wait long for friends to convert and can barely stand to see themselves, let alone want to be in the same neighborhood as they are. However it sounds, there is a basic premise of this film that could work in the hands of a less conceited filmmaker. Unfortunately, we end up with poorly drawn characters whose only goal seems to be looking beautiful at first, making the inevitable distribution more contrasting, trite script so vulgar that it leaves the viewer tuning in the dialogue, and a few incomprehensible motivational motivations that motivate little more than (in one case) the appearance of director Roth on screen. It's a messy movie in a few ways! Avoid this time of the devourer.
