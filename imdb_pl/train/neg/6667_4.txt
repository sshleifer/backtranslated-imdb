I liked this movie until Ed Norton's facial hair. Without revealing any plot details - one day he wore a light beard, but that same evening the beard disappeared and a very lush mustache appeared on the spot. It was much fuller than the mustache that accompanied the beard. Later, during the dark night in the open space, the mustache disappeared and appeared, cleansing the shelter. This was the moment when it would not be possible to stop shaving. These discrepancies in continuity have completely distracted me from the rest of the movie and ruined my previous credibility. Besides, the long cowboy scene in his bedroom was too similar to De Niro in the Taxi Driver. Even if it was to be a tribute paid too much to this viewer.
