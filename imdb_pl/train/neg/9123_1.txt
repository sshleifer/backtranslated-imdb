I do not have much to say about this movie. It could have been a wonderful tour-de-force for Peter Sellers, but this is one of the most tragic events in film history. The fact that it is the last film by Sellers makes it even more painful. <br /> <br /> Horrible scenario, direction and shocking wooden performances come together terribly together to make this one of the most incredibly horrible movies ever made. <Br /> <br /> I want so much that I can even find a giggle or giggle buried somewhere in the pile of rotting fat, but it's a dead, humorless catastrophe. The truth hurts. <br /> <br /> Peter, why could not you stop BEING THERE?
