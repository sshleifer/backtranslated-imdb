This is a very sad movie. Really. Nothing happens in this movie. The script is bad !!! I think that they have just copied and pasted the first 15 pages to 90 pages. The producers had to think that we would create a Hollywood movie here in Belgium. They failed. Now in the third week only takes place in Antwerp and Brussels at 22:45 or something like that. In the past, we had really good films in Belgium, like Daens. Shades are a waste of time. Maybe you could sneak into the theater after watching a real movie. If you've seen 10 minutes of Shadows, you've seen it all. He was advertised to death on local radio and television. I hope it will soon disappear in the Shadows.
