It was one movie that I wanted to watch whenever it was released. Promos was eye-catching, and Govinda in a negative role was surprised. <br /> <br /> But the movie is not so good <br /> <br /> It has many disadvantages <br /> <br /> The beginning is good and up to murder all goes well, but the movie falls when the romance begins between Govinda and Karisma and the songs that follow after <br /> <br /> Then spin in love Govinda and Tabu leaves more doubts and flaws, and then How it happens that Govinda turns into a wealthy criminal from a poor peasant? <br /> <br /> The last retrospection is also prolonged, as well as the entire clash between Govinda-Karisma and Tabu <br /> <br /> N Chandra disappoints. Music is OK, Bahot Khoobsurat stands out <br /> <br /> Govinda tries to play a negative role and does it very well, although she overdo it too much sometimes Karisma is good, but sometimes she teases her with tears. Tabu is fine. Nirmal Pandey still does not know that the difference between loud screaming and rest is obvious y
