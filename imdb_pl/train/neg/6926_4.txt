I have it in DVD 10 pack CURSE OF THE DEAD. You must love these bargain packages. Even if they do not include real remastering, restoring and other hoo-ha, and movies are generally in full-screen and scan format, there is no doubt that there are always a few gems. By "jewels" I understand that there are always some good nonsense, especially if the films come from the 70s, when The Mansion of Madness is. <br /> <br /> My copy is called Mansion of Madness, but when the title screens are rolling, it's Underground Loch Poe Dr. Tarra. It does not matter, really, because nonsense is nonsense, right? Yes! But to say that this movie is completely worthless is not true. Here and there are a few funky elements and of course the movie had a decent budget. <br /> <br /> The opening title sequence is fun and its color negative is like a cheap TV. Dialogue is always fun. At the beginning of the film, the horse and carriage driver gets out to move the dead tree trunk in the middle of the road. "JAKA FORCE!" Says our hero. The funny thing is that this guy will not be able to fight the crazy foresters later when they start doing bizarre fun. You completely forget that this guy was even in the movie until he reappeared at the end. Such figures are so memorable. <br /> <br /> However, the best part of Mansion of Madness must be crazy music and carousing, which must endure good guys. It's like bad cartoon music that a three-year-old can find. And why in general the whole bizarre slapstick? I would say that my favorite moment had to be when the horse and buggy are ambushed by forest maniacs when they drag a stupid, ghost-looking stick in the middle of the road and stop the cart. What the hell? Oh yes, there are also tons of boobs that can be seen also for those who kick things like that. Boobies, bad dialogue and crazy music. That's the best sum of Mansion of Madness for me. It's worth at least one watch and it can be a lot better if you have a few to drink or anything. I can not say that I have ever been bored with it, but I can not deny that it is also a barrel of poop. Just like the Magical Mystery Tour, but with a story, but not. Hmm. <br /> <br /> And Mr. Chicken PWNZ.
