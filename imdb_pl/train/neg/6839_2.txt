The twins separated at birth (due to the death of their parents) reunite twenty-five years later to avenge their parents and collect a million-dollar tunnel. Double Impact takes two hours and essentially does not add any real approach to the story of the Corsican brothers, and Jean-Claude Van Damme, while adequate as a bad twin brother is simply embarrassing as a good twin brother. Also the action sequences are not so exciting this time, and Jean-Claude relies more on shots and then on his martial arts. The cast is also wasted, and after two hours the movie is just boring. <br /> <br /> * out of 4 (Bad)
