I loved the first Azumi movie. I saw Mrs. Ueto in various television appearances, and I saw my participation in samurai and ninja films. I must say that this movie was much weaker than I expected. <br /> <br /> Given the cast of the film and setting it in "Azumi", they should have been able to do a much better job with this film, but instead it was slow, boring in parts and sprinkled with a very weak, unconvincing and wooden actor. <br /> <br /> When they tried to appeal to the first movie, they did it in a rather loose and weak way. In "Azumi" the title character is the best of the group of better killers. In "Azumi 2" it seems somehow reduced and less impressive. <br /> <br /> It does not mean that it was a total loss. There were several decent fighting scenes and some top characters. Unfortunately, the film suffers from the simple fact that Shusuke Kaneko and Yoshiaki Kawajiri are not Ryuhei Kitamura and Isao Kiriyama. The last two really captured the atmosphere of "manga" in the script, while the former never "got".
