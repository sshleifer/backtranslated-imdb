When it comes to film, it's a good science fiction movie. It has many cool things and some high-quality scenes. That said, it's not so good, and some things are quite far-reaching ... <br /> <br /> When it comes to developing this other cube-movie, it's complete and complete. This is the definition of milking a wonderful and imaginative original film ... All this feeling can be somewhat translated into the core of the first, but introducing people / androids as part of the "band" behind the cube is a little stretched ... <br /> <br /> I gave it 3 *** because of stabbing the back of the original. This one should be sterile in so many parts of the movie that there is no time or space to tell them all ... <br /> <br /> You can watch it for those who have not seen Cube and Hypercube, but are not recommended for fans of the series ...
