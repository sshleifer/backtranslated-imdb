Well, you have to give the director a reward for how brave he was. An indulgence would be the right date. Not only did he use five casts (no additions on ALL), but he also decided to use special effects of sub-par with a misleading and boring story, he too, and I am NOT kidding, I will warn the beginning of the film in which you can DIE! However, they promise DIRECT COOOOFFFFFFFIIIIINNNNN. Having a frightening gardener is always a good move. Yaaa-unique-aaawwwwnnn .... <br /> <br /> If you watch the Mystery Science Theater 3000, you could see it. They like to show awful movies to let you know. <br /> <br /> A good present for someone you hate.
