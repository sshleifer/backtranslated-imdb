In the deleted post another IMDb user indicated that anyone who can see "The Medusa Touch" should be alerted to a scene that unbelievably reminiscent of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in New York. But I hope that anyone who reads this will consider this warning. Despite an interesting pedigree (producer Elliott Kastner produced "Harper" and "The Long Goodbye", co-producer Arnon Milchan co-produced Oscar-nominated "Confidential LA", and screenwriter John Briley won the Oscar for "Gandhi") and international cast, I think that " The Medusa Touch "is a heavy, unintentional laugh. It was a bad, terribly written and messy game. He tried to use the genre of telekinetic thrillers from the 70's. The film fails in many respects. Please consider "Carrie" and the unappreciated "The Fury" (both directed by Brian DePalmy). They were two fun and exciting thrillers that touched on the same topic.
