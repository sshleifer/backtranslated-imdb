This movie is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm learning French in college and that's how I understood all the dialogues, so the language barrier was not a problem. I must say that it is really difficult to get into any of the characters shown in the movie. There is only one professional actor in the cast and I'm guessing that there are no professional directors or writers. <br /> <br /> Although I rated it one in ten, it probably does not deserve such a low rating. It is only a futile effort to lower the current overall rating by 7.3 to something more realistic. Maybe 4.3 would be more accurate because the movie is a real non-event for 100 minutes or so long that you will never come back. <br /> <br /> The real shame is that I'm sure that some student is breaking the nut that makes the film twice as good and half the length. However, if you want to join a fashionable band that seems to be circling around IMDb, you might as well give "Lost in Translation" 10.
