I'm still a sucker for Pyun's aesthetic sense, I liked the movie, although the "unfinished" ending was a disappointment. As usual, Pyun develops a perverted sense of humor, and Kathy Long's fight is extremely impressive. Beautifully photographed, it has the impression that it was done on a big screen.
