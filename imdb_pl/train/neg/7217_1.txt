I just watched this DVD at home. We love westerns, so my husband rented it. He started apologizing halfway. Saddles, costumes, accents - everything was turned off. The part that pissed me off is that the guy did not shoot the "collector" with his bow and arrow when he took the fat man's soul. His only justification was "he only had 2 shots". We've seen it all the way and, as somebody else said ... too many bad things to extract any reason why it sucked. I mean, the boy happened to snatch a bad stone from the collector that same month and the day he was found, why all this? And why was there a grave yard where everyone died on April 25, but the people whose souls the collector took were still walking? If you want to make a movie after a few beers, it could be your movie. However, if you want a real West, you will hate this movie.
