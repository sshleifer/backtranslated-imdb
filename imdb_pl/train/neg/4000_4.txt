I liked the American movie, so I rented the first Chris Smith movie, which I also considered a documentary. In the first minute I saw that it is not so, but I gave up. <br /> <br /> What a dead end. Being faithful almost does not serve you if you intend to examine boredom, especially. tediousness with which we already know. <br /> <br /> Excuse me, but will it be a hit for EVERYONE 1) a lot of work is sucked and 2) most of them are shitty, minimum wages in the service sector? I knew it before I saw the movie. Anyway, it was not really investigated, because while the movie is struggling with a sense of "reality" (hand-held camera, lack of music, etc.), what happens is almost not like in the "real world". <br /> <br /> Would the employer be so happy with Randy when he gets the check after Randy gave up after 3 days, when the guy said he expected 6 months? Or a day after he left work (and screw up the machine he was working on) that everyone would be so easy on him? <br /> <br /> A big problem is our "hero" (?), Randy. This guy is a loser. Not because he got stuck in these jobs, he has a bad flat or looks like one. It's a drug. He does not pay attention to or even try to do it. He has zero personalities. If I had to hire someone, he would not cross the interview. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to see what Chris Smith does, but guys, I'm pushing "this-it-is-important movies." "American Job" does not work.
