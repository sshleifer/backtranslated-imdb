... Wrong, that is deliberately bad ... <br /> <br /> This little jewel fired straight onto the big MST3k screen. Although it is obvious that the film does not try to be taken seriously (I hope their goal anyway ...), the film is still bad. Damn, makes Leprechaun look like a big budget in space ... <br /> <br /> In short: paint my plum in the color of a car!
