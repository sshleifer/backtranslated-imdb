This Hitchcock film is not much like the similarity to his later suspense films and seems more reminiscent of the very old-fashioned tale of morality. The young couple receives a legacy that they think will make them happy. They spend money traveling around the world and living in a very hedonistic existence. However, after a while emotions begin to weaken, and the pair is dispersed and aimless. However, not in any place where they are in a luxury cruise, the ship sinks and loses everything - and eventually they end up much happier because now they appreciate life! What a strange, stupid movie! Personally, I would like to inherit all this money and find out if it makes me unhappy! <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are relatively weak compared to later productions - rough film with poor sound quality and rather amateur acting.
