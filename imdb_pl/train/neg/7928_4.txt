In fact, the movie is neither a horror nor a Sci-Fi. With a very strong Christian religious motif, this film ensures minimal content and no tension. Second-level actors do half-decent work, reading their boring roles. The only good performance is Sydney Penny, who plays the role of a mother ... I will not break the film, it's either Christ or Antichrist. Avoid watching this movie unless you are a Christian religious fanatic who is obsessed with the apocalypse. <br /> <br /> Being a non-Christian, I had to force myself to watch this movie just because I wanted to write this review. It is a pity that the Sci-Fi channel had to air this movie in the evening.
