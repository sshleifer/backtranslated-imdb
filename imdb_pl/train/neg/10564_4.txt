The real shame of "The Gathering" is not in bad action, nor in a desperately shallow conspiracy. The real shame is that it was much worse than the series that began, although it had one main attraction: Takashima. I would like to see Laurel Takashima in a room with Susan Ivanova, even for five minutes. He has this sarcasm, this joke, this double-edged personality, which is both changeable and nice. Unfortunately, the pilot movie "Babylon 5" has an incredibly boring story about the murder. Patricia Tallman - who never seriously returned to the show much later - luckily became much better with age, as Lyta Alexander, who is just a tedious, exhausting telepath. I will leave you with one last thought - why does Delenn look like some cosmic frog (though she is a woman)? Thank God for the way Minbari looked later in the show.
