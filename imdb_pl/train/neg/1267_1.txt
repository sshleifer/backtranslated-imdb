Why me? Why should I be subjected to such slaughtering, what could make an interesting plot ?! At least, if I can warn other people, it would be worth it. <br /> <br /> I had to watch this horrible movie for a college course. Otherwise, I would look at the summary on the back of things and turn to them. The film was slow, it had a VERY small character development and focused on the idea that a terrifying little white man could cool off if he hangs with a black LA style token. <br /> <br /> If you want to experience the stereotypical sense of the stunning LA exterior - watch the movie. Remember, however, that this film does not reflect what we consider to be the 'LA lifestyle', it is a great example of the products that ARISE comes from.
