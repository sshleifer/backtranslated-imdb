Well, after watching this, I can say that this is not the worst movie ever made, yes, people are worse there, there are some good points in the movie, you can watch drunk teenagers, have horrible deaths, and lovely looking rats eating some experiment scientific, and becoming grotesquely huge, drunk caretaker, broken doctor, and so a girl in string underwear, which absolutely no shame, stupid panties, I could not wait for a rat to eat these drunken fools, I cheered the rat for the first time, had a good premise , the first part of the movie was interesting, although with the scientific discovery of rats and a small story behind, but I think it ruined when stupid, drunken, horny teenagers are involved, the rat in my opinion, the one who got lost, his name is Brenda , he was so fake, he had to be cGi a rat, he looked like a guy dressed in a beaver suit, it was pretty schlock y, lame, but not entirely monstrous,
