This is really one of the worst films ever. I consider myself a big fan of a zombie movie and I usually tolerate bad acting, bad "special effects", stupid stories and anything you can find in second-order movies. This one has virtually no positive aspect and is third or fourth, maybe worse. Some of my friends and I did a small movie during a week's holiday and we definitely did a better job (although there is no zombie movie). <br /> <br /> This move is not even funny, let alone anything else. Really bad and unnecessary special effects, zombies that look like normal people (with the exception of white extra skin stretched on their faces), WAY TO MUCH Fake Blood (I like realism very often, the combination of realism and Zombie movies is debatable, but the gore is just stupid). The camera stays quite long with feeding scenes, it gets boring and you can not help wondering why the zombies use BRONI (!) To kill the victim. I will not go into the details of dubbing (others did). Although I am from Germany myself and I am at least a bit curious about the original version, I will not waste more time on this film. <br /> <br /> Stay away from it, if you can.
