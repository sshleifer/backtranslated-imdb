I gave this program (I only watched seven episodes) four stars because most of its jokes / sets seem to be failing. Some are not funny, but some are fun - in a 12-year-old boy. It reminds me of this New York painter who throws paint on canvas, calls art and sells it for a lot of money. Silverman throws away what she has, including the kitchen sink, while she prays that a few things will stick to the wall in her effort to be funny, but different. <br /> <br /> However, what she "got" often is not enough, as if she missed a good comedian who must succeed. <br /> <br /> The whole enterprise is like immature potatoes.
