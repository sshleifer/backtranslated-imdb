=== minor spoilers === <br /> <br /> I am, like many others, a big fan of Jerry Bruckheimer. So when I saw all the beautiful posters hanging from the front and the trailer in front of MI: 2, expectations were growing. Production of Jerry Bruckheimer. Big cars. Nothing Cage and fresh from Oscar - Angelina Jolie. What can go wrong? Much. <br /> <br /> The script is neither funny (which is really difficult), nor exciting. You put on a black man who keeps making racist jokes about himself and Wooh-haa !! do you have a comedy? I do not think so. Excitement is completely out of place. First of all (and it is probably repeated many times) there are no nice characters, so who cares who will be killed? IF you agree with the assumption that the psychol will kill brother Nica, unless he steals 50 cars in 4 days, the next thing you know is that Kip (brother) goes with Nothing on the streets. Is this excitement? Do not think. Then there's the best song - romance between Nothing and Angelina. She looks bored to have to say all these stupid words to Nico. 'Do you have a girlfriend?' - Do you see someone? 'What went wrong?' etc. <br /> <br /> Then there was only one glimmer of hope: the chase of the car. They are at least disappointing, because the trailer looked as if it was full, and there is only one. Very long, caught in the annoyingly hectic movement of the camera. I really had problems with following the action. <br /> <br /> So this is an action movie? thriller? romantic comedy? - you do not have to decide, just avoid this terrible mess. I'll give 3 out of 10 stars and feel that I'm generous.
