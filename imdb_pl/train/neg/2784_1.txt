My husband and I are the parents of an autistic little boy who lives in the same town as the screenwriter of the movie. We were very worried that JCC brought this film to a Jewish film festival because of the way in which a mentally handicapped Frankie character is portrayed. After leaving, we went to see this movie at the local theater. We demanded a refund. We encourage the writer to transfer some of the funds to the JCC Achad program to apologize. <br /> <br /> We did not like meeting Frank - mentally handicapped, maybe even an autistic teenager - as part of a joke that is still dropping something to look at the nanny's breast. <br /> <br /> There was no point in making Frank's character different than saying "hey, being mentally handicapped is fun." Challenges like Frankie are a serious matter. Families like mine really suffer. <br /> <br /> The writer has to explain himself. Does he know families with disabled children? Does she see families with disabled children week after week in the JCC pool?
