Tobe Hooper made great films, so I was sure he could not be BAD. I did not read any reviews and tried to watch this unwitting humorous movie. Sometimes it made me laugh, sometimes I almost fell asleep, sometimes I made almost CRY for Hooper. <br /> <br /> I rated it 3/10 because its a horror movie from 1990 and many interesting or funny things happened there. Throughout the movie, I was thinking something like "it just CAN NOT add more stuff in this movie ..." ... but they did it. <br /> <br /> Some say it's some Firestarter clone, but it's not really based on this idea, but that's all. It's a combination of horror, comedy, strange religions / gods, funny gore, simple effects, drama, horrible acting, incredible scenario ... and more. <br /> <br /> * spoilers * The story is: The government is trying to create the ultimate weapon using nuclear energy or something and fails, during the process the child is born for 2 test persons. When mom sings a child after birth, both husband and wife are burning, and this is SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION. The government buries the whole thing and leaves the child live among other people and ... then, after x years, this kid grows up and realizes that he was born for some reason and he can burn things with his brain. Then everything becomes an unbelievable mess, nothing really explains anything and ... Well, when the government realizes that "okay, can set this fire to work", take it to a normal hospital, where there is some nuclear poison, what they intend use this man. they can kill him, no, they can not shoot him! .. and argh, I think it's enough to say, I promise that there are 100 strange things in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you want good laughter, look at this one. Wounds.
