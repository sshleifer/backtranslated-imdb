Understand that I'm reviewing the movie I saw. I understood virtually all the nakedness and gore was cut out of this film, thus completely sterilizing it. When I saw names like Ginger Lynn and Jenna Jameson, I knew I would not get a classic horror movie, but at least I expected free boobs and bloodshed. But no, it has to be the most massacred modern horror, it means it's easy to say that there are many more scenes in some scenes, but they suddenly cut off, or the scene just ends completely with its beginning. How to screw up porn stars and cannibals? I mean, it's a winning formula, I wonder if the director slept with a director's wife or something like that because it's literally amazing how much of it was cut out. Reading about it a few years ago in Fangoria, I was excited, it looked like a funny movie, but unfortunately the real movie is somewhere locked in the treasury and we have to endure this piece of excrement, which was named Evil Breed. I hope that one day an invaluable song will be released, because I think there is a good movie in this mess, but it's best to catch twelve Buda packs so far, because that's the only way to go through this movie.
