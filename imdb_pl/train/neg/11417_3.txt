Youthful group in "St. Elmo's Fire, who has just graduated from college, barely realizes that she is able to graduate from high school much less than four years at any well-known university. For the most part, these children are irresponsible, selfish, greedy and stupid, but co-writer and director Joel Schumacher seems to have kept them as milestones for a generation. With an obsolete cast of "up and comers", background foundation that sounds terribly similar to "Terms of Endearment", and writing, which relieves satisfaction with this circle over us, "Fire" is a poor light it becomes even more embarrassing when years pass. * 1/2 of ****
