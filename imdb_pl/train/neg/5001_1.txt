I do not know why I'm commenting on that stupid reality show I've just watched in a few episodes (cable marathon broadcast, 5 episodes in a row or something like that, but I did not watch the whole thing, just like three episodes) because I was in the ninth month I was pregnant and I was going to work every day. Maybe I'm bored today :-) <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for Britney, I really do. money and fame seem to have a very small sense of dignity. Either it is self-centered to the extreme. She married a filiform Federline (okay, everyone can make a mistake), and earlier she "played" this awful program about his everyday life, where he pushes the camera wherever he wants, regardless of whether it is in someone's face or in the shower when Federline is standing there. She babbles about her sex life, leaving nothing to your imagination, I do not care about my part, but I can not help wondering how she feels when she is divorced. And yes, I am embarrassed because of her. But I should not be. It seems that he lives a completely empty, shallow life. I do not want to change with her, even if I could. If you want, kill the TV.
