OK, so I'm an original Wicker Man fan and I usually do not like British-made films, so why oh why did I give in to the most painful cinema experience? I'm not a fan of Nicolas Cage and maybe I had a moment of madness? The film was terrifying! The piece at the beginning of the disaster had no meaning for the movie, and the policewoman knew where Edward was going, so in the end with the two girls visiting the continent, well, it would not be like the whole thing would be investigated. The story behind the wicker man has not really been studied - and I think the setting in America did not really help in the pagan topic. This movie was slow and did not contain atmosphere or tension. I must say that the best was at the end when Nicolas Cage was on fire! I am in a desperate need to see the original again, to cleanse my disappointed soul. I can not really stress how disappointing this movie is, please do not see it if: <br /> <br /> A) I do not like American remixes of British films B) Are you a fan of the original C) Hate Nicolas Cage
