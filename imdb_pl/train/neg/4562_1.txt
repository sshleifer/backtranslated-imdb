I did not feel as if I had been raped, as in the case of ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS, but BELLE'S MAGICAL WORLD is still the antithesis of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. Just like CHRISTMAS, BMW hates its audience, though not so extreme. It's ugly, non-canonical, idiotic, and the writing is terribly bad. None of these stories works. These are not characters that we loved in BATB, they are a group of people. I wanted to analyze it, but after a few minutes I gave up because no one in their right mind would take this slap seriously. We have three stories here. The "perfect word" is an overbearing, hard study of forgiveness. "Fifi madness" only works if you can accept the fact that Babette's name is actually Fifi and that he is the damn werewolf of James Bond, and Lumiere is an idiot to women. 'Broken Wing' (or 'Broken Wind', as I like to call it) is probably the most shameful of the whole group. The beast hates birds? Since when? Do not watch this shit - every copy of this movie deserves to be cremated. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is still a classic film, a transcendent celebration of love, art, intelligence and the human soul.
