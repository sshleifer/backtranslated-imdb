Annie's wig does not look good. she is not cute and pretty enough to play Annie. Annie is sticking out in the movie because her costumes look like Halloween costumes. terrible working and terrible threads. This film is a change from the 1982 version. I think that a younger and smaller girl should play the main role. Ashley Johnson presents a very boyish Annie. Not appealing. At least the casting director was doing well with Daddy Warbucks. Mrs. Hannigan was also badly served. Camilla Belle was playing Molly all right. "Warning" this video may offend your IQ, so you can only show it to very young children. 8 and younger. Some threads are too fictitious and hard to find in the real world.
