To be completely honest, I have not seen many Western films, but I've seen enough to know what a good movie is. It is by far the worst western on today's planet. First black in the wild west? Come on! Who ever thought it could be a cool wall movie that everyone would love, was a bit, no, no, totally delayed! Secondly, on this day and age women, especially black women, were not willing to carry and use weapons. Asian chick speaks excellent English? If the setting is west, Asia is not where you are going. In the end, a bad gay chick was too much, the movie was just nonsense from the beginning. Now, do not get me wrong. I'm not racist or white, so do not be fooled after reading this, but this movie, this movie is the worst presentation of black people I've ever seen!
