I have no idea which director of the program George Schlatter hoped to sell this comedy. With Redd Foxx in the lead role and enough primitive costumes and polyester for carpets in the '70s, "Norman" plays like a blaxploitation image in combination with any number of stupid sitcom episodes involving comic misunderstandings, not to mention the prolonged Waylon Flower episode! Based on the art of Sam Bobrick and Ron Clark, this tale of a detached marriage (Foxx and Pearl Bailey) learning the hard way that their son is secretly homosexual - and living with grinding, fancy white homosexual - has enough inertia -wristed jokes to shame every early episode of "Three's Company." Bailey retains his dignity, and Foxx's usual confusion is good for a few chuckles, but the rest of the performers are humiliated. * with ****
