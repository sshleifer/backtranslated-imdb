Anyone who gives this film a good review, of course, had to have something to do with his creation. This movie is a painful sucking. Acting is stiff, the genre soundtrack is ridiculous, the direction is bland and the weirdest of all, the teacher is not really that attractive (making the student's glaring progress even more awkward). The creative minds behind this garbage should be resolved and spread to prevent further manifestations of such concentrated greed. I am sure that some of the starving children in Africa could have used the wasted money for this project. Hell, the funds would also see a more enlightened goal of driving addicted to crack; at least someone will get some entertainment out of it. For the simple reason that it did not give me a lethal disease, I will give this film to two.
