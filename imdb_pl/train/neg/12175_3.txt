Why is it worth viewing good movies when you can view "Trancers II?" <br /> <br /> Ooh, this movie is very lame. I can imagine a cast and a team riding L.A. with a camera throwing add-ons in the stupid make-up of monsters in the poor, suffering Tim Thomerson. Families of stars actually appear to play the cameos, probably because Full Moon can not afford "real" additions. Lame, lame and complicated script would take eons to solve all nodes - this must be a classic Trancer! <br /> <br /> And yet ... and yet ... it rules. Note that the same is true for "Trancers IV". I say this because it's true. What can he beat by watching an older guy in a trench coat who mows a zombie and then resigns from such questions as: "Do not worry, ladies, they are biodegradable"? Well, many things can be better, but still good things. <br /> <br /> The only significant caveat is Megan Ward who really stinks in the pond. It is a bad rival for the heroine Helen Hunt - they are both young eye candy and would be more effective if it actually contrasted a little bit more. Well, you can not have everything. At least the wonderful feature of the "long second watch" has returned to its place and we have more Hap Ashby, the least convincing sportsman in cinema history (oh, wait a minute - he has a rival figure of David Ogden Steirs in "The Creator"). <br /> <br /> I have not seen it lately, but it seems to me that I remember that Martine Beswick twice escapes during the last battle. Applause for poor continuity! This is just one of the many attractions of this amazing film.
