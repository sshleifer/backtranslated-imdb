"How She Moves" comes to life only when its high-energy, talented cast members are on the heel and spread their things in the camera. Otherwise, this outdated story of suffering and success has little energy, is not very original and low in relation to anything that can make a movie stand out from dozens of other similar films that appeared before it. <br /> <br /> Rutina Wesley has a modest appeal as a talented academic teenager who thinks that the best way to raise her tuition fees at school is to participate in step-dance competitions, but both she and her colleagues are poorly handled writing on the screen and an unmatched direction. As mentioned earlier, the film achieves a certain spark when the performers dance on stage, but such moments are much too small and unfortunately fleeting.
