So, when Herbie appeared for the first time, I was completely happy watching the cup of Dean Jones. I just wanted to party for a few hours and eat some buttered popcorn. Now, unfortunately, I have expectations for a riveting / enchanting story when I watch a movie if I'm not on some medicine. And this is another good movie for the treated. There are no bigger laughs, no complicated plot lines, no difficult twists. Herbie Fully Loaded is great for fully loaded. <br /> <br /> It was the first time I saw La Lohana on screen since she swapped places with Jamie Lee Curtis (I thought she was great at it) and I can not say that this time I was very impressed. In addition to the ever-changing and unnatural color of her hair, she simply did not say that she was a neighborhood kid who spent her whole life in car racing. Her "need for speed" was not consistently portrayed in the film - maybe she was somewhere else - she looked older than her part and seemed always looking for something (togs party? Designer? A new place to spend money?) Set. I did not see any chemistry with Justin Long; this romance seemed at best obligatory. The only time Lindsay seemed involved was interaction with Matt Dillon, whom I thought was appropriate as Evil Bad Guy Trip Murphy. <br /> <br /> It was great to see Herbie again. movie intro with material from old movies. If Disney had jumped out with some car jewelry, 53, I could only wear some to be loyal. His new feature (?) Was a bit inconsistent (does he send his driver's thoughts? Is he skateboarding now?), But whatever. We all knew how it would end, but I regret that he did not end up with someone a little less stupid than Maggie. And my head still hurts from the lesson that Maggie and the audience have driven home. <br /> <br /> What would make a movie worth the trouble? Have an old Herbie in real history with real intrigue - at least Herbie is as good as Lassie - but apparently he's asking too much. Why is Disney always going back to the same as "Herbie Goes Bananas" and "The computer that wore tennis shoes" when it comes to innovation? <br /> <br /> I'm sure it was a great movie for children and people without expectations. For the rest of us ... this is when you have the flu and you just can not stand the tension of the Rear window.
