This is the sounds of Stan and Ollie whirling in the graves. <br /> <br /> I will not bother with the basic disadvantages of this movie because they are so obvious that they do not speak. Small things like "The All New Adventures of Laurel and Hardy", even though the stars have been dead for over thirty years when they were made. Such small things. <br /> <br /> A bad idea would be for the actors to have fun in the buffets that were called Laurel and Hardy. As bad as it could, it could work. To have a really bad idea, try to cast two actors to impersonate the duo. Ok, they can claim to be nephews, but the end result is the same. <br /> <br /> Bronson Pinchot can be fun. Okay, forget about his crazy foreigner "Cousin Larry" in Perfect Strangers and look at him in True Romance. Here, however, it stinks. It's probably not his fault, and like the director and support staff - everyone is better than material - he was probably desperate for money. There are those who claim that Americans have difficulty mastering an effective English accent. This reason is not supported by Pinchot. What is Stan? Welsh? Iranian? Pakistani? Only in the cries of the trademark Stan is approaching, but since the cry is exaggerated to the point of boredom, there is nothing to write about. Gailard Sartain does a little better as Ollie, although it's like saying what's worse - getting into a dog's dirt or digging in knackers? <br /> <br /> Remember the originals with their time divided, intuitive teamwork and innate sympathy? Well, he is not at all, replaced by two stupid old men and jokes so misleading that you can park the bus through the gaps. While the originals had threads that can be summed up in several panels, this one has a little long-witted hokum mum (and what a bad title!), Which is mixed up with the boy brotherhood scenario. I can not say I've seen every one of 108 films by Laurel and Hardy, but I think it's a safe bet that even their nadir was the league in front of him. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the main problem is that the originals were a kind of fun, or at least using your own touches. At least I felt natural and unforced, unlike the invented caricatures of Pinchot and Sartain. And when did Stan make malapropisms and that's all? "I was to give you standing cremation"; "I'd like to marinate my friend." Stop! <br /> <br /> Only significant moment is a reference to Bozo the Clown, a cartoon character who shared the comic Larry Harmon. Harmon, of course, bought the name of the copyright (how disturbing is watching Â® after Laurel and Hardy) and was the co-director and producer of this parody. <br /> <br /> Loads of questions. Will Stan and Ollie fart if they live today? Would they cover mummies with broken bottles? Has Stan been stuck in the genitals with a spear and ended with the grand finale of CGI? Let's hope not. <br /> <br /> I was laughing once, but I think it was incredulous how terrible it all was. Why was this film made in the first place? Who would want the creators to want it? Probably the worst movie I've ever seen, an absolute disgust I fell ill after only the first five minutes. More or less as much fun as trapping your head in a vice, while red-hot poker and nettles are attached to your back passage.
