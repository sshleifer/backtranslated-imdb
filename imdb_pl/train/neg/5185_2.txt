Complete waste of time <br /> <br /> Halla Bol is a complete waste of time. The script and dialogues are poorly written, the direction is poor, and the acting boundaries for hammas. This film was clearly aimed at the crowd of Rang De Basanti, but far from the sign, because there is not even one of the elements that created RDB combined with a great audience script, great acting, good direction and a powerful social message that has never been spoken, but They are shown. <br /> <br /> Compared to this almost masterpiece, Halla Bol takes a step back, resorting to such scenes as a hero taking a leak on the Persian carpet of villain and mentor hero staring at the bullets in the truck! All this could have been acceptable in the 1980s, when the quality of movies fell, and bad movies such as DivyaShakti and Phool Aur Kaante became big hits, but making movies became more subtle and thought out late. <br /> br /> Rajkumar Santoshi is a talented director and I appreciate the fact that he wants to give a social message in every movie he does, but maybe he just does not know how to do it! He resorts to a sermon without attention to the audience's intelligence in understanding what he is trying to say. Maybe he should just concentrate on entertainment and leave social messages to Rakeysh Mehras and Aamir Khans. <br /> <br /> Even if you disagree with everything I say, you will agree that during the show you will be thinking that Rang De Basanti was much better and that Mr. Santoshi should have pushed the industry away from Om Shanti Om. Fighting with the industry? It is true that Santoshi presented the industry as a place of biting, biting and casting couch, which the character happily gives with an asterisk with curiosity named Sania. There are people who think that these parts show the real face of the industry. Do not believe everything you see! <br /> <br /> In conclusion, raise your voice against such movies and do not spend hard earned money on this bomb. <br /> <br /> * except ****.
