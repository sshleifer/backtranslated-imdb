Having the pleasure of Mike Myers' previous work (Waynes World and Saturday Night Live), my expectations for spoofing from the 1960s were quite high. After the first minute it became clear that it was an exercise to be as childish and tasteless as possible. After ten minutes I turn off. I watched it a second time for the second time to see if I was unfair the first time. I turned it off after ten minutes. It's hard for me to believe that even a twelve-year-old boy can find it funny. Dialog is pathetic, Myers is painful when he watches (like Heather Graham), and more characters, including Fat Bastard, get worse. In addition to the mildly funny title and psychedelic set design, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Personally, I recommend avoiding it like plagues, although I liked a few of my friends (maybe then they had their eyes tied).
