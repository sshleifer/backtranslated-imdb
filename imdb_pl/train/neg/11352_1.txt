here's what you'll get if you let a 10-year-old (maniacal American) write a story about a trip to the moon. Absolute garbage without unnecessary features. Maybe it fascinated in 3D. but as a narrative and entertainment animation, it had nothing to do with wasting an hour and a half. Save time and money and watch BOLT instead. <br /> <br /> Shit. Not enough lines, but it seems to me that sums up ... well, I agree with the above review - it's like a propaganda story from the Cold War period. Maybe it would be interesting if they did it about flies revealing a landing trick on the moon or if the flies died in the first minute. BTW - why all the main flies have been deformed? - no one had a full limb compliment!
