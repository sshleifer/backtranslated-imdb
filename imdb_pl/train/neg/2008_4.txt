Not to mention whether Ann Rivers Siddons adapted the material for "The House Next Door" from his 1970s novel of the same title, or did it someone else. A lifestyle film was directed by Canadian director Jeff Woolnough. After reading the book a long time ago, we decided to take a chance when the movie appeared in the cable version of what was clearly a film made for television. You know that when critical moments precede the ads, which of course can not be found in the version we watched. <br /> <br /> The film's star is Lara Flynn Boyle, who has a new look that threw the viewer a curve because of the cosmetic transformation the actress went through. From new eyebrows to other parts of the body, Mrs Boyle is little recognizable as Col Kennedy, a character in the center of mystery. This was not one of the better moments of the actress in front of the camera. This applies to the rest of mainly Canadian actors who deserved better. <br /> <br /> The movie has a sense of crossing "Desperate Houswives" with "The Stepford Wives" and other better-known features, combined with a gentle dose of creeping. The best thing about this movie was the house that serves as a setting.
