I will never be a member of any club that would like me <br /> <br /> especially this. <br /> <br /> Starr Andreeff is a lonely mother / stripper who gets attacked by a <br /> <br /> female vampire and left to die. He begins to have a longing for blood, <br /> <br /> and meets John Savage, it looks like <br /> <br /> wonders where he left the phone number of Michael Cimino. Savage <br /> <br /> is also a vampire and wants Andreef to join his little vampire family <br /> <br />, which consists of a British vampire, a blond vampire who <br /> <br / > attacked Starr and green-haired dwarf (I do not do it <br /> <br /> up). <br /> <br /> The family does not want Starra, so they try to kill Savage and Starr <br /> <br /> and Starr's baby. <br /> <br /> Someone forgot to tell John Savage that it was a drama. <br /> <br /> spends most of his time on the screen, exposing more tics of his face than <br /> <br /> Hugh Grant on the Jolt Cola bender, and reads all his poems as <br /> <br /> creates a movie the Farrelly brothers. Andreeff tries to do <br /> <br /> most of the badly written role, but the screenwriter / director Ruben goes <br /> <br /> for all the clich√©s of vampires like Starr eating his son's hamster <br /> <br /> and buying a lot of raw meat to fight the thirst for blood. Dzieciak <br /> <br /> is also very fallen, for those who think that watching <br /> <br /> violence against children is really funny. <br /> <br /> The movie is extremely bloody, but not in wild style, like "Killer <br /> <br /> Language". Here the blood is disgusting and never justified, it just occurs. <br /> <br /> It is only in the budget. Most of the R scores go to Andreeff's colleagues <br /> <br />, who in the background of conversation scenes undergo embarrassing routine procedures in <br /> <br />. The budget does not include <br /> <br /> vampire fangs! All vampires here have to stab their victim to eat. <br /> <br /> A great idea, unless you've already seen George Romero <br /> <br /> "Martin". <br /> <br /> Even after 77 minutes, and when you put Ruben's attempts towards <br /> <br /> artistic direction (slanted frames, blurred scenes), it's <br /> <br /> tiring, boring and dirty ride. Leave this club and take a shower, <br /> <br /> you will need it. <br /> <br /> This is rated (R) for strong physical violence, violence on weapons, sexual <br /> <br /> violence, strong blood, strong vulgarisms, nudity of women, sexual <br /> <br /> references, drug abuse and adult situations. <br /> <br />
