When I did not know American TV stations, when I turned it into the cable of my parents-in-law, I first thought it was just a low-budget science-fiction movie, and after a few minutes I started thinking that it might be a wise satire on the worst excesses of a Christian fundamentalist and then me has arrived - good sadness, these people are serious! It's been some time since I've seen something so involuntarily funny. I hesitated before writing this review for fear of insulting believers, but then I saw other reviews and thought, hey, they can do it. Difficult philosophical puzzle: how to make a film that criticizes films without showing what you criticize? Answer: do it in such a way that the only people who will appreciate it are people who hate the films you criticize. I suppose some liberals (spit when you say that!) They may be offended by the contempt of filmmakers for the audience who is not obsessed with the J **** C ***** myth, but I do not mind - it was so funny!
