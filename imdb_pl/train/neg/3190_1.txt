Jimmy Dean could not be more squat or absurd. Hysterical if you look at the eyes of the Mystery Science Theater 3000, which I rate as 10. I mean that the view of this obese, corn-fed pork anxiety around Malta should be enough to send you to the vomitory if you do that far in the movie. This ugly, hysterical farce should be placed among others in "Booty Call", "Pumpkinhead", "Swarm" and "The Smurfs Go To Bangladeh". Such a film-gulp proves that sometimes actors, writers, producers etc. They lose their mortgage or are deceived. The question is "who was so stupid to finance such a whale?" But then, if good judgment had been won and there was never "Ultimate Justice", we would not have the delightful trick in "Mystery Science Theater 3000"!
