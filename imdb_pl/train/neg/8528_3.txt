The poster says: "He was six years old at birth ... At 34, he travels all his life". Ami is an Israeli born in America who was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy at the age of one. At the age of 34, after the love of his 22-year-old guardian did not go well, he decided to come to the US to face a doctor who said he would only be six years old. He wanted to show the doctor that he was still alive and weighed 39 pounds. Why? Your guess is as good as mine, even I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, life is bold when everything that can move is the left index finger, but why is it so angry with a doctor who diagnosed his illness 34 years ago? His doctor just told my mother that, based on the history of the disease, people with his illness will not live long. Why show him in the door of an old doctor? Why is tracking this old doctor in the US a journey of his life? There are so many things in Ami's life that we might be interested in: how can you create these animations by moving only with one finger? How can he go through everyday life, completely dependent on others? How did he survive the prophecy of his doctor? How does he deal emotionally when other people look at him like a strange creature? The movie did not tell us anything about it. Instead, the filmmaker got a van and went on a journey to let Ami show up at the door of his old doctor to show him he was still alive. I thought it was a joke.
