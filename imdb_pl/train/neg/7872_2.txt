Anyone who wants to become an editor should watch this movie! It shows you every mistake you should not make while editing a movie! My grandmother could do it better! But that's not the only reason why this movie is really bad! (It's really so bad that I can not write a sentence without an exclamation point!) If the first episode of "Les Visiteurs" was a pretty good family comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues, this continuation wrongly copies the first prescription. Funny parts can be counted on one hand or half. Clavier loses his role even more than in the first part, Robin tries to act like Lemercier (because he replaces it), but it's grotesque. Lemercier is Lemercier, Robin is Robin! Even if Muriel Robin can be fun alone on stage, she's not in this movie because she's not acting the way she used to. I know it would be difficult to replace someone who was good at the role (Lemercier received the César award for the role in the first film), but made a big mistake: instead of playing her role, Lemercier played her role! When it comes to history, it's just too much! Of course, at the end of the first movie we knew there would be a sequel, but Poiré and Clavier should try to write a simpler story, like the first episode. Gags are repetitive, childish and déjà-vu. No, really, there are no more than 3 fun parts in it. The only good things are costumes and some special effects. So you have only 2 reasons to watch it: 1) if you want to learn to edit the movie terribly, 2) if you want to waste time or really need "brainless moments"! 2/10
