This film is a parody and it is not suitable for keeping company with the parent's original. The plot is an absolute mess and the film is too long. Each time they struggle, they desperately introduce a sentimental reminder from the first film. <br /> <br /> "Gregory's Girl" is one of the top 10 British films of all time, this one is awful.
