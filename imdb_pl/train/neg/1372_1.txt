I saw it on television. I am glad that I did not go to the cinema to see it or to spend money for rent. The film is completely predictable - from a corrupt owner and planner to winding electrical cables. The plot is really weak and unbelievable - an avalanche guy gets hit by a 20-foot avalanche of breaking bones (using real material) and all he needs to do is stand up and shake. The avalanche thunders at a million miles an hour and stops at the side of the road. <br /> <br /> Some of the real avalanche materials are impressive and show their destructive power. But the deal between a real avalanche and the scene makes the film look even better. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, do not worry about it, not even on T.V.
