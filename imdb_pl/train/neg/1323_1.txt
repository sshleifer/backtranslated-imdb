it was a simpler time (seventies), a simpler place (San Francisco), where a man could make a simple film about a psychotic, crazy drug, re-crucify Christ as a woman with acid with endless sequences of dreams and interludes flashbacks during multiracial orgies between the sexes, regardless of financial or moral repercussions. <br /> <br /> this film, boring, slow, boring, is the worst example of this kind of pretentious hard-filled art school handed over as art in the mid-1970s. and I love it! When this train wreck from endless slow close ups and heavy reconstructive guitar licks begins with acid, you can not take your eyes off him, until the absurd and absurd end. a kind of cross between a star of Jesus Christ, outside the dolls' valley, and a really bad sour journey with parents on a waterbed. it is also a train wreck, completely fascinating, and a great picture of the worst (or best) elements of the b-grade class from the seventies. <br /> <br /> the plot. <br /> <br /> I will tell you only the plot, because you will hardly be able to tell what is happening because of a continuous cross editing flashbacks of events that may or may not be heroes who may be themselves or not, and face painted hippie. Nicks endlessly circle in banal sequences on the level of performance mime as street theater. <br /> <br /> "Logan" is a really annoying iconoclast of a filmmaker who yells at people who are assigned and surrounded by a dumb movie crew who is always dropping acid and I have what seems like really bad orgies. Richard Dreyfus has an auxiliary role as something that looks like an accountant. the film crew hates him for some reason and may explode with maniacal laughter to torment him. "Suzanne", the title character, is a slender blond who goes into space with no thought and comforts the crazy figure of the "artist". By the way, the "artist" is completely crazy. either from his strained hammer or from the incredible horror of his paintings. of course Susanne's horrible acts. there are several other characters that appear randomly, a cigar chomping "the man" character. who is also hot for Suzanne. he has a monologue. I could not really understand what had to do with this story, except that everyone had to hate the "man" at the time and it was impossible to make a movie without it. there is also a mute girl. Mute girl finally pays off to believe me, she is incredibly stupid.
