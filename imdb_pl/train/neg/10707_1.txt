Where to start? It's probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Editing is the worst in history, sound effects were terrible, and sound editing went crazy. Most of the film can be found here only in the unfortunate digging effects, with confused conversations in the background. I had to change the volume to full power, just what was going on ... and what exactly did I have to hear? Probably one of the worst scenarios ever made. I can not believe that people actually recorded a bit of this movie. It makes me think I could take shit in a box, send it to the producers, and then ask me to fund the movie. <br /> <br /> Dolph, he was ordinary, Dolph. Nothing more needs to be said. The villains were angry, the characters were angry, and the movie was smelly. If you really want to know what NOT to do, write, direct or edit a movie, watch it!
