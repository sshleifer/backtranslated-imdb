On a distant planet, a psychopath is saved from being executed by a cosmic monk. He frees several inmates and flies from prison on a spaceship. They fall into a ridiculously gigantic space ship that orbits a supernova star. This massive ship is inhabited only by three people, probably because the film's budget did not include the employment of many actors. In any case, to cut short story, three gadgets end up playing cat and mouse with evil. <br /> <br /> A psychopath in this movie is curious to be annoying. "Annoying" is generally not a term that could be described as a madman - out of balance, terrifying, dangerous, but not "annoying", but it is. Three people planting a huge ship are seriously unconvincing, guaranteeing such important roles - this ship is practically the size of the city! Considering that the film is set to approximately 50 years in the future, it is somewhat optimistic that such a huge ship created by man can exist, no matter that it is used for such a relatively mundane task. Despite the huge size of the spacecraft, the crew has frightfully finished, small rooms, and the dining room consists of a plastic table and chairs. But there are many corridors. <br /> <br /> The film is quite well prepared and works like an average science fiction thriller. But no big deal.
