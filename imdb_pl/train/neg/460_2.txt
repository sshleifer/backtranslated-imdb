I was obliged to watch the film for my work, so I did not pay for it (on the contrary, I got paid), but I still thought that the film sucks much more than average. The jokes were poor, the two main actresses ... well, to use the "Club of first wives" division for the age of women in Hollywood, they are no longer in the "hot rod" age, but more in the age of the "district prosecutor". What made me the most angry in this movie is the main storyline that quite completely plagiarized "Beavis & Butthead Do America" ​​(in which the boys are overjoyed that some guy offers them money to "make a wife" without realizing I expect to kill her). Generally, a bland piece of shit.
