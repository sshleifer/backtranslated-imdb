I'll be honest - the reason I rented this movie is because I'm a big fan of Kyle Chandler (especially from Early Edition). Because usually a good guy plays, I wanted to see him in a different role (out of curiosity). The plot itself also drew me in; the greedy hitman (Tony Greco.k.a. Mr. Chandler) must kill an accidental person before he is entrusted with the life or rather death of a witness who will testify against someone from the "family". The movies were not what I expected. It was sick, I hated the end (if you saw it, you would know why), and there were so many unnecessary parts. Basically - it was dirty and it made little sense. Yes, it was a mafia movie and yes, BOOMs go. But film is something more. This film behaved as if he did not have time to go into details - just deal with it and understand it. Acting really rewarded - James Belushi was quite funny as "The Rose". Sheryl Lee made Angel seem as trustworthy as she could. She surprised me the most. And Kyle Chandler was as convincing as an anxious visitor to the "family." If the script was fair to the actors.
