This movie had potential, but what makes it really bad is the acting of Lindsay Crouse. I have never seen her before in any of the others and maybe there are some Crouse fans who like her in something else, but her performance in this movie is bad. <br /> <br /> Its delivery is robotic. When she delivered her lines, it seemed she was trying to make sure she had the right lines and just read the list in her head. So her voice has a very small inflection. I can not believe that someone so bad in acting was given the lead role in the movie. She must know someone in business. <br /> <br /> Now I hate being so mean to her, but the comment must be "this" long, and her performance is something that protrudes more than anything else. br /> <br /> However, I liked where the story goes, so I watched it. The first part of the script has the makings of a good movie. But the end was also disappointing. Maybe if her acting was better, I would like it.
