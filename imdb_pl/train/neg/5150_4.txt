I got a DVD from the library in the expectation that I will understand well how the background is in a large opera production. I must say that I was very disappointed. The topic had so much potential. Scenes in Wagner's production must necessarily be complicated and impressive, and the history of their creation and use could have been a great educational experience. Instead, we get a mix of clips of people moving around the great scenery, vaguely assisting with the commentary that did not catch my attention. I thought that I was listening mainly to the musical foundations of the opera. I was impressed by the amount of effort required to produce such a production - which hit quite well and the next time I'm at the opera, I'm sure I will remember this part if this movie - but left me cheated by the lack of detailed comments and explanations.
