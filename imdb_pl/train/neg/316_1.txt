This film is by far the worst film ever made. If you have to create a movie in which a guy plays Lars in heavy weight, do not do this goddamn movie. I must say that I could watch Leprechaun in Space 6 times before I could watch the trailer of this POS movie. Adam Sandler should be limited from any movie after this disgrace. Watching this movie is like combining listening to Cher and eagerly putting the penis in the blender. Everyone with half of the brain cell will understand that this movie is not worth a penny. If I had an extra dollar and had to spend it, I would give it to the Lorraine Bobbitt foundation before buying this movie.
