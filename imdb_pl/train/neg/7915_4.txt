All X-Men movies were great. And I mean all of them, including the long-hated X-Men 3. They had solid characters (Magneto and Xavier were the best, in my opinion), and a good arc of history. <br /> <br /> I was all excited when I heard that this movie was in production, and my expectations were getting bigger until I saw the movie. I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Hugh Jackman is not a bad actor (his best movie is The Fountain, though you will not hear about the movie when they talk about the actor), and his acting is not what turns the movie on. <br /> <br /> The whole film is harassed by many pointless characters that do not add anything to the story (like Blob or Gambit) that were cast there so that fans would believe that the filmmakers had to read the original comics. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of XMen, I read many, many of their stories, and this movie did not respect any of them. No. Even continuity. He does not respect the Weapon X project, neither the Wolverine and Sabretooth accounts, nor Emma Frost, the wolverine motivations are stupid and visible in millions of films: Revenge for the death of a loved one. <br /> <br /> Oh. What I was expecting in the whole movie is Berseker's moment for Wolverine similar to the one in X2 at school, when Stryker's men enter, and he decimates the enemy forces, but hey, this is Fox, it's a family movie and not you will see a clear violence from the most brutal and macabre hero Marvel. <br /> <br /> Besides, I had the impression of constant dejá vù with this film, because Wolverine's beginnings are already explained in X2, we already know how he got the skeleton of adamantium, so there is no point in making a film about something that we already know. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think that Wolverine is one of those few people who do not need a solid story because the mystery is the nature of the character. Do we really want to know how Joker has scars?
