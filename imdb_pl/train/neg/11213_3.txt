OK ... I watch a lot of bad movies. I am proud of this fact. many times there are gems in bombs with a rating of B. But this movie is one of the worst I've ever seen. I like a good horror movie ... but one with a story and a sense of movement. The opening scenes seemed quite good. Decent music and photos. Then from there he descends from the hill. One of the main characters has a disability (ringing in the ears called tinnitus). Now, in turn, it threatens to reveal his secret. It focused too much on the film. So what's ringing in my ears and accidentally left the earplug in a place where it should not be. You do not have to talk about it all the time. So this guy has an affair with this girl, and in the motel he falls down and hits his head on the table. So instead of telling everyone about his affair, he decides to quit the body. Now her twin sister is trying to find out where she is and what happened to her. Well, after she saw her again and again (like a zombie like a ghost), and even pointed directly to the body, she finally finds her. Now the body is recovered and is about to deal with the only suspect who killed her. The bad thing is that she did not have much plan. Only pretend to be her twin and met the guy on whom the body was abandoned. This idiot did not even believe he killed her. So everything was revealed there, and even though she had a weapon ... somehow she manages to suffocate. The last scenes of the film are her "ghosts" and her twins coming out of the water. So you want to tell me in this movie that the bad guy wins. And not one, but two innocent people are dying. <br /> <br /> Good things about the film: photos <br /> <br /> Bad things related to the film: the sound of music has a long and drawn error of managing the plot of low quality to occur in some not all actors
