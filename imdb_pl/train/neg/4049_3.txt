I did not like the vehicle of Bill Murray, which was originally released in the 1980s, so I tried to watch it again to see if my aversion to this movie boils down to my film preferences in the 1980s, or to the fact that this "stripes" is simply a bad movie. Well, the verdict is in the text and "Stripes" is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> "Stripes" could have been an innovative comedy in the early 1980s and could appeal to people who have gone through basic training or who are fans of Bill Murray, but it's still a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Why is it wrong? Mainly because "Stripes" is to be a comedy, but it is not so funny. There is some laughter, but they are few. Most of the film absorbs a dramatic plot, which is extremely complex and not very interesting. This lack of comedy is particularly noticeable if you're used to more modern comedies, such as "Anchorman," which strive for laughter in every part of the movie. <br /> <br /> "Stripes" suffers additionally Bill Murray and Harold Lack of Ramis' acting abilities. Bill Murray is a great comedian, but at this point in his career he was not a very attractive drama actor, and Harold Ramis plays Harold Ramis. These two people are not good enough as actors to carry the dramatic arc of the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, most of the comedy in Stripes revolves around the selfish, intelligent alec of Bill Murray, a male-child figure, so if you do not think that this character is funny (as I do not), you will not find the majority comedies that are fun in "Stripes". <br /> <br /> "Stripes" is a film from an age that has not aged well and is not worth watching. If you want to watch the comedy "Buddy" from the 80s, I recommend "Stir Crazy". Like "Stripes" humor in "Stir Crazy" is not as fast as in modern comedies, but unlike "Stripes" it is aging much better and as a result it is still visible.
