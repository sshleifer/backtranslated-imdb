Good job Al Gore! You've become the first person to earn $ 1 billion in global warming! Like all other fairy tales created by a man in the world, this one is there with the best lies that have sucked so many people out. Certain pollution is not a good thing and I would like all trees to grow, but global warming is business! It employs thousands of people who are very misleading. <br /> <br /> Google it! There are many things that just do not add up, but well done, Al, you failed as a politician, but you did a lot of money by sucking the world. <br /> <br /> What's next? Is the saint real?
