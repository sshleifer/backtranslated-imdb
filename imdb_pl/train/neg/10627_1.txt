I notice that most people who think that this movie is telling the truth, or were not born before landing on the moon (1969-1972), or was not old enough to appreciate it. I think it is much easier to challenge a historic event if you do not survive it. <br /> <br /> I was a young man in the time of Apollo, but I was old enough to understand what was going on. The whole world followed the landing of the moon. Our families gathered around the TV to watch the premiere. Headlines in the newspapers shouted about the latest events every day, from takeoff to landing, from walks on the moon, to the launch from the moon, to spatter, in many languages. At school, some classes were canceled so that we could watch the main events on television. During Apollo 13, the world prayed and held his breath when men limped into an uncertain fate. You can not go anywhere without asking about what was last. The world was really one community. <br /> <br /> Now, after a buffer lasting 30 years, it's easy to claim a scam because global enthusiasm and interest have died down. We are left with a book with history and anyone can argue that history is wrong and tries to "prove" it by means of lies and invented facts, completely ignoring the predominance of evidence indicating otherwise - not to mention that he lives in the souls and memories of those who survived wonderfully intoxicating and fantastic days.
