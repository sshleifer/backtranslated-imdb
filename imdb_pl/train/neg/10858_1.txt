I did not know if I would laugh or cry when I saw it. Only addicted Danni dirt fans might want to. It's supposed to be a horror movie, but it's just dirt. The most cool scene is a car accident with real special effects from the best hollywood. Avoid this movie at all costs. See this only for research on how bad the film can be ................
