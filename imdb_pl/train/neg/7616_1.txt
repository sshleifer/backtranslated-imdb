The good news is that a movie was made based on the alleged Aztec myth and containing a very Aztec-American (there is a word that exists) cast. The bad news is that she was dead at birth. <br /> <br /> If Ed Wood were to retire and train George Romaro through his classic "Night of the Living Dead," we could just come up with. "The Legend of Diablo" is definitely a breeding ground for any future resurrection "Mystery Science Theater 3000! "<br /> <br /> I do not think you can even call it a movie" B ". Production values ​​are so boring that I felt that I was watching a long skit from the series or an 8-millimeter film filmed by a group of school-age children. <br /> <br /> SOME SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The basic storyline sounded so interesting that it made me borrow it. A sheriff from California finds a box containing an Aztec demon and accidentally frees him from an unsuspecting community. His daughters, one hot and one homely, a team with gringo FBI man and a priest, to try and curse the demon. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, every zombie scene you've ever seen in previous undead movies is played-poorly. These zombies walk more like an army of nut professors than undead! The supposed infrared scenes from the demon's point of view are not anything special? and he / she / it definitely seems to be holding up very strongly (as opposed to turning forward). And the scene in which the priest quickly pulls the demon out of the cave is ridiculous! It really seems to be done for a comic effect - although I know it was not! I was still waiting for Benny Hill's music to start playing and for a whole gang of zombies he would chase the priest across the beach! <br /> <br /> Of course, the voice of Darth Vader / Field of Dreams, an agent calling the FBI, becomes almost comical. On the other hand, like most of this cheese ball! Robert Napton, director and script writer, should win something for this effort! (What do you say about the black sphere of life, like "Hollywood 10"? This, as I see, is rated at 1.5 on a scale of 10. I'm afraid it might be a bit hojne! <br /> <br /> Is Well, Lindsey Lofaso looks pretty hot as the younger daughter of the deceased sheriff, probably because her home big sister (Calvi Pabon) really escaped from the house! Fred Estrado is quite decent as an FBI agent. I wonder if Mario Soto who played Rodriguez's father, is the same Mario Soto who crashed for the Cincinnati Reds? If so, he should stick to the baseball.In fact, they could not do anything worse if they went through the baseball theme and called him "Demons in the outside field!" <br /> <br /> If I find out that it was a project for a social university class, I'm sorry, it can be good enough for B or even B +, provided the gang gets a college camera back to the campus in one "The Blair Witch Project" proved that a cool, camp movie can be shot on a modest. "The Legend of Diablo" did not seem to have modest OR shoes to work! It was low budget, low talent, low price. The last scene - and I mean the last 10 seconds of the movie - is ONLY a gentle, creative or interesting moment. <br /> <br /> I paid $ 3.45. I could better spend it on a hamburger!
