First of all, let me say that if I had to honestly evaluate this film from 1 to 10, I would give it -4. It's not that I'm a hard critic, but this movie is BAD. Everything from story to directing to editing is awful. The story at the beginning is not even decent (you can not expect too much, because it's based on a video game, something I did not know I'm going into the movie), but the direction and editing has made it worse. The film cuts at uncomfortable points and goes to scenes completely unrelated to the previous ones; some, like a fast sex scene in the middle, do not even make sense to put in the story as characters do not show any feelings towards each other. You can enter this movie, expecting to see a pile of nonsense on the screen for an hour and a half and you will still be disappointed. Honestly, if you pay for watching this movie, you're wasting your money, and if you do not pay anything, you still lose an hour and a half of your life. So do yourself a favor and do not watch it.
