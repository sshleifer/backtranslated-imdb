My main comment for this movie is how Zwick was able to get credible actors to work on this movie? Impressive cast? even for secondary characters, none of which really helps in this movie. But I must admit that the Tom Hanka pendant almost made it worth it? what was going on with Tom? Have you lost the bet? The best scene in the movie was Joe Isuzu - definitely classic! The premise is good. Basinger's character, struggling with existence as a Pink Lady, goes to a motel in Vegas, throwing a wonderful pyramid of cosmetic sale. This happens when Corbett's character is on his way to Vegas to deliver Elvis's suit to his ex-wife, motivated by. As they both go, they have many contacts with Elvis prompts, who are on their way to impersonate Elvis in Vegas. Soon the FBI gets involved and begins to follow what they think is Elvis's serial killer. Unfortunately, the premise does not mean that the film was good. <br /> <br /> When watching this movie, imagine that you came back to the first class? when plot and continuity are not really important. It's much nicer to just look at how Basinger looks beautiful in a Pink Lady outfit, instead of wondering why what he does does not make sense. The film tries hard, but ultimately falls much too short. Ultimately, he is full of ideas that could theoretically be fun, but in practice they were not so funny. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst, but you may find that you feel like leaving the building while watching one ???? Do not say I did not warn you!
