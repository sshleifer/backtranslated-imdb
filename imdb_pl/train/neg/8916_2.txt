I rented this DVD after watching it, looking for something else. When I saw the title on the jacket, I could not believe my eyes. I read the book Yaloma about a year ago and I loved it, in fact I admire the work of Yalom in general. (I'm a clinical psychologist.) I've watched 30 minutes of this movie and I had to turn it off. I'm not sure if I can take a lot more. On the apparent level, false accents, as others have commented, are at best distracting, and at worst are irritating and bland. Action is boring when it should be passionate and comical when it should be serious. The portrait of Lou Salome is simply nonchalant, and the brilliant Freud is more than a student. I see so little spirit of the book so far. I was hoping that I would be able to recommend this film to my students. Instead, I will refer them to the book. Imagine that.
