I am surprised by many voting women who even give the film better ratings. My idea of ​​this film was that the target audience is adult and male. The beaten and tortured woman, ruthless revenge and the high number of bodies are typical ingredients introduced into the history of the film by the spaghetti subgenre. The opening and blow of the hand are picked up by DJANGO. THE SHOOTER does not have the style of DJANGO, for example. Rating, acting and photos are mediocre at best, but if you're looking for the ingredients mentioned above, you're in the right place. And the actors do not have an Italian accent. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
