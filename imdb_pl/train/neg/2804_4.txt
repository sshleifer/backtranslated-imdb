I was probably wrong, seeing the 1973 version with Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack for the first time, so the adaptation of 1983 is such a disappointment. I just did not get any chemistry between the two main stars. A lot of acting and theatrical acting simply does not do it for me and what it was like to put Tim in the role of Rochester. Did the casting director really ever read the book. Very strange! He is a great actor, but Mr. Rochester is definitely not! And Zelah was just, well, strange, some mixed-up couple. Favoring the cast was pretty good, and Lowood's scenes were the best adaptation for me, but overall they did not capture any magic of the novel. I certainly would not ask anyone to see it as a real adaptation of the novel. A real profession!
