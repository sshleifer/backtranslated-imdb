Twilight zone has achieved a certain mythology - like Star Trek. This is because there are many devoted lovers of the show, no matter what they think that each episode was a winner. These are those who rate each individual at 10 and can not objectively assess the program. For this reason, some time ago I looked through all the original Star Trek episodes (good and bad), because the overall ratings and reviews were just too positive. It's time to do the same for The Twilight Zone. <br /> <br /> While I scored a lot of episodes 10, this one gets 3 simply because it was bad. Writing was actually embarrassingly bad. Two people from opposite sides in the great war are seen throughout the episode. After some time, it turns out that they are the only two people left on Earth - as you learn in a really stupid and totally unconvincing conclusion. Usually, the end result makes the episode great - it killed him!
