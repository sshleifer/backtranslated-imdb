Christopher Lambert is irritating and disappointing in his performance as GIDEON. This film could have been the classic in which Lambert starred, as well as Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump, or Dustin Hoffman as Raymond Babbitt in RAIN MAN, or Sean Penn as Sam Dawson in I AM SAM. <br /> <br /> It's a pity because the story is important to us in life, great performances of Charlton Heston, Carroll O'Connor, Shirley Jones, Mike Connors and Shelley Winters. 3 out of 10.
