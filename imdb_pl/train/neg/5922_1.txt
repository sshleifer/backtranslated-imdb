My mom keeps the tape with this movie as a general threat to any loving person who makes her nervous. Everything stinks about it. <br /> <br /> As such, it is a real classic. <br /> <br /> Who gave him 10/10? Have you accidentally watched a good movie and accidentally voted for the movie? <br /> <br /> Everyone involved in the creation process should be forced to watch at least a small part of the film. This should be an indelible stain on the minds of all those who hold a sacred film in their hands, and should be venerated as a sign of a surge of film disaster.
