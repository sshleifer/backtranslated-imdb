How sad is the lack of the possibility of publishing a sign lower than 1. I watched this nonsense and I could hardly believe what I was watching. Every single part of the movie was terrible. Music, acting, directing, history, everything, just everything. At different moments in the movie I really laughed loudly. I particularly liked the piece in which our protagonist paces through the hospital in slow motion in a blur and thwarts a nurse from the clipboard, because .... That is why. Product placement? Crucifix's (crucifi?) Everywhere. If you are a Christian and you are very happy, you can like this movie. If you like this movie, you really have to go out more.
