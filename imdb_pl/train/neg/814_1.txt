This movie was just bad. Almost every stereotype of the cop's film is present and accounted for. The bad guy is running away? check. Partner? check. Wacky clash of personality with a partner? check. Rookie with something to prove? check. Rookie shows a gray veteran. check. The only ones they did not touch were the idiots shooting themselves in the foot and returning, but they probably save those old chestnuts for Doole's next trip. Add a battle between the sexes of Girl Power with tired old gags and banal, exaggerated material like Doole's award-winning car, which is constantly destroying and you have a recipe for a really bad movie. Avoid this at all costs.
