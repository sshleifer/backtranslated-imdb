For me, this is a story that starts with amusing jokes about Frankish fanatics when traveling with stairs and when sitting at business meetings ... The problem is that when you watch this movie for an hour, you will see the same fantasies / funny situations once for the first time. It's predictable. It is rather a television story in which you can leave and come back without anything. <br /> <br /> I like Felix Herngren as Frank, but that's not enough, even if it's a comedy that must have more variations and some message for the audience .... <br /> <br />
