Haunting. Remake, of course. The original was a terrifying psychological thriller and improved over time. Compared to this remake from 1999, it's a classic. There is no development of the form here, only caricatures (slut, authoritative brain, "I will take us from here", oh so sensitive bookworm). But seeing how special effects are a "star", I think that characters with which one can empathize with emotions are a secondary problem. Unfortunately, the effects are funny. Mating cherubs, stretchy doors, irritating dead children who can not speak straight ... and an idiot-finished ending that most likely gives you an enema from butterflies and a rainbow. I take my Bowling orally, thank you. Bruce Dern, I liked you from The Cowboys. Stop.
