Carl Panzram lived an amazing life and wrote down his memories on scraps of paper, perhaps for the only person who ever did something unselfish to him. The book "Panzram: A Journal of Murder" by Thomas E. Gaddis and James O. Long, which appeared for the greater part of the century after the death of Panzram, gives the historical context to the American first generation. go west and become a cowboy, get caught, thrown into the boy's house, run away many times and constantly thrown into a tortured and sodomized prison. As Panzram became enormous and strong, he tried to take revenge on the evil done to him during his journey to South America, Europe and Africa, and it did not matter what people he raped, robbed or murdered because we are all equally worthless. <br /> <br /> This film casts the lean James Woods into the rough neck, ass, son of Carl Panzram, who is drunk in the film, overly dramatic and emotional, and who never mentions the joy of sodomizing men and boys. The film does not discuss anything special, especially about the traveler in the world and a career prisoner (eg Robbed of the former president Taft or release from prison in Oregon, if he gave the word to return). In short, I do not think Carl is too happy.
