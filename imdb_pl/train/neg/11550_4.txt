I knew that I would see a low-budget movie, but I was expecting much more after the film by Alex Cox. The operation of the two leading men was terrible, especially the white guy. The girl should win an Oscar compared to the two. This movie was full of what I think would be a joke for people in the film industry and some other jokes that I actually understood and made me laugh out loud, which is rare. Without these loud moments I would give this movie 2/10. What happened to Alex Cox, who created all the classics of the 80s. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: <br /> <br /> There were some questions that I had after the film ended. Why did a Mexican guy go to the other guy's house in the beginning? What did his daughter say she has 100 people laid off from her last job? Why did she break her own things when she was angry with him? I think I should have gone to Q & A after the film, but I did not want to get up at 10 am.
