One of the worst movies I've ever seen, cheesy camera work, poor use of filters, the movie was grainy, the script was horrible, that is, further, how predictable was the great battle at the end ..... <br /> <br /> some of the fight scenes were ok. I guess .... <br /> <br /> some of the scenes were so bad that it was comical ... how Sorbo would get a horse and ride at the end ... LOL I mean really ... a horse ? Oh, I can not forget how evil assassins are circulating in the same vehicle throughout the movie ... one would think that after killing a key witness and federal agents, they would be followed ... ETC, ETC really does not care about watching this. .
