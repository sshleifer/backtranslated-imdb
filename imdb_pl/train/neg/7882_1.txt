After stopping at the movie store to find something to watch, we stumbled across it. From the summary it looked attractive, so we tried. And here's the kicker: the first 20 minutes are interesting! It's really nice! Oh, wait, I spoke too early. <br /> <br /> Somewhere, the movie has taken a disgusting transformation into fundamental, right-wing Christian brainwashing. Not quite sure what's going on, but I think the screenwriter found God out there, finished writing this script and did not have time to edit it because he had a KKK meeting to get in with his friends from Westboro Church and his hoodie was not Purely. <br /> <br /> Can they put a warning on it? I refuse to support this religious idiocy. Just like video games have rating systems, videos require a symbol: maybe a small cross in the bottom corner to show us that the movie will turn into a worse one. <br /> <br /> Unless you share feelings with what a moron has come up with this story, and let your Bible open on your knees, when you watch and plan how you convert your neighbors, do not waste time. This is one of the worst trash that has been appearing for a long time, and radical religious nuts no longer need funding.
