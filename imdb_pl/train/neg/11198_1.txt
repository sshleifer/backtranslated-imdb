I should not even review the movie because it's not really a horror movie - so it does not deserve the attention of Dr. Cheese. At least this is not a horror story in the usual sense. It is certainly a terrifying proposition to waste time watching this shit. That's why I turned it off after the first four hours. Imagine my surprise when the clock showed that only 45 minutes have passed. Yes, right; Simply put, this movie is b-o-r-i-n-g. <br /> <br /> "The Order" had many disadvantages, not all of them were unique. In particular, it seems to me that the main problem with the "religious" subgenre of horrors is Hollywood's reluctance to engage Christianity on its own terms. It is possible to create really terrifying films that are also orthodox. Just ask William Peter Blatty. In fact, without orthodoxy, movies like this are just something that is something that is a genre movie (usually boring and illogical) of filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Think about it. If someone has made a movie allegedly about, say, physics, but not only did not have the basic laws of physics, but based the entire story on the wrong portraits, soon you would get tired of the resulting senseless intrigue. The same applies to these types of films. <br /> <br /> In other words, the "Order" (and many similar films in front of it) invent from the whole material about the Catholic Church and about the Christian faith and try to build a plot of these inventions. No wonder that the plot is inconsistent and stupid. This film has the added charm of being as interesting as growing nails. <br /> <br /> Avoid this steaming stack.
