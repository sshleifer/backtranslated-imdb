The first (and only) time in which I saw "Shades" was during Sneakpreview. It was not even at the premiere. I remember there was someone from the director's staff, I do not even remember who. It was a Belgian movie, we never heard about it, so we were fairly neutral, not knowing what to expect. Mickey Rourke is a brilliant actor and stands much further away from the rest. An actor, whose star has long since stopped growing. Helps to make a movie in Belgium entitled "Shades". <br /> <br /> Immediately after the beginning of the film, we noticed how many curses are there. Nothing against the occasional curse. However, it was annoying. Whenever Rourke uses the word F *** to express something, it comes naturally. However, when someone from the cast, a non-English speaker uses the word F **** or S ***, he becomes arrogant and aggressive. <br /> <br /> We quickly lost the count using the words F and S. Everyone was happy that they were not in the theater. And we had to vote, but it was difficult for us because it was only from 0 to 10 and we were looking for -10.
