I still can not believe this movie. They have so many unbelievable things that it's hard to believe that someone wanted to do it. <br /> <br /> The story is a joke, but in the sense of being funny, but more like no story. How to mix a slapstick comedy with a train assault, prison movie, conspiracies in the city, sexual jokes and an FBI agent? You can not. <br /> <br /> Besides the frightening direction, actors are the most noticeable thing. I watched the movie and thought, "Is this really Marlon Brando? No, it can not be. (5 minutes later) Is this Charlie Sheen? Wow, maybe Brando is real. (5 minutes later) This can not be Donald Sutherland. (5 minutes later) No, not Mira Sorvino. This movie is too bad for everyone. (At the end). No, no, no, it can not absolutely be Martin Sheen !!! Not for 10 seconds of such a movie. Then it ended and I was stressed. So many good, Oscar-winning, usually convincing actors in such a stupid, stupid, horrible movie. I rarely wanted to know so much about how this happened. They could not get that much money. <br /> <br /> Only an unbelievable stupid idiot movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10 1/4 5 (1+ - 6-)
