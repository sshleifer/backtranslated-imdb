Writers and producers of this small trip have fallen to new depths of depravity. Was the writer's block so badly set up that the OR dried up so much that they had to turn on a disgusting scene in which a young woman empties in the back seat of the van and then throws the feces out of the car (the mind at least sums up the value of the movie). We have already been treated on one of the other women urinating over one of the friends under the threat of weapons, as well as on numerous episodes of graphic vomiting; once enough ... we got a message! It really raises the sense of humor to a different level! If the script and acting were better, I could easily forget that I watched a movie shot entirely on a low-budget film. It was quite an original plot, with a clever (one) direction, in which we could only take a point of view from inside the van; thanks to which it feels much more real. We've never seen each other anywhere, like a store or field, where several women have disappeared, and that might have added much needed tension. <br /> <br /> The scenario was tragic. Lines like: "I do not feel well ... I want to go home" after one of the girls has been prosecuted by a psychopath; subjected to violence by a screwdriver and shot, it seems a little undercooked. <br /> <br /> Acting was diabolical (except for geek). Did all the five main actresses in this game learn by taking a correspondence course during a long post strike! The sound was so bad that I had to watch the whole movie with subtitles. <br /> <br /> It seemed that the director has an easy job in it. It seems that the only direction he had to give him was: "The Girl's Cry." <br /> <br /> AND SOON SOON ...... If you watch this, make sure you have paracetamol ready!
