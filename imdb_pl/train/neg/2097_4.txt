I was expecting a lot more from the Battlestar Galactica series. A very boring prequel to the main series. After the first 30 minutes I was waiting for the ending. The heroes talk a lot about religion, computers, programming, revenge, etc. There are gangsters, mafias who make hits. However, Caprica has no stock from the original series to offset the slower parts. <br /> <br /> Let me give you some useful advice when watching movies: As a rule, if there is a lot of excessive use of excitement, then you know that the movie will be a dud. Caprica has a lot of that. The director / writer usually tries to compensate for his weak abilities by throwing a few naked bodies. It never works and everything she does is degrading (very) young actress involved and I feel sorry for them. Directors / writers who do this should be kicked out of the company. <br /> <br /> If you want to be bored for an hour and a half, rent Caprica. There is (free) porn on the net if you really want to see a naked body. Otherwise, keep moving, nothing to see here.
