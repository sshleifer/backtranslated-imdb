I went to see this movie (I actually went to see Family Portraits, which includes Cutting Moments + 2 other short films by Douglas Buck) at the Mar del Plata festival (Argentina) ... I just could not watch it! After the first half of Cutting Moments, I had to cover my eyes and look at them from time to time. Before it ended, my stomach was turned upside down and I felt a slight dizziness. I just had to leave the cinema a few minutes after starting the second shortcut (BTW, of course I was not the only one who left the room). WAAAAY was too violent and disgusting to me! I am impressed by many brave people who really loved him. I just do not understand how you can love these kinds of movies! Shocking and bloody and horrible images that I saw, really stuck in my head for two days !! I'm also trying to analyze the story (my boyfriend saw everything and told me about it), and I just do not think it makes any sense. I mean, this amount of violence and other things has no sense other than to try to shock people. I think that is not enough. There's absolutely nothing in this movie that I can say, "Well, at least" x "is good." Well, I do not think I'll ever understand this kind of movie.
