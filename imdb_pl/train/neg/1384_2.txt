Jet Li is one of the best fighters in the world. He has been for over 20 years and shames others. Although it is large in Asia, it is almost unknown in the US. <br /> <br /> The Black Mask is supposed to be a breakthrough movie for him, but it's terribly wrong. First of all, it's dubbed. Although it may have a camp value (copying is not even close and flat), it seems unsuitable for a regular movie viewer. Secondly, the director of this movie, Daniel Lee, is doing a terrible job. It cuts scenes so fast, sometimes you do not know what's going on. Another time the camera shakes and shakes. Fans are watching Jet Li films for fantastic martial arts. However, the director edits the scenes so fast that you do not even know who is who in the middle of the time! Another time the scene is suspended (i.e. Li begins to cut a hole in the jeep's floor, while the badguins arm a weapon, two seconds later, both Li and interest in love are already under the car!) Other scenes are so unlikely that they exceed the point of being completely absurd (deadly CD-ROMs) Li needs a director who is less susceptible to cutting machine guns, and more to create a cinematic scene.Added rap / techno music goes from being alright to the intrusive .The plot has the capability, but all are wasted by cartoons characters who take away all the credibility that this film aspires to, and do we really believe that interest in love would not recognize Simon because he has a half-mask? Will the hair, lower jaw or voice return it? <br /> <br /> you want to see the Jet Li movie, try Iron Monkey or its classic Shaolin temple. This chaotic mess is a complete waste of time ... 2/10
