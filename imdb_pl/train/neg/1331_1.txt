Collusion is even worse than the typical movie of the week "bad white male corporate capitalist." This film is less pleasant than toothache. Jay Leno can work. He is good in his underrated debut film, The Silverbears, in which he gives the spectacle with the requirements of his character. This film is so bad that the character of Leno, the saint impersonator, is less irritating than the figure of Morita, the saintly fool.
