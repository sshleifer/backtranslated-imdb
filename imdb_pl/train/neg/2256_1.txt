I admit that I saw maybe five minutes of "Jerry Springer". I do not consider myself a snobbish, but I really think that I am above watching what is in his program. You should also try to rise above it. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie as part of an event in the social sciences that I led. I was told that this film really has little to do with Springer itself, rather it focuses on the lives of those who appear on "Springer." This film, better treated, could be a fascinating look at how pathetic the lives of these people are. I admit, I felt a twinge of empathy for Connie (Molly Hagan). That's all she has in life. How sad it is that he feels he must go to Jerry's show to solve this problem. <br /> <br /> I really feel sorry for Molly Hagan appearing in this place. Did you notice that after this film she was mainly degraded to the role of "B" on television? I will say this about Hagan. She is an extremely beautiful and intelligent woman. I have no doubt that she is very serious in her acting and tries to play her roles with a lot of empathy. The problem is that Hagan can not take the scene by himself. She just does not have what it takes to play the main role. Her best work will always be Angel in "Herman's Head" (a show that was not great, but his heart was in the right place), and when she appeared in "Seinfeld" as Robert's sister.
