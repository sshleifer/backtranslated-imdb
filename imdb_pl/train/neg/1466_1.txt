<br /> <br /> As usual, I really could not wait for a new movie / movie on my favorite subject - it makes a nice change from the * weirdly known * document about the Kursku or Stalingrad on the History Channel. <br /> <br /> I was eagerly awaiting Pearl Harbor and Enemy at the Gates - but I was brutally brought back to Earth by realizing the evil, silly-humorous power of Hollywood - and her ability to spend an absolute tripe fortune. <br /> <br /> So once again I was excited about "The Rise of Evil", especially since I heard that Ian Kershaw was involved, because I liked his books. I can see why he gave up. <br /> <br /> Quote the guy responsible for the rubbish: <br /> <br /> "Kershaw's book was an academic work," he said. "<br /> <br /> it was quite dry. We needed more incidents. "<br /> <br /> Incidents? Are they completely crazy? It can not be said that Hitler's life is without an "incident" - yes, the two biographies of Hitler Kershaw were long and detailed, but they were meant to be. <br /> <br /> The thesis of "Rise of Evil" seems to be: <br /> <br /> Hitler was a very bad man - no, he was a VERY bad man who HATHED the Jews, and in case you missed it , we emphasize the fact on EVERY stage in the film. <br /> <br /> There was no effort to try to explain the mood of those times and why Hitler could accept the views and strategy he had made. Needless to say - in contrast to the generally excellent "Nazis - a warning from history" - this film did not pay attention to the fact that almost all leaders of the Munich Communist uprising were Jews and that this could have colored his views on the subject - and his axiomatic linking of Jews with Bolshevism - an absolutely key aspect of understanding a large part of the Nazi era. <br /> <br /> But there was not much understanding to do - the filmmakers did not intend to go there, so we still have everything we knew. We certainly do not see the fascinating fact to which Kershaw refers, which Hitler briefly was a socialist / communist just after the First World War. It would of course be too complicated for the film to be able to cope, and perhaps even diminish the merciless mantra "was very bad", which is constantly storming. <br /> <br /> We know he was a bad man. We also know, however, that he was a hypnotizing figure both as a public speaker and in more private situations. He could be polite and even sympathetic and, of course, he supported certain views, such as vegetarianism, anti-alcohol and anti-smoking, with which many Guardian readers could agree. He was also famous for animals, which is why this completely invented scene of dogs being flogged was so absurd. <br /> <br /> Out of all the accounts I saw, he was also a brave soldier in the First World War. While we saw him with his Iron Cross, we will never see him win (there was no need to talk about acts of courage). We also have no insight into why he was so excited by his war experiences, while Sassoon, Owen, Brook, Remarque and many others thought it was a repulsive experience. Again, as in the above point on the Jewish / Bolshevik link, it is important for understanding someone's topic. Why did he love the war so much? Why did he think it was always a good idea, despite the huge evidence to the contrary? Why did not he care for his colleagues who died? Or maybe he did - but he still drew the wrong conclusions. <br /> <br /> This film certainly had nothing interesting to say about it. <br /> <br /> As often happens, a movie is a classic example of "creating a story related to the present" and inventing things or leaving inconvenient facts to fit the "present" - which too often has to satisfy the lowest common denominator, in which you trust your audience by an inch, so you just stick things into their throats, knowing (unfortunately correctly) that you can always escape because there are so many stupid fools in the world. <br /> <br /> History is really about making us relevant to the past and seeing how it's dying our present, for better and for worse. This garbage was a great opportunity, lost again. They spent millions on it, and the locations and large scenes were impressive, but they did not tell us anything that we did not know yet, and promoted the lack of understanding of this dark period in human history. <br /> <br /> WT
