A darkly comic surprise about a cosmetics saleswoman, with strange connections to Elvis Presley, Elvis bouncing sea creatures during a speech at conventions in Nevada ... and accidentally killing each of them by his own fault. Kim Basinger, still an attractive actress with considerable merits, likes to choose bizarre movies to play, but this horrible scenario (by Mitchell Gan and Adam-Michael Garber) does not have any good humor in it. Stereotypes and boring gags are not meant to be a classic comedy, but even on a shameful, shameful level, the picture is primitive and messy. If you look, check if you can count how many Basinger's alien arrows at the wheel of her pink cadillac, hands always in the same position and inconspicuous facial expression. I hope that both she and Elvis were well paid. NO STARS WITH ****
