I do not know anything about the Iliad, so I can not comment on its accuracy in this story. However, as an independent film, I found it very boring. The battle scenes were trying to be big and spectacular, but they were just plain CGI. <br /> <br /> Acting is weak and no doubt Brad Pitt was cast just to attract the ladies. But he does not make a good warrior, too good, I'm scared. <br /> <br /> Good points are design. This film looks good with the landscape and impressive castle buildings / walls. I like a movie where I'm trying to get the characters' accents at least, but this movie just ignores it altogether. we hear American, Scottish English anything but what you can expect from a film about ancient Eastern civilization. <br /> <br /> In total, I do not recommend this movie for a sitting family. It's too long and the young are bored. <br /> <br /> It's OK for adults if you do not care about the lack of realism.
