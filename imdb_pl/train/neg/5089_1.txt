It is so sad that the Romanian audience is still inhabited by vulgar and uneducated people who like such cheap and demonstrative shows, as superficial and brutal as the series "Garcea" or "Vacanta mare". The difference is that Mugur Mihäescu, Doru Octavian Dumitru and other such sub-craftsmen never claim that they have their performances as "art". Pintilie, who made a very good film 40 years ago ("Duminicä la ora sase"), then another, quite nice ("Reconstituirea"), tries to declare her cinematic lengths of "works of art" - but unfortunately, he is a master in the way too limited level of specific cinematographic means of expression. Therefore, "Niki Ardelean" again offers a sample "HOW NO" - this is his only merit.
