After waking up at 3:30 in the morning and not being able to go to sleep, I decided that I might as well have fun when I was suffering from a lack of sleep. This movie was on HBO and I decided to watch it. What a mistake! <br /> <br /> Here is the plot (potential spoilers, if you care about it): a neurotic man with candy addiction (Josh Kornbluth) works as a deputy to some funny company. He suddenly has a chance to "pass perm", which seems to be the favorite slogan of this movie. But thanks to safe work and secure income at your fingertips, Josh decides for some stupid reason that he does not want to do it. Hopelessly, he blocks a few small tasks, and his laziness and lack of ambition fill me with contempt. His inability to send some "very important" letters at a particular time is supposed to be fun, but he is stupid. Josh meets and cheats a lawyer, and they sit together in bed (of course, Josh's fantasy in real life, because such a thing would never happen). Many other things happen, but it's too trivial and ridiculous to get in right now. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this movie is announced as a comedy, I only laughed twice during this movie; for the first time it was Josh Kornbluth's opening shot (my initial reaction was to suppress fear) and the other was in bed with an attractive woman (yes, right). Josh Kornbluth is probably the most terrifying person I've ever seen in my life. He is an unattractive, overweight, balding Jew who I assume is having sex with beautiful women. I do not sympathize with Josh's character at all. He is lazy and not motivated, and I just do not appreciate unsuccessful attempts at humor. Skip it, even if your life depends on it.
