This movie should only be 10 minutes. I mean, there's really only 10 minutes worth of seeing in this thing (I will hesitate to even call it a movie). The first steps of the movie were somehow promising. Because the film starts with the short comments of the man himself, you really rub your hands and listen to more recordings of Cohen's life. Well, Nick Cave does a sensible job, covering one of Cohen's famous songs. The length of the Cave performance makes you even more anxious to see Cohen, whose wit and well-spoken words tickled your taste. But as it turns out, Cave's performance is just the beginning of long, super boring performances, literally a handful of people who do not even have the minimum attraction to keep you in place. I mean what the filmmaker really thinks? five-minute close-up photos that want to be singers at a fake concert in Australia !!! What the filmmaker really thinks is to offend the audience by adding "false applause" to these endless nasty performances. The film is an excellent torture that shows very little of what you have seen. There is not a single recording of Cohen's past. In fact, with the exception of a few pictures from his early years as a singer / poet, there is absolutely nothing! If you sum up all the minutes that Cohen says, they may not even reach 10 minutes. But these 10 minutes are presented step-by-step between the disastrous work of the camera, which captures some of the most unattractive people screaming Cohen's lyrics. If you've ever decided to waste money on this movie, NO! just put it in the trash and at least save your time.
