Of course Florence Chadwick was a much better swimmer. She sailed round the Channel in both directions. She sailed from Catalina Island to the coast of California. Marilyn Bell is a sweet story, but the mere glorification of us Canadians in the face of a higher world. Another sample of our inferiority complex. Our political system works quite well, and the health care system allows people not to die in the hospital lobby. That's pretty good. Better than Lebanon. But what should we do with hockey ...? And curling. The concept of naming this sport, its inclusion in the Olympics ...! Oh, but we digress ...
