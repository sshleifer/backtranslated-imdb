I've seen bad things in my time. Half a dead cow trying to get out of the high mud at the waist; head at the collision of two cars; a thousand plates crashing on the kitchen floor; people living like animals. <br /> <br /> But I've never seen anything as bad as a cat in a hat in my life. <br /> <br /> This movie is worse than 911, worse than Hitler, worse than the Vllad Impaler, worse than people who put kittens in the microwave. <br /> <br /> This is the most disturbing movie of all time, easy. <br /> <br /> I used to think it was a joke, a complicated joke, and Mike Myers was maybe a drug addicted drug addict who lost a bet or something like that. <br /> <br /> I shudder
