What can you say about this film? It was not terrible, but it was not good! Two days earlier I watched Lillies and it was one of the best gay movies I've ever seen. So it was not the best time to watch the average Gay Flick. <br /> <br /> The story was stupid and the acting was OK. It was not bad enough to turn off, but it had some bad moments and terrible stereotypes. He was not well manned either. <br /> <br /> Would I recommend this movie? No, you would waste your time and money. I do not understand why such films are made and who finances them. Take your time Watching the Noah's arch instead of the logo. I think it was in this movie that he tried to go, but he never got there.
