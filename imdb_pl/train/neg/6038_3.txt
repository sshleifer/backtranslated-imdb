I had no other expectations than being entertained for 90 minutes, and that was exactly what I was. <br /> <br /> Of course it's a campus, of course some of the dialogues were not perfect, of course the "special effects" were a bit hokey. That's why I liked the movie so much. Ideally suited to this genre of classic horror movie from the 70s. <br /> <br /> The talent must start from where it's going, for the actors and crew, and also better material that will sharpen your skills than this. <br /> <br /> I am looking forward to the next movie from these producers and directors.
