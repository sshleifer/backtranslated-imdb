This early entry B into the patriotic category hit great young Gene Tierney in commercials and posters, but you must wait before you see her, riding a Hollywood train on camels. Earlier, we founded George Sanders and Bruce Cabot in the desert as guys who barely get along, but they must gather in the face of an attack. I saw Sanders as so many nice guys that it was cool to be a witness of a rare good queue. However, the charm of Bruce Cabot is quite mysterious to me - compared to him is basic and insubordinate, but I always felt that he just appeared, smiling from under the car, covered with fat and sixth grade education. Some like them in this way, like the figure of the gypsy queen Gene. It is an action adventure filler, and as we are warned of attacking the locals with weapons, ready to sabotage and attack the British in their country, the final battle for the weapon takes place, in which we must lose the main character well from everyone. This function does not require anything more than just remarks on a Saturday afternoon, a programmer who did everything that was paired with a better one. It was almost more interesting to describe the great cast and unexpected appearance of Dorothy Dandridge in one of her first roles. Two or two and five stars out of five. -MDM
