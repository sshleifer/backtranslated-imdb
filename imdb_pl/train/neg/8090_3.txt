I am partly a fan of Miyazaki's work. I say "partly" because most of his films can be divided into two categories: brilliant and boring. Unfortunately, this movie belongs to a later category. <br /> <br /> This movie suffers from the same fundamental problems as Miyazaki's last film, "Howl's Moving Castle." An intriguing assumption arises, but immediately afterwards it is reduced to little more than the background for some unfathomable events that serve only to confuse the plot, not to explain it. <br /> <br /> The first third of the film reveals a post-apocalyptic world in which history takes place and it looks like a very interesting story is about to take place. From that moment things go down the hill. The middle part of the film consists mainly of thin-veiled eco-propaganda, and the ending is heavily distorted by reliance on impenetrable spiritualism, which destroys a large number of Japanese animated films. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie looks as if someone snatched from the script every other side before passing it to the animators. There is something that is visually stunning (although unfortunately the version that I saw was a copy of the Nth generation, with a bad color - which generates a common myth that Nausicaa shows its bare bottom during the flight), but that does not make sense, finally left me confused .
