it must be one of those films where the trailer is 50 times better than the movie itself. I saw the trailer for the first time in 1991, it looked great. I have always wanted to see it since then, but I could never find it ... until today, 14 years later. <br /> <br /> let's just say that I was so disappointed that it was unrealistic, OK I knew it would not be an Oscar winner, but I still hoped it would be a great fun movie with no brain in the mold. Unfortunately, it was not, it was Puchatek <br /> <br /> what with all American rock and roll music and acting was so bad that it was quite scary. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes were nonsense and they looked fake. <br /> <br /> this DVD cost me only 5 pounds and I believe I was exaggerated by Â£ 7 <br /> <br /> Now I'm sad because I know I will never get that hour and half as much.
