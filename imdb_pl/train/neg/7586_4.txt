Summer Holiday is a forgotten music version of Eugene O'Neill's Ah Wilderness and deservedly deserves a musical adaptation of Take Me Along on Broadway. With the exception of the Stanley Steamer song, none of the other Harry Warren-Ralph Blane songs are worth memorizing, and even this one is questionable. <br /> <br /> It was right after the premiere of this movie that MGM let Mickey Rooney leave and I do not think it was a coincidence. The film was made in 1946 and was released in 1948, so Mickey was 26 years old, playing Andy Hardy like a teenager. He was just too old for a part of a 17-year-old who influenced radical ideas in a spirit of youthful rebellion. <br /> <br /> Rooney has made four films for MGM from 1946 to 1948, this one, Killer McCoy remake A Crowd Roars by Robert Taylor, Love Laughs in Andy Hardy and Words and Music. In each of them Rooney played for adults. Even in Andy Hardy's film, Mickey played adult Andy Hardy, who had returned from World War II. Why was he in this Louis B. Mayer only knows. <br /> <br /> Rooney's bad casting makes Summer Holiday even worse, because in the original Ah Wilderness the emphasis is on the character of father played by Walter Huston. And on Broadway, "Take Me Along," which won the Tony Award for Jackie Gleason, the Big One played drunk brother-in-law Uncle Sid, played by Frank Morgan, and this is the main character. <br /> <br /> Gloria DeHaven enters the role of Judy Garland, and the sweet and lovely friend Rooney and Marilyn Maxwell play a girl who gives Rooney adult education. In the original play O'Neill has her as a prostitute, but it was a Hollywood codex, so Marilyn does everything to get the young Rooney. <br /> <br /> Many really talented people have one part in it and they do everything in their power, but Summer Holiday quickly disappears into the cold autumn.
