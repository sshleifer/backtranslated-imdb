Absolute garbage, worse fighting scenes than van Damme's 20-year-old film or an American ninja, etc. <br /> <br /> A truly terrifying acting, not a skill visible throughout the film, like a cast of wooden sculptures. /> <br /> See how bad the movie really is, maybe it was acceptable in the 80s, but this is a movie from 2006, I do not love this movie because it was not born in the 1980s. <br /> < br /> If you like real fighting movies, check out tons of jaa in ong bak and guardian, these are the right martial arts videos. <br /> <br /> laugh and watch it today you can see unintentional humor, how bleak it is.
