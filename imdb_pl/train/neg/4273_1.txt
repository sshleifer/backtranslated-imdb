There is nothing special about either the TV series or the movie. Which is the prequel of a television program that is not found anywhere in life and entertainment. Both before David Lynch disgusting style of storytelling and later. <br /> <br /> From the moment the body of a poor girl washes the beach. And introduced into some of the most dulling, immoral, immoral character of Twin Peaks. <br /> <br /> For Mind to anesthetize an almost pedophilic disgusting path, the film seems to be romantic about the destruction of Human Life through random psychedelic phenomena in Movie Twin Peak: Fire Come Walk with me. <br /> <br /> I watched all this to make sure that nothing was missing. I did not do it. It is simply an obvious sexual fetish extended to long series, which imposes a ridiculous porn movie. Save your agony in suspense and watch everything at least have the ability to tell stories and then seduce you into some kind of mental porn movie. <br /> <br /> I've heard a lot of reviews, ranting and raves about how great David Lynch is. Because of his ability to define misery and tragedy and make her a wonderful thing. This is not art imitating art, but it is a sick, twisted version of art that does everything in its power to inspire a total thoughtless life. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and avoid this trash.
