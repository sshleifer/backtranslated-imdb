It is a movie that is so bad that you can not stop watching it because you keep telling yourself that "it can not be so mushy until the end. I just can not ". You know, "worse than bad JAWS 4". <br /> <br /> I really think I only saw one movie that was worse than that and then we're talking about religious nonsense about how you "I'll end up in hell for lying or watching football. <br /> <br /> Gore? Indeed and a lot. Well done gore? No way. <br /> <br /> Acting is bad, and all lines are bad phrases. The same applies to the plot, which really consists only of sex, blood and violence, like many other movies up up. <br /> <br /> If you're hoping to merge Ichi the Killer and August Underground ?? Look further. You will not find it in Live Feed.
