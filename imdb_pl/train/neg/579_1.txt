Listening to the director's commentary confirmed what I suspected while watching the movie: it is a film made by a guy who wants to play the film. The plot is a kind of thing that teenagers are mistaken about when they go through the fact that "I can write a phase of a book / script / award-winning sitcom". There is a germ of an interesting idea (probably because it is a continuation of someone else's film), but it is completely buried under a guaranteed, ill-made and ridiculously incomprehensible scenario. <br /> <br /> The lines are terrible, and the performances do not get involved, although I'm inclined to blame the director again. It seems that he did not consult the actors about what is required at all, instead he put the script in his hands, he pointed the camera at them and told them to do it. Who knows, with a bit of coaching, the actors would be better able to stabilize (say what you like in musicians in movies, Jon Bon Jovi was perfect in Row Your Boat and more than acceptable in The Leading Man). <br /> <br /> At the moment the cast has no chemistry. A beautiful opportunity for parallel use of classic sex and vampirism is skipped when, in order to infect the character of Bon Jovi with the blood of a vampire from his sick hunter, he receives a transfusion. She should bite him. Remember that for the rest of the movie they should look very interested in each other. The only real moment of sexual tension between the two women is run by the self employed director. Initially, he intended to use this silent sequence as an excuse for a more pointless exposure of the story - so I suppose the finished product could probably have been worse. But not much. <br /> <br /> Honestly, movies are coming, it's badly printed, stupid and forgotten. Even if kitschy movies are not sexy enough or bloody enough to be funny. It could have been fun and damned little, but the director left more comedy for all the wrong reasons.
