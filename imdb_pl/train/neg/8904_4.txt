Personally, I really liked "The Prophecy" from 1995. Christopher Walken was, as always, great, and although the movie was not spotless, it was a frightening and very original Horror / Fantasy movie that had a great time. This inferior sequel from 1998 is still worth a look, but mainly because of Walken. Walken is one of the best actors, in my opinion, once again in the role of the fallen Archangel Gabriel, whom he plays here for the second time. Once again, the war between fallen and loyal angels is brought to earth. Gabriel returns to prevent the birth of a child, namely the child of the angel Danyael (Russel Wong) and the human woman Valerie (Jennifer Beals). This child could once be a decisive factor in the heavenly war ... As I said above, Christopher Walken is once again perfect as Gabriel. However, apart from Gabriel "The Prophecy II" unfortunately also contains some terribly annoying characters. Valerie's character was irritating enough, and Danayel annoyed me even more. The biggest pain in the butt was Izzy (played by Brittany Murphy), a suicidal girl who could not close herself. Still, Walken's performance is not the only advantage of the movie. The whole film is quite gloomy and well filmed in dark colors, which contributes greatly to the atmosphere. The scene of Gabriel's resurrection at the beginning is also impressive and is one of the coolest moments in each of the films "Prophecy." "The Prophecy II" is however the weakest of the three films "Prophecy" with Walken. Definitely Christopher Walken a one-man show, funny, but nothing more.
