It was a classic case of something that should never be. Gloria was now a single mother, her husband left her because she would not live with him in some commune (he was furious that Reagan was elected and wanted to turn away from society). That's when I had problems with the series - tell me, is this the same noble Michael Stivic who opposed the right-wing philosophy of Archie Bunker? The series lasted, but it just did not have any pizazzu. No matter what moment Sally Struthers got from All the Family, she left. Perhaps, if the series received a different name and appeared to be completely independent of All In The Family, it could succeed. Ah, this is show business.
