warn: this movie tells many love stories without any consistency. <br /> <br /> The only intent of this movie seems to be showing love in many different ways. a few minutes, so there is no character development and almost no plot. Just a sketchy idea of ​​a story. The writer tried to build turning points that were to surprise the viewer. However, it just did not work out because you did not recognize the previous characters or these "jokes" were simply stupid. <br /> <br /> This is a love movie that does not reach your heart. Dozen times. Or even more, I do not know and I do not care.
