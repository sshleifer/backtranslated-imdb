I wanted to see a movement thinking that it could be a rough diamond, but the only thing I found was bad writing, terrible directing (shot sequences do not flow), even if the director could say it's him. It looks very boring and immature) edition could be made by anyone with 2 video recorders, and the video material was low-budget. I would say that it was not even as easy as mini digital video. <br /> <br /> There are some simple ways to fix a movie using what the director has, for example through editing etc. But it's obvious that he just does not care. This film puts as much effort as a ham sandwich. It could be better, but it would mean an extra job.
