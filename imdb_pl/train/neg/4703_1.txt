"Show me your boobs!" Is not funny, and certainly not on the channel that shows cartoons, if you understand where I come from. I do not want my 6 and 7 year old daughters to think this way or hear about it. It's sad that Nick misses this shit too much, and then it happens, stupid little kids behave like stupid adults. I know it's meant to be humorous, but think that we have cute little innocent girls in grades K and 1st that can not wait to see. I had to comment on how disappointed I was when I saw it. My daughters will not watch this. I'd love to block Nick, but I do not have the heart at the moment, but if Nick has to spend that nonsense, I'll have to.
