I saw it not so long ago and I must say: this movie is terrible. I watch bad movies for fun. Scarecreow is not funny. Scarecrow is stupid. You have an incredibly black villain who likes to shout terrible puns when he kills his victims (actually worse than the one contained in this sentence). He has a hard history he uses to justify his murders. "Everyone is choosing me. The only girl who thinks I'm not a litter trailer, likes one of the guys who choose me. I want to kill everyone. Wah. "OK, I'm exaggerating. But the premise for this film is enough to put it at the very end of the list of bad movies. <br /> <br /> Adding to what I just said, the mother of the child is dissolute, enters the mother and her current boyfriend begins to do so, the boy's mother tells him to leave, the child refuses, insisting that he is not going to leave his own home . The boy chases a child in a corn field. He kills the kid right in front of his mother, mom screams in terror, the boy is like "OMG! I did not want to! "Then she tells her mother not to tell the police about it. However, the kid was killed under the scarecrow. Thus, like every kid who is murdered under a scarecrow, he returns as a murderous scarecrow with revenge. His victims "were not so persecuted before ..." (official Scarecrowa line) <br /> <br /> What's worse, this movie was filmed in a huge 8 days. That's true, 8 days. I was going to give it to the movie 2 because it still has one or two moments of redemption. (These are spoilers, so I will not ruin this if you really want to see this shit.) I could forgive bad behavior, terrible special effects, bad scenario and bad camera work, but I just have no respect for the lack of effort at this level. <br /> <br /> This movie is not as good as it seems. If you want to see an example of how not to make a movie or you like watching bad movies like me, look at it at your own risk. Everyone else should stay at a safe distance from the movie all the time.
