A decent continuation, but it does not pack the punch of the original. The murderous screenwriter (Judd Nelson) accepts new identities to make his own novel KABINA BY LAKE. Still merciless killing, but the movie seems very cheeky. Every humor is not funny. The overall design seems to have the quality of a quick number, and sometimes Nelson is above the top. This movie is about rewriting the script before moving to the screen ... it should happen with this script.
