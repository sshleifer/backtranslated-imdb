Gregory Peck's acting was superb, as you'd expect, and the pictures were pretty stunning, even when playing a melodramatic "moment". But the rest of the movie was overused and difficult to watch, for me anyway. I tried to like it, but I had to scroll through the last thirty minutes. I feel that I have wasted a few good hours. If it were not for Gregory Peck, I would not have fifteen minutes. 4/10.
