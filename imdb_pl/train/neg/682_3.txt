Note: I can see from various posts that there was an original silent version, as well as the sound version of the same movie. I saw the sound version and was aesthetically malicious. Given that some of them indicate that the original version was LONGER and no shit dubbing, my review must be read with that in mind. <br /> <br /> Although I know that Rene Clair has a great reputation as a film producer, and Louise Brooks has a bit of a cult following, it's a technically poorly made film in many respects. While Hollywood has almost gone into sound mode around 1929, until the early 1930s, many well-known French films were essentially silent films - with some dialogues and sound effects very poorly hit in the movie. The lip movements of many, especially in this film, do not even come close to what is being said, and this would explain why an American like Mrs Brooks can make a French movie. It's just sloppy and I'd rather just make a silent movie - and as a silent film it would be an average movie - with excellent camera work (sometimes) and decent working in a quiet style. br /> <br /> The problem that I found in the film is too simplified plot. For silent morality, to play around 1920, it would be good, but according to the standards of 1930. The plot is slightly frosted (which means "old" - not "slutty"). The lady wins a beauty contest, and her fianc√© macho can not deal with it. He gives it all temporarily, but he returns to a fancy life and that means its end! A bit melodramatic, eh? And also a bit simplified and underdeveloped. <br /> <br /> Finally, the figure of a fiance's friend (?) I find very disturbing and unreal. He looked like Harold Lloyd and spent most of the movie being abused and chosen by a friend and everyone else. As soon as he took it all through the movie and there was no solution, his character seemed superfluous and the treatment he received was exciting. Was the audience laughing when it was abused? It seems to me that this is implied and I do not like it at all. <br /> <br /> There are MUCH better French era movies (Le Million, La Femme du Boulanger, Fanny, Regain and others) as well as better silent movies. I just can not understand the high rating of this movie.
