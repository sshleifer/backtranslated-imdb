What is the most shocking movie in history? Gynecological nightmare "Cries and Whispers"? Fassbinder acid psychodrama? An unpleasant black comedy "The last house on the left? I am sure that for this part of the film audience that links their masts to the good ship Buster Keaton, there is only one answer - each of his sound films. <br /> <br /> I do not know what more accused my soul in this film - grounding Keaton's complex and expansive physical art to a gloomy slapstick; painful hesitation of this film master with dialogue - not that there is no charming, comical voice, nor that he can not make the dialogue amusing; it just seems that the studio has not given him enough time, so he seems to be trying to remember his poems before he delivers, which only makes him - Keaton, not his character, looks stupid; is it the humiliation of seeing Keaton entangled in a tacky sexual farce when he gave us the richest relationship about the romantic frustration in the movie? <br /> <br /> No, I know what was most disturbing - watching Buster Keaton, the biggest comedian of the cinema, I will step aside to watch Jimmy Durante do his schtick. It is the horrors that make Dantes compose your Infernos. <br /> <br /> It seems that MGM has an interesting idea that the best way to adapt Keaton to sound was to transform it into Brother Marx, along with verbal pedantry, sophisticated, boring "clowning", slapstick slamming, theatrical surroundings, triumph through chaos and Thelma Todd. Keaton was simply not that kind of comic book, and wherever Groucho's malicious language and cheerful opportunism could make this plot work, the socially inept Buster's professor can not, he's too studied and predictable. <br /> <br /> What Buster needed was to be allowed to experiment like Lang in "M" or Rene Clair; he would never try to stop the tide like Chaplin. When a movie like "The General" refers to - a mess with trains - the loss becomes even more apparent. <br /> <br /> And the fact is that in the spots in the midst of a flat direction, the film is not so bad - there is a great shock when the camera on the bus leaves Keaton at the train station; and the solution, if it is not original, is at least more vivid than before. There's something captivating in the way Keaton slows down the plot that needs the whole zip he can get. <br /> <br /> There is a movie about loneliness, an emotional paralyzing order, numbing effects of education, etc. that have difficulty getting out. The best way to appreciate this movie is not to watch the TZ Post's narrative, but the distorted genius of Buster Keaton, imprisoned in mediocrity, confused by new technology, ridiculed by the sinister fate (in this case the studio), retaining a stoic grace. Looking at it, it becomes a kind of masterpiece.
