this movie is terrible. The characters are completely unbelievable and insanely inconsistent. The story is awful, and some of the scenes in the class are worth attention and cause uncomfortable watching. <br /> <br /> In fact, the quality of the script and the characteristics would suggest that this movie was written only by high school students a total lack of credibility in the school environment would suggest that in fact writers probably never attended high school. Acting in most cases was also weak, although much of it resulted from a bad script and story, I'm not sure if any of the actors could make this movie possible to watch. <br /> <br /> said that the sound of the song was fine, and the photos were cool in places (though the editing was poor).
