At the beginning it was a "sweet" movie, and then it was at best overly worn and contained average songs. <br /> <br /> There is too much English King James, which is not only annoying in today's world, but not always easy to interpret. Can you imagine that young people are trying to listen to this movie today? Forget about it. <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby has a few good lines here and is liked as "Hank Martin". Rhonda Fleming ("Alisande La Carteloise") was also, in addition to her good looks and beautiful, long red hair. <br /> <br /> It's a nice movie with a good feeling and I can not knock it. It may be worth borrowing, because of history or if you're a big fan of Crosby, but overall, it's not that much.
