First of all: I love good Splattermovies and I'm not afraid to make contact with art, but this zero budget is none of it! The picture quality is so damn low, the most annoying audio track I've ever heard (!!!!) and when it comes to FX ... well, the super-low quality makes some of them look as bad as that it would be in a real movie (which is not here). Lack of concept, thin plot, primitive acting and a rare dialogue - I think in the whole movie I counted about 10 sentences, each of which was repeated about 20 times ... the same for many film sequences (this could be an indication for what kind of audience this shit was made !!!) History seems to be such that a young boy had to watch his father raping and killing his mother, he suffered a mental trauma and as an adult goes on a tour, doing a self-mutilation demonstration. So far, so good ... But for those pseudo-art-idiot directors, this storyline is just a line to put in low-cost shock scenes in a row that have neither a message nor a meaning (freshly removed viscera are cast on a naked, bound woman in the earth's hole ... why? and why do you see both the woman and the caster in the entire bloody "film"? The disturbing? Yes !! Sick? Yes !! Necessary? No! Artistic? NO !!!!! Everyone, who will go wrong with this cheap gore-show for art, should visit your psychiatrist as soon as possible or watch Pink Floyd's "The Wall" to see how a similar topic can be worked out in an ingenious way ... I hope it was your first and last movie (!!!!!!!!), Andrew Cobb ... !!!! And all who are there, remember: not everything that looks cheap and of course does not make sense, is automatically "art" ...
