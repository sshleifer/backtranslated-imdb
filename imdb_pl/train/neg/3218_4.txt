This film turned out to be an interesting study of cause and effect, but not much more. The basic story follows the lives of a handful of people and how their actions (intentional and other) affect the lives of others. Establishing the film is very promising, but I feel that it does not fulfill the promise. Too much time is devoted to telling the audience about the theory of chaos and too little time to show it. As a result, I never felt a real feeling for any of the characters and never made a good emotional connection with them. At the end of the movie, I had the attitude "yes, what" in relation to all of them. A stronger direction of character development would make this movie great, but in its present shape it is just like that
