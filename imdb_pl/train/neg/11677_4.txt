Critics talked about it when, to be honest, it's not that great. Sure, "CHAOS" and "INSIDE MAN" are literally the same movie, only with voltage fluctuations. But "CHAOS" turned out to be more pleasant because it was a fast pace, similar to the stupid movie "Swordfish". The reason why this movie is more popular is the fact that it was released in the United States, and "Chaos" was broadcast worldwide at film festivals and foreign theaters, but has not yet found a distributor in the UK and the USA <br /> <br /> It's true that this movie is a lot of tribute to classic movies like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee movies, but that does not mean it's a nice movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Watch out if nothing else is on T.V. but after some time you will be bored.
