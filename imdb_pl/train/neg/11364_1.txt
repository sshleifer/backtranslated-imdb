The first ten minutes of this film about making an international film in Belgium are fine: you see real chaos on set, producer on the verge of a nervous breakdown, cool director (Mickey Rourke), bad star temperament, etc. You've seen everything, but it's good. BUT THEN! The rest of the movie simply repeats itself: the same ten minutes over and over again. Without climax, without dramatic development, without a good acting game, even bad acting, it just lasts and lasts. Mickey Rourke has two good minutes when his character talks about his career in a scene where reality and fiction meet. In total, it gives you 12 good minutes. <br /> <br />
