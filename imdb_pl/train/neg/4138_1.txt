I think it would be a good movie because I like zombies and horrors in general. But I did not think it would be such a piece of this kind of thing. The only zombie in the movie is at the beginning and is run over by a damn car !!! The film looks like written by a porn director and filled with porn actors, I would not call them actors! Costumes seem to be stolen from a local school. It looks like a road movie with almost no monsters. There is no fun in this piece, only horror, but not in the way the director intended. I'd rather be raped by a pedophile than see this movie again !!! ugh!
