The director claims that in the role of "Behind the Scenes" he loves horrors. He loves them so much that he devoted the film Dario Argento, as well as other well-known directors such as George A. Romero and Tobe Hooper. Essentially, the dedication of this film to these wonderful directors is like donating a piece of sh * t for Mother's Day to my mother. The first thing they did wrong was casting. CAST PEOPLE WHO CAN ACT. Nor should you throw a person who is 40 years old into the role of an incomprehensible 18-year-old hermit. That's right, he's been in high school for 22 years. People's reactions when they watch their guys break their hearts are fun. Or like one part, when a guy gets stabbed in the ear (haha, understand this), and his girlfriend just says, "Oh ... my ... God?" The scarecrow itself is quite a character. Bouncing cars and calling people losers. <br /> <br /> The film has one redemption factor ... oh, wait, no, no. <br /> <br /> If you absolutely MUST see it then watch the Rock and Roll trailer on DVD. It covers everything and has a really rough guy.
