The first of the series was brilliant, easily one of the best horrors of all time. This is the worst. When I sat down to look at it, I actually thought that if the fourth and fifth were bad, it must have been good after the previous horrible ones. Boy, I was wrong. Incredibly wrong. <br /> <br /> When I watched the first ten minutes, I was really tempted to turn it off, but I thought no, maybe it would improve. It was not. <br /> <br /> Not only is it a scary movie, but it did not need another sequel, because the last two (fourth and fifth) were horrible enough! Also, how many times can you bring Freddy back!? Acting was terrible, the plot was predictable and nonsense, and it also had flaws. The way they made Springwood completely wrong. He does not respect the first at all. To add to this, the whole thing seemed really exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Some say that this movie was "funny". This film is not "funny" at all. Since when will Freddy Krueger be "funny"? I would call it fun nonsense. This movie is supposed to be a horror movie, not a comedy. If Freddy had a daughter, would not this information appear like the first !? The ending was just stupid and bad, just like the rest. This completely destroys the essence and uniqueness of the first. It just reveals itself. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that Wes Craven created something so good at first, but you have to pull it because of this basket that belongs to the basket. They should not even make this movie. Neither of the other parts, except the third. The third is the only decent of all sequels. <br /> <br /> If it was the DVD itself and it was not part of the DVD Nightmare On Elm Street set I got, I would throw it out when I got it. <br /> <br /> Summary: a pathetic and weak attempt to continue. <br /> <br /> - complete MOCKERY of the first movie <br /> <br /> So please, do not waste time on this worthless trash.
