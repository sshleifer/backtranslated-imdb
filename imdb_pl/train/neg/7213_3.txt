Although I certainly consider The Exorcist to be a classic of horror, I must admit that I do not consider him as highly regarded as many other horror fans. Therefore, I have not seen many Exorcist extortionists, and if Exorcismo has something to say, I must say it's good because this movie is boring as hell and it's definitely not worth spending ninety minutes! In fairness to other random exorcists, this is often considered one of the worst, so maybe it was not the best place for me to start. It is not difficult to guess what the story will be: it is basically the same as the one in "Exorcists" and sees that the girl is possessed by the demonic spirit (which happens to be the spirit of her deceased father). The rural priest is then called to perform an exorcism. Like many other Spanish horror movies, this movie is the star of Paul Naschy, who is basically the best film. Exorcismo was directed by Juan Bosch, who previously directed the derivative of the Spanish Giallo "The Killer Wore Gloves". I have not seen any of his other films, but on the basis of these two: I think that originality was not one of its strengths. There are not many good things that I can say about the film itself; it usually just goes on and the exorcism scene is not worth waiting for. Certainly not recommended!
