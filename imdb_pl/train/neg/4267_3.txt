I saw this movie at the Rotterdam festival, as did all other voters. The director was present and it seemed that he worked very hard and was very involved in the project, which I think explains the above average reception and the mark he received. This is the most similar to the storyline of the favorite Aussie Kids "Round the Twist", but it takes this function too seriously. The film itself is worth seeing if you are trying to make a world tour around the cinema, visiting all UN member states, because I can not think about another Fiji film, but in general, it was generic, malfunctioning (though by an amateur cast) and foraging on the mentality of subalterns. The moral of this story seemed to be that the indigenous inhabitants of the islands would try to mutually twist each other, but as long as there is a decent white governor who can enter, all problems can be solved (leaving the island).
