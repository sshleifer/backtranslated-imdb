Unless you are mentally ill or you are not the most annoying segal fan, you will get tired of this terrifying pretext for the movie in less than 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> The Plot - Even in the Seagal movie, the plot is simply stupid. I mean, it's not just bad, it's barely consistent. <br /> <br /> Acting - Incredibly wooden. I literally saw better acting in porn. Ironically, this film tries to make money on the audience, which is a "lesbian love scene" that is completely brazen. <br /> <br /> Special effects - they would not look out of place in the 60's game and with the sword. <br /> <br /> Unless you suffer from insomnia and exhausted all other medications, do not make the same mistake as I do and buy this DVD because you will be asking for that one and a half hour of your life.
