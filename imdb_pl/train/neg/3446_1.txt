This movie on paper looked like it could be good after watching, although I realized that this movie was totally awful !! The plot does not make sense and I think I counted the best part of 5000 cut scenes, each of which makes the movie more irritating and boring. I watched this late night black black noise just to add GRAY to it, but the truth is that the only thing that scared me was the music, what they would call tragic music, play the opera, I mean seriously !! This movie sums up everything that is not good in this type of film. To be honest, not to say anything more, but watching at your own risk, this movie is just complete nonsense, ENJOY !!
