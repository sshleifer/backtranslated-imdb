It's an extremely boring movie. If you grew up in Vietnam, just like me, you've seen and heard all the movies and quarrels a hundred times. But what makes this movie boring is the narration of director Carlton Sherwood. Most of the movie is filmed with Sherwood, who talks directly with the camera about his opinion about this conflicting time in the history of our nation. <br /> <br /> If you're old enough to remember Vietnam, you've won to find something new here. There is no new evidence that would condemn John Kerry or new evidence worth another documentary about Vietnam. Younger viewers interested in the subject should see the excellent film by George Butler Going Upriver! The stolen Honor was clearly supposed to be the work of John Kerry's hatchery, but he failed to achieve this goal.
