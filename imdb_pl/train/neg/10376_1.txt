I saw this movie at the pre-premiere screening at the Writers Guild theater in Beverly Hills. As I recall, producers and filmmakers were present, probably to illustrate our reaction. <br /> <br /> Many scenes caused a laughter among the audience, which would be okay if it was a comedy it was supposed to be a horror movie. <br /> <br /> If the audience was not scared, it seems that the filmmakers were. They delayed the release for over a year. Out of curiosity, I saw it again to see if they had cut it again; as far as I know, they did not do it. It was the same bad movie, only one year older. <br /> <br /> It almost qualifies as "so bad, it's good", but it's slow and boring.
