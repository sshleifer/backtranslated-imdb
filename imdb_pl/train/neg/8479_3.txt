Okay, when I came to the board in this movie, I really expected people to make fun of it. I was surprised that people over the age of 7 liked it. I liked this movie ... but only b / c me and my younger sister (which is actually only 10) made fun of it all. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, Jordan, but the acting was terrible. You know that the movie is directed to the toilet when the lead does not work. And he did not even have a good script or conspiracy to implement it. I also thought that the figure of Pamela was very bad ... pathetic boundaries. <br /> <br /> Even so, I thought there were some good actors like great Spencer, Hollywood, and Ronnie. It's still not enough to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Two things about this movie that I just can not beat: <br /> <br /> 1.) That Spencer's guy would hit her. Okay, eww. I checked the dates and although in reality he is only four years older than her, the difference in "Figure" seemed much larger. Jordan is a very pretty girl, but in GF she looked 10 or 12 years old ... she looked like a small child! Jake Abel (Spencer) seemed to be a college student. <br /> <br /> 2.) Kristi Yamaguchi can come only to skate for one girl. I mean, I know that Katelin is good and everything, but it still seemed unlikely that Kristi would go to boarding school, which does not even have scholarships on skates, or that the school would hire a skating coach. <br /> <br /> All this has been said ... it was not the worst movie that was ever known, but it was not very good even according to DCOM standards, which I consider to be quite low.
