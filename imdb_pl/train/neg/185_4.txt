Five really good westerns Manna is unmatched as a band in Hollywood. Even John Ford has never done so much with such high quality. An interesting fact is how uneven they are. My beloved Clementine Ford is worth about two and a half of them. Or at least two. <br /> <br /> The real hero, apart from Mann and Stewart, is Chase. Chase is responsible for the brilliant Red River. Chase wrote about a distant country, a river bend and probably a few others. But none of them is as finished as My Darling Clementine, but then there are not many Western or other films. <br /> <br /> Each of the five Mann films has huge gaps, maybe six. Bend, Far, Man of the West, Furies, Winchester 73, and yes, six, Naked Spur. Each of them has a wonderful scene after a great scene, with quite glaring falls. It's the same with Red River, which is still the biggest western ever made. So perfection is not everything. <br /> <br /> But Far Country has huge, huge holes. She's sad and really comes alive only when Stewart and Mc Entire block the corners. The rest is nice for pedestrians, with the usual exception of Mann's camera. The Manna camera is a one-man cinematography course. It is an eye as good as anyone who has ever found himself in a strip of moving film. Almost never in the wrong place. <br /> <br /> Far Country has one amazing moment. And, as usual, it comes from Stewart. Nobody in the history of cinema has ever received physical punishment with the authority of this man. It is absolutely amazing: look at him at Bend, Far, Winchester and Man with Laramie: at Bend he was beaten and hung on the thread so credibly and with such boiling hatred that he looks like someone who was displaced from Dachau in Far on with such violence he is shot down from the raft, he looks so convincing that you are bowed, and of course when he is dragged through the fire in Man, you can see well that you are looking for burn marks. What an actor. Not to mention the moment in Winchester when he was beaten early in a hotel room, as well as anyone did. <br /> <br /> But it was Manna territory: look at Gary Cooper fighting with Jack Lord on Man of the West. As painful as any fighting scene. Cooper, though not as convincing as Stewart, is equally equal when he looks exhausted at the end of the fight. In short, no one but anyone, but no one has ever shown a human being in the extreme, like Mann. <br /> <br /> What a great, great director. <br /> <br /> See every western who has ever done. It's his real monuments, even if they are all horrible. Well, so what. When they roar with their magnificent scenes, they are as good as everyone else, including Ford. And his six westerns as a band are the best they've ever done, period. <br /> <br /> Thanks, Anthony.
