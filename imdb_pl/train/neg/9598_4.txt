Robert Colomb has two full-time jobs. He is known throughout the world as a television reporter. Less known, but equally difficult are his exploits as a full-time filanderer. <br /> <br /> I saw "Vivre pour Vivre" in English called "Live for Life". A little life! Robert seems to always have at least three women in his life: one lover on the way out, one on the road and a cheated wife at home. It helps that Robert is a glib liar. His most useful lies include: "I will call you tomorrow" and "My work lasted longer than planned". He spends a lot of time and money on airplanes, trains and hotel rooms for successive contacts. You wonder when this guy gets caught on his pants. <br /> <br /> Some people may find his life exciting, but I thought it was tedious. His companions, including his wife, Catherine, are attractive and desirable women. But his lifestyle is so hectic and he's so lying that you're wondering if he's enjoying it all. <br /> <br /> Adding to boredom is a significant movie material that does not lead to a story. There are extended sections without dialogue or only French dialogue. We see documentary films about wars, torture and training for soldiers interspersed with live action. When Robert's flight returns from Africa, we wait and wait for the plane to land and take a taxi to the airport terminal. <br /> <br /> Annie Girardot is an outstanding performer of this film. She was the most interesting character and she played it to perfection. It was also nice to see Candice Bergen at the beginning of her career. I can not find fault with Yves Montand, which was basically an amoral tramp. <br /> <br /> I liked some of Claude Lelouch's innovative techniques. In the hotel room scene, the camera moves around the room, as claimed by Robert and his lover. We see them briefly during each passage in the room. In another scene set on the train's sleeping car, Robert lies on the upper bunk while his wife is on the lower one. Robert gives his wife some important but disturbing news, but we hear only part of it because of the train's clatter. I felt that his wife could not absorb every word because of the shocking nature of the message. I also enjoyed the exciting Safari scenes in Africa. The pictures of these scenes and those in Amsterdam were great. <br /> <br /> I reviewed this film as part of a project at the Library of Congress. I called the FIFTY project: 50 Notable Films forgotten in 50 years. As I can best define, this film, like the other forty-nine I have identified, has not been video, television or distributed in the US since its release. In my opinion, it's worth sharing it again. <br /> <br />
