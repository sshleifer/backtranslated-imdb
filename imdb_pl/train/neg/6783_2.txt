It seems that the number of people who have never written an IMDb review before or since then is surprisingly large. Given the very low average rating given to the film by other people, I think you can draw your own conclusions. <br /> <br /> This is a very bad movie. I admit, I thought that this idea was quite sweet and I was happy to see that the actresses who played Eve and Harmony on Angel started to work, but it did not last long when the horror of the film became known. <br /> <br /> Acting: The leaders seemed competent enough, but everyone else? Terrible. <br /> <br /> Plot: A wedge full of holes large enough to drive a truck. <br /> <br /> Direction: non-existent. <br /> <br /> Humor: Do they really think that people will laugh? Oh boy. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: OK. there were some really beautiful women in the film. Not only the three main female figures, but on the other side of the board. It's as if the producers were hoping that the scenery would keep the male viewers so dispersed that they would not notice how terrible everything else was. If so, they failed. <br /> <br /> In the right hand it could have been charming, but darkly fun camp classics. It was not even close.
