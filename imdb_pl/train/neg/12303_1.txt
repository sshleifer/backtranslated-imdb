This movie is so bad that it's good - unintentionally funny. I could not stop watching him, I was laughing like that! It's like a parody of a romantic thriller, except it's not a parody. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul plays Emily Wendell, the oppressed wife of a preacher who falls for Luke (Corey Sevier), a clumsy and mysterious tramp, whom we eventually learn in prison; the only thing that Sevier is guilty of is bad action! Remember that it is not worse than other actors. You get the impression that the actors have * no * the idea that they are in a really terrible movie; they play it straight. Everything in the film is bad: acting, script, love scenes, tempo, twists, choice of music. The climaxes are just so absurd - first shooting at the church, then Luke's last words to Emily - I howled with laughter. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Luke was lifting weights and munching in jail, and we're seeing a lot of his bare torso. This is probably the most important part of the movie.
