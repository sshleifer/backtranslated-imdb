One of the cornerstones of the low-budget cinema is the well-known, classic plot and total corruption. Phantom in the shopping center is no exception to this rule. The screenwriter takes a long-running plot of the Phantom of the Opera and moves it to a shopping center from the late 1980s. However, the purpose of the "Phantom" is now to revenge the people responsible for the disfigurement of his face and the murder of his family. Special effects provide a good chuckle, especially when parts of the body begin to appear in the dishes from the yoghurt stand. Pauly Shore has a small role that does not allow him to be as disgusting as one would expect, mainly due to the fact that his fifteen minutes of MTV fame have not yet arrived. If you're looking for some good laughter at the expense of the actors and the special effects crew, check it out. Otherwise, look for something else.
