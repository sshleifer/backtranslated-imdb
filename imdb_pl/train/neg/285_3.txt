It's not about gymnastics; exchange occasional training assemblies, or it can be archery, microbiology or snober-flicking. Instead, like any other Rocky / Flashdance derivative that flooded the 80's market, it's about conquering adversity with accuracy, making all social / personal realities irrelevant to your loneliness - of course with love interest. In short, Ronald Reagan from top to bottom; just like a piece of cinema depends on details. Some of the actors are weird enough to liven up - especially the interest in the love that no one else brings you like Mr. Keanu Reeves, warming up on Ted; heroine Olivia D'Abo, the hateful alcove dad and half-step sister are more interesting than the sickly mother or her inert females, one of which seems to be made of porcelain. My instinct is the horror of black comedians, but on the other hand they are at least in the movie. But D'Abo does not quite convince his clumsy girlfriend, and in the absence of any other narrative narrative, the lack of interest in gymnastics alone really matters; all these are just bodies moving around, and not only the result of the big tournament is sealed, all this is done by an obvious doublet.
