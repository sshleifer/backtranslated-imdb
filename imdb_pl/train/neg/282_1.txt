What was an exciting and quite original series of Fox, degraded to meandering guts. In the first season, Dark Angel was on my weekly "must see" list, not just because of Jessica Alba. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the rulers at Fox decided they had to "fine-tune the story. During the 3 episodes of the first season, they completely lost me as a spectator (not even seeing Jessica Alba!). I found that new characters added in the second season are too funny and amateur. New threads stretched the continuity and credibility of the show too thin. In one episode of the second season, they even had Max sleeping and dreaming - where the first season stated that she could not sleep biologically. If it works, do not do it! <br /> <br /> azjazz
