Sometimes I put my head down and think about the reasons why films about deadly sharks and / or crocodiles are still being made today. They make these bad copies of "Jaws" since the 70's, it's not that they become more liked. The idea is still the same. So we have an animal that begins to murder people. First he removes several secondary characters, and then begins to attack the main characters, usually played by several nobici√≥w, except for someone who was a bit more familiar, who usually plays a specialist. One of the main characters usually dies before others kill an animal in some way, they usually explode. Then we usually get the last shot when we see that the animal is still alive, or lay eggs etc. Etc. "Crocodylus" basically uses the same abused ideas and does absolutely nothing to create even a little variation. Unless you count with the fact that the "specialist" is the captain in this one variety, in which case your standards are quite low. It's funny that he plays Duncan Regehr, but he liked to be Zorro.Hell I would give a bonus point for it.
