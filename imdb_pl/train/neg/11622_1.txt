Dave goes through a divorce and his mind returns to his first love. "Wandering" is probably not a word. I should say that he is repairing the past girl. He remembers the day the relationship ended. Sequences of sleep lack only misty transitions. He fondly remembers his favorite songs and the places they went. I am not an adviser, but maybe it had something to do with a failed marriage? Dave goes to the support group and meets with a lady in her middle age (also divorced), who instead of being "turned off" by his horror, begins to interest him. Did I mention how terrible Dave is? Sometimes she refers to herself in the third person. He does not move his hands when he goes. It's just weird. Too short a story, Dave is plotting to hunt Mary (an old friend) and kill her ... err ... I mean confronting her. He does it. Which was really scary. She believes she is married, but he is still flying in the middle of the country to meet her. He sets up his home to make sure he is alone before he "falls" on her. He leads an awkward conversation with her, which ends with sharing the gospel of Christ in about 10 words or less and returns to the new young girl. The film was mainly unintentional comedy. I'm still enjoying my wife with my impressions of Dave ... "I heard another song by Dave & Mary!"
