I saw this film many times in the late 60's and 70's, when it grew up like a reindeer head with rabies every November-December as a Saturday show for kids. It was always a fierce competition for CHRISTMAS THAT HAD NOT BEEN (Can I say "Christmas"?), Perhaps the biggest, most cult movie of all time. But this is another review. <br /> <br /> At that time I was surprised that the shade of the SANTA CLAUS screen was almost "pink and white", the color of imprints with gears changed so much. <br /> <br /> The movie is a bit scary! That's what I thought - and it still is. I was very funny then, just like me! It's funny like "elves again." Incidentally, the picture quality looks much better on DVD, which I have now than in the theater, around 1969-74. <br /> <br /> If you are expecting a "lost holiday RANKIN-BASS" - forget it! If you want FELLINI, then Saint - read on ... <br /> <br /> By nature, dubbing on these foreign films (the original version here was in Spanish) always makes them seem "surreal". This contributes to the inherent strangeness of movies, but it is also quite frightening that the "dishonest demon" (described in the original American trailer) spends the whole movie trying to transform decent children into "evil". "Key boy" who wanted to have parents at Christmas - suddenly "port-a-family" emerges from giant "Christmas gifts-mind" until he realizes that he dreams of it! if you're a fool, save your stock - this movie will make you think you have hallucinations ... no drugs!
