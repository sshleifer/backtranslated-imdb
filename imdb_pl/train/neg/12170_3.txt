No wonder that Pamela Springsteen resigned from being a full-time photographer; a much better idea is to have it behind the camera than in front of it. Although this film is not devoid of interesting elements (dyes from hell etc.), it's disadvantages. First, Angela, a murder counselor, seems to be the same age as the campers. Having an older, more dangerous director of the camp would do much for the film. And then you have murder scenes. The budget was apparently too low to properly perform most of them (without using words), although drowning someone in the lavatory toilet is certainly original. But in general, there are a lot of movies that are more frightening / more pleasant to spend an hour and a half looking at life.
