Bernard Rapp died last year and was a very cultured journalist. The cinema was one of his greatest passions (he wrote an extensive world-wide dictionary of films), so he was obliged to have a camera at least once in his life. But the films he left received the summer reviews: "Tiré à Part" (1996), despite the sensational performance of Terence Stamp, he was very caricatural in presenting the heroes, "une Affaire De Goût" (2000) was neat, even if Bernard Giraudeau he gave the perverse spectacle "Pas Si Grave" (2003), which was another disappointment, and "un Petit Jeu Sans Conséquence" is just as disappointing as his predecessors. Its comic potential is used in an ambiguous way. <br /> <br /> However, the initial idea allows to predict shooting, spiritual comedy. The couple belonging to Yvan Attal and Sandrine Kiberlain, who invited their friends, are in a full move in a lusty residence. To play with their guests, they pretend to share with each other. And things do not go according to plan, because the announcement of their separation does not surprise them. Two lovers begin to think about the legitimacy of their couple. <br /> <br /> Despite the lush scenery and promising material that he had at his disposal, the unmatched director Rappa is unable to give life to this game with unexpected consequences. The plot has a shabby pattern with characters that have specific, well-known features and masks that reveal who they really are. Comic verbal or situational effects often fall. The bad editing disappears slightly in the film with this bad habit, from Rappa to the sudden cutting of many sequences. Even the sincere contribution of the actors to the venture is debatable. They seem to be bored and recite their lyrics, and do not live them, especially Sandrine Kiberlain. The audience soon gets into a deep numbness. <br /> <br /> It is a pity, so to speak: Bernard Rapp's films never met his intentions because it is testified by "un Petit Jeu sans Conséquence".
