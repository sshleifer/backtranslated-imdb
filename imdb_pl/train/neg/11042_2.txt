I would like to say that this concert was unusual in its banality, but it is usually in every respect. He has a stupid husband, his wiser, but boring and conventional wife, along with an idiotic helper for "comic" relief - he needs predictable jokes, with even more predictable reactions from laughter, scare boring, unimaginable narrative lines narcotic narcotic drug, leaving me physically sick or in deep sleep more like a coma. But it can be for some time, because it gives the average American personality to which they can really identify. A "regular" guy like you and me. I live in the southern United States, so for me this show is just the opposite of escapism. Here, this disgusting figure is everywhere, in some form or different. Seeing him on television is a brutal exaggeration.
