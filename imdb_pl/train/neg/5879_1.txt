I wonder how the actors acted in this film. Annette Bening was really herself, half and half, was she pretending she was natural? It did not matter, considering that even if it walked on the ceiling, it would not change the design of the movie. Brian Cox worked really well. I almost thought that he always behaved in this way, crafty, dishonest, in a dirty environment where nobody cared about hygiene. As for Gwyneth Paltrow, the question is what he's doing in this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is quite disgusting and disgusting. Who would pay to see such shit?
