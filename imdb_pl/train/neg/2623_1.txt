Sly Stallone is not the best actor in the world, but compared to his brother, Frank ... well, now give away those prizes! Mullet with hair, muppet Frank seems to think that every part of him requires him to be a refugee of the American-Italian Wise-guy from "The Godfather". Please, let somebody give him an acting offer "he can refuse!" This movie just stinks the place, even by terribly worrying about it, Frank still steals acting disgraces. All people compensate for their lack of talent, shouting their words and throwing their arms around, gesticulating wildly in a style that has gone out of fashion with silent movies. <br /> <br /> The plot, whatever it is, does not make sense when the meteor lands and turns all the women into crazed sex nymphets, but because it is a 15-certified film, it means they undress to underwear and they make the moans sound like dogs on fire. What's going on at last, I'm not entirely sure, because I lost my will to live long before the movie was finished. <br /> <br /> Avoid this as a plague and watch "Deep Impact" on a sensational movie about a meteorite hit the ground. <br /> <br /> Note Order: when one of the women runs underwear belts, she has panties / underpants under suspenders / garter belt, panties over suspenders so that women can go to the toilet with less confusion. It may be a trivial point, but it shows how stupid this movie is when it can not even do it!
