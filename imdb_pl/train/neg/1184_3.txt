this movie had a pretty good story, but the pasta was very slow ... very slow. even if someone thinks it's a classic, I think there are a lot of better movies from that era to watch. <br /> <br /> the pictures are not perfect, but not the worst. the sounds are OK. lighting OK. <br /> <br /> I would still not recommend it to anyone other than the student of the film. <br /> <br /> the movie does not contain music, and the horses who have sex do it too. and the woman masturbating on the edge of the bed was stupid. <br /> <br /> here no wins, skip this total boredom. I believed it was worse, but it's only a waste of time and I do not have good reviews here. particularly high marks ...
