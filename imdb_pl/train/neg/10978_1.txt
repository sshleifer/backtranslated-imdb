Usually, when a movie gets one vote, it's because someone just does not like it and is annoyed that there is no lower rating, so he decides to drag it down as much as he can, instead of just giving him a low rating. In this case, it is not. <br /> <br /> Bonesetter is a great example of the 0/10 movie. Nothing is doing well and there is no chance, because it really is not trying to do anything. There are threads of a bad novel D & D story that is not connected to each other and a complete lack of any action. It is obvious that no one who was involved in this project made any serious effort, because even a completely unskilled person would work harder. A really awful movie.
