The version of the movie I saw was entitled "Horror rises from the grave." The horror in question is a wicked medieval magician played by the legend of the Spanish horror of Paul Naschy, who looks like he was playing in the Abanazer at the panto church. He gets up from the grave when a stupid descendant (I think he is a descendant, as well as played in Naschy) returns to his home and reconnects the head and body of the magician, who were separated by sorcerers who killed him, try to stop him, er, getting up from the tomb. <br /> <br /> Of course, when the head and body come back together, hell breaks loose and many people die. Like all good magicians, Abanazer has a lovely assistant here. This one is played by another Spanish horror movie, the beautiful Helga line. As practically every other woman in the movie, the Line periodically downloads her set. There are a lot of nudity in the film, not just a female - we can even see Nascha's stomach, which is not a nice view, I can tell you. Most of the sex angle in the movie is ridiculously unjustified. There is one particularly funny scene in which Naschy and Line discuss their evil plans, and then suddenly decide to embrace the young blonde they have. <br /> <br /> In some places it is also quite bloody - especially the Herschell Gordon Lewis-esquire moment in which Line submerges his hands in the man's chest to remove his heart. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie are pretty effective zombies that appear late. However, they are quickly frightened by the fire and do not bother back. Detriment. The scene in which the zombies are created is however the most absurdly inept movie moment. Everything happens in the long run, and we really have no idea what's going on until we see how some characters move from a distance. There are several such junk moments, mainly due to poor editing. When a worker falls into the hypnotic spell of Nasch's head, a large close-up of his face appears, which seems to last forever and serves no purpose. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is not a great horror movie, but quite entertaining. Of course, the version I saw was a dubbed version of the American that probably was cut into pieces. As far as I know, the original Spanish version can be a masterpiece ...
