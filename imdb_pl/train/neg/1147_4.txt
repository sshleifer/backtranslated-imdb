This film belongs to the history of F.B.I. because Knott's Berry Farm is in the old west. The shamelessly purified version of the Federal Bureau of Investigation fights crime. Hoover's heavy hand (did he have any other?) He shows all the time with teeve actors to read scenarios, bad sets, cheap sound effects and lighting 101. With Jimmy Stewart in 20% of the dramatic capacity, Vera Miles chews on the scenery, the movie depicts everybody -lister known in the mid-fifties with a bit of irony and humor, from the "Amazonian jungle" to "barbecue in the yard", everything smells of sound scenes and back parties. Even the shots are preserved and familiar. I imagine that Mervyn Leroy was getting drunk every night. With the exception of a few (very few) interesting outdoor shots, nothing but a note.
