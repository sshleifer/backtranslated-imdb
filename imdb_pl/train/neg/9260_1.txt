The only combination of this movie with horror lies in the fact that it is terribly non-binding. I'd rather have my finger stuck in a rusty nail than sit back again. Even for a television film it is flat. The cast is boring. The script is as exciting as a bowl of sand. How the two directors conspired to create such a movie will remain one of the great mysteries of the 20th century. There is only one scene that even slightly deserves to be included in the Omen series, and is filmed indefinitely and shortened in the expected time. If you want to see it, insert it, set the alarm clock for 90 minutes and feel comfortable. With a bit of luck you will take a quick nap and the alarm will wake you up when the worst is over. Namely, this movie.
