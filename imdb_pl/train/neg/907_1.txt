I wrote a review of the movie after buying it on DVD and being very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I tried to watch it after reading some comments since then. Being a film student and making similar films with the budget (ie No budget, shot on digi cam), I support my original comments. This is not a student budget project (not particularly good), released on a video / DVD to make it look like an award-winning movie (if you read the cover). So deceive the public that this is something that is not there. I want to get my money back under the act of describing the transaction! Complete garbage!
