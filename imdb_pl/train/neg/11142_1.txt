This is absolutely the worst piece of shit I've ever had to watch - it was actually so bad that I just had to watch it :-) <br /> <br /> CGI is very angry that it's cool! It's not even close to shit CGI animations in Spawn, that's bad, har har har ... <br /> <br /> I'm amazed that some distribution companies have actually spent the money on DVD, but I think that this way they will gain more money because the cost of their execution could not be more than several hundred dollars. <br /> <br /> It's terrible that the kindergarten class could do it. <br /> <br /> See and laugh!
