Like a relative who gives you a bad gift, Soul Survivors has his heart in the right place, but he sets off with a bad performance. Stephen Carpenter's effort in the field of writing / direction is freely borrowed from other, better films such as "Jacob's Ladder" and "Abre Los Ojos" ("Open Your Eyes"). For those who have not seen any of these films, I will not give this assumption; Suffice it to say that it is not as well served here as in these two great films. <br /> <br /> Melissa Sagemiller stars as Cassie, who will soon go to college. Her current boyfriend, Sean (Ben Affleck) and former boy Matt (Wes Bentley), both friends, and Annabel (hot Eliza Dushku) are in a car accident after being hunted by two killers (?) In transparent masks. She is experiencing a wreck, but while attending college she has visions of the hospital, trials and dead people who appear again and disappear, leaving her in a state of complete confusion: who is dead? Who lives What is real? <br /> <br /> Soul Survivors looks bad, filled with blood, stained with blood, using the body of a teenager. It is true that it has its share in the scenes of persecuting the killers-victims (abundant, repetitive and paralyzing mind), but at least trying to build tension through ideas, not cliches, unfortunately, rather unsuccessfully. This causes confusion much more often than coherence, because the story becomes confused, chaotic and inconsistent near key puzzles (predictable, how is it.) <br /> <br /> Fans of horrors who raise a copy will not have the clue they are in the movie who is more concerned about building a restless facade of reality than providing the number of bodies. Credit goes to Carpenter for trying to create something beyond the horror of teenagers; It is a pity that he created a derivative of a psychological thriller. Sagemiller also deserves recognition for showing strength in the central performance, actually developing its character and evoking some emotions as Cassie unraveled. It's great that the filmmakers try something different, but the film ends with a mixed bag and an unsuccessful experiment. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
