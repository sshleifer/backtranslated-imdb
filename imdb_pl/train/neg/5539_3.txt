Wimpy stuffed shirt Armand Louque (brazenly played by a character veteran, actor Dean Jagger in a rare main role) joins a group of researchers who want to find and destroy the secret technique of creating zombies. Armand falls in love with the charming Claire Duval (who attracts blonde Dorothy Stone) who uses meek juice to get her friend Armand Clifford Grayson (hopelessly wooden Robert Noland). Furious because of being abused and rejected by Claire, Armand uses his knowledge of voodoo to take revenge. Sounds exciting? Well, definitely not. First of all, the static (not) direction of Victor Halperin allows meandering and uncompromising story from the borderline of the speech in an incredibly slow pace. What is worse, Halperin fails to bring tension, atmosphere and momentum to terrifyingly boring conduct. Usually, a bla working from a stupid cast does not help; only George Cleveland as abundant general Duval and E. Alyn Warren as upset Dr. Trevissant manages to revive a little thanks to their welcome and refreshing histrionics. The amazing result of the film library, painfully obvious stage sets and raw pictures are also poor and not very impressive. In fact, this weak excuse about the horror is so nasty that even the invaluable, stern eyes of the great Bela Lugosi can not alleviate the paralyzing boredom. Not a blunt dud.
