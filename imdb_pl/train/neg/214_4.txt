Given that this movie had a serious and quite successful startup campaign, I would expect something worthy of fuzz ... from the initial scene (in which the two brothers "sensuously" caress each other, lying naked in bed) goes quickly down ... nothing to attract attention, not something that attracts attention throughout the story, baaad baad acting (a few minor exceptions, but artificiality is the best). Incest and lesbianism are promising topics, but the script does not thoroughly analyze any of the two (the mind that the possible excuse of the creators, saying that their goal was a subtle film, would be fun, unless subtle and superficial means the same ...). Too interesting viewers will not get any interesting scene ... at this point they could save a part of the movie ... so you can imagine how bad it is. You could say a lot of other things ... but please, look at the movie ... I am an egoist and I would like to waste as much as 1 1/2 hours of life ... like me :(
