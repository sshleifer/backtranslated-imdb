I go to many movies, I often bring my 5-year-old son, I'm glad I did not bring him to this. There are many references to sex and a skinny submerging scene, but this is not the main reason why I would not like to take it. Trailers lead to the belief that it is a light comedy; however, practically all the funny moments are in the announcements. I waited for him to become interesting, funny or serious; however, I almost fell asleep when the story unfolded without a story. I understand that dogs can be great company, as was said, the whole story focused on a poorly behaving dog, whose owners were not experienced enough to train. If a man caused so much damage and chaos, that person would be forbidden. The worst movie I've ever seen with Jenifer Aniston or Owen Wilson, wasting their talent. The best way to summarize this movie is that the couple gets an unruly dog, the couple falls in love with the dog, the dog dies, the sad couple. End.
