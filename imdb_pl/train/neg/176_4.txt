<br /> <br /> I saw it on the Sci-Fi channel. It appeared just after the first. For some reason this movie interested me. I do not know why, stop asking. <br /> <br /> --- SPOILERS --- Okay ... It was bad when this guy got involved in making the movie. In the first movie, he had a "reason" to kill people, but in this sequel, half the killings / homicide attempts were essentially without reason. Stanley killed the director because of the creative differences, he caught the co-creator because of the creative differences, but what about the attempt to kill the cast? No cast, no movie. He wanted it to "look real when they die"? If it was supposed to be a movie with such a high budget, use special effects, MAN. Of course, as in the case of the first, the captured girl escapes, and Stanley ends in collapse and disappears. Woooooow (sarcasm). This film's HAD potential. And the saddest thing of all ... a really sad part ... I would watch "Cabin on Lake 3". Just because I like Judd Nelson, and he's the only good part of this sequel.
