I knew that my summary would get you. How does this movie look like Pet Rock and Disco ?! If you have not survived the seventies or eighties, you probably can not understand why someone would like to have a new cola or have pet rock (and honestly, at least for pet rock, I still do not understand it completely). These are just a few things that seemed to make sense at the time, but the younger generation is really surprising. The same can be said about Kay Kyser and his team. At that time (mainly in the 1940s) they were very popular and had enough punching power that the studio played them with Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre in this film. If, however, you did not live at that time (it was already well before my time), you are wondering why someone likes this kind of "entertainment". In the end, Kyser and his teammates are incredibly disgusted, and their humor is very, very wide (i.e., unsophisticated and trashy). Honestly, I could not stand their pranks or appreciate the fact that there were too many musical numbers in the film. Due to these factors, a great cast received a seat in the back, and fans of these actors will probably be disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film includes Kyser and a band coming to the residence, where the young lady and her crazy aunt live. There the bridge is washed away and strange events begin. Finally, it ends with several attempts to live and Sally's screenings. It's all about laughing - and it's not really a horror movie despite casting. <br /> <br /> In general, this is good entertainment at best. As a fan of Lugosi and Karloff, I felt cheated when I had to watch Kyser and his dicks.
