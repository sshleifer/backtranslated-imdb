I saw the last Woody Allen movie because I'm a fan of his work and I try to see everything he does, although the reviews of the movie made me expect a disappointing effort. They were right. It is a confused film that can not decide whether it wants to be a comedy, a romantic fantasy or a drama about the middle-aged women's crisis. It fails. <br /> <br /> Alice (Mia Farrow) is a restless middle-aged woman who has married great wealth and leads a life of pointless luxury with her rather boring husband and two young children. This fairly mundane concept of the plot is revived with such incredible credibility as an old Chinese folk healer who makes her invisible with the help of magical herbs and the spirit of the former lover (with whom he flies over Manhattan). If these supplements sound too fantastic for you, how about something more prosaic, like an affair with a saxophonist? <br /> <br /> I've never been sure what mixed confusion was trying to say. There are only a handful of really funny moments in the film, and the ending is Pollyanna's really preposterous accent. <br /> <br /> Instead of renting "Crimes and Misdemeanors", a brilliantly made movie that combines a comedy with a serious consideration of ethics and morality. Or return to "Annie Hall" or "Manhattan."
