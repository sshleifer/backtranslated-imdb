It's two, because I liked it as a child, but it became so unnecessary that I started to hate it ... I can not give this descriptive review, because it would be a repetition of one thing after another, I probably would not say anything that others they did not say anymore. <br /> <br /> The only other thing about this concert is that it's pretty nasty, with a kid with the clamor of this twisted babysitter who runs about it. I have a cousin who loves this show, and he is the strangest and stupidest person I've ever met. This performance should be drawn from the air. It's always the same thing over and over ... They have to show Nick better shows. I am really very tired of such things.
