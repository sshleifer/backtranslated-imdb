I only lasted 15 minutes before the self-preservation pulled me out of the empty, salivating dullness that this film effortlessly caused and pushed me back to the video store armed with a bear. <br /> <br /> Say that the movie would be a badly missed opportunity to use words interspersed with characters from the top keys on my keyboard (just to make these comments clean). <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br />
