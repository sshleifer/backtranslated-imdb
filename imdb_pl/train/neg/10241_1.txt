It is an incomprehensible, terribly low budget piece of horror. <br /> <br /> I do not even have a vocabulary to say how horrible, turbulent, boring, tangled and just weird that this effort is (Hey, what do you know that I ...) Set in post- apocalyptic America some guys meet on the beach, which causes slaughter and chaos - everything was so incomprehensible that I could not make a head or tail of any of them. <br /> <br /> Seriously, as it was picked up by National Lampoon, it completely overcomes me: it's really awful. <br /> <br /> And it's not so bad that it's a good cult style. <br /> <br /> It's just terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible. <br /> <br /> Honestly. If you still do not believe me, watch her with every intention of loving, then come back here and tell me what you think. Even gerbils on acid could not understand that. <br /> <br /> Avoid or destroy even better ...
