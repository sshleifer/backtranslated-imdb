I really can not understand how someone could give this disgusting movie more than one star ... How can you like such a delayed movie in which all the scenes of animal use are real? I do not even want to imagine the tearing pain these innocent and defenseless living beings have felt in these terrifying moments ... Jesus ... What kind of "human" would torture them in this way for no reason or just for money? I'm telling you, this director is either mentally retarded or just a monster with a "heart" of stone. Or both. He really deserves to cut off and burn his hands alive. <br /> <br /> Contains a variety of horribly barbaric scenes that can cause shock, especially for sensitive people and children: a real frog is skinned alive, the fish are sadistically maimed and thrown back into the water, the dog is beaten, the birds are thrown do wody ... <br /> <br /> This movie is more than horrible; it must be the worst and most delayed movie ever made, along with another, called "Cannibal Holocaust" or something similar. I will never watch or buy any film directed by this soulless monster. No one should waste time watching it, especially when there are many REAL great films in which all scenes of animal use are exhibited. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, only a few people liked it - which is natural because it is the worst movie in history - so it was not a success. I hope it will make the delayed director realize that such unwarranted barbaric acts of extreme cruelty and violence against REAL animals will NEVER be praised and that he will put up all the scenes of using animals in his next films. I really believe that everyone receives, but what they give! There will be a day when all the delayed and cruel "people" will feel the same pain that they once inflicted on others. <br /> <br /> This is probably my only "negative" review. I usually do not comment on the movie if I do not like it, but this time I could not close. I had to tell the truth, because the abuse of animals must end!
