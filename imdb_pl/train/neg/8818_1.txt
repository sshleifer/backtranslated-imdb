Stupid and just a strange movie about a child who is traumatized when he finds out that Santa is not real (???). He grows up and becomes an adult (Brandon Maggart) who makes lists of naughty or nice people. One Christmas surprises and sets off to kill naughty people - of course dressed up as Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> A boring and simply bad movie about the deadly Santa. If you're looking for gore, he's not here. Only a few murders have been shown and they are not so bloody with VERY false effects. Most of the movie contains Brandon Maggart, who speaks to himself and slowly goes crazy. The screenplay is trivial, the acting is terrible and leads to the ending, which made me stare at the TV with my mouth open. Seriously, I had to rewind the tape and watch it again to make sure I do not have hallucinations! I really REALLY have a bad ending. <br /> <br /> If you want a terrifying Christmas flick, rent a "Black Christmas" (original version from the 70's --- NOT a terrible remake). Avoid this at all costs.
