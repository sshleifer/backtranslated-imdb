At the very beginning, after finding out that outlaw John Dillinger (Warren Oates) is an egomaniac violator, another thug from the 1930s is trapped in a farm house surrounded by the FBI. The second of Melvin Purvis (Ben Johnson), investigates the situation, puts a lit cigar in his mouth, picks up two loaded caliber 45 machines and goes alone to a distant home. Bang bang bang. Purvis emerges from home alone, carrying a woman hostage, the unfortunate dead. Everything in a long shot. <br /> <br /> If you're fascinated by stories like Red Riding Hood, then it should be very attractive. <br /> <br /> Oh, it's as exciting as mindless. Pretty Boy Floyd dramatically copes with his fall. Multiple violations of the civic code. Many shooters with Tommy's pistols and guns. Blood all over. <br /> <br /> As history stinks. Few remember Melvin Purvis as an FBI hero, partly, I think, because of his name. Melvin PURVIS? We all remember J. Edgar Hoover, who dismissed Melvin Purvis because he was a rival in the pursuit of public attention. <br /> <br /> The picture was written and directed by John Milius. He is the guy who wrote in the contract that in the case of shooting and killing any animals during one of his production, he should be a designated shooter. Milius is a guy, a freak who had Teddy Roosevelt's warlike riders in the Spanish-American war, shouting quotes from Henry V - "Holy Cross Day" and so on. and complete garbage. "I knew I would never take him alive, and I did not try too hard." I mean, kill them all and let God put them in order. <br /> <br /> You'll just love it.
