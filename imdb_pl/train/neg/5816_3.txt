With critical acclaim, I expected more from this film and from Tamara Jenkins. History just spun around and did not seem to make sense or conspiracy. It is hard for me to believe that a 14-year-old girl (mature for her age or not) would be so worried that she would lose her virginity "with her". Maybe I'm too young for relationships (I was four years old in 1976), But I did not have any problems connecting to Shakespeare's stories in love or Life is beautiful and I was dead for none of these settings. The cast is very good, but unfortunately the script did not let them involve the audience. In general, the Slums had their moments, but if you do not want to mention halters and socks, I would say that you skip this one.
