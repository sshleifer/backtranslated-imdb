Apparently, many people really like it, but I found it to be an infantile and quite offensive Wallop code, saved from oblivion by Jane Russell and a few unforgettable music numbers, especially the opener (but in the later period there was a clear drop in the invention). I can not deal with Monroe - she should play a stupid blonde who is not so stupid, but she is just stupid. Russell is unable to convince when she claims she has never been in middle school, but otherwise is rather great. Men are stunningly uninteresting, as is the conspiracy. In any case, it is not terrible, but so uneven that if it's a classic, God help us all.
