The DVD version consists of 2 episodes and the turning point is Caesar. In addition, the language was Spanish without subtitles. That is why it is difficult for me to look through this film in depth because I did not understand what was said. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra is a historical icon, some are very difficult and I discovered that for novice, Leonor Varela simply plays well. He is a strong will, but also a very supportive, affectionate soul mate. Thimothy Dalton as Caesar is perfect, and their romance is the most important in the first episode. So it is not a document or a peplum, but a great love story. <br /> <br /> After the paricide comes a new lover (Marc-Antoine), but the taste is gone: we always remember our first love. So I found the second episode boring, and their tragic fate is not well known. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the production is luxurious: the sets are large, tastefully decorated; Moroccan location live exotic and wonderful wardrobes. Producers certainly have a lot of money, but they do not spend on special effects. They are so poor (blue screens, ships, Sphinx) that is fun. <br /> <br /> At the end I would love to hear it in French or English to get a definitive opinion on these two films.
