Terrifyingly senseless and worse, a boring movie. Stranger Than Fiction has nothing new to say about anything, no heroes going beyond the most unimaginable stereotypes and is based on a clumsy central concept that is neither specifically original nor treated in a way that is not very innovative. <br /> <br /> Will Ferrell is totally wasted on what he probably hoped would be his response to Jim Carey's Truman Show, and replaces his usual screaming routine (though very funny if you reject Talledega Nights) for Well, actually nothing. <br /> <br /> Emma Thompson is just a bit annoying (some of the reviews I read here tell about the Oscar nomination, it's ridiculous), while Maggie Gyllenhaal does a satisfactory job with a very weak script that allows nothing but establishing her character as a former law student who left Harvard to become a baker because she liked to make people happy. Please. The fact that she ended up with Ferrell's "character" is completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Marc Forster's attempts to revive the film using computer graphics serve only to emphasize what is not inspired by the material with which he must work. <Br> <br /> I could either watch Prestige for the third time or watch it. It is a pity that I did not decide on The Prestige.
