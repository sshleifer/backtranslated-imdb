he wonders how this movie was made. I watched him when I worked at home, writing e-mails and answering the phone - I watched it ONLY because I hoped that part of the "revenge" would be good. Needless to say, revenge and enforced twists were not worth the e-mails you were watching. in fact, I'm not even sure what happened at the end. the action was as bad as the scenarios of the FBI Files screening - definitely the worst reconstructions (actually only "Arrest and Trial" can be just as bad when playing). I did not even know that the leading man was in the Third Eye Blind until I watched the movie here on IMDb, but it's obvious why he has not made any movies since then. I hope he is a good singer.
