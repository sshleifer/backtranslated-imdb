Yes, I saw heavy cuts. Unedited sex scenes. Creepy scenes. Almost on a par with "The Need" movie for terrible acting. This movie is as bad as bad movies. Bad scenario, bad acting, bad effects, bad locations, bad tricks, everything wrong. The best "actors" in the film were dancers on their knees, whom they rented for vampire extras! <br /> <br /> Sean Harry, "foppish actor", as someone else put it, makes the match look talented here. His incredible ability to drive the car improperly when it is clearly shaken by people on the hood (check the reflection on the windshield), his inability to turn left, which is a class. OH and do not forget about the sex scene. plus his remarkable use of a toy gun, which guys could not even dress up as real guns. Other actors on the screen could barely deliver their lines. It was like half the time was waiting for a line that was not there! <br /> <br /> The "special effects" were so good in the sense that the guys who did this took their real names from credits! <br /> <br /> If you want to have a good laugh at the party and then rent this movie ... then there are plenty of good comedies that are just as fun and do not give money to people who do not deserve it.
