The endless craze of clever visual irony does not necessarily create an engaging movie. Half of the movie "Blonde wig" never took off because of the creators' over-indulgence. <br /> <br /> Half Wong Faye (with a very funny one, if Karen Carpenter is watching, Faye Wong) has much more charm. All the ingredients are there, but the element of the story about the girl meeting the boy takes a back seat for artistic cunning. Character development is uneven. Emotions are missing. <br /> <br /> For music lovers "Mung Jung Yun" Wong Faye (Cantonese version of the hit "Å»urawina") is effectively used in Chungking Express. Faye Wong also recorded the version in Mandarin "Zhen Tuo". Both are on CD, although only "Mung Jung Yun" is on the official soundtrack for the movie.
