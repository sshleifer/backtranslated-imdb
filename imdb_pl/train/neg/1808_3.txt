In his film from 1966, "Blow Up" Antonioni had his heroine with the truth against the background of British youth protesters. By setting such questions on the background of hippie youth movements, Antonioni intentionally or not, questioned the effectiveness of these organizations. How can you fight for a case when what you think is real can be a lie? On the other hand, the film says that we must fight and actively question what we see because others can deceive us with false images and false truths. Although the hippie aspects were the most difficult parts of "Blow Up", they created a nice texture and gave the film more meaning than it could have otherwise. It was a very scared and mature video. <br /> <br /> From "Zabriskie Point", Antonioni throws out all ambiguities and subtleties of "Blow Up" and goes fully hippie. The result is a film flooded with bad metaphors, stupid ideas and hard stories. Like someone who showed such restraint and intelligence in his career, could he do something so stupid? <br /> <br /> The film begins with a nice series of close-ups, observing a group of radicals discussing the significance of the revolution. Suddenly, one man (Mark) gets up and leaves. He hates the stiff and orderly nature of the revolution. He acknowledges that although revolutionaries are fighting for freedom, being tied to such a belligerent cause is an effective commitment to freedom. Like Jack Nicholson in The Passenger, Mark wants to be free. <br /> <br /> As such, Mark buys a gun and goes solo. He accepts orders from anyone. When the police attack his university campus, Mark shoots at the guy and runs away. Then he escapes to the nearby airport, steals a small private plane and flies into the desert. Antonioni treats the desert as a peaceful utopia and contrasts it with ruthlessly capitalist cities, with their billboards and empty modern devices. He considers the desert a kind of garden of Eden. <br /> <br /> In the desert, Mark meets Daria and falls in love quickly. Antonioni gives us a funny sex scene in which hundreds of hippies have sex on the sand. Freed from the limitations of modern life, these tree hugs and student radicals can now celebrate their individuality by jumping in the sun. <br /> <br /> The movie ends when Marek dies, and Daria fantasizes about blowing up the mansion and the dignity of the homes of the wealthy capitalists who killed him. This is Antonioni's challenge to his audience. Pick up your weapons, pickets and explosives, he says. Break the walls before they pull you in! <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie did not affect the audience. They recognized that "Zabriskie Point" is another, self-centered, commercial attempt to be radical. Kind of radical radicalism. I felt unreal and tame. <br /> <br /> Thematic movie is quite stupid. Antonioni basically says that if you are dissatisfied with the modern world, and the thick cats that use you, you should either flee to the desert (Mark) or actively fight the system (Daria). That's all good and good. But even though artists constantly warn us against such dystopian nightmares, they are unable to show us how to effectively manage change. Like the end of the Fight Club, nihilism and violence do not give anything. In the real world, social changes are usually initiated by humble inventors, stimulated by small technological advances. I mean, what triggered women more than contraceptives? <br /> <br /> 3/10 - A very bad movie. The problem is that Antonioni does not really believe in rebellion. He is a quiet and contemplative man. An introvert who seems to have made an extroverted movie to gain more worship from the counter-culture that adopted his earlier film, "Blow Up." As such, "Zabrinskie Point" is a very pretentious and stupid movie. Essentially, a 50-year-old man says: "Look at me, I'm a daring rebel!" <br /> <br /> There are many movies where the audience is encouraged to fight the "system", but all fall into one of four categories. In the first category you have movies such as "Network", "Cool Hand Luke", "Cuckoo's Nest" and "Spartacus". All this shows that the life of freedom fighters is unsuccessful, although in each case the "spirit of the revolution" will survive. The message is that you can not change, but if you die or not, the optimistic concept of change will survive through martyrdom. Basically, we must continue to fail, instead of giving up hope. <br /> <br /> Then you have movies like "Fight Club", "Zabriskie Point" and "Falling Down", which just encourage an explosion. Destroy all this. Blow it all out. Everything is a lie, so you might as well shoot firearms. These films arise rather from angry, reactionary feelings than from any common sense. <br /> <br /> Then you have the category "run instead of fighting". Terrence Malick and Antonioni are the masters of this genre. Films such as "Passenger", "Red Desert" and "Badlands" show human beings fleeing worlds they do not like, and forge islands or peaceful havens. Both directors are pessimists, including Malick has destroyed islands, and Antonioni has his islands without any sense of happiness or solution. <br /> <br /> Then you have the fourth category. Films such as Donnersmarck's "The Lives of Others", Ashby's "Bound For Glory" and Kubrick's "Mechanical Orange" treat artists as a force of change and rebellion. In these dystopian worlds, where everyone is satisfied with being a slave of the state, the unrestrained creativity and free will of the artist / criminal keeps the system in check. Simply existing outside the herd, you create waves. Your comments, actions and criticism undermine the status quo. As such, Donnersmarck's film has novelists and artists undermining Nazi Germany, while Kubrick has an artist / criminal from Nazi struggling with Nazi claws, painting the city with blood and sperm.
