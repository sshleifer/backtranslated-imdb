I thought the movie was OK, but very disappointed that they did not capture the real picture of his life. I expected so much that his mother would be a real Jamaica, that it drives me crazy. Just watching the beginning of the movie told me that the film is not accurate. Which completely lost interest just a few seconds from the beginning of the movie. I am very disappointed, just like watching the biography of Mark Antoni and playing the role of Arnold. I do not know what the writer thought, longing for a valuable piece of the film, which I am sure that his mother played a great role in his life. I will say that the movie was ok except the main Fla !!!!!!
