When you see Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi as a co-star, you expect to find a well-made horror movie, but in reality it was completely different, representing what I described as an early effort in science fiction. Karloff and Lugosi are playing scientists (Rukh and Benet respectively) - competitors to some extent, until Rukh wins the Benet demonstration that proves his great theory. Science here was - to put it mildly - a bit rough on the edges (and therefore science fiction, with an emphasis on fiction), but somehow Rukh uses some kind of Andromeda ray that lets him look at the ground "several thousand million years ago." In this historical huge Africa has hit Africa, leaving the substance, which scientists call "Radem X" - which can heal and destroy, much of the film is quite tedious in Africa, looking for the meteorites that Rukh finally finds and the harness to create a great <br /> <br /> Karloff and Lugosi were quite good here, Lugosi played a role in which he is a good guy, but honestly I think he's a bit unconvincing - especially during the scenes taking place in Africa. This story also deepened somewhat and though it attracted mine attention, she did not take me in. Given that this is really science fiction, not horror, and science fiction was at a very early stage, I suppose that the movie has to be cut out a little loose. It was OK - nothing more, but nothing more. 4/10
