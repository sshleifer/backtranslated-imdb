This movie was very promising and the story was quite interesting, but the actors, the director and the filmmakers have released the film seriously. <br /> <br /> I feel bad because of the writers, it could have been good. Acting is wooden, only a few characters are trustworthy. <br /> <br /> Who ever edited it, just learned new editing techniques and wanted to spill them all over the movie. There are many quick "flashy" changes in almost every scene that are meant to be symbolic, but simply end up as annoying. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this movie and expected a decent resolution to break the balance, but unfortunately, left me feeling that I wasted my time, and the creators of the film wasted their money.
