While some performances were good - Victoria Rowell, Adrienne Barbeau and two Italian girls come to mind - the story was bad and derivative, the emphasis on the girl's racial origins was at best clumsily treated, and the relatives were mostly portrayed as stereotypes, not real people. In many moments that were to be fun, I felt uncomfortable. It's hard for me to understand why the local SF newspaper said it was a good movie and I wonder WHO published a great review here at IMDb. Very disappointed with this movie and angry that I actually went to the theater to see it, based on a faulty connection to Garden State, which is much more fun, more ingenious and poignant than this movie. I must specifically mention the emotional culmination in the church, which was so wooden and numerical that I almost left, and some in the audience actually UNDERSTANDED. After that there was a stupid climax in the cemetery, which I saw 10 minutes before his appearance. I really do not like being misled to spend my money so useless.
