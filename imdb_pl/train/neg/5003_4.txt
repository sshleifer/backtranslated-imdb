I am ashamed that I am writing this review. I say this because those of you who read this will know that I have been sitting through the whole thing and that it is embarrassing to admit even strangers. But I had to warn those who read the viewer's comments on IMDb before watching the movie, not watching it. At least I can do it. It's a bad movie! Trust me. The story is silly. Acting is amateurish. And directing, working with a camera, sets, costumes, etc. They're in the second place. Let it go.
