I've been a big fan of Lynn Peterson since her groundbreaking performance in the 1988 hit Far North, and though I loved her in her other movie, Slow (2004), in which she plays Francis, it's far away from her strongest role. <br/> <br /> Lynn, as you all know (or should), plays the key role of the "driver". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, other than the amazing Lynn performance, I'm afraid that this movie really does not matter much. <br /> <br /> Oh, wait - there was one more thing - incredible creative creativity to remove vulgarity for TV viewers. Memorable lines such as: "You son-of-a-gun!", "You-of-a-witch!", "Shoot!" And "Well, Forget You!" <br /> <br /> O.K. Bye. <br /> <br /> P.. Does anyone know where I can get another Lynn Peterson poster?
