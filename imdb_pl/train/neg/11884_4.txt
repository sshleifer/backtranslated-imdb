The biggest joke in the world. The world's largest, most exclusive joke inside. <br /> <br /> Emulating the bold and 'everyman' humor of the office space, this film drives the attractiveness of the film in the ground, making humor such that it would only be appreciated by legal secretaries writing books. The audience is asked to take on the unknown role of the legal secretary, and then to become a terribly stupid hero. <br /> <br /> The whole film focuses on the legal secretary who finds free time, listening to music and writing a novel at work. These are his goals. You can not imagine that a blow to the face is for the public when (halfway) they find out that he has a job that fits all three criteria, but then he gives up! The director and screenwriter (Jacob Kornbluth and Josh Kornbluth) completely remove the audience's motivation for empathy, and even finding the entertainment of the protagonist who previously threw out what complains about his lack. <br /> <br /> In addition, the main obstacle is that the secretary's legal secret fails because each time they must be explained to the public. Without them, the audience would not notice anything particularly strange. Humor is only effective if you do not have to explain it to the audience, which is fun.
