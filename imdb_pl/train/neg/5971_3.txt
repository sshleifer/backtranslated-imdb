I was told that I was watching this movie by a friend who talked about what a lovely story. <br /> <br /> Foo. <br /> <br /> I want to have two hours back, how could I have done a lot more productive things to my time ... like, for example, shooting with thumbs. I do not see anything that could bring tangible benefits in this film, with the exception of the sweet aspect ... <br /> <br /> 3/10 (and this is generous)
