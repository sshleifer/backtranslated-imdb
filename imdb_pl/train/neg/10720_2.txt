I saw this movie last weekend and is stupid and mindless. An ancient curse turns a man into a mummy in pajamas? Victims are scared senseless and can not escape a slow-moving old man. They throw torches and tremble, instead of trying to push him away or, duh, burn him. Quentin alias Mr. Fabersham from Honeymooners is married to Diane Brewster with the pseudonym Miss Canfield from Leave it to Beaver fame who is unhappy in marriage. Wow, love plot. The rest of the cast follow her in the tombs and wait for the screams to react and help them. The Egyptian girl does not look bad, but she does not borrow much for this film. Where is the mummy? Really only the curse is released. This does not stop Universal Mummy movies in any way. Watch this movie if you need sleep because you dose your dose.
