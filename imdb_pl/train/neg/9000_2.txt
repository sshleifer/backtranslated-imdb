When I rented it, I hoped that "Reign of Fire" would not bring: a clash between modern technology and mythical beasts. <br /> <br /> Instead I got a standard "monster hunting for stupid people in a remote building". with bad script, bad music, bad effects, bad plot, bad acting. Bad, bad, bad. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave him 2 was that theoretically there could be worse films. In theory.....
