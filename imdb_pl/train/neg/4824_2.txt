I wanted to like this movie, but many elements ruined it. The use of a fisheye lens and intermittent editing did not give me the feeling of being in the world of the finish head, but it made me think I was watching MTV for a few short moments. The film never seemed to go anywhere, and acting was really a perfect example of excessive acting. I love movies that give us insight into the seedy world of the underworld, but this movie could not decide if it was a bad horror or even worse serious comment on the horrors of addiction.
