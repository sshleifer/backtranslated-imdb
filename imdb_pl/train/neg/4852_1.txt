I saw this movie once, and I thought it was OK. Then my friends at work said "See it again, it's better". So I did. And to my surprise, it was WORSE for the second time! There's a limit of words, so I'm going to throw the ball here. <br /> <br /> - Bombing scenes were so stupid. Why the hell is there something WAITING to cause an explosion? - None of the characters here is even nice. Not the first time, not even the second. <br /> <br /> -Oh, and the last time I checked, the car does not explode from one shot with a weapon, or fire, which can be extinguished a tiny fire extinguisher ... or more than 3/10 viewers actually watched the movie ?? ? - The camera is so shaky, I can barely say what's going on. This initial scene with the robot put away my stomach, the rest of the movie was not much better. <br /> <br /> - A sniper scene. The McManus brothers (from "The Boondock Saints") were rolling their eyes, it was so stupid. First of all, why did the guy put his gun where someone fired? What more, why would he spend so much time cleaning the bullets, reloading, aiming and NOT firing, when so much chaos happened around him? -SAS RUNNING types instead of staying and fighting ?????? Huh ????? Are the soldiers ... gays ... ??? I did not want to sound homophobic, but to be honest this scene was so absurd. <br /> <br /> - Long for your own good, but too short for the amount of material you put on. Bigelow seems to think that the more shares the better. It seems that he is wrong - the movie is full of unnecessary action scenes that throw in there to distract attention from the lack of a central plot. I know that Watchmen is 163 minutes longer, but at least this movie has not stretched. This movie, on the other hand, does and therefore feels longer. <br /> <br /> The only good thing was Renner, which was at best satisfactory. But do yourself a favor, just skip it and do not give in to the noise.
