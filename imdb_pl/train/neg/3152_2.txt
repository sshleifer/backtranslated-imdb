Poorly constructed, badly written, full of clich√©s and flat dialogue. Not one scene is shining. Actors are struggling with a painfully boring scenario that allows you to completely avoid surprises, twists or conflicts. You know from the first ten minutes where it happens. <br /> <br /> In the case of a movie set in New York, there is almost no feeling for the city. There are a dozen other independent films that make it seem magical with a small budget. This one seems to have been filmed in Toronto. <br /> <br /> If you quit Natasha Henstridge, why put her in loose sweaters? Why does Vartan look boring and colorless? Where is the attraction? I felt like I was watching a Christian movie of the sub-par this week, which was so sexless and moralizing. <br /> <br /> The big success of Steven Feder is that he convinced people to make this bland movie.
