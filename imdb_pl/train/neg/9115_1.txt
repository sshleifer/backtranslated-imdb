If you ask me, the first one was really better. Look at Sarah M. G., she is a real, malicious, cruel girl, look at Amy Adams, she is just a small fool hanging around. She is nothing! People do not love her! Secondly, Sebastian was charming and hot in the first film, now he is "a tiny face". The story is not so good and I do not understand. Why they did not do it first is the beginning. Ugly actors, nothing to tell. This is not cruel, it's a game. The first has better actors, a better story and its importance. I think that music is better in cruel intentions 1, and music is better in cruel intentions 3. This is not the worst movie I've seen, but in compaer with the first one is one big, big, big nothing.
