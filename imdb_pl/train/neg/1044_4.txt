"Raising Victor Vargas" is one of those light, family movies that can be watched and made by N.Y. Times at the same time. And if you want to go to the kitchen for taco and Corona, you do not have to "Pause" a DVD. Just let him roll because you will not miss anything really important. No twists, turns and tensions. This is not an ethnic film, it is a film about a poor, struggling family of immigrants, who by chance is Latinos. They could be any ethnic group. It made a very small difference. I've seen it a whole million times. It is enough to connect a Jewish family, an Italian, black or Irish family. Just accents and names were different. If the Vargas family were called Bush or Clinton and were Presbyterians, the movie would be a complete nap. <br /> <br /> It's funny that critics here could not get a flat straight. Some said it was Spanish Harlem. Some Bronx and other Brooklyn. As a New Yorker for life I vote on the Lower East Side. And it seemed that the family had never met anyone but other Latinos. They lived in an isolated / isolated small enclave. Some interactions with non-Hispanics could have caused some emotion, interest or tension. Do you remember West Side Story? <br /> <br /> And now to often criticized cinematography. I do not know if it was my TV, but all the shots in the rooms looked ORANGE for me. Apt, furniture and faces were ORANGE. What's that supposed to mean? And apt. it looked quite crowded for me. Someone here mentioned that the old pharmacies / tenement houses had very large rooms. Well, maybe 50 years ago. What the owners did was break up one big apt for 2 or 3 very small and squeeze as many immigrants as they could. <br /> <br /> And one more annoying thing ... This is the second family movie that I saw and criticized this week, in which a teenage boy "jerking" appeared. Is this private sexual act necessary for us to watch? Save me! What's up with these directors? <br /> <br /> So "Victor Vargas" is a nice little movie. It was nice to see the change of young Latino actors who had a break and the chance to show their talents. But the writers disappointed them by giving them a flat, non-spectacular scenario for work. Enjoy the show, but keep your fingers close to the "fast forward" button.
