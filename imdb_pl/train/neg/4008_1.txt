As a fan of Sookie Stackhouse books, I think that this series is completely disastrous. Vampire Bill does not look very good and looks much older than described in the book. I discovered that they made wonderfully colorful characters look very natural and vulgar. One of the things that I love about books is that despite all the nonsense that Sookie goes through, she's always a lady, and yet she does not seem to be in the show. Not only that, but prejudices in the TV series are not so widespread in books. I did not expect an exact replica of books, but at least I expected them to be used in the series.
