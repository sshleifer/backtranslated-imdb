I hate this movie. I hate the show. I hate almost everything about it. It's so annoying and stupid. everyone says that nat and alex wolff are heroes in the music world and that they will make a big deal out of it. WHAT TYPE OF DRUGS YOU WILL TAKE ??? !!!?!?!?!?! nat and alex will end up as a hobos or will end up like Jane Hudson with "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?". I could only survive 20 minutes of this, just 30 seconds of the show, and I managed to survive about half an hour of "Battle of the Bands". If anyone could cheer on those guys in the Kid's Choice Awards, I have no idea. A few days before Nick's film premiered, most teenage actresses of Nick's girlfriends (Jamie Spears, Emma Roberts, Lindsey Shaw, etc.) appeared in the ad affecting dead kids about how amazing nat and alex wolff are. firstly, they did not pick me up, and secondly, nat and alex probably either stoned them or paid them a lot of money to say it and convince, because I can not see how anyone could find this program / entertainment movie. the music is just awful. Singing nat sounds like a sick, dying moose on the crack. alex is the most annoying movie / TV character. he's not funny, he's upset, he's really weird and he thinks he's hot and he knows everything about girls. This guy is lucky if he manages to lie down. you know that this program is fake when you find out that some of the characters (in real life) do not even exist !! Jesse is played by cousin Nat and Alex, Jesse Draper (they had to have a budget problem). Their father is not a single, he married Polly Draper, but he does not appear in the series, which makes it appear that the Wolffs are without a mother. Rosalina does not exist either. His name is Allie DiMeco. I will tell you that the Naked Brothers will be in a deep shock **, when their "fans" will learn that the whole action is exposed. 0/10
