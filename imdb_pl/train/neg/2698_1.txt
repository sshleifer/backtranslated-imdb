This movie shows how racist John Singleton is. It presents white and other races that are not black like the evil that exists in our educational system. How quickly he forgets that it is the same educational system that made him what he is and let him fail. The Ice Cube character is the epitome of the inciting black man who was responsible for most of the violence in this film. Singleton barely touched the relationship between the white and black figures who were trying to reach each other. When Omar Epps says, "I must be with my people," this racist remark was loud. And John, do not think for a moment that the picture of Thomas Jefferson in the stairwell of the tower did not pay attention to me. Nice touch!
