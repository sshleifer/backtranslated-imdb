This time we get a psychoanalyst named "Joe Petto" (understand?) That creates live, bad toys that kill people. It's about a family that's unlucky, just living in the same house where he lived with his mutant, the son of the robot "Pino" (again, understand?) <br /> <br /> Easily the worst (and hopefully, that last) in this half of the series, this and the previous look like soft porn movies, but without sex and nakedness. It's a kind of hybrid "Halloween III", "Puppet Master", "Dolls" and bad home movies. Apparently in 2000. They started the sixth chapter of the series, but he was abandoned and never finished. We can all just hope that it will remain ... <br /> <br /> 1/2 stars from **** <br /> <br />
