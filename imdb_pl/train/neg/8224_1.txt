Do you watch this movie? I thought, what a lot of rubbish. These girls must have stones for the brain to agree to participate in it. A waste of time to watch, the cloudy heavens I just rented. Acting was below the standard, and the story was unbearable. Anyone who is considering watching this movie should save money. The film has no credit. I am a real lover of cinema and it is worse than "Attack of the Green Tomatoes". <br /> <br /> I just hope that this piece of rubbish did not cost too much. Money would be better spent on homeless people in the world. I just hope there is no continuation.
