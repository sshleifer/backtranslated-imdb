This movie is horrible. The script is bad, the script is mediocre, and even the sex scenes are worthless. Emotions and intrigues of the original movie are missing. This movie was shot in a dark, shadowy and monochromatic style (la "War of the Worlds"), which is so disappointing after the beauty of the original movie. The reflective figure of Greg Morrisey shows one facial expression throughout the movie. The returns and phrases of the original thread are here pitifully missing; the few that exist are simply anti-climatic. The only highlight is the performance of Sharon Stone as Catherine Tramell, faithfully continued in this sequel, but it is not enough to compensate for other shortcomings. The only circumstance in which to perform "Primary Instinct 3" will be a situation in which Michael Douglas will agree to join the cast.
