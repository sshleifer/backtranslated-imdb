How has this film ever been circulated in the name of all that is holy? It looks like he was shot on somebody's cell phone and takes the scene with the victim of a screaming girl to completely new depths. They literally scream for a full 90 minutes of film. And that's all they do. There is no plot, no tension, no heroes and there is not much acting. I just scream and shout. <br /> <br /> I gave up after fifteen minutes and quickly turned around to see if anything happened. Of course not - except for screams. Oddly enough, the fact that we are going through fast forwarding highlights another problem - there is no question of working with a camera. Each shot looks like any other shot - medium distance, one angle, boring, boring, DULL. <br /> <br /> It is not so bad that it is good. It's just bad.
