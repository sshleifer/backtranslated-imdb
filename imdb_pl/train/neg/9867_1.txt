I saw this before the season of the awards last year, I did not really know why they gave it away after the vote, but anything, maybe at least the exhibition, but the movie was intricate. Sure, some parts were fun in a black humor, but none of the characters was very real to me. There was not one person I could connect with, and I think it failed there. Sure, the conspiracy is a bit interesting and very subversive in relation to Scientology, WOW! What a great idea ... let's see if it has already been extracted to the point of futility. All this test is false, from lighting, casting, scenario to horrible visual effects (what is to be intentional, I can say, and everyone else, but no one laughs at you). In any case, I hope that it will go on sale at least on DVD, I would not like a project that many people put in a lot of effort to become completely unnoticed. But in any case, it is tripe. Boring guts in this.
