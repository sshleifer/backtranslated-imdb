I could not wait to put this movie on my DVD player when I rented it. Then when I started, I could not wait to get out of the DVD player. I actually watched the whole movie. My wife and I waited and waited for something funny, but nothing funny never does. The box reads how it would be really fun. The premise of the film sounds good. Ben Stiller is funny. Jack Black is funny. How to miss this movie? Well .... he misses! This is the most dangerous "comedy" I've ever watched. No one who I spoke to thought he was even a bit funny. It's really a bad movie. Trust me. Avoid it .... AVOID !!
