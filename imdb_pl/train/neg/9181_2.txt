I usually try to be professional and constructive when criticizing films, but my GOD !!! It was the worst movie I've ever seen. Bad acting, bad effects, bad script, bad everything! <br /> <br /> The story follows a group of teenagers on the way to the rave (which takes place in broad daylight) on a distant island. However, when the group arrives, the only thing they will find is an empty dance floor and bloody clothes. Determined to find out what happened to the rest of the partiers, the clan sets off on a mission through an infected zombie forest. During this crusade, they are assisted by a police hatchling and sea captain who have the right number of weapons to hand over to each child. They also meet with Jonathan Cherry and other survivors. Essentially, the rest of the movie is a collection of poorly focused sequences of actions, including too long shootings outside the "house of the dead". This fight ended with cheesy Hollywood violence, unnecessary clips from the HOTD video game and sloppy rotations of the camera matrix. One of the heroes, even volunteers, sacrifices himself to save others. Why? Not because he was noble and brave, but because some of his face was crippled with acid, the zombie spat on him while he continued to beat the creature long after he was turned off! Should I sympathize with this guy?!? <br /> <br /> In conclusion, it makes no sense to watch this movie, unless you want to see for yourself how awful it is. The theater I was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen, and I'm sure the money I wasted seeing this piece of sh * t could easily cover the costs incurred for its performance. GRADE: F
