"I Love New York" is another entry of VH-1 (MTV Networks) showing entertainment party dating with awesome, nasty woman. It had to be an easy decision to take the wildest, telling Ebonik, the craziest rider - and her mother - and give them a show on this network. Many will argue, "this is a show." True, it's not as bad as the previous program "Flavor of Love" - ​​but it's just as bad. <br /> <br /> I am reminded of a sketch from the 90's In Living Color series in which Keenan Ivory Wayans imitated boxer Mike Tyson in the dating program "The Love Connection" and chose "Robin Givens" on date. Mike talked about how the date was okay, but how the abominable mother interfered with her. This show reminds me of it. Men are elected and have names to degrade themselves and the woman they meet with more - (I think that a smart man looking for a smart woman on a regular basis would NOT allow her - and her mother - to give you a name, which is so ghetto, you will be ashamed every time you appear on television). professional reality actors, so why bother yourself. <br /> <br /> I am escaped by the discovery of what is so funny in all this. The fact that it is as false as her newly implanted supplements? 15 minutes of fame and hundreds of thousands of dollars of advertising time for the network? (Well, you can not hate them for trying to earn a buck.) Maybe you're wondering - who would want to be with this woman after an hour? Or I wonder if she and her next performance will be at WWF! Any way you cut it, it's a train wreck you've seen so many times, so now the shock value goes down to zero. <br /> <br /> The lack of a turn or turn makes it a more interesting train wreck, or different from the others. It appeals to the lowest common denominator and for those who call the "end" of the reality show, it is another nail to the coffin, why it should end immediately.
