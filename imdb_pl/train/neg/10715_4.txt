What happened? What we have here is basically a solid and reliable premise and with a decent and talented cast, but somewhere the movie loses. Actually, it never really went. There was some excitement when it turned out that Angie is not really pregnant, and then find out she is after all, but that was it. Steve Martin, who is a very talented man and usually brings a lot to the movie, was horrible, and his whole character was not even close to being important to this film, except to make it longer. I would really like to see more interaction between the main characters, Kate and Angie, and maybe not try a clean comedy, which unfortunately was not, but maybe a drama with comedy elements. I think if the movie did it, it could be very funny, because both actresses are quite fun in their own way and while sitting here I can think of many scenarios that would be rioting.
