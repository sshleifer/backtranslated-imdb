REALLY? REALLY???? I know that if you make a film about a political war, you will be noticed, but this movie is just rubbish. Horrible in every respect. It's terribly inaccurate in many ways. It's easier for me to believe that the president of the United States, who is fit for this, flew a fighter plane and shot down the aliens. It's easier to see a few things that were right. My jaw dropped when I saw someone say that this movie was the best in the last 25 years. It was exaggerated, seemingly meaningless plot diversion and sometimes had dubious pictures. <br /> <br /> X-box, YouTube, tools ACUPAT ?? Has anyone checked that these things did not exist in 2004? It is not that you have had to carry out extensive research, but only five years before the film's release. I am a veteran of the Iraq war and if you spend ONE day with an infantry platoon or an EOD squad, you will understand how B.S. this movie is. To compare it to a Platoon or Terraced Ryan is ridiculous. Why do not you just throw in Commando and Red Dawn; I think they can be more accurate. <br /> <br /> If for some reason you can see an incredible plot, historical and actual discrepancies, then this movie may be fine. Nothing more. If you still hear "Oskar buzz" and you have to add your pompous review, go straight. As for me, I write to the director to see if I can get back 131 minutes.
