After a car accident, a crazy scientist (Jason Evers) keeps the head of his fianc√©e (Virgina Leith) alive. Then he goes to hunt, looking for the perfect body, to become its whole again. Pretty bad, there's nothing here. The cast also includes Leslie Daniels, Bonnie Sharie and Bruce Brighton. Someone should have helped to get it out of misery. Let him die.
