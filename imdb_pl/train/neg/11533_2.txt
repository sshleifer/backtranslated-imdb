If your game is that derivative and predictable thrillers of revenge are your thing, you will have a rare feast ... They really do not speak to me, so I could not find a single thing that could do this strange story. It seems to be something straight from the 80s, at a different age, when it would go straight to the video. Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer are doing well with a poor script and boring scenario. But what does Gillian Anderson do when he engages in such a movie after the brilliance of his performance as Lady Deadlock in the adaptation of Bleak House on BBC television last year? It is said that the director was influenced by a witness to the rape and his work on documentaries, but even this does not justify the bizarre scene in which a herd of rural hounds beat Dyer. I do not think I'm the only person in the cinema laughing. What I do not understand is the involvement of the companies behind this film - FilmFour and Verve Pictures. They were both involved in several great independent British films in recent years. Verve distributed Bullet Boy, Code 46 and Red Road - Straightheads do not deserve mention in one breath. FilmFour and Verve take into account: is it really the best, what can you do? What will independent British filmmakers make of your artistic judgment? It's a big stain on your reputation. Listen carefully: do you hear thousands of fans of independent British movies crying in despair?
