So it was HBO "Made for TV Movie" eh? Is this justification for such a pitiful plot and terrible acting? Such a shame that Jim Belushi has been reduced to a role so repetitive (shot, survived, lying, beaten, survived, shot, lying and so infinite.) Call it a scenario ... As for the British, it's a shame to see Timothy Dalton pathetic (or after I just took p ***, depends on how much I paid, I think?) South Sheriff's test). As for that other Briton, bleached blond, what a fool! There is a recent tendency to glorify these "speaking English" (sic) super brutal thugs, perhaps thanks to the two Madonna movies, it manages to entertain and justify violence by skilful use of irony and humor, as Pulp Fiction does. However, this film discredits and devalues ​​the genre. I certainly miss you.
