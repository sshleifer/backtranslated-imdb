This movie looked good - a good cast, an ever-green theme and an explosive opening. He left from there. Why was it filmed by hand? He shakes, judges, some captures scenes and simply confuses the viewer. This is a bad choice. If that was not enough, the worst edition in the memory involves the drugged browser - mandatory, if you want to enjoy it at all. And then he commits the worst sin of all. After bringing the viewer to the most varied and unlikely scenarios, until they run out, they throw credits without revealing the solution - ending - paying - how the hell was the motive? How can you succeed in creating endless thrillers? Doh! This movie had a great promise and he finished making a plant of a face in the mud. What a waste of effort. Poor effort of writer and director.
