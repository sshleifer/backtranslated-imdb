Was this a thriller, as I thought, when I saw the cover in the video library? No. Was this the "thought of food" because the author could have tried to do it? Not quite. So what was it? It was a very mediocre movie that had great potential and was nicely directed, but it was disappointed by a misleading story with no strengths, beginning and end, with poor acting that he expected from a serial killer who at times seemed overly zealous to ensure the best cast performance. It was nice pictures, with good colors, nice hi-tec materials, beautiful scenery, but they leave you in a lost place and place. And with a feeling, let's just quickly wrap it in the end. OK to see if there is anything else on TV.
