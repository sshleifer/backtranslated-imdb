This movie started well, I felt that I was watching the Seinfeld adult version. I quickly began to question the situations and activities of the main characters and did not find an answer to the question why they were doing what they were doing. All the acting was great, but only a few scenes had short moments in which they were really fun. Dan Cortese was amazing. I loved him in this role. His agent should show this film to casting agents. Watch the first few scenes, then find something better, otherwise you will find yourself totally in this mess. I found this in the basket in the video store. It cost me two dollars and because of the rarity of this movie, I feel that it is a good price.
