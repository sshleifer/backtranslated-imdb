I watched 3/4 of the movie and wondered why this awful review is here. It was quite easy to watch (at 3am). He had a good cast - the role of the serial killer Kevin Dillon was very credible - he was both charismatic and chilling in his veins. The rest of the main characters were not so bad either. <br /> <br /> This is your typical video of persecution. Marriage can not get pregnant, so they go to the fertility clinic for help. The sociopathic donor of "genetic material" focuses on the recipients and, in the typical form of persecutors, breaks into their lives. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned, most of the movie was quite good ... we see that "Conan" is growing more and more obsessed with raising a child and creating an ideal family with her mother. Of course, things do not work for him as he planned. This is not a bad storyline. <br /> <br /> But the last 15 minutes were just awful. I'm very tolerant towards movies (especially at 3am!) ... but I was just amazed at how the ending was badly written. I actually laughed! <br /> <br /> In total, not the worst movie I've seen, but I would not be able to jump over it (unless I skipped the ending). The only re-educational feature here was the role of Kevin Dillon - one of the best serial killers in history. <br /> <br /> Try to look around other channels before you look at it. But if there's nothing better, try ... =)
