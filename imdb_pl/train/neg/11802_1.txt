Total dreck. I got to the point 16 minutes / 27 seconds and gave up. I would give him a negative numerical review if it was possible (although "acceptable" is a more appropriate word ...). In contrast to the sizzle that you could see and feel practically between MacMurray and Stanwyck in the original, chemistry between stupid Dicky Crenna and what she saw here, simply does not exist. The cube becomes an unattractive massive bracelet? There is no lighted finger? And I thought that I would be sick when they had a humiliated face (and rightfully, trust me) Lee J. Cobb as Keyes, who practically wrenches his explanation of his "little man" to Mr. Garloupis. No offense to visually impaired people, but it seems that a group of blind people have fled with the designs of Dietrichson and Neph's homes. The same applies to those awful checkered pants that Phyllis wears. And crikey, how much money does Neff have to live with a view of the huge marina? This, people, everything is done again in the first 16 and a half minutes. If you can go through this, you have a much stronger constitution than me or you are a masochist. But please, take Alka-Seltzer first or DO ANY "small man" who can never leave. Of course, be careful.
