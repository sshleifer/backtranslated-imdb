when you get to the scenes that involve Albert Brooks without his shirt ... try not to gag the fur ball. <br /> <br /> I like Albert Brooks. I saw the majority, if not all of his films, but the first time I saw this movie. Contemporary romance is an interesting look at the theme of love. There are very few films that deal with the despair of love and so openly as Modern Romance, although Chilly Scenes of Winter in 1979 is very close. Both basically deal with obsessive men who are too psychologically drawn / obsessed with their women. <br /> <br /> Where, like Chilly Scenes of Winter, borders on the theme, this movie has a more grounded foundation with the theme of love, because both people are already in a relationship ... and beyond relationship ... and they come back to it again. <br /> <br /> And because it is a movie that was released in 1981, it is his time in style terms and such. This is the main reason I like this movie. My basic rule when it comes to films is: "If it sucks, it may have some historical significance," you know what a time capsule is. <br /> <br /> Which leads me to terrifying scenes with Albert Brooks shirt. <br /> <br /> Man is hair. Very hair. As if he was wearing a black curly sweater with hair. And what's worse, it almost looks like a victim's burn - hairy. This is not a nice view, and scenes with him without a shirt last and continue. At the beginning of the 1980s, hairy men were seen as normal and nothing shocking. But in 2009, the view of something like that is simply repugnant. I'm sorry, Albert! At some point I would like someone to say, "hey, let's try this scene, but with you in a simple shirt, it means you can scare people." This is really bad and I'm sorry for the poor, pretty actress who was dealing with Albert Brooks' naked body. Probably for several days she was pulling his hair out of his teeth. <br /> <br /> In any case, it's OK. It could be better if I did not see Albert Brooks without his shirt, which seemed to be 10 long continuous minutes, because it would forever destroy my watching this movie.
