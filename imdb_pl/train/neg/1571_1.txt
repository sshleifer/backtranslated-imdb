Watching this movie forced me to think constantly; why are they making such a problem because of some broken brakes? There are a million options for slowing down your car! In the movie Speed ​​the Writers, they thought the least about a good reason why the car could not stop ... <br /> <br /> There are not many good things to say about this movie; all the usual narrative phrases appear, the actors are very bad, the story is just as leaky as the sieve, etc. This makes the movie a waste of time and money. <br /> <br />
