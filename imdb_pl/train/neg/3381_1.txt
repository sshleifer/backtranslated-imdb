This may be the worst film adaptation of a musical on Broadway. Even the music was destroyed. Attenborough knows nothing about the theater - almost every shot and the moment they call in a false way. I will say, however, that it is bad enough to be funny. <br /> <br /> Hairstyles are very outdated. I can not understand my whole life what it means (conceptually), opening a movie outside the theater where "A Chorus Line" plays. Are we supposed to think that these people are involved in the audition for "A Chorus Line", which contains stories about people who listen? Oh no, the program collapses itself. <br /> <br /> I saw the original production and listened to the album hundreds of times. Why, oh, why did they do it?
