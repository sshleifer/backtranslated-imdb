Apparently, the movie, which predicts the upcoming trends in British popular music, on so many fronts is ridiculous. Tommy fast? Honeycomb? The DOES film contains a song by the group Spencer Davis, two by Animals and one shot live in the movie The Beatles, which performs their live version of Twist and Shout (all 1:20). But in general, the awkward presentation of British music around 1964. Oh and Hermana Hermits.
