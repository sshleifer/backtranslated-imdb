This movie is not very good. In fact, this is the worst Elvis movie I've ever seen. It has very little plot, mainly partying, drinking beer and fighting. Burgess Meredith and Thomas Gomez are wasted. I do not know why they made this movie. You could say that Elvis was also wasted, it is much better in "Follow That Dream".
