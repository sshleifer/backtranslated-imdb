Another look at horror. Stylistic differences between American and Russian films are interesting. However, from my American perspective, this movie was not very good. The heroine, Marie played by Anastasia Hille, was not a nice character and it was hard to identify with her. Most of the time she was unpleasant and confused most of the time. Too much time was devoted to bringing her to the main location of the film. Then a long time passed before the real tension arose. When that happened, it seemed that the volume was the main effect, which was more annoying than anything else. The concept was more original than most Direct-to-video films and they did not use sex to make up for a thin storyline. In total, I recommend it for rent, but not for theatrical viewers.
