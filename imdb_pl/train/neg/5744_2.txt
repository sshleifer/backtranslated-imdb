This movie was horrible, just. It was so bad that I registered with IMDb to warn you of its dangers. <br /> <br /> I am an expert on horror in camping, per se. I watched "Redneck Zombies", "House of the Psychotic Women", "Slumber Party Massacre II" and many more. I know my schlock. And I know that this movie sucks. <br /> <br /> Three quarters of the movie consists of frightened people running from one side of the screen to the other. When they do not run, they spurt out non-sequential lines, devoid of emotions and motivation. When the actors start to be acceptable, the direction falls to pieces. There were so many shocking shots at a low angle; I thought Leif Jonker had a 3-foot tripod. He used what I call "Leif Maneuver" a few million times: I mean, I'm moving away from an interesting object like an amateur. Apparently the film crew could not get up early enough to shoot the sunrise, so they shot the sunset ... and they played it in reverse. Guided by the lazy direction, you are really impressed with the last scene of Gora. The only thing you can imagine is that the last five minutes have been filmed before the first eighty-five minutes. <br /> <br /> If you want a good (bad) movie mountain, rent a "Riki-Oh" or the "Dead Alive" foundation. If you're a fan of szlocka and looking for a challenge, give "Darkness". <br /> <br /> Quote about the movie - <br /> <br /> Vampire: it's time to die!
