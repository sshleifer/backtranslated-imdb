Every now and then there is a film that turns me down and reminds me that my taste in the films I am looking for is not always impeccable. Normally I would stay away from such things, but I was cheated by some of Rohmer's great reviews and pedigree. <br /> <br /> There is an initial and intriguing novelty in production, in which Rohmer basically puts the actors on the painted (digital) downfall of the French revolution era. It fades quickly and becomes more or less as interesting as watching paint on the paint scene by numbers. We still have a boring and stuffy movie about aristocrats in 18th-century France. None of the characters is attractive or sympathetic. The pace is so lazy, the dialogue so tedious, and the uncertainty is clearly a foreign conception of Rohmer, that it ended up that I did not care who he fell over, who hid whom or what the devil was supposed to be. The film would be very beneficial due to the appearance of emotional accumulation and musical score (finally, great classical music was used). Despite the fact that it is so "talkative", the movie sounds very similar to the silent movie and the worst kind of film, boring and uninteresting film with infinitely interesting subjects. Only the most talented French historians will find in this film everything that seems to paint well-known events from a new point of view (you are an English woman and royalist). Otherwise, avoid this sucker at all costs, unless you suffer from insomnia (I have been napping twice).
