Detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) has a serious problem in his hands. A serial killer, Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober), for whom the psychic extraordinary Tess (Tracy Griffith) helped him capture, was resurrected thanks to the First Power (... given to him by Satan after his execution in the gas chamber) and may have weak bodies. Somehow, Russell, who joins forces with Tess (who understands what they stand for), will have to stop Channing or many women will continue to die in his bloody hands. They will seek help from Sister Marguerite (Elizabeth Arlen), who tried to inform her superiors in the Catholic Church of the First Power, but she was denied access to a weapon that could stop Channing ... a cross with a blade that can penetrate Channing's heart freeing his world from its evil . She will take her anyway and help Russell, who will need all the help he can get when he kidnaps Tess, preparing her for some satanic ritual / ceremony. <br /> <br /> In the film, Mykelti Williamson, always a reliable supportive supporting actor, gets a partner in the role of Russell ... so you know what will happen to him. Just like in the movies of this type, everyone around Russell is dying, but when he tries to kill Channing, he simply kills the poor host of some other poor soul he has. <br /> <br /> Pure occult nonsense ... fool from gate to finish. Phillips and Griffith are trying, I'll give it to them, but they have no chance at such a fast pace. Kober, who is usually effective as heavy, is almost nothing more than a goofy villain who jumps into the air and throws rotten jokes.
