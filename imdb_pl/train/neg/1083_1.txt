This movie is like a real life, which I mean - not much happens in about 2 hours, and the few plans of the game or story are confirmed by often invisible cast (their invisibility results from "experimental" lighting, mentioned by many reviewers). <br /> <br /> A large hole. No wonder that Altman proves this - he is a very changeable performer (yes, we all loved "Gosford Park", but "Pret A Porter" anyone? Kansas City? Dr. T. and women? Aaargh), but the fact that the raw material is a John's tale Grishama, and the excellent cast you will see in the gathering gloom of your insistent dream - makes it really a masterpiece of evil film. And no, it is not "so bad that it is good". <br /> <br /> It's just bad.
