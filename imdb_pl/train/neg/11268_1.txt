I was hoping that the film would be at least visible. The plot was poor at least. I was expecting a lot more considering the cast (I wonder if any of them will include this in their CV). At least I did not pay for the rental. The best part of the movie is definitely Dani Behr, but the rest of the movie is complete and exhausting.
