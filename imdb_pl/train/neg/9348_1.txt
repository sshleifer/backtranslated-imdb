I consider this film embarrassing to watch. I felt it was pushing the plot down my throat, as if I could not understand the subtleties I needed to constantly spell it out for me. <br /> <br /> Having a father who is still an alcoholic, I did not really feel it was a film about alcoholism as such. Alcoholics, real alcoholics are very lonely people, in my opinion of course. It is difficult for them to communicate, something that the main character had no problem with, except that he had a problem with saying that I love you at some point - which was a bit of a weak effort to establish his cold character. He was also constantly surrounded by people !? <br /> <br /> I felt cheated that at no time were we really alone with the character to really feel his inner loneliness and confusion. I could not connect with the character and did not feel any connection with my father. I felt nothing when it was over, only a relief that it was over. <br /> <br /> Kevin McKidd is a good actor, but he is not a tough guy. A mechanical orange thing was as subtle as brick. McKidd was too old for a teenager, they should have three different characters or avoid the scene of teenagers and concentrate more on an adult McKidda. <br /> <br /> On a good note, I felt that the little boy was really good at the beginning of the movie !!
