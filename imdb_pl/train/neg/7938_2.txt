A family looking for old roadside attractions, which can be placed in a father's book, encounters an ancient, decrepit, old, bizarre show run by an eccentric one-eyed man. When their family delivery van breaks down after leaving the box, they are forced to stay in an almost abandoned fishing camp, which was the place of a break in prison a few decades earlier. <br /> <br /> There were many films in the 'bizarre subgenre of horror, from beloved Tod Browning' Freaks' (1932) to the hilarious' Freaked 'by Alex Winter (1993). Both are classics (or soon with "Freaked"). "Side Sho", however, will never be. And if you ever reach classic status. . . Well, it will be an obvious clue to the sad state of our species. From an absurdly bad song opening to a 17-year-old daughter who is obviously older than her natural mother, this movie did not have much to say. The letter was below normal, but not entirely terrible. . . just boring. The direction was weak, and the rare effects of eccentricities were quite terrifying and unbelievable. Acting was terrible, and the casting was even worse. Anyone who believes that the age of these two teens from the camp could not meet a teenager for a long, long time. There was not enough gore and violence to compensate for the lack of any other quality. . . and when there was some violence, it was not well done. And I can not forget about the ending battle scenes, which were all honestly one of the worst I've ever seen in a movie. In general, it is an easily forgotten and badly executed horror that deserves to be left alone at the bottom of the dollar. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 2,5 / 10.
