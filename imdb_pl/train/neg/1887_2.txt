Earlier today I got into a dispute, why so many people complain about modern movies, in which I came across a strange statement: "the development of characters in newer films is simply not as good or interesting as it used to be." Depending on the film you are talking about, this can be attributed to many things, sometimes the general special effects and fictional Hollywood trash, such as War Of The Worlds, but in the case of exaggerated, uninteresting attempts, social commentary and desperate struggle for "art" back to cinemas are films such as "Dog Days" that are guilty. <br /> <br /> I usually have a very high tolerance for films, no matter how boring or pointless I am, find them (from good, long ones like Andrei Rublev and Dogville, to those that I found painful to sit in La Alpha Dog and Wild Wild West). I turned the movie off for 45 minutes, which is 30 minutes more than I should have. I was not interested in any form and I found nothing significant except a thin veil of indeterminate pessimism. Trying to say something about the fall of society, this film too easily becomes complacent, banal and exploitative in a very honest sense. Of course, I've seen a lot of disturbing movies on the same subject, but there are so many better movies about depressive, pathetic people (Happiness, Gummo, Children, Salo, Storytelling, Irreversible) that actually contain characters with great emotional depth and personality. Dog Days did not have more than eighth grader disgusted with society, deciding to ignore real intelligence about the way people really are, and instead to decide on a boring, horrible and hopelessly unoriginal attempt to "work". This is not a characteristic of an unknown or clever perception about the fall of society, it is only boring and nothing worth worrying about.
