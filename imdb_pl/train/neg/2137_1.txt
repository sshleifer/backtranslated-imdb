Even the first 10 minutes of the movie were terrifying. It's hard to believe that someone other than John Cusack would pay the money. Along with a series of anti-war / anti-war films already destroyed at the box office, it is almost unthinkable that any studio would like to be associated with this script. <br /> <br /> At first, it may have seemed like a politically motivated derivative of Grosse Point Blank with Akroyd and Cusack. But after about 90 seconds of the film it becomes obvious that it is an undisputed attempt by DR STRANGELOVE. <br /> <br /> I liked so many Cusacks movies that I thought I would risk watching this DVD. I have to say that I do not know if Cusack is sensible enough to let me see another function in which he would appear again, unless someone else can vouch for it. Cusack seems to be so irreparably damaged by his hatred of George Bush and the war in Iraq that he is ready to commit professional suicide. Tom Cruise has never been this close. Not even close.
