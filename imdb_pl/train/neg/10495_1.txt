I think Croc Hunter is a pretty cool guy! I know I would not have the courage to go up to 5 feet from croc. <br /> <br /> But everything in this movie is bad. Farting jokes, people eat, and the sketch of the president make the film one of the worst of all times. <br /> <br /> It's a really bad movie that you have to stay away from. All "jokes" are so young that you will laugh because they are so stupid. The plot is so bad that you wonder if the screenwriter is 4 years old. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that Croc Hunter did not beg the crocodile to eat it after he saw it.
