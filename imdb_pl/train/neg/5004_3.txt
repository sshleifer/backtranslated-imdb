Wow, it's ironic because this movie has been around for some time. I think someone else checked it out a few days ago. <br /> <br /> In any case, I watched this movie just because Nick Stahl is on it. br /> <br /> The film was funny. The characters were led by INSANE, former SO Clich√© and STEREOTYPED. This movie had one of the worst dialogues I've ever heard. There were too many twists and turns. <br /> <br /> There is ONE scene worth watching, the scene: "Warm heart, cold weapon", where Nick Stahl kills the unbearable girl in the shower. (Well, actually everyone was unbearable.) But his acting in this scene was perfect. His face looked like my American Psycho (good movie). The stage is worth seeing, but it's not worth watching the rest of the movie, do yourself a favor and do not watch it.
