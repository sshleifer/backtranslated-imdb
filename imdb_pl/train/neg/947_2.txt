If anyone survived and still remembered this decade vividly, if the real seventies were half so funny and (partly) normal, they would be much more pleasant. The real children in that era did not act or act as closely as bright-eyed and normal as those kids. The youth of the country was still influenced by the hippies and drug culture, all the rebellions of the 1960s, which caused, especially in the department of behavior, irritability, self-satisfaction, self - justice, childishness, their unjustifica- tion - none of the characters shows this. <br /> <br /> Someone compared to "Happy Days", and I see why: they were both series, which take place 20 years before the current time, when they were broadcast, and both offer only superficial, carefully depicted real ages , not even close to its full scope, simply showing obvious things - fashion, toys, music, devices, etc. and that's all. For those too young to remember about them or they were not born then, trust me, the seventies were not like "Happy Days" were like the '50s, because "M * A * S * H ​​*" no it presented exactly life in the US Army medical base during the Korean War etc.
