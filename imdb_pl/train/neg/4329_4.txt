I will never forget the joke and the great comedy ORIGINAL holiday movie! The lines, tempo and time of events in this film are unique! However, this continuation of European vacations is a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> In this part of the Griswalds series they win the European Game Show. The problem is that many jokes in the film are little more than mild, "ha-ha" laughs. For example, a flight attendant in the plane asks Clark: "Do you want your canned cola?" Clark replies: "No, I will have it here." This is really the only line that is fun in this movie. <br /> <br /> Humor European Vacation is tight. As if the writers borrowed all the jokes from the first movie, they tried to repeat the script that was made earlier, and relied on a funny sequence of chases at the end of the picture to kill time. /> <br /> What's worse, you can not find natural comics like Randy Quaid as Cousin Eddie and the original kids who played Rusty and Audrey from the first movie. Their deputies are not funny, they can not act and they just look like they're going through most of the time. There are also a few primitive jokes and comments that are not only not fun, but are in bad taste. <br /> <br /> Griswald should stay in Wally World. A place that made them legendary! Do not join them in this terrible European adventure. Viewers should see the original holiday video again instead! You'll be glad you did it.
