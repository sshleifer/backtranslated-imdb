but there are not many of them. Probably the worst "major release" movie I've seen in my life. By far the worst this year. There is no point in commenting on the plot, cast or acting. The problem is beyond anything else. It lies in the absolute stupidity of the annoying kind (not a funny kind) of everything that happens on the screen. I do not know why I gave him 2/10 instead of 1/10. Probably because of Steven Martini. He really tried. Conclusion - 95 minutes rinsed from the toilet along with several brain cells. Avoid at all costs.
