Deathstalker is directed by John Watson and plays Rick Hill, who is a bodybuilder and famous for it, if I understood correctly? The plot is as follows: Deathstalker (Hill) tries to recover something from the evil ruler and must go to the Lord's cave. During his journey he meets many dwarves and monsters, and the settings are very similar to Tolkien and of course Conan the Barbarian. It is a rip off of Conan's huge success and although it is a very stupid film, it has many nice advantages and is recommended for fans of trash and tolerating movie junkies! <br /> <br /> There are not many cinema credits in this film. A few scenes are almost atmospheric and fascinating, but what Deathstalker focuses on is naked women and huge Hill muscles. Women are usually helpless victims and very stupid, so this is a very macho movie, and therefore may not please many feminists! Combat scenes are nothing special and quite boring, and monsters are nothing special. All other aspects of the film are also very amateurish and badly done, but what did you expect from such low budget expenditures? It's trying to be as great as Conan, but he fails. As I said, it can satisfy turkey cinema fans, but no one else. This belongs to a category that is so bad that it's great! <br /> <br /> Deathstalker is still not as close as it could be, and as a turkey movie, I appreciate it almost as much as other turkeys, these are nice of course! If bad movies are your cup of tea, try this and have fun, but if you do not understand "pleasantly bad movies," stay away. And if someone can not stand a lot of nudity, stay away. There is more nudity than violence here, and thanks to these scenes, the film has an R rating. Otherwise, it could be a safe movie of the PG family! <br /> <br /> 4/10
