I will be recording as the second person who, after years of using IMDb to search for movies, was motivated by the Nacho movie, The Abandoned, to create an account and post a comment. It was the worst movie in my life. The plot was on the verge of non-existence, and none of the "puzzles" was added in any way. Acting was ridiculous, and writing was embarrassing. How this movie was supported and became completely beyond me. The only salutary grace I could find was the cunning and repeated use of the word Anastasia Hille. (and a brilliant sound project) If I had to deal with the possibility of seeing the movie again or being maimed by wild burrows, I would be opposed to a difficult decision. I am disappointed that I can not give him 0 stars.
