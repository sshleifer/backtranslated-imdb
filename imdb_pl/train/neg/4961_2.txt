And that's all. It is slow. Actors have the ability, they just do not seem motivated to make an effort. The plot is not too big and is hampered by the aforementioned slowness of all this. The accents, when they are, are British. Many of these people are Danes. OK, OK, the accents are not that important. But language is. I do not think they would use words like "yes" and "OK" in Beowulf's time. And the supposedly nice weapon his king gave him? Have you ever overloaded this thing? Have you ever seen it? Maybe Beowulf's goal was so bad? Well, his purpose at least matched the computer graphics used to generate monsters. These too were rather excluded. Bad special effects. A bright point? Only one I can think about. Marina Sirtis has been good for years.
