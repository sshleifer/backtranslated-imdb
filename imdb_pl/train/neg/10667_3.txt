Do not be fooled by all big names like Burt Reynolds, James Woods and Anne Archer. These are only praised additions. Their scenes were probably shot in one day. Regardless of their motives for being in this movie, if you have an actor like James Woods, use it better. For me, this is a sign of bad direction. The plot itself was not so bad. And the acting of most actors was above average. Cuba Gooding Jr. but he was terrible. He was so unbelievable that I almost laughed at his dramatic scenes. And because it was meant to be a serious movie, it can not be a good thing. Action scenes were not bad, but they lacked this special impact to make it more exciting. There was a need for a better direction again. Also, the stimulation was inappropriate for such a movie. It took almost half an hour to get the main character. For an action thriller lasting just 90 minutes, which is far too slow. The only factor enabling redemption is Angie Harmon. She does everything in her power to make everything work. It is a pity that the director left her hanging. Yes, this movie could be much better with a great director. Andy Cheng is too inexperienced as a director to do it. And for the coordinator of the action / feat of his caliber, you would expect at least more exciting action scenes. Do not waste time on this. Avoid!
