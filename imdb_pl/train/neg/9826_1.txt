I think it would be a great movie for a true believer in organized Christian dogma, but for anyone with an open mind who believes in free will, rational thinking, separation of church and state and GOOD Science Fiction, this is a terrible joke! br /> <br /> There are a few well-known actors who either needed a job very much or had to share their personal beliefs with the rest of us pagans. <br /> <br /> I was this fun movie in the same way that Reefer Madness played with me. This film attempted to teach education about drugs through fear tactics in the same way that this film tries to teach "Christian" principles with the threat of hell and unhappiness for other good people who do not share their interpretation of our world. <br /> <br /> Howling with laughter and at the same time I was scared that I realized how many people believe that our society should return to the good old times of the 19th century!
