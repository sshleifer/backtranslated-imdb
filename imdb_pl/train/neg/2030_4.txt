The comment "eliz7212-1" hits the proverbial "nail on the head" for this turkey program. But this is a bang to see how William Shatner "jumps out" and "dances" (yes, signs "" on the word dance are necessary for what Bill does). This program would be a great sketch on SNL or MAD TV - and evaluate a few stars on one watch to see Shatner, who seems to have taken the "camp" to new heights - whether in the role or alone. But the guy is funny. <br /> <br /> Girls who are in the booth areas with game data scrolls will have a lot of luck when this turkey is canceled - unless this whiskey-a-go-go is revived, with resurrected demand for shapely young women, to once again dance in elevated cages. <br /> <br /> I watched the first annoying player and literally "stupid than: fast", but thanks to the usual happiness he left a quarter of a million. The second competitor, a bit more intelligent, but who would be lucky enough to get 1000 $ for Jeopardy!, Was awarded by the card, which requires an answer to a special question - which he did not know and thus left a zilch. <br /> <br /> This multitude of game shows, which sometimes give large sums to everyday units, is essentially a cheap effort to attract viewers. Even if the host is well compensated and distributes six numbers in the average episode, I suppose revenue compared to costs may be beneficial - because you do not have a sitcom cast, in which several stars receive six or seven numbers, for each episode, with a few large transactions . <br /> <br /> I suspect, however, that even the better ones will dress quickly. This one has almost reached this point. I think that his offers, especially with James Spader and others on "Boston Legal", should give us a satisfactory number of Bill Shatner's offers. <br /> <br /> Again, the above rating is just right to see hoot Bill and maybe sometime; That should be enough.
