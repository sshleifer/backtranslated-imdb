The basic premise of this film is the political comic. I suppose that for those who do not know anything about military realities, it is probably a "feel good" film about gender equality. Indeed, a recent commentator said: "allows women to know that they can do anything they want." What a slap! No one, man and woman can do anything they want, and unfortunately Demi Moore "turns up" on SEAL Hell Week in the early 27 weeks of the BUD / S program for several sessions in the local gym and her desire to be just SEAL will not do it . In this most severe military training program there are about 80% of resignations - those who voluntarily give up, can not compete at the physical level, suffer frequent physical injuries during training or do not cope with psychological teasing. I never went beyond the shallowness of the imagined, alleged message of this film. In the real world Demi can not stand the first 24 hours in this difficult and lasting physical training. Wish he will not do it. Skip this video as wishful thinking and better spend your time reading "The Warrior Elite" by Dick Couch (Crown, New York 2001) to get the best description of what is really going on during this training. Call me, Demi! <br /> <br />
