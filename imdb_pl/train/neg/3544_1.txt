Vulpine Massacre should be the real title of the movies. The tag line should say "Guaranteed that your children will be CRY!" This is a drama of nature telling the story of a family of wild foxes in a remote region. Starting from the meeting and pairing of two young foxes, and ending with the birth of a large family and attempts to bring them up. The only thing that is said in the narrative is a tree that stands above the bottom, giving an insight into the animals that love and live ... Beautiful landscapes and great filming of animals. Sounds good, eh? From there, things go straight to hell, and then start to drill towards the core ... <br /> <br /> *** Spoilers below - or it may be Warning! *** <br /> <br /> Almost for the first time we find out that one of the foxes is born blind. But it seems that he gets along well and is accompanied by a beautifully joyful result ... And then he dies ... Then we have one of the adventures of the siblings. And then he dies ... One of the sisters gets screens ... and then he dies ... And that's how it looks like some scary movie, when one fox after another is killed by nature, in traps, just up and disappears, and even by several snowmobiles! At the end of the movie, almost all foxes were massacred. Fortunately, no death is shown on the screen. (Not the version we saw.) Unlike saying "Tarka the Otter", death in this film is almost pointless and borders sadists in the way hopes are built and then extinguished. One or two losses would be acceptable. This is finally a nature film. But not nearly the whole family. <br /> <br /> Do not go see this movie deceived by a happy box to think about its safety for children. Watch this with some awareness that things * will not * go well at all and that you or your children may be feeling very bad depending on how sensitive you are. You can enjoy it. Maybe not ...
