I am a big fan of the Largo Winch series. This film was a pain for me. I had to use fast forward to keep from falling asleep. It was boring! How can someone destroy this title so much? History was the only good thing. The actors were sh.t. They can not live in this role. The main actor (Tom ...) is nil. Watch the other roles of this actor. The battle scenes were unbelievable boring and did not allow themselves to be imitated, somehow they were not supposed to follow the situation. Like another reviewer, he said that a low-budget movie with bad actors. Maybe next time someone else can do something better for that. The French do not do well with big movies, such as Alien 4. It was a bit worse, after Alien 1,2,3.
