Still a famous but decadent actor (Morgan Freeman) did not make the film for four years. When he is invited to participate in a new project, he asks the clumsy director's cousin to throw him into the poor Latin area of ​​Carlson to investigate the work of the manager of a small supermarket. He sees the wonderful Spanish cashier Scarlet (Paz Vega) and is attracted by her ability. His driver never comes back to catch him, and Scarlet goes to the actor. But first he has a job interview for the secretary in a construction company, and the actor helps her be prepared; then they spend the afternoon together, having a good time. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of Morgan Freeman and Paza Vega. However, the pointless "10 items or less" is absolutely disappointing. This low-budget film does not seem to have a story and is supported by the chemistry and improvisations of Morgan Freeman and Paza Vega, actually nothing happens after 82 minutes. An ambiguous open application is simply ridiculous, and Morgan Freeman's character returns to his silver world and tells the simple employee that they will never see each other again. Was he afraid to romance with her and destroy your perfect world with your family? Or maybe class clash and realizes that his fancy neighborhood would not be suitable for an ordinary employee from lower classes? My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Um Astro em Minha Vida" ("Star in my life")
