The over-zealous theme of "Bonjour tristesse" comes from Francoise Sagan, the under-age first novel, who became a bestseller, although God knows why. For teenagers wanting to get rid of a potential female advisor may have some charm. Do not be fooled by the fact that David Niven plays a playboy father, and Deborah Kerr is a mother-mother. Unfortunately, too much depends on Jean Seberg's frail shoulders. It is beautiful and easily fulfills the image of a spoiled teenager. The problem is that she can attack poses, but she can not act. Anyone who saw her as Joan of Arc in the first film of Otto Preminger St. Joan - Seberg - knows that she was unable to make the film at the age of 19. This film, also by Preminger, fulfills the "promise" of the first. This was her second movie; was now 20. What was Preminger thinking? That Niven and Kerr can compensate for Seberg's lack of ability to act? No way? Seberg's character is at the center of the story and, although convincing, although he may be physically 17 years old, he can not fulfill the emotional requirements of this role. I do not know if she became a successful actress in a short life, because in later pictures she did not affect my consciousness. But anyone who thinks that this movie is better than average requires checking the taste. In spite of Niven and Kerr, it remains a minor story done in a minor way by a beautiful young girl who desperately needed an acting lesson.
