... the kids were annoying. It also seems that the creators of this film fought for 90 minutes. However, decent death scenes. If it were not for death scenes, this movie would have a very Disney character. <br /> <br /> The main child hero did not seem as scared as he should. If I was in the middle of the forest with an individual character of a ghost killer, you can put your ass. I would not wander and ride a bike. <br /> <br /> Generally I've seen worse (ie. Cheka), but I do not watch it anymore and I do not recommend it to anyone who does it, unless you're an avid collector of horror movies.
