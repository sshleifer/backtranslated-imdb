An interesting idea for vampirism that has something to do with the virus (but it has already been done several times). Overall, the movie is too long and it's a bit long. Editing could have been enhanced. I am sorry to hear about the problem with loans. Maybe the film has started to market. In some places the lighting was too dark. But the worst technical problem is sound. The level was good enough to hear the dialogue, but many interiors have an echo for them, which is very distracting. Either they were not careful in recording, or the sound mixing could be better. There was too much background noise. We should induce someone to make sound effects in martial arts scenes. The metallic clash of swords hitting together was not the sound of an epic battle. Particularly in the fight scenes, the edition had to be more strict. <br /> <br /> Also, the acting was a bit flat. I'm sorry, but when I see that the same person writes and plays in the film, in my experience it is a red flag. <br /> <br /> But it was a good effort, so I gave him 4.
