I'm sorry that this movie did not frighten me, it just annoyed me. It was so frustrating when I saw the potential and it all fell off to the side. Children! Father! Hunch! He had so much potential and ziltch! zero, nada! I've heard it before. Horrible! No! I can be scared alone, here, where I sit, than in the movie. Are there people who write this figure that women should be so annoying? What? This movie was quite moody. Or at least it could have happened if the director / writer took the trouble to do it. We could have good music, which would also increase the tension if somebody tried. I really want to know why they get money? Just give it to me and keep all my troubles. Abandoned? ... No, where we were betrayed
