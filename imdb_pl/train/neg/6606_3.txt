Please, do not hate me, but I must be honest, watching this movie, I had a lot of fun, <br /> <br /> It's a movie with stupid cast and stupid songs !!! <br /> <br /> Unnecessary songs !!! Mehbooba ... A total insult to the original Holi .... well ... it was OK! because of tradition Every movie must have it !! Chad Raha hai Nasha Whatever ... A very unbelievably silly song Le ... It sounded like a song Stupid Song Playboy ... <br /> <br /> Other than a song. The movie was fine. It was Ram Vale's own adaptation of Gopala ... If you think so, you'll like this movie <br /> <br /> Well, this movie depends only on the viewer and on the basis of whether he thinks the movie is total Copy He / she would like to hit his head in the cinema chair OR if he / she thinks about directors Self-look would be relaxed and look at this movie <br /> <br /> In any case, I looked both ways, I would like to congratulate and misinterpret Ram Gopal for the disaster he created ... <br /> <br /> Well, some other things that bothered The CAST were Incredibly Bad. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan As Babban / Gabbar (Amitabh in his own remake of the film Funny, which was the director's thinking) Ajay Devgan As Heero / Veeru (Bobby Deol could be better) Prashant Raj As Raj / Jai (Abhishek was Meant for this role Appearance in the song of Mehbooba) Sushmita Sen Jak Radha / Durga ( Jaya Bachchan was right, Tabu was right about these j role) Nisha Kothari As Ghungroo / Basanti (I think Es ha Deol would be Great) Mohanlal As Narishma / Thakur (Mohanlal Is So Cute .... Oops I'm sorry hehehehe was OK I could not think of anyone) <br /> < br /> The movie would even have FAIRED Even if the cast was OK <br /> <br /> The movie was not even exciting, the movie was just fine, just to watch <br /> <br /> Overall rating <br / > <br /> Direction ... 8/10 I got some cinematography from him ... 9/10 Script ... 3/10 BAD Scripting Songs ... 5/10 Unnecessary in the film, it could have been better, Easy on the Ears will play in PC and IPod and Stuff Cast ... 1/10 <br /> <br /> Total ... 3/10 <br /> <br /> Syed Shabbir Aly Naqvi from Pakistan
