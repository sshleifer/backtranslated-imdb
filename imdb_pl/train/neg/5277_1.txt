I caught this evening at Showtime and was amazed at how a film with such an interesting assumption could turn out to be so incredibly horrible. WHO IS YOUR TATUS? the play of Brandon Davis as an adopted senior high school student Chris Hughes, a maniac who inherits the heir of the pornographic empire left to him by his biological parents. Although the premise is that the movie can be fun, it's ruined by the inept directing of the first director Andy Fickman, a stereotype and a predictable scenario, and the acting is even bad in the standards of direct video. Even the normally humorous Charlie Talbert turns into a surprisingly grim performance as his best friend. Ali Landry is the only good part of this bad and unpalatable bagpipe. 1/10
