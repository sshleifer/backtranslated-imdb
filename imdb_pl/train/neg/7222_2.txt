Knowing the comics of Enka Bilal for a long time, I had to see this movie. I thought it would be a good way for the artist as Bilala to spread his art and ideas to a wider audience. I also thought it would be a good movie to recommend, and I thought that I would enjoy watching this movie ... I was wrong! The film was a real torture to watch. The idea has potential ... but the film leaves too much to be desired, and basically anyone who sees this movie has the impression that it can do better. I will not suggest whether you should see this movie or not. Chances are that you are reading the pages that you have already seen or that you will see them - but be prepared for a very bad 102 minutes.
