I can not believe how someone can do a comedy about a problem such as homelessness. Of course, Brooks did not make a comedy about _reality_ homeless people. No mention of drugs, prostitution or violence on these streets. The people we meet in this movie are homeless in the fantasy world, so the only difference between them and us is that they do not eat that often. Brooks' films have been getting worse over the years. It's just another nail to the coffin.
