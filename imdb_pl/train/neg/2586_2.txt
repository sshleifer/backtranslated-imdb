Let's go to the chase: this movie is softcore pornography sold for the masses under the name that the studio will milk every last penny from the American Pie pacifier. Period. <br /> <br /> The whole story (and that should not mean that there is a lot to watch) serves as a vehicle to show the audience more tits and sex scenes. <br /> <br /> If you're a guy with Tween and you're too sensitive to buy real porn, this is a movie for you. Otherwise, the film does not have much to offer. <br /> <br /> Acting is sub-par, character development is practically non-existent, and history is a nonsensical note of nudity, drunkenness and mischief (none of which is particularly memorable). <br /> <br /> Go buy real porn if you want to see it, and if not, go watch the GOOD movie. Animal House, Kids, and even the original American Pie are great cinema pieces, and all contain large amounts of alcohol and nudity. <br /> <br /> "It's not so much but how to use it"
