The film had a charming opening, I really believed that I was taking part in one of the best romantic comedies that I had seen for some time ... there was something special "alien" in the way the film was set, realistic, but somewhat abstract and mystical. But the story began to become more and more unreal. To say that the ending was CORNY and PREDICTABLE would be almost an understatement ... The most typical romantic ending in which everything goes well for every "nice" character. A scene in which the main character realizes that he made a mistake and chases "the woman of his dreams" only to confess his love to her in front of a nice crowd of viewers. Come on. In the end, "good guys", "bad guys" win ... You get a photo. A WASTE of a potentially interesting movie.
