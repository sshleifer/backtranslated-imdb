I did not know anything about this movie and left in half an hour, knowing everything about it. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I am generally a nice person, but if someone would tell me that he likes this movie, I probably never talked to them anymore. Anyone who likes it in general, most likely has an exceptionally dry personality of the hermit type. I also intend to add that they think they are also quite intelligent, as are the egocentric bust bags that make voices to the film. I know that everyone has a different kind of humor, some may not even like mine, but fine; I do not think, however, that it would cover the whole range of humor. This film is as flat and boring as the mind of Wes Anderson. Come in and get ready to go out; it's best to get your money back.
