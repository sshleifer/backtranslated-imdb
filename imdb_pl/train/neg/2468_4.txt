It was not that great. Not terrible, hateful or anything else, just forgotten. <br /> <br /> It had something like, um, hesitant, thin air, as if he never knew whether he wanted to laugh, or sweetness or satire. So we have a weak connection of three. The actors seemed a bit lost. <br /> <br /> Also ideas were really tired and recycled, almost zombie. How many times do we have to say that the 1950s in the United States were infected with a banal sense of harmony? And this has been perpetuated by aggressive consumerism? And this emotional repression in men is hopeless? An old hat. <br /> <br /> The biggest crime in my eyes, however, was how it was detached from reality. I know it was a comedy and everything, but - especially in a full movie where you have to keep your audience interested for a long time - you still need some emotional anchor, some relative history guide to get him involved. That the child of the "hero" could see an old woman, two schoolmates and eventually his father dies painfully at the hands of zombies or anything else, and for him to welcome all this with a happy smile and shrug, I just fight it in any positive way . Mum was the same. If you make your two main heroes so inhuman at this level, you risk losing me and it happened. <br /> <br /> The biggest positive thing I can offer is that I love the look of this kind of apple pie in the suburbs and it captured it well enough, it was a good movie, especially some of the wide street shots and inside the Robinson home. The opening of the film chronicle was cute, in a way that was made-before-but-still-funny. <br /> <br /> And I thought Billy Connolly is doing well, and it comes from someone who is not a big fan of Billy Connolly: Movie Star. I was just afraid that he would be struggling and tried to steal every scene, but he played for him rather low and probably the most pleasant character in the whole movie came out. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's not great.
