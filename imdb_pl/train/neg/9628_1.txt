It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The DVD was delivered to me for free with an order that I placed on the Internet for non-DVD related items. <br /> <br /> No wonder they were dealt, certainly no one could split the money into this drivel. <br /> <br /> As some reviewers may say, they thought it was a funny begging, the person who included him in the worst five films, has him in his place. <br /> <br /> As a talented actor, how Philip Seymour Hoffman can get involved in this trash is unbelievable. Mainly humor in the toilet and badly done. <br /> <br /> Everyone who wants to play should avoid it at all costs.
