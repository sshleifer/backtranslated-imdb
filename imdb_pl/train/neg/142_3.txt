First of all, there are some good things about this movie, but it's all a kitschy thing combined with a movie for teenagers. In the commercial of this film, which I saw, a lot of emphasis was placed on the fact that Denise Richards is in it, but she is a poor actress and is not as good looking as people try to get her to it (it has something to do with the movie). And what about this look gives everyone? Perhaps this is part of the character, but as I said, acting ... Still, writing is fine. You know who it is in the whole movie, and you can almost predict what will happen, but not in an annoying way. I think the book he is based on is probably good, judging by the storyline, but next time I will read the book to find out and not to watch.
