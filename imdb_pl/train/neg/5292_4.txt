I can not recommend this movie as a dating movie. Gary Oldman's half-autobiographical account of life in south-east London is, to be honest, a brutal Beckett description of one of Dante's hell circles. In its center is Ray Winstone, who made such a figure before, but never. The film begins with the order of drinks in the pub bar - that's all - and you're already overcome with a sense of frustration, self-loathing and barbarity, which shows in many different ways during the movie. It's a masterful acting game. <br /> <br /> Of course, tense and disinherited needs a film in a drama like this, and Winstone is answered by Kathy Burke as his long-suffering wife, who absorbs and ultimately rejects his unbearable behavior. Charlie Creed-Miles can turn around like a son of drugs, Billy, though he sometimes had to wonder why he got in. Gary Oldman directs the action on the actors, maximizing the claustrophobia of their miserable advice. 4/10
