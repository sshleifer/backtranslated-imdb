This entry is certainly interesting for fans of the series (like me), but it is still incomprehensible. The plot is misleading, as is continuity. Some striking effects, but we'll never know what it really means. <br /> <br /> Try to see the "NC-17" draft that contains gore that has been cut to re-evaluate "R".
