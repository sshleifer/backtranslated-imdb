I watched the whole movie to a disgraceful ending, although I felt so bad at what I saw. I felt that the director was shouting for attention, and the only way to achieve it was to be the most repulsive. Since I've been living in the UK, I've started to love this country, but this film presents British young people in the worst possible way. She has nothing to say, but avoid it, she will be angry and sick. The people involved should be ashamed.
