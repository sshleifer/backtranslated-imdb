Munster's Revenge is a sad, sad sight. Munsters were brought back for the last time (Fred Gywnne received a huge salary to return to the role of Herman Munster) in this television film about a pair of waxes replicas of his grandfather and Herman, which robots "terrorize" the city as preparation for robbery mummy hiding place at the exhibition. When the police are on their heels, the two older TV icons are trying to figure out who is behind the crimes to remove their names. We can see them dressing as waitresses (a small climax in the film), grandfather turns into a bat with a wire several times (once he flies to Transylvania with Herman, who somehow refers to his frequent flying flies) the most irritating the relative of "The Phantom" constantly sings and breaks glass ad nausium! What is the most sad is difficult to determine: whether Gywnne (especially) and Al Lewis look so miserable in any scene and so indifferent to the material. Are they the robot costumes of hokey that pay attention to the value of school production. Maybe it's a funny scenario. Crazy Sid Caesar, mostly hilarious antics. Or maybe he sees something that brought me joy and fond memories when the child was subjected to the super transformation of the K-Mart fashion. In any case, the result is definitely disappointing and stupid even for Munster standards. As for the rest of the cast, Yvonne De Carlo plays a proper role (though it shows more fission than usual for a woman from her years and experience). K. C. Martell creates a not-so-nice Eddie Munster. Jo McDonell is an attractive Marilyn. Bob Hastings looks and acts as the mentioned Phantom and speaks in the most absurd way. The film has a really cheap attitude to it even in the case of a film made especially for television.
