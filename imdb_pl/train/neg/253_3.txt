The premise of the film has been clarified, and if you have come this far, I can not pretend to be a film critic. With that in mind, my own opinion about the film is quite low. I am a fan of Takashi Miike, but this is happening in the category of not very successful work together with DOA 2 and 3 and several others (many). <br /> <br /> The movie seems to be a free pass because it's Takashi's movie and nothing that Takashi does can be wrong. This is the approach of high school students to the cinema. For the rest of us we find an hour and a half of a child screaming for no real reason, totally annoying (and yes, it takes a movie), the tempo of the film almost reaches the level of rigomortis, and acting ... well ... hmmm. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Takashi, you will see him regardless of the peak interests. He lacks originality (see Endless History) or any character development from the main character in the face of a conflict other than a rather superficial one. <br /> <br /> As mentioned above, this is the first film that Miike is credited with, but that does not mean that nothing we hope to be a personality of Miike will spill onto the screen. The only thing we get is some of Miike's directed by the photographer. <br /> <br /> The film had the potential to be great. This assumption is not difficult to savage. But it seemed that he was stuck in the ground. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is that if you are just going to Miike, then go to some standards such as Gozu, Ichi and Audition. Then a movie in his works, such as Blue's Harp, Fudoh, Rainy Dog, Bird People of China.
