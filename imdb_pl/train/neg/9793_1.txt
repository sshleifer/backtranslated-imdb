Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is the worst television program ever. There is no plot, only a handful of foolishly dressed kids using martial arts dressed in second-class spandex clothes. <br /> <br /> The special effects look like they were from the '70s, the costumes look like a bad comedy, and the show is just awful. <br /> <br /> The only worse thing than a television program are toys, only second-grade plastic garbage fed to our children. <br /> <br /> There are much better shows for your children to watch! <br /> <br /> Try to give your children something like Nickelodean, these shows really have some intelligence behind them, unlike power guards.
