Personally, I hated the movie because it was predictable, the characters were stereotypical, and the whole idea was to detach The Cutting Edge and Cadet Kelly. <br /> <br /> The main character is a snotty girl who is sent to a place she does not belong to. He hates the whole place, and to make matters worse is a hot guy who apparently does not like her (well, the whole damn school can not stand it anymore). Amazingly, she found a way to fit in and make everyone like her plus, makes the guy fall in love with her in love. Then comes the choice where he has to choose between figure skating and hockey. He chooses hockey, then goes to figure skating and stays in the Olympic team. There is nothing strange about this. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was so damn predictable that you knew what would happen before you saw him. It was so awful that I almost vomited, and before I finished watching them, I had a terrible headache and a desire to shoot myself for watching such nonsense. Do not watch it if you're under ten years old or you do not really like crappy movies.
