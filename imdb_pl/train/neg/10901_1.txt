And a few more "no". Voodoo Academy is undoubtedly the least ambitious film of all time. What exactly is trying to do? To tell a story? Of course not; as mentioned above, most of them are just barely legal guys who have been wiped out. Can it then be an attempt of subversive homoeroticism? Well, maybe, if not, it never goes beyond the most harmless and harmless forms of male contact. (Which, to everyone's delight, has been repeated about eighty thousand times.) Well, it's a kind of horror; is he trying to scare us? Not unless the director intended to do so through the total boredom and vanity of his "work". <br /> <br /> I never liked a movie in my life. This is the most boring and unnecessary thing I've ever seen. It's as if the Voodoo Academy dealt with horror genres, zombies and gay movies, put them in the grinder, and then run them through a coffee filter - just instead of a coffee filter that filters out the coffee beans, it's the kind that removes everything that's important, irritated or in any other way interesting. The result is a 74-minute film that is just as exciting as a glass of warm water - just not being able to rehydrate after 10-day ginseng, which will inevitably meet you if you look at the gullet of human effort.
