Slow, slow, slow ... There is no secret or excitement in this film. If you do not know who is the "mole" in the first ten minutes, you must be dead. Secret services also had to be because it took them all to get them together. There are no persuasive characters in the film (not a movie). The tempo of the movie is slow, there is no tension. The hired killer is a great shot, unless he targets Michael Douglas, because everything that seems to be able to hit is a big windowpane. The funniest scene in the film is when the presidential wife speaks a code word at the antimilactic end. He laughs loudly funny. At least six people got up and left the movie early. I would join them if I was not sitting in the middle of the row. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
