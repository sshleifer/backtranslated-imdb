I think Jason Lee has enormous potential, but it was a MISCONDUCT vehicle in which he tried to break out as a star. The plot is awful, the comedy is terrible. I laughed twice, I'm thinking about relief, because from the perspective of time they were pretty bad jokes. I was scared of Fletch's future and I had to console myself that the film was flawed, not Lee. <br /> <br /> Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are hot, but I recommend looking at the real estate photos on this site to find out the movie instead. Save time. 1 star.
