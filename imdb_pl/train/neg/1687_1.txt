If you watch this movie, you will have a grudge against the cinema, director, producer, actors and the person who told you to see it! Shame on you, Sarah Michelle Geller, for putting your name and face on this bad excuse of the movie. It could have been more frightening if Japanese actors simply spoke Japanese instead of trying to "act" in English. I wanted to win when the movie is over ... a real disappointment over the whole buzz of television and trailers of films promoting this poor money producer. Sarah Michelle really did not have to work at all to make this movie ... she just practiced her skills of frowning. Do not waste time or money on this movie.
