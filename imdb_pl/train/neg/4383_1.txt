The worst comedy of Bob Hope (and includes heavy competition). Hope, on an island with sailors, dreams of being in a bathtub with a geisha girl "steering a ship". Someone was probably leading this Hope-hackery over the cliff, because it contains Phyllis Diller and Gina Lollobrigida and he still can not cope with laughter or excitement. Where is Bing Crosby when you really need him?
