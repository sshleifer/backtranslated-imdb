I love the 80s slasher and remember how "Silent Night / Deadly Night" was discontinued from our cinemas, I was very disappointed, so I was very excited to see some of them at Fear.net. You Better Watch Out was what I expected from this type of movie. The quality of special effects was ridiculous thanks to today's standards, character development too long, but all in all the laugh was loud fun! <br /> <br /> Scenes in which he loses, because Santa, also known as dad, feels like a mum, and later, when the crowd is shown in lighting flares - not in flashlights, like in the 80s, but real torches! - I really tickled my funny bone. However, scenes in which he checked children in his area, caused me a terrifying feeling of a different nature. I also liked to find out who these actors were. It took me some time to understand that the main character was a nice teddy bear on the brothers.
