First of all, to give you an idea of ​​my preference for movies ... <br /> <br /> 2007 Comedies that I liked: Superbad, Knocked Up, Hot Fuzz, Blades of Glory <br /> <br /> Comedy 2007 I Hated: Evan Almighty, The Brothers Solomon, Good Luck Chuck <br /> <br /> I should have followed my first instinct and turned off the "Hot Rod" after going through a 20 minute sign. Until then, I knew that this movie would not make me laugh once. The script is absolutely brutal - I have no idea how this monstrosity managed to break 6 on IMDb. Anyone who is more than 10 years old and enjoyed it must be something of a mental defect. <br /> <br /> It's not close to anything with Will Farrell and it's clear that Andy Samberg can not carry more than a sketch of 5 to 10 minutes on YouTube or SNL. I do not know how they tied Ian McShane and Isla Fisher to make this movie ... they had to be guilty of favors or something like that. I came, knowing it would be a stupid movie, but I thought it would be fun at least. I did not smile so much. <br /> <br /> I usually do not comment on IMDb movies, but it was so awful, I just had to warn people. This is only the fourth movie I saw that I had to rate 1/10.
