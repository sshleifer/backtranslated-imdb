Essentially, what we have here is not much more than a remake of the fun classic 'Death Line' kitsch horror from the '70s, which ironically resembled those of the shoemakers, also partly shot at the unused Aldwych subway station. <br /> <br /> Good use of the currently unused Jubilee Line platforms at Charing Cross, as well as the Aldwych mentioned above, this movie essentially has the same story - a suspect murderous crazy zombie in tunnels feeding on lost passengers who missed the last train - originality is not strong for this point movie. <br /> <br /> Indeed, strengths are missing unfortunately. Gore ranges from the poor to the unnecessary, while the sub-Gollum nutter is never fully understood, because it seems little more than a developed plot device. <br /> <br /> Franke Polente has little in common with a thin scenario, than often squeezing many tunnels and screaming, she was like most of the others in this movie, played by a small dog and a flock of tame rats. <br /> <br /> If this scary movie set in the London subway is your bag, or you just want to play "locate the tube seat", and they will pick it up on DVD when they get in the trash bin. If you're looking for a classic horror movie, head to Death Line copies (aka Raw Meat). <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good, well-written movie, you need to change trains ...
