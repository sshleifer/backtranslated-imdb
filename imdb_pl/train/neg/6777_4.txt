Although I recently gave PETITICOAT a positive review, I really did not like this film, although it had many similarities. Both were created only a few years apart, both with Cary Grant and both were comedies from World War II. However, the overall tone and style of the films were completely different. KISS HER FOR ME, in general, seemed simply a cheaper movie - with poor writing, low energy and VERY wide performance - even compared to OPERATION PETTICOAT. I believe that at least most of it lies in the cast of Jayne Mansfield. The combination of her big talents and limited acting ability really made this budget movie look like it came from a third-cycle program. Besides, there was not much chemistry or energy to connect her with Cary Grant - an actor generally loved for his grace and class. It's a bit like combining Sir Lawrence Olivier with Marjorie Main.
