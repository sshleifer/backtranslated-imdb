Reed Diamond plays a man suffering from amnesia, who has been in a psychiatric hospital for over ten years, after discovering that he is wondering about the back roads with blood on his hands. Doctors want to test an experimental new drug that will return lost memories if it works. But when drugs give him demon hallucinations, he chooses to escape. While on the outside he befriends a young boy whose stepfather (Greg Grunberg) suffers badly from her mother, he will not let her get close to the darkroom in his basement and behaves suspiciously. <br /> <br /> While the general "secret" movie is quite easy to identify before it is revealed, I think that Mr. Diamond's action is so fascinating that I focus my attention all the time. (In the interest of full disclosure, I've been a big fan of him since the killing and his short but extremely important role in The Shield up thanks to Journeyman & Dollhouse). Not a great movie, not good, but useful enough. Although I liked it better than the previous films that I saw from the director / writer Michaela Hursta (Room 6, Pumkinhead 4, Mansquito) <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: one passing pair of boobs in hallucination <br /> <br /> My class: C-
