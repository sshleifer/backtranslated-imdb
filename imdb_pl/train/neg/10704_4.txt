It's Die Hard meets Cliffhanger when the ski resort is besieged by terrorists and from one policeman, Jack (Crackerjack), he wants to stop it. <br /> <br /> Action B movie that borrows from other movies and is pretty good with a pretty good action, a funny story (as always in these movies) and three stars. Thomas Ian Griffith as a police officer and Nastasja Kinski and Christopher Plummer as terrorists. If you do not like stupid B action movies, it's not for you.
