What happened to the actors who took part in this shit? Michael Dorn should stick to the Star Treck commodity. John Diehl, does anyone remember him at Miami Vice? I liked it there ... Well, whatever - what can you expect from a movie with one of the baywatch rescuers at the helm? Nothing, and that's what we get. None of the characters is even nice, special effects are fun (but not fun). History is a (very bad) joke. There is no logic for what is happening. I have the impression that the creators of the film tried something like "Attack of deadly tomatoes". Especially in the scene in which all important people discussed national security in a closet ... <br /> <br /> If you happen to see on TV, switch channels - your TV will be grateful.
