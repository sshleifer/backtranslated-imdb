An unusual and unforgettable remake of an old, famous English movie. Although it may be undignified as a total catastrophe (which does not exist), it never builds tension and betrays television's origins. Richard Burton sleeps through his role, and the closed (in this movie) face of Sophia Loren also does not show passion. (**)
