I remember when this piece of rubbish came out, all the newspapers were crying about how long it took Barbra Streisand to make the film. Well, it could not take so many years; the art was only opened in 1975, eight years earlier. She created the Broadway star of the great actress Tovah Feldshuh, who probably should have been cast in the film, but NOT ... The great STAR BARBRA WAS IT HERE. AND WITH MUSIC IS NOT LESS! This movie is a total disaster from the beginning to the end. First, Barbra was forty years old when she did, and she looked at her every minute. There was no way anyone could swallow her as a young girl who wanted to study the Torah. And then, when she dresses like a boy, she becomes camp. I get the impression that Streisand could not be unattractive, so she played with make-up; it's prettier than a boy than a girl. And as if it was not bad enough, he engages in a school friend, Avigdor (Mandy Patinkin, whose best moment is a shot from his naked rear end), and his fianc√© (Amy Irving, who performs a simple lunatic routine, a little schtick, which a poor woman always runs away when the director ignores her and does not know what she is doing, Yentl even goes to marry a girl, I will not hesitate to mention the wedding night scene. <br /> <br /> Then there is music. Nine completely forgotten songs, all sung by Streisand with the help of a lector (presumably as a look into her mind), and each of them is intrusive and irritating like nails on the board. <br /> <br /> I will not say Streisand does not show a flash director, some visuals are beautiful (especially Patinkin's ass), and she has a good eye for balance. The problem with this movie is that it will not get out of the way. I cut her for one second in the title role, she should NEVER add songs, and the whole mess lasts for two hours and fifteen minutes. After forty-five minutes, I was tired of all the pathetic mess. <br /> <br /> Terrible, horrible, terrible.
