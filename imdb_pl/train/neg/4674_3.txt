I do not know who is guilty, Miss Leigh or her director, but her performance as Catherine is almost impossible to see. On the other hand, Ben Chaplin does a better job - against all odds. His character is completely charming and attractive. but he is certainly not so greedy as to bear the stupidity of Leigh. Chaplin seems stunned by what can not be understood as the shyness and lack of Leigh's grace, but rather her orthopedic instability. There must be some element of credibility in his interest, but when he plays it, he is incomprehensible. The protrusions do not quarrel. Maggie Smith and Albert Finney are, of course, great, despite their efforts to derail them. Supporting cast is also a pleasure to watch. It is also a pity that they do not work together because production is beautiful.
