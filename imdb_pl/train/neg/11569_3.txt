Even if you subscribe to the anti-free-trade policy of this film, it is still the same tired note, played again and again. Clink clink clink. Even if you can accept a preacher with peroxide hair, who advocates a return to the first principles, Reverend Billy is quite difficult to look at as a serious figure. A clown pastor is one who wakes up every morning without aspiration more ethereal than seeing his own face on television before he returns to bed that night. I must admit that he has a nice wife, but to save this grim mess in the film would take a lot more. Endless bus journeys are the worst part - with the progress shown - can you guess? - a colorful line moving on the map. You guessed it. Well, it has the advantage of being short. Is this the only good thing I can say? Hmmmm. Yes, I'm so scared.
