We can start with wooden acting, but this movie is a disaster. Growing up in NY, I can say that this film is an insult to anyone who knows the community or people. I'm not even a protector of culture and I think it's a Hollywood piece of trash that fits his fictional, funny presentation of the culture and language that anyone who follows Seinfeld is inaccurate. This is a colossal waste of time, and worse, it is not exactly interesting, because the result is obvious, and the confrontation scenes are ridiculously bad. Who works this way? No one. <br /> <br /> The name of the writer is Israeli or something like that, but it is clear that he has no idea about the topic he writes about. Looking at his biography, it is shocking that he lived in New York and wondered how much he has a real relationship with the community. Even average movies like "A Stranger Among Us" are better and closer to the truth than this dreck. Reading the credits of this guy, it's no wonder he wrote scripts for all C-class movies that somehow contain stars. shocking. Perhaps he knows someone because this scenario is even below the norm for Dolph Lundgren's evil movie.
