Gods ... where to start. I was able to stomach only for the first 10 minutes before turning him off in disgust. Apart from the actor playing Robin Hood himself, the rest were just awful. And, I can only extend my suspension of disbelief just so far. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning of the first episode, I lost count, how many errors, holes in the story and horrible costumes. It started with some poor peasant who tried to hunt deer to feed his family. Everything is good and good. However, the poor blighter had to be mostly deaf, because a handful of soldiers in full armor, on a horse, was able to sneak up to him within a radius of about 10 feet. <br /> <br /> Then, as he runs, he walks away from them, 10 feet behind him, to a shot where you can not even see them, and then after them about 20 feet behind him. Then he falls into a few bushes and is immediately manned by two soldiers ... who just a few seconds earlier galloped on horseback, a few dozen feet behind him. <br /> <br /> The "armor" of the soldiers is such a painfully obvious material that they tried to look like emails and unfortunately failed. Not to mention that the "armor" of the main soldier is 5 sizes too large for a poor man. Seriously, it looks like he is a small child with too much father's armor! In the end, Robin manages to fire about five, perfectly aimed shots around the hand of one soldier, in about 2 seconds, from what appears to be a reflective bow. No man alive would be able to make such shots in such a short time, with a rifle with a range, let alone a bow. <br /> <br /> Then they run away from the soldiers and stop to help an amazingly well-dressed and clean "peasant" with digging a ditch ... something that all noblemen were willing to do all the time, right? It's just like this apologetic pretext for the series that has ever won the second season. The production costs (at least for what I saw) must have increased in tens of dollars (or euros) ... <br /> <br /> Seriously - I think that the high school theater class could have a better interpretation. It was so bad, even the horrible version of Robin Hood Kevin Costner was better. <br /> <br /> I strongly suggest that you avoid this monstrosity and go to rent or buy a series of "Robin of Sherwood" from the mid-1980s. Much better written, played, disguised and produced. <br /> <br /> Out of shame, the BBC ... for shame ...
