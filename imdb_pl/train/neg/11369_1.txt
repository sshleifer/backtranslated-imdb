It's quite ridiculous, I hope that many people are exposed to Muslims who live throughout the US, USA and around the world. Religion has over one billion followers. I was born and bread in America and through my religious classes and teachings I was taught how to cultivate my country and work for the benefit of society. I am very committed to following the religions and teachings of my religion that have been stressed out throughout my life to educate and prepare for success through education to help me return to the world. I know many Muslims from all over the world and have traveled to countries such as Pakistan. I have yet to meet one person who thinks that we should hurt anyone or not accept any other religion, except for people in the media ... I wonder why ... It is also sad that these extremists are the ones that the media use to representing the entire religion. It is the religion of a billion people, and it is less than one percent, I am sure that other people of other religions would not be represented by the KKK, IRA and many others who are simple, small percentages of extremists who use outdated rather than literal passages from respectful books to pursue personal revenge, personal or business within the so-called religion
