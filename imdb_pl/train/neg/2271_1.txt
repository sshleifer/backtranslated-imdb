Someone could probably make a great documentary about the Jerry Springer Show, but this fictionalized version only succeeds in sucking out everything that is authentic and interesting from the trash-TV phenomenon. There are dozens of famous bad movies (such as "Manos: The Hands of Fate") that show more creativity and spirit than this grim, senseless loss of the film. <br /> <br /> Seriously, why not a documentary about the Jerry Springer Show, which would begin to answer some real questions, such as: Who are these people? What will happen to their lives after they appear in this program? How could the mayor of Cincinatti be here? <br /> <br /> One good line: During the "orientation" session for guests: "People, I can not stress it enough: LACK OF WEAPONS!"
