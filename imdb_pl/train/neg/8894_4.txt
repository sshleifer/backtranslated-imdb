This film is the embodiment of phoniness, straight 11/10 on the phoniness scale. The accents of the accents as well as the tightness of the spandex cardigan pants are stunning. Yanks, although true Scotland may be equally colorful, if you ever go there, do not expect that you will get a big chance to "dance" the controversy with the inhabitants. Also, do not try to influence your local opinion through a different tap-dancing art. <br /> <br /> There are several infectious singing and dancing scenes, but the plot is too tacky and linear, and the dialogue is often too weak. I doubt if anyone would want to get stuck in a ruined 18th century Scottish village in Boondocks, not in gay New York. Maybe it was not such a great sacrifice for this priest that he left Brigadoon, he could just try to get out of this dump. <br /> <br /> Watch out for what's the right alternative The Christopher Streed parade in Scotland would look like LSD. Besides, I would recommend him exclusively to Hollywood musical compliments.
