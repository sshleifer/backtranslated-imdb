Horror? Really ???? I can not believe how bad this movie was, what is the meaning of this movie ??? film almost 1h and 30 min, and the first 70 minutes is just a lena walking with that stupid expression after an accident ... she did not talk much, not even a lot of actions. I have to say that the last 20 minutes have had a small action ... and it was still stupid ....... and the end for my God, I do not know where to start, it also ends with that silly look on the face of lena lol. do not get me wrong I love Lena Headey, I think she is a great actress, but I do not know what led to it .. do not waste time and watch it because this movie has no history, no acting ... and there is no sense ... not to mention the slowness of this movie and it seems that you are watching it forever.
