I came to the conclusion that the whole joke of the movie would be to see a rich white guy who behaves like Chris Rock, and then I see Chris Rock reacting to the reactions of people. Instead, you see that Chris Rock is himself and people do not understand him. There are maybe 2 scenes in the whole movie in which they use their trick. This should be much better.
