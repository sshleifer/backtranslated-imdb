As a former citizen of Kalamazoo with a passion for the city, I could not wait for this movie. But what a disappointment! Although acting and acting values ​​are not bad, the scenario is horrible, the plot is unrealistic and the subject is disturbing. <br /> <br /> The main message of this movie is that women are nothing without husbands children. It's hard for me to believe how regressive it is to women. Did the writer live under a rock? <br /> <br /> Although I liked watching my beloved city on the big screen, I would not recommend it to anyone. This is horrible. This is embarrassment for the city from which the name comes from.
