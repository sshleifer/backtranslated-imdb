Oh my, where to start ... this movie was just awful. Writing was bad, acting was bad, special effects were bad. I think the only advantage of this movie is that it made me laugh! I was in the mood for a scary movie, but I certainly did not understand it! I thought it would be decent enough because I'm not picky. I watched some bad horrors. In fact, my goal is to see all the horrors, no matter how terrible they may be. At some point in the film, I made a commentary on the "blood of corn syrup", and in special features admit that it was Karo syrup (brand corn syrup) ... The film had all the necessary things to horror (blood, nudity, crazy killer, stupid movements) but nothing was missing for it to be good. The writer should either take a few lessons or simply give up!
