Hood of the Living Dead and all the other movies that these guys have directed, look like they've gathered together and filmed it with their buddies who have no talent in the afternoon (bored and unconvincing). I believe that 95% of amateur films and 90% of home videos are better than this film (although the similarities between them justify comparison). "Hey lets see if anyone is stupid enough to buy our movies!". I hope that nobody was ELSE. I apologize to those who are involved in flic, because this review is a bit harsh, but I was the one who read your fake reviews and bought a movie.
