This is one of those movies where I would like to stay in the bar. <br /> <br /> The movie is quite boring. What is there is very frail, and you must guess. The film is devoted to pretentious camera techniques that seem to be the intention of inducing migraines and make it look like a student film. Did I say it was boring? If all the characters suddenly died at the end of the movie, I would not worry about it because I had no emotional attachment to any of them. <br /> <br /> There are about 4 good minutes in this movie, but it was about that. For the first time, I considered leaving the cinema during the performance, but I thought that it needed to improve. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This kind of movie could threaten naughty children.
