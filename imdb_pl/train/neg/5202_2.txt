Contains spoilers The story of the film can be summarized in a few sentences: Three guys go hunting in the woods. Two of them, along with other people, are shot dead in the head without explanation. The last guy can stand still, shout and do everything without shooting. It goes through the old factory and has bad people who fall into its scope effortlessly. The villains are comfortably dressed in black and look like a villain. <br /> <br /> This is the whole story, not summarized, but in detail. Everything is attracted by a guy standing by the doorbell. We are waiting with him. A long shot of men bored in the woods and sleeping. We can take a nap with them. The one who was filmed on following a female runner could be salutary if we could see her bouncing ass or boobs. <br /> <br /> There the dialogue is smaller than the Terminator and it's not because there is so much action. Characters simply do not talk. And then they do not even have something simple to say, like "I'll be back." If my friend was shooting this weekend, I would cheer on him, because inventing camera controls is a pretty good feat. Paying money for renting this as a DVD is totally inappropriate. <br /> <br /> One thing that is a bit funny is the addition of the director's story of how the local police did not realize that they were shooting and treating them like an accidental guy walking with a gun. If they filmed it, I would be more sure that watching the movie would be more fun.
