I think Elisabeth Rohm, though she may try, is not very good at all. I think it was because of the budget that she could be the only person they could get for the price. Mainly I watched him for the needs of Myron Natwicka, whose work I know very well. <br /> <br /> He was the most reliable and, without a doubt, the most convincing to watch. When it was not on the screen, the object was lost. The film was shot in Vancouver. He gave me creep, but be sure that in real life he is a nice, funny compassionate man. He even said that playing this role gave him creeping. <br /> <br /> I will be watching everything with him, but Elisabeth Rohm - never again. It was just as exciting as the argument about law and order. Maybe a very nice person, but not an actress.
