The slackers in the title of the film are three college friends, Dave, Jeff and Sam (Devon Sawa, Michael Maronna and Jason Segel respectively), who soon graduate without a thorough exam, but are successful. It lasts until the very end, when it is unlike yourself, but the most pleasant character of the film Nathan (Schwartzman) determines what they are doing. Nathan begins to blackmail to catch up with his dream girlfriend when he can not do it under normal conditions. The only problem is when the trio starts working on it, Dave falls in love with Angela's beautiful and good will (James King). Unfortunately, it's not a genius movie genre. Schwartzman makes watching the movie easy because his performance is brilliant. King's performance is average, I think she was rented just to be with her great look. The Slackers reminds American Pie in a different direction. The jokes are as shallow as in the American Pie. But are not they used? I think this film is a warning to the creators of this genre, who lack originality. In general, a few smiling moments, but a horrible movie in terms of acting (except for Schwartzmana) and the theme. * except *****
