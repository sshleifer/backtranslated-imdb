I remember watching ATTACK when it first came out and I caught it recently. The sci fi channel became worse, but not too much. Shameless retort of Jurassic Park, ATTACK replaces sabertooth cats for dinosaurs. And they are at large, devouring as many additives as possible. CGI is quite bad, and the approximation of the prosthetic heads of cats is ridiculous. We get some blood that helps a bit. Wait until you see what a crazy scientist does, who started this whole mess. Apart from Robert Carradine, who has little to do, the cast is unknown. Apparently it was shot in Fiji. Good job, if you get it. It reminds me of all the low-budget STV monstery that were popular in the 80's and 90's.
