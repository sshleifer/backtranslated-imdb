Did anyone else feel as betrayed as me? The first hour was quite solid, but last one. Oh my God. It seemed to be predictable and tacky. It was not impressive and epic, just like the whole series of the show. Most of the reviews I read were shining, but I really do not understand why. I seriously predicted this general ending earlier, but then I withdrew it because I thought, "No, they will never do it, it's too weak." I can not stand it. I feel unhappy. I think I'll go out the door soon to sell every season. Someone, please. I changed my mind. I want to love it. So bad. Someone will tell me why I'm wrong. A great performance. A terrible ending.
