One of my sisters' friends lent me this game and it's fucking hard! It carries the look of a game for children, but you must learn to perform a lot of complicated moves that require twisting and turning your hands into all kinds of awkward positions, and you have to search through seemingly endless levels for 100 notes to improve your "score"! You must also find those incredibly hidden pieces of the puzzle that require almost impossible tasks from you! AND I'M ONLY FOR THE THIRD STAGE !!!!! Maybe if you have no life and you can stay at home all the time, you can enjoy it, but stay away from it! AND IS DEFINED UNKNOWN TO CHILDREN - STRETCHING YOUR HAIR FOR AN HOUR!
