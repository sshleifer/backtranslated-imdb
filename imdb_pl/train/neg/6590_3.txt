The reviews I read for this movie were quite decent, so I decided to check it out. BAD IDEA! This is another film about the spirit of revenge on a group of friends. The story is stupid, mix the two parts of the Ring with one part of Prom Night, sprinkle I Know what you did last summer, and add a touch of Single White Female - now mix it up, completely nonsense. There is nothing new in this story, and once again looking at the stereotypes that I liked so much, this time was not fun. This movie jumps too much into the past and the past, and once I've understood it, I realized that it still does not make much sense. Characters go from common sense to a psychic killer in the blink of an eye. Speaking of characters, they are all your stereotypical favorites - a greedy selfish lawyer, egocentric actress, baseball star, voyeur, bitter girl, terrible quiet chick, "prettier than nice" nice girl, fucking black cat ... and I did not care about any of them them. Perhaps a better writer could make a movie, there were some decent scenes in it, but overall the movie was a mess. I should also mention a "video tape" that could not be shot. <br /> <br /> This movie is not the worst Asian horror it has to offer, but it's still pretty bad. If you just want to see scary images in the dark, or just want to laugh at a loud game or just shout "you're stupid!" On a movie screen, or you just want to have one more Asian horror when someone asks you how much you've seen - this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> Those looking for a decent story are looking elsewhere.
