I think the biggest failure can be boring. The bad is actually better than boring. This thing has no breath. It has an interesting fact that it takes place in Cambodia. How many American films from the 1930s take place in Cambodia. Nevertheless, the conflict is difficult to understand. Even the movements of the troops are somewhat confusing. What attracts her is a love story. Why are these two guys so completely paralyzed on the sloppy blonde I do not know. I thought he should still use his Zombies (as they are) and forget everything about her. The film just moves. A perfect microcosm is a place where one of the main characters follows a Cambodian priest through the water to get to the secret place where hieroglyphs (or whatever) are stored that explain how to turn people into zombies. I thought they would never get there. One guy does two steps. He stops. Is looking around. The second guy is hiding behind the columns. He takes two steps. He stops. Is looking around. The second guy hides behind the bushes. Here's the movie in a nutshell. Then there is bad acting and bland dialogue. I have a lot of patience when it comes to B movies. This one is unbearable. Incidentally, a more accurate title would be Revolt of the Hypnotized.
