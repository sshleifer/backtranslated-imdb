I just visited the Russian forum of our TV channel, which showed this movie. Well ... 99 percent of active Russian buyers are disappointed. We wanted to see more real facts about our space achievements in this movie. But the authors meant something different ... :( We are a great and beautiful country in which intelligent people live, we are proud of all our cosmic dreams, true achievements on the one hand in this field and science on the other, so I would like to ask the authors: Where is our LUNOHOD? And where, our hell MIR station? Ah, I'm sure that LUNOHOD events took place much earlier, when Armstrong's "walk on Moon" and learning errors - I really do not have time and place here! Let's see our constructive critics on the Russian forum at www.1tv.ru
