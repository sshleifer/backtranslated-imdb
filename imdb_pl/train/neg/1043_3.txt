What a bad movie, bad movie !!! I can not believe in all the hype that has been overwhelmed by this pretentious, amateur pretext for a real movie !! I left the theater before the end, bewildered by how poor the direction and work of the camera in this movie !! And reading the adoring paeans, which claim that the film is truth and reality, while all that is in fact is an impudent attempt to extract wool from the eyes of reviewers and festivals by being cheap and cheap. At least this movie showed me once and for all that the Sundance festival has become a complete joke, and showing it here is rather a sign of bad film making than anything else. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. You want to get back your time! I know yes.
