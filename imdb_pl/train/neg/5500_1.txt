This film tries hard, but lacks the fun of the television series from the 60s, which I am sure that people remember with sentiment. Although I'm 17 years old, I watched several series on YouTube a long time ago and it was enjoyable and fun. Unfortunately, this movie has nothing to do with the series. <br /> <br /> The special effects are rather unsatisfactory and not flat camera. The script was also boring and devoid of a sense of wonder and humor. Other unsigned scripts include Home Alone 4, Cat in the Hat, Thomas and the Magic Railroad and Addams Family Reunion. <br /> <br /> Now I say that I liked the idea of ​​this story, but unfortunately it was poorly made and he ran out of steam too early, and to be honest I'm not sure because it is something for the family. And I was annoyed by this chatty costume, despite the thrilling voice of Wayne Knight. <br /> <br /> But the most angering thing about me was that this movie wasted the talents of Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Daniels and Daryl Hannah, all very talented actors. Jeff Daniels has done some good performances before, but he seemed to have no idea what to do, and the character of Elizabeth Hurley, unfortunately, proved to be useless. Daryl Hannah is a beautiful actress and is generally ignored, and I liked the idea that she is interested in love, but unfortunately you can not see much of her (not to mention the Monster attack that can scare kids than charm them), just like Wallace Shawn as some government agent. Christopher Lloyd gets better and as an actor I like Lloyd (he was in my two favorite films Clue and Who Framed Roger Rabbit and I like Back To The Future), but he did not have much to do, and he had a tendency to act quite violently. <br /> <br /> In general, how much I wanted to like this movie, I was not impressed. Instead of being funny, it turned out to be pointless, which was a pity, because it had a lot of potential, with some talented actors and a good idea, but wasted with a poor execution. 1/10 Bethany Cox
