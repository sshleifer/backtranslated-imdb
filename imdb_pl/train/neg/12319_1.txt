I feel that I just watched a movie with snuff ... Beautifully played, tense, addictive and horrible thing! A two-hour litany of deviations in the most basic and comprehensive sense of the word, sexual violence and torture, rape, beheading, incest, corruption, live burial and abuse, abuse and abuse. Without any redemption. And I was entertained. I could not stop watching. What does it say about me, about people who create and act in such things, and about a world that has become so anesthetized that ultimately real snuff films will be the norm. I am neither puritanic nor humorless, I do not try to hide from the darkness, and I definitely do not live protected life, but I am ashamed of myself. And I'm sorry that my British cousins ​​are pulling the wastewater in the way my tribe does. It does not have to be cozy, but does it have to plunge into substitute sadism?
