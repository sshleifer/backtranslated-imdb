I got this movie from a private collector and I was very curious about it. He was 7.8 in IMDb (only 9 votes), and some external comments were pleasant. But I must say that it is very ordinary and uninteresting giallo. Yes, great pictures, the film is well-directed, but it never frightened me. It starts well, but although it does not bore me at all, the story is so ordinary and things that occur so normally that I did not like it too much. <br /> <br /> You can make some laughs. And you can see small tits. But if you like giallos that I like (weird, surreal, nonsenseful, bloody, moody, brutal murders ...) you will not appreciate this movie. <br /> <br /> I give him 4 good directing and editing and the final twists and turns that make the movie fun. But it can be much better.
