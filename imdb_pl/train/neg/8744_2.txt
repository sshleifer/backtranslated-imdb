It accidentally ended up watching this movie. I'm still not sure if I regret it or not. I felt like watching a movie made by a group of film school students who did not quite do it. It plays every Hollywood stereotype you can imagine, and at the same time whips us with the message "corporations are the ultimate evil." The subtlety of this film is unknown. As for this, it manages to even deliver your own spoilers. <br /> <br /> History seems to be the computer fantasy world of a sucker. The main character is an attractive teenage boy with a girlfriend, but he is a programming genius and an apparent hacker (I think), among many other elements that you have to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I should have known that it would be a z-movie when I saw Ned Bellamy ... he has a tendency to be a good tip. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this one, I'm afraid.
