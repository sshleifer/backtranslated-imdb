I wanted to give Drawing Blood the benefit of initial doubts. The initial moments when the naked woman spread out and the painter, Diana, intended to paint her, and then to suck blood to suck, so that she could use it for her art, giving the impression that it might be crap of a vampire. It turns out that this first impression turns out to be false. Oh, Troma, a sign of some kind of lack of quality: sometimes they offer something that is rubbish, but fun and at least to some extent suitable for junk (and sometimes not). This is a case in which watching is not very funny, because his attempts to humor (ie the father of the main character is an old vaudeville who makes impressions of Jimmy Durante?) They are weak at best, and any unintentional laughter cuts Sergio Lapel's opportunity to market basement. <br /> <br /> And he does not try without him, oh Lord. He tries a lot, which is a big part of the problem. He and his producers had money for lights, of course, but the way they were used in the film made me, former student filmmaker and aspiring director, sulk in place: if I saw it in the theater, I would have to blind my eyes in many cases and I would think whether his DP understood really basic 3-point lighting. Although this, along with a very poor sound project (or just a lot of accidental loud buzzing, like in an art gallery scene), should not be something that will be noticed during the release of Troma, it should be something * basic * that the filmmaker can handle even if the script is not too funny or scary (and it is not) or if Lapel makes a strange mix of songs placed in strange moments. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie in any respect, and maybe if you are a vampire (or just a vampire), it may have some appeal as a low price of the cheapest alternative to Near Dark, or as a slight improvement, let's say Blood Freak from 1972. You generally have better ways to waste time.
