Title: Robot Jox (1990) <br /> <br /> Director: Stuart Gordon <br /> <br /> Starring: Gary Graham, Anne Marie Johnson, Paul Koslo <br /> <br /> Review: Stuart Gordon We usually associate with extremely bloody horrors, such as Re-Animator, From Beyond, Dagon and Castle Freak, we made a small detour here and we made a small science-fiction movie. I emphasize the word "little", because it is a very low budget, and there lies its main weakness. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in the future. A world in which the big superpowers (which according to this film are the United States and Russia) double their differences not by leading a full world war ... but by fighting in the style of gladiators with gigantic robots. Our hero Achilles must face the evil Russian hunter robot called Alexander. There are many low-cost time-lapse animations. <br /> <br /> Well, I think it's amazing. Big nations deciding territorial disputes with gigantic robots? Interesting assumption and such an assumption that could be properly settled if the right budget was available. Unfortunately, what could have been a funny movie ends with embarrassment for a great director. <br /> <br /> As a child, I loved this movie and I think that if you want to enjoy this movie, we will have to return to the baby mode to have fun with it. I showed this movie to some of my friends, and with the progress of the film my friends, "how the hell is this piece of nonsense fro"? And this movie is really a science fiction of one of my favorite directors, Stuart Gordon? "But when the film changed into brazen territory, I almost felt that I was pushing and not forcing them to go through these tortures. because I loved this movie as a child, and watching it still involves a bit of nostalgia. But everyone will not just get it. <br /> <br /> And I realized that the movie is not really good. First. The film is about giant robots that are throwing each other out of hell. To achieve this in a reliable way, you need to use damn good special effects to make it work, expensive effects would help the audience suspend disbelief, but unfortunately it is a small-scale film from a small company (Empire Pictures, which went bankrupt after making this movie!) the effects only help us giggle and laugh at them. sets and garments look unfinished or semi-fit. <br /> <br /> OK to admit, after accepting the fact that you are watching a mix of moderate stop animation and miniatures, you can in a sense surrender to the film, and even enjoy great robots, kicking each other. There are certain scenes in which robots are fighting, which is cool, and they forced me to "like this movie!" But everyone knows them, some shitty effect will take you straight from this little protective cocoon in which you tried to hide. And boom, your right to make this movie simply does not meet its assumption. <br /> <br /> And one more thing that worried me a bit about the movie. This film is basically a movie for children. You know, giant robots are winning? Stop-motion animation? Good morning? But this film dialogue had many sexual innuendos, and violence is getting a little bloody. So I asked myself if this is a movie for children or not? After some time, I came to the conclusion that it was basically a movie for children with adult sensitivity, which is not really a good mix. <br /> <br /> So for those of you who do not feel the naive childish charm of watching two robots fighting with each other, and if you do not have a nostalgic connection to this movie (like me), I suggest that you avoid it. Gordons is a great director, but this movie he did not just did it for me. Well, at least I'm not an adult now. <br /> <br /> Mark: 2 out of 5
