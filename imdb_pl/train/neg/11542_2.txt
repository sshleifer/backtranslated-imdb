An unpleasant woman and an equally unpleasant man are brutally and monstrously attacked by a group of two-dimensional bandits during a night meeting on a forest road in Shropshire, England. A man and a woman who were attacked and carried out an attack on their attackers ... <br /> <br /> A totally repulsive piece of voyeuristic trash, somehow impersonating a "thought provoking" drama, when in reality it encounters sub-Michael Winner cr * p (you just know that Oliver Reed and Susan George would be planted so easily if it was made in the '70s). What's happening with Alice (Gillian Anderson) and Adam (Danny Dyer) is frightening and devastating, but Dan Reed somehow manages to rub the viewer's nose into every last glob of his sexual abomination. His apparatus behaves hungry on Anderson's naked body, both during and after the attack, while the scenario leaves almost all figures staggering in a stormy sea of ​​a two-dimensional banality. His scenario forces his characters to behave in such a way as to distance the viewer from "victims", pushing in their faces more ghastly situations (Adams' attempt after attacking Sophie and Alice, Alice's attack on Heffer AFTER his suicide) - a test confession). <br /> <br /> The dilemma stems from the performances of the main characters - Dyer is a terrible actor, incapable of light and shadow as a young male victim of the first attack (he will finish in Eastenders, mark my words), but Anderson is extraordinary. Even if this horrible scenario forces her character to behave in a depraved and absurd manner, he somehow provides a very attractive and complicated characteristic as an indulgent, arrogant hedonist who encounters such horrors and must take revenge. A wicked and senseless movie, almost, but not entirely rescued by the convincing performance of the central woman.
