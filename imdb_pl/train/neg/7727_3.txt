I am commenting on this miniseries from the perspective of someone who first read the novel. From this perspective, I can honestly say that although it is nice, I see why there has not been a retransmission recently. More specifically, this mini has some serious problems, such as: <br /> <br /> 1) This is terribly badly saved. Actors playing the younger generation were 15 to 20 years older than the characters. Ali McGraw (then 45) played Natalie Jastrow, which was supposed to be around 26. Jan-Michael Vincent (39) played Byron Henry, who was to be around 22 years old. Other children of Henry and Pamela Tudsbury were also played by actors too old for characters to be in their twenties. <br /> <br /> 2) Some of the acting was absolutely horrible. Ali McGraw sometimes made this mini unseeable. I've seen more convincing performances in high school plays. <br /> <br /> 3) The direction was poor. To be honest with Ali McGraw, bad behavior and character development were probably directing. Hitler's portrait was exaggerated. His character looked and acted more like a cartoon villain than a charismatic, sometimes charming, but always diabolical genius Herman Wouk painted him like in a novel. Some other characters are made so stereotypical (Berel Jastrow) that they do not gain the depth of the character that Wouk created for them. <br /> <br /> 4) This mini is very old. Hokey music, pretentious narrative (sounded like a middle school movie narrative) and the whole mini-opera in the style of prime-time soap made it almost comical. Also too often Byron and Natalie are disguised and they look like they were in 1979, not in 1939. <br /> <br /> Someone who watches this without the benefit of reading a novel will probably not be sitting by that's all, because it's going to be a more dramatic soap drama "take it too seriously" from the late '70s / early' 80s than the TV version of what's definitely a modern American classic. <br /> <br /> Remakes of older movies and the like are sometimes badly done, but this is probably one case where a creative and inspired director could make a very stunning, memorable and critically acclaimed production. I never see it happening because the remake would have to be so long (15 hours) or longer to do it well, and given the short time of focus of most of the current American viewers, it will not fly.
