Nothing will ruin the film as much as combining a poor script and bad direction. This is the case of the "Mummy's Tomb". <br /> <br /> The screenplay is a remnant of ideas from older, better Universal Horror movies such as "Dracula" and "Frankenstein". The direction is trivial and stale. Acting is mediocre. Even Kharis Chaneya is weak compared to Tom Tyler in "The Mummy's Hand", and producers are stupid enough to add material from the much better prequest Christy Cabanne and point the weakness of their own movie! I realized how bad the movie was, and re-wrote it from scratch two years later as "The Mummy's Ghost" with a much better script and better director. The result was probably the best movie in their four-movie Mummy, though not as good as Karl Freund's original in 1932. <br /> <br /> Pictures of Cabanne are picking up the movie on 3. The "new" stuff is at best 2. Dick Foran and Wallace Ford probably were happy that their characters were out, so they will not have to appear in the ruins any more !
