the author of the book, under the same title, should not allow her name to be used for this film. if you have read the book, this film has such a liberal interpretation of the real events in the book and its spirit that the film and the book seem to have little to do with the title and certain superficial details. the film adds nothing to the artistic output of the literary book. <br /> <br /> for those who have not read the book: you will also be disappointed. the plot not only moves at an incredibly slow pace, but does not offer anything more when it moves slowly (eg character development). some viewers may have fun in some lesbian love scenes in a later movie, but you might as well see a special showtime for things that show there and isabelle - it's quite tame and not really ingenious.
