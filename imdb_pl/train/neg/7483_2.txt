One might think (like me) that with Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese the film should be at least decent. These stars (especially Martin and Cleese) have produced some of the funniest works of the comedy of all time. <br /> <br /> Well, apparently I was wrong - this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It embarrasses me, as one joke after another can be so inconspicuous. It pains me to watch these talented actors who perform one of the most positively defective scenarios that I came across. Based only on big names, I remained hopeful for a long time, but consistently did not provide any entertainment. <br /> <br /> Usually, both in movies and in life, I try to stay away from biased comments and broad generalizations. But with this movie, it's hard not to break free. I can count on one hand, maybe even two or three fingers, the main Hollywood productions that made me more bitter. This is one of the worst comedies ever made. <br /> <br /> I tried to enjoy it --- really. But The Out-of-Towners finally fails miserably. If you really want time-efficient entertainment, just take the money and watch them spin when you drop them in the toilet. Just do not watch this movie.
