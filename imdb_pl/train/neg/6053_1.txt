absolutely rubbish. I liked Halloween and from then on, Johnny was in a spiral. it's about pits. we get it John. pro-lifers are terrifying! you do not have to make a shit movie that bores me to "tell" me. <br /> <br /> The pace is far away here. It looks like John does not have much to do here. in his opinion, it looks like he did not write this trash. It's countless times when the camera just sits and waits for the actors to look stupid or say something stupid. I love the long cut. too bad carpenter does not know how to use it. must hurry with Herzog and Fassbinder 30 years ago. Please, John, stop making a fool of yourself and bore me to death!
