Perhaps one of the worst teenage movies I've ever seen. I'll start with the bad parts of the movie, which largely covers the whole movie. Above all, something that nobody can avoid: HORRIBLE ACTION. I swear you've picked up some random street kids based on how they look. Secondly, BAD / UNCONVINING CHARACTER WORK / DEVELOPMENT. You almost do not know half of the dead children. All you think is that they deserve it in one way or another. The scarecrow figure was exaggerated and cheap cheats other great fantasy killers, such as Freddy or Pinhead. Next: BAD DIALOGUE: The scarecrow was full of terrible one-generation, which would make you laugh just because it was so terrible. Lines like "Let's go find small animals for torture!" Really leave you with a raised eyebrow. Last but not least: Next off: BAD CASTING. How old was the guy who played Lester? How 30? The back of his head was balding for God's sake. I can say a lot more about this film, for example about low-cost special effects, about the effort in the "school movie class", but this is understandable. It's just a bad movie at the worst. As for what I thought was "good" in the movie: - Keeping people low, low, LOW standards - It would help sleep down insomnia. - Very cheap laughs, even a giggle.
