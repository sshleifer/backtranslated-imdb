Do we really need more narcissistic garbage in the baby boomer generation? Technically, I am a Boomer, although at a time when all "idealistic youth" of the 1960s read Marx, burned their cards and generally prolonged the war that destroyed tens of thousands of lives; I was still in primary school. But I remember them well, and 9 out of 10 are stupid fools who would believe everything for as long as it would be destructive. <br /> <br /> This is just another exercise of importance for myself from children who never grew up.
