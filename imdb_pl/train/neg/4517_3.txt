There is a lot to offer: spectacular locations and flying sequences; period costumes, props and sets; and competent writing and acting. However, in order to enjoy the drama, we need at least one director who has certain qualities that we like or admire. In this group of feline snobs we found only one character who is nice at all? unfortunate enlisted man in a passing, peripheral role as their helpless victim. The review here clearly shows that we are completely out of step, but we have not considered their malicious behavior of the students to be fun or entertaining. Even the dog is disgusting. We threw the towel after two of the six episodes, so you should properly reject these observations, but what I found written about this mini-series did not give us reason to expect a transformation of the figure or redemption.
