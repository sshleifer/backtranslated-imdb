He hired her last night. The opening (2001) took too long in WAAAAAAAAAY. The hitchhiker scene did not serve the purpose. Some skits were simply delayed. I knew earlier that Chevy Chase was turned on for less than two minutes. No problem. Here are the best parts: <br /> <br /> KOKO, URANUS, BABS COMMERCIAL, Curtis Mayfield song <br /> <br /> Sum: 7 minutes of good footage from the 75-minute movie <br /> <br /> Everything the other was either preposterous or stupid as hell. <br /> <br /> Let me give you some advice: if you want a primitive movie that falsifies TV and movies, you can rent "Kentucky Fried Movie". If you want less impersonal impersonation of films and movies, rent "AMAZON KOBIETY NA KSIĘŻYY" or "UHF" <br /> <br /> Otherwise, do not bother to rent this movie. You will save 2-3 dollars. <br /> <br /> IMHO: Ken Shapiro's Best Film is STILL 'Modern Problems'
