Oh Geez ... There are so many other movies that I want to see there ... I got stuck with my nephew for the weekend and that's what he wanted - Yes ... <br /> <br /> I used to watch this program when I was in college. .. it was thoughtless, a bit fun and a little action-oriented. The show had a good heart ... and the characters were cute; no one has ever been killed or even badly wounded ... it was like a cartoon animation. Break for 2005 ... What happened? This one does not work. As others have said, there is simply no coherent story, and the performances are strange ... almost annoying - definitely not true to the original characters ... the whole thing is like a Mad TV sketch and lasts over 100 minutes! It was one of the few moments when I was EMBARRASSED watching the movie. What were they thinking? The best I can say, it had to be about product marketing, toys, etc. I can only say that let it die quickly. This makes the original Dukes of Hazzard look like the Masterpiece Theater ... <br /> <br /> I think that the only remake left to do with television is Gilligan's Island ... Good Luck!
