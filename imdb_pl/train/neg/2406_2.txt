From the mind of Harry Alan Towers comes another piece of film sediment. Apparently, based on the work of H. Rider Haggard, the only similarity that bears everything that Haggard actually wrote is that it takes place in Africa (although in Africa, which has dinosaurs - which our intrepid adventurers use to tow their kayaks! ) some characters with the same surnames. <br /> <br /> Our heroes (David McCallum, Patrick McNee and John Colico) set out to look for treasures, armed only with a medallion, and finish exactly where the treasure is, only by chance. Along the way, they meet a collection of extremely lame monsters, choose a French chef, and McCallum has an affair with Queen Phenicia. <br /> <br /> It's so funny, it's hoot. That's the only reason I did not give him 1.
