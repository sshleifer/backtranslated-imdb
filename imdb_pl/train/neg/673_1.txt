... let me count the ways. <br /> <br /> 1. "Remake" only the title, which draws all the clich√©s in the manual of the slass. <br /> <br /> 2. A plot so predictable that it becomes quite pathetic. <br /> <br /> 3. Completely poor performance of all tests at voltage or excitation. <br /> <br /> 4. PG-13 rating, which does not guarantee gore, violence or sex. <br /> <br /> 5. A black character who is not terrifying or even mysterious. <br /> <br /> 6. The cast of characters that are so poorly written and stereotyped that we could not care about them. <br /> <br /> 7. Lack of any effectively frightening atmosphere (in contrast to the original Prom Night). <br /> <br /> 8. A dialog script that is unbearable - it's numbness. <br /> <br /> 9. A series of cardboard performances (I do not know whether to blame the actors or the poor script mentioned earlier). <br /> <br /> 10. A completely inept teen-oriented remake who is not brave enough to try and have an imagination - or even show a puddle of blood. <br /> <br /> They are fanatical horror movies, not saving money. /> <br /> BOMB with ****
