The Inspector Gadget was probably my favorite cartoon of the '80s. I liked both the first and second season of the series, as well as the special Christmas "Inspector Gadget Save Christmas" from 1992. Some fans of gadgets quickly criticize the second season of the series (1985), but must compare it with the release of DiC from 2002 "Inspector Gadget's Last Case: Claw's Revenge", because the second season will be absolute gold. <br /> <br /> Being a fan of gadgets, I could not resist seeing an animated Inspector gadget in something that was not related to Gadget Boy. I bought a movie and I swore to myself that I would be objective; I knew that sometimes artistic liberties come from the original series. I was not even prepared for what I was going to watch. <br /> <br /> There was almost an untouched fragment of the original program. <br /> <br /> Here is a short list of only some of the cons for this movie: * Humor does not exist in the original series. <br /> <br /> * Penny and Brain (originally having almost equal parts in the series as Gadget) is missing in action for fifteen to twenty minutes intervals. <br /> <br /> * There is no original music by Saban and Levy, and the existing score is below normal. (It is understandable that Saban now has his own production company, but at least "Inspector Gadget Save Christmas" has good music, even without Saban). -kopter, gadget-key chain, gadget-hammer, gadget-coat (which was actually used, but not even called the same), as well as its other standard gadgets for hat and hand. In this movie, the legs of his gadget were telescopic instead of springs. Such things annoy the real fans of the show and are simply not needed to change. <br /> <br /> * The gadget from the original series is now a fast talking, supposedly "fashionable" convertible. All fans from the original series enjoyed a mobile gadget that turned into a gadget and vice versa. <br /> <br /> * Quimba's boss is very modest now, and even means Gadget. He was always grouchy in the original series, but it pushes the situation a bit. <br /> <br /> * Penny does not have a computer book anymore. <br /> <br /> Are there any positive features of this movie? OK, here goes ... <br /> <br /> * Maurice LaMarche is doing a good job, taking over the role of the great Don Adams as the Gadget Inspector. <br /> <br /> * In one scene, the head of Quimba refers to the real villain from the comic series: The Great Wambini (classic black character "Gadget" from the second season, directed by Louis Nye). <br /> <br /> Are you looking for additional factors for this movie? Well, you're not happy. Life is about making choices and living through these choices. Most life situations have a purpose, even if it is to teach. The lesson learned here: stick to the original formula! "If it's not broken, do not fix it." Fans of a real gadget should avoid this movie; you will definitely be disappointed. <br /> <br /> I hope DiC and Shout! The factory will continue to release more original series after the 2006 release of "Inspector Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1" containing the first 22 episodes of the series. As a true fan of gadgets, a lover of the 80's animation and many DiC programs, I encourage the viewer to buy "Inspector Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1" and "Inspector Gadget Save Christmas" DVDs that are perfect and will definitely bring back good memories.
