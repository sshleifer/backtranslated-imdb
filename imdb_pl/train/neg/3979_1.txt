OK, this is one of the worst 4 excuses I have ever had the misfortune to watch. Like all of Olsen's other twin films except for the New York minute, this movie had no history, no gaping storylines, disgustingly rotten acting and bad movies even !!!!!!!!! in case you do not guess yet, I hate MARY KATE AND ASHLEY !!!!!! The only reason I watched it was that I was really bored and nothing else was on it. I wonder if the twins will never stop doing the same stereotypical movies in which they have an incredibly stupid adventure in an exotic place and save the day, in the meantime getting help from two cute guys who immediately salivate over them. The least they could have a guy 4 1 of them or have them both 4 the same. The story in this story was so stupid and just stupid. even the toddler could see the defects. Perhaps they should separate and start making films individually, or maybe films with a different story. Anyone who liked this movie was not an insult - either really stupid or really artificial, or did not really see a good movie. or maybe they are really smart and they just have bad movie choices. in any case, I would not recommend this movie to my worst nemesis for a good movie experience ... the only thing that is good 4 is the laughter that rends the ribs with pathetic attempts to be cool. if he laughs, it's fun. I basically give 0 or less.
