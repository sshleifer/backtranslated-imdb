Elephants Dream was to be the flagship project of the open source community. And although it was a very interesting idea in the concept, it actually failed. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully rendered, which is probably the only convertible factor. However, a huge surplus of light heyday is a huge problem with them. It's horrible, although I think it helps to give the film the dream quality. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to the terrible voice. While the voice actor Prooga is at least partially competent, the voice actor Emo is NON-SMOKING. My guess is that when you have a budget that is basically zero, you can not afford to hire real voice actors. For me, it looks like they've hired one of the animators to make their voice. <br /> <br /> The movie does not go anywhere. It seems to me that this is rather a kind of movie "look what we can do" instead of a real movie. The plot does not go anywhere and it fails to show any interesting point. The whole film seems to be an excuse to create interesting areas. <br /> <br /> In general, it may be worth a quick download from the official site, but do not expect anything but nice graphics.
