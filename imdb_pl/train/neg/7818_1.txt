I usually do not leave the movie, but halfway. This movie promised something different, but I still thought I had not seen it before? Alert Spoiler! After returning to the spacecraft, it crashes and lands on the ground, well, all these years, with the super adult on board, this thing can still be burned and smashed! What, this advanced civilization does not seem to develop the chassis? For an industry that is so liberal, we can see another Woody Allen movie without blacks! Superman runs in circles to save people, making sure that he is holding on to Europe and the United States. Maybe I could take it about 30 years ago, but now.
