This early film by Adam Sandler can be compared to his life as a comic in the same period of 1989. The constant recognition by his character of his hidden comic book genius and the frustration associated with humorous material seems to have come from Sandler rather than the script. The movie is nothing compared to his hit feature films such as Big Daddy or even banal Billy Maddison. Unfortunately, Sandler has not yet found a way to express himself in a consistent, successful and funny way when the film was created, just like his character. Most of the "jokes" of the film come from Sandler, who talks with himself, usually about his unrecognized comic talent and beats because he is too ugly and can not get women. The film is also difficult to watch because it is not treated like a real movie. Sandler talks with the camera and viewers throughout the film, often referring to the low budget or questionable content of the film. The film is awkward and embarrassing to watch. I immediately wanted to forget that I even saw the movie after it ended, for fear that if she learned more about it, she would ruin Sandler's career. Give it to the video store, I rented it for free and it was still a waste of time.
