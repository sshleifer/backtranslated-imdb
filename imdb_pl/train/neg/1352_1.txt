Eytan Fox, though generally based on the apologetic side of Israeli politics, has made some very interesting films in the past, such as "Walk on Water" and simply the great movie "Yossi & Jagger". However, in "The Bubble" he took this illogical and unjust approach to extremes. <br /> <br /> Far from making this film a standing ovation, the people at the show, in which I participated quietly, got up and left. I silently quit, furious with anger at such an absurdly one-sided movie that explains self-preservation as racist abuse and racist abuse (and terrorism) as outbursts of justified anger; which means that the Arabs are so wronged by the evil Israelis that they react in anger to the constant flow of unilateral Israeli aggression against them, and therefore should not be held responsible for their actions. <br /> <br /> This movie was not worth the price I paid for the ticket (indeed, I was considering requesting a refund) and was basically an Israeli appeal to the Palestinian movie "Paradise Now." If you want to be anti-Israeli, watch this movie because it really justifies such a belief system. The fact that this film was made by an Israeli director, and worse, such a talented Israeli director, is a cry of shame. Indeed, how Israel may be surprised that it is considered a country of pariah when the Israelis themselves do such anti-Israeli propaganda, begging for faith. <br /> <br /> What a disgraceful, terrible little movie!
