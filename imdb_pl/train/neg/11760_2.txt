Amen to Magsel. There was a lot of confusion. First of all, how do you know which movie you are buying? Henry Cele plays in each of them. I bought this movie, thinking it was a miniserial ... WHAT IS LETDOWN !! It would be a comedy, but a rape of a young girl. David Hasselhoff (spelling?) Is it fine for popcorn TV, but he was not credible in this movie (where was his English accent?) AND WHAT WITH LOVE? The film was supposed to be a story about a young man reaching a military power - not a captain of a slave ship who plays with an English virgin looking for his daddy ... <br /> <br /> If I paid over $ 7 a movie for it, I would have to call the police - because it would be a crime!
