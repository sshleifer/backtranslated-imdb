I remember watching this movie several times as a very small child, and these were parts (in fact many) that I did not understand. I think I saw it once as an adult and then I understood these parts. The only problem with watching him as an adult was that it was not fun to me at all. What movie is this? Is this a "movie for children"? Not hard. Contains language and theme inappropriate for children. Is this the hyperbole of what each parent feels like, experiencing with their own children? Maybe, but why would not he focus more on the character of John Ritter than on Junior? When the film is 7-year-old as the main character to deal well with the audience, it should be a movie for seven and under the crowd, otherwise people older than this will have no relationship (even 8-year-olds would not like to watch a movie about a child which is much younger than them). I am sure that this film did not go well at the box office, and the reason must be that he was unable to find a niche on the market.
