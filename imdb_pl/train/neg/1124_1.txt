The opening shot was the best thing in this movie because it gave you the chance to see a passionate, well-made independent movie. Shit, this one opening the shot for filling me with hope. As the "film" evolved in a slow, slow way, my thoughts varied in relation to this "movie": was there too much butter in my popcorn? Did the actors have to pay the director for participating in this "film"? Has my ticket been approved at the box office? Yes, dear reader. I saw this movie in the theater! This would be the only exception I will make about watching a movie at home through the cinema, because you can turn it OFF at home. Were there any redemption values? Peter Lemongelli as a standard "gull" from college had his moments, especially in a dog collar. In addition, this "film" began with being a comedy, a family drama for spiritual improvement. None of these fronts has been achieved. Oh, and the girl was completely angry. Her performance was the only comedy I found.
