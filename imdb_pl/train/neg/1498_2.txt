The justification for what happened to his film in terms of distributors and secondary directors, drunks and receptionists rewriting the script aside, just take this film as it is offered without further explanation. <br /> <br /> This movie is awful. Straight in a whore. Instead of refreshing what can be used for the plot, I will launch a reel with interesting points that made me scratch my head. <br /> <br /> Class (5 people) going on a class trip inside friggin 'nowhere Ireland. These students can be Canadians or Americans, it's hard to say. The fact that the film was filmed in a Canadian forest, not in Ireland, is also obvious. One of the students seems to know nothing about history and is basically a figure of "stupid jockey" from many movies from a kicking ass from the 1980s, except when he sends Randy from Shout. One character can be Chris Klein's stuntman. He has a girlfriend who will probably be killed, but he will never settle. One character is grim and removed from peers ... just ... because ... and then there is a blonde. Yay blonde girl. <br /> <br /> Ireland has a population of 2. They are cousins. Gary, who is clearly the same age or younger than the rest of the cast, is sometimes called "sir". She is very sinister and wears a knitted cap. His cousin is a shapely porn star with the worst Irish accent that will fascinate me with the movie during life and most likely beyond. <br /> <br /> Picturesque Ireland has many Canadian forests and wetlands and 2 ducks that appear more than once the cut scenes. <br /> <br /> Manufacturers got a discount on false guts. Good for them. <br /> <br /> Unbeknownst, the weird freaks have access to new hunting knives. Perhaps there is an outdoor area nearby, with a blind and deaf official working in the register. <br /> <br /> I do not know if you mingle for about 600 years, because history leads us to believe that it happened, it is a bit uneven, but amazingly spry and quite strong. Genetics is a great dice game. <br /> <br /> There may be more than one freak in this movie. He appeals to "them" and we see shadows, but only one weird looking guy is ever seen. And when one strange-looking guy is finally killed, apparently the whole danger is exceeded. I run with my initial assumption that no one thought to give the other man a full make up, so they just used this one. At least it looks on the screen. <br /> <br /> Richard Grieco should be ashamed. <br /> <br /> It is also worth noting that in addition to these new, shiny knives, inbred freaks have access to some chic leather equipment, because when Richard Grieco crosses his ties, they are new ready for the next sucker, who becomes attached ... who also escapes because the chains give you enough freedom to simply undo them, wondering why even bother to tie anyone to yourself. <br /> <br /> A dead body in a hut will be driven by the worm after 2 hours. The dead body said will also have glasses when no figures wear them. Interesting. <br /> <br /> Jenna Jameson appears without reason on the left, talking for 2 minutes, disappears from the left. In the middle of a giant forest. This is not unusual because Gary can also jump out of nowhere, which is also known as anything that exists on television from the screen. <br /> <br /> Madam. Jameson dies with sadness and somehow her clothes disappear like my hopes that this movie will not suck the wind. <br /> <br /> I offer a special bow to the figure of the "breeder", a poor girl who has been used by freaks for months (or years) for breeding purposes. Poor girl who still has eye shadows and emotions on the camera with all the passion and conviction of a stuffed chihuahua. <br /> <br /> The ending of this movie was clearly marked by a drunkard or someone with a fierce mind disability that was cultivated and encouraged by excessive petrol drinking for years. <br /> <br /> Apparently it was not just the random crap I found in the film network late at night, apparently people heard about it and even followed it through its production. How sad for all of you. I have nothing more to say. May God have mercy on us all.
