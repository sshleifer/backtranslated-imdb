Well, it's 90 minutes of my life I will not be back. This movie makes the TV show "California Dreams" look like "Almost Famous." Acting was terrible and unrealistic. Do not even start with the actual band at the forefront of this story, lame songs, appearance, etc. You had to believe that they are one of the hottest bands in the country, and there is no irony in the world to accept it. The guitarist is seen as a heroin user, not because I blame him, if I was near such a disgusting band with bad songs and wooden actors, I would also inject a horse. <br /> <br /> If you take music seriously, avoid it at all costs.
