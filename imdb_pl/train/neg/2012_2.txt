Living in some future fascist or nearly fascist state that seriously limits personal freedoms is a recurring theme both in contemporary literature and filmmakers. Such works warn us of undesirable trends in our society, which should be considered; but to be effective, they must also be entertaining. Unfortunately, most books are probably more effective in publishing warnings than in amusing us enough to become really widely read; while with movies the problem is usually reversed. The first such work, which became truly widely known, was probably George Orwell's 1984 (published for the first time in 1948) and it is still available in both book and film form. <br /> <br /> Watch or read: and then, when you feel a little depressed by man's human inhumanity, reach for Cinderella 2000. It is a light, low-budget film comedy based on the same theme that provides easy but ungratefulness watching; as in 1984, the calendar exceeded its previous period. Most of the comedy overlaps the trowel, although there are only a few really funny moments. To train your mind in the long intervals between them, you can focus on asking if this movie will have a new life extension when it is released as a DVD or if it eventually disappears in obscurity because the existing tape copies make the redemption worse. Nowadays there are many worse films on DVD and I honestly do not care what happens in both directions. <br /> <br /> So far the best movie of this genre was probably "The Handmaiden's Tale", but I would gladly exchange them all for a well-made movie about Jack London's great novel "Iron Heel". It would be ambitious, but it still seems unbelievable that no modern filmmaker has ever dared to try it (IMDb only mentions the quiet black and white version made in Russia in 1919).
