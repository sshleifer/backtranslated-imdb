Five passengers in the bus depot tell themselves about their terrifying dreams, waiting for them to be taken. But is there more to these nightmares than at first glance? <br /> <br /> I'm lucky, five bad movies for the price of one! Each segment is characterized by the worst action, special effects, make-up and music. And these were to be terrifying? Hmm .. I think I was more scared during the episode of Teletubbies. I swear, you will sit as if I was, bored with tears in vain waiting for something interesting. Do not worry. It's never like that. Actually, I even stopped advertising quickly because it was much more entertaining than the main function. And the ending is the final option. Yes, none of this ever happened. If only the same can be said about the day on which I set the VCR to record this shoemaker .. 2/10
