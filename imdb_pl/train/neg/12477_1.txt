It's one of those movies where you and a group of friends are sitting over a beer, eating a pizza and laughing. Unfortunately, I watched for myself. My friends and I have rented a large block of films and we have never seen this movie. It was back and I thought it was not worth watching. I did it and I was impressed by how awful this movie is. <br /> <br /> I really like bad movies now and I would probably like this one if the "hero" was not so repulsive. The whole movie I hoped he'd put away this stupid sword and let someone kill him! In the film he does very few heroic things. He is fat, disgusting, stupid. He has fewer redemptive qualities than a villain. And what happened to all the naked chicks? I mean, I love naked chicks just like the next guy, but this movie went a little bit overboard in this department. <br /> <br /> Well, anyway, if you love bad movies and can stand the disgusting "hero", I'm sure you'll like this movie.
