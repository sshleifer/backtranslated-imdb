I gave this film the highest rating of 2 stars because it personally appears in minutes 42 and 43 of the movie .... a scene at a roadside bar in Russia. In this scene, the director of the film offered me an immortal line - "50 Dollars..You Drink and Talk", but I felt that my Polish counterpart could speak with a more convincing Russian accent than me, so I refused to take it in part. I was a bit nervous because it was my first film experience ... and who knows ... these lines could end up with lines like "I'll be back" and "Honestly, my dear, I'm not giving the damn thing". If I said this one line, my name would appear in the Rancid Aluminum subtitles as "Heavy 1" instead of the name of Ryszard Janikowski. <br /> <br /> Over time I am counting on my name being in no way associated with this movie. <br /> <br /> Although I spent the whole day on set, Barry Island in South Wales, no one could tell me what the real plot was. The catering companies and the lady from the closet agreed that it seems to have a lot of curses and nudity ..... it could certainly have been worse if I found myself naked in this scariest movie ... <br /> < br /> Nadal ..... On the positive side ... I talked to Rhys Ifans during one break. I had no idea who he was because "Notting Hill" had not yet been released, not the supposition that he might be a Welshman. I have made many inappropriate comments about how terrible the Barry Island cavity has become since my childhood visits in the '70s and' 80s. It was only when Keith Allen appeared that I realized that I was in good quality production ........
