This movie is horrible. Everything in it was done before. There is nothing original. I can not stand it when writers do not invent their own threads. <br /> <br /> The girl has a wish on her 13th birthday and wakes up as an adult. Hmm, it sounds like a movie from the 80s called Big. The acting of Jennifer Garner is even more annoying. She does not act like she was 13, she just behaves as if she was stupid. <br /> <br /> From that moment you can guess the whole story. She gets a good job and it happens that a friend she was 13 years old works with her. Wow, how wonderful! But no ... her friend is angry and turns away from her, trying to get her job. But, of course, he wins in the end when there is a "great" idea. <br /> <br /> There is also a dance scene in the film that I have seen thousands of times. <Br /> <br /> I hate this movie.
