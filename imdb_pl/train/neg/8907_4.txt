I rented it on DVD yesterday and did not realize it was a "character study" movie, so I fought to watch it an hour before I pressed the Stop button. <br /> <br /> Even with the topic research topic, I just could not enter the movie at all. Perhaps it was my mood when I wanted to watch something else, or maybe I had other expectations, but putting aside, I tried my best to finish watching, but I gave up. The actors played their roles well, but the global connection did not meet to keep my interest. The only interesting thing was the theft of the sergeant's gun, who hastily bought another, and the spray painted it black so that it would appear as a police force. I think this movie should be titled "Who stole the sergeant's gun"? The scenes were well done, but by combining them once again I felt robbed for anything coherent to see me. <br /> <br /> Because I have not finished watching, I would say that renting this movie is certain. .. maybe. For me it was a waste of good effort and time to watch. I will leave it to you, but I definitely do not recommend it.
