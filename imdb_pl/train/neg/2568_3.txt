Dear me ... Peter Sellers was one of the most weird talented actors. But his choice of films, say, after 1964, was very unfortunate. He did not seem to realize how to use his talents. It would be better if he worked with more Kubricks from the movie world than the people he did. From his later films, only "The Optimists of Nine Elms" and "Being There" impressed me with the ones I saw. <br /> <br /> Having said, Boultings and Sellers have made a few films before it does not sound so bad - I have not seen "Carlton Browne" and "Heavens Above!" yet - at least in the sense of good use of the Sellers to a certain extent. But "There a Girl in My Soup" really is a bad movie and a picky choice from the sellers. In your films from 1955-64 you can usually expect at least some very ingenious twist and always enigmatic belief about your roles. Here you have Peter Sellers trying to play a typical romantic trail. Almost Sellers play council Niven without joviality. He certainly does not convince, does not try as he can or create an interesting character. He should have left such parts to the masters of suavity, such as Cary Grant, and to concentrate on those intriguing dramatic and comic roles he was famous for. <br /> <br /> Hawn and Sellers really do not set up any real chemistry; it is not an easy, brilliant affair that has been perfected by William Powell and Myrna Loy. This is a very artificial knowledge, until the end - I know that this is part of the character of Danvers, which is a dry buyer of ladies, but it does not really change in a convincing way. Sellers also have a very neat way of playing "charm" ... this character really has no depth and really does not gain sympathy or interest of the viewer. Sellers go through movements in a way that you can not imagine, remembering the splendor of his changeable, iconoclastic performance in Lolita. <br /> <br /> There really is nothing to say about the plot, direction or character, to be honest, they leave little or no impression. It's really one of the most anemic, carefree, vicious and slightly boring movies I've ever seen. No "vehicle" for the undisputed talents of the Sellers. <br /> <br /> Mark: - * 1/2 / *****
