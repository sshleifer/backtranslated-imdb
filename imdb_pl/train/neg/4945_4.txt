Sure, this one is not really a hit, nor does it occupy such a position. "Dieter" is the name of a quite popular German musician who is either loved or hated for his kind of acting and that's exactly what this film is all about. It is based on the autobiography "Dieter Bohlen" written a few years ago, but it is not meant to be accurate. The film is full of sexual offensive content (at least for the American standard), which is fun (of course not for other "actors") or stupid - it depends on the individual type of humor or being "Bohlen" - Fan or not. From a technical point of view, there is not much to criticize. Speaking of me, I consider this movie an OK movie.
