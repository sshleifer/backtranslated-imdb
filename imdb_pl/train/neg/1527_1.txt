If you really want to really waste two hours of your life, do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Browse the list of TV programs. 2) Find the movie "Men in White". 3) When "Men in White" appears, sit down and watch. <br /> <br /> And that's all. After two hours of playing bad games, awful (and not funny) references to movies and experiencing something about the lowest possible production value in history, you will waste two hours of your life and wonder why. br /> <br /> Why did I do it? I was stupid enough to think that this movie could be really good. It was not. <br /> <br /> But on the other hand, if you're old enough to remember the Power Rangers, you can see familiar faces during the movie. Presumably, to save on production costs, Saban (who also creates Power Rangers), decided to freely shower the old monster costumes with a favorite series of all sticky toys throughout the movie. I noticed a few old monsters from the episodes I've seen since my childhood, so I think at least it can be said that it has some nostalgic value. <br /> <br /> But if you want to see the real power of Rangers monsters, go and see the Power Rangers. It is much better than this piece of rubbish. (And that says something!)
