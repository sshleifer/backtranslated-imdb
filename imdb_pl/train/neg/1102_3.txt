First of all, I have to admit that both films that I saw in this director, which I saw without titles, could lose points. My Czech is not bad, but after two of his films I would not even try to learn. Samotari is too cool. Too cool. It's about ten different story lines that intertwine with each other. It's not so unusual in a city the size of Prague (small, really.) The main characters are between 20 and 30 years old. They have a job and only one study. The best figure is a young Balkan girl. Her feelings are repeated by immigrants here every damn day. That's it. The only great character. Everyone else makes their own life hell on their own. How can I feel sorry for such obvious incompetence? There may be interesting passages with Japanese tourists, but do I need a different stereotype in the film? If you like good music, see this movie. If you want to laugh at the stupidity of others, see this movie. If you like irony and dry humor, see the original Jarmusch, not an imitation. In NO circumstances, we will not see Ondrick's film, Septej (Whisper.) Unless you like homophobic stereotypes.
