The fact that this movie was entitled to the most successful film in Swiss history makes me shake my head! It's true, but it's pathetic at the same time. A film about the Swiss army can be much better. <br /> <br /> The story sounds interesting at the beginning: Antonio Carrera (Michael Koch) is forced to release his army from the army when he is in the church, a wedding with his love Laura Moretti (Mia Aegerter). <br /> <br /> Acting does not really differ from just a few recruits drunk and stoned in reality. Melanie Winiger plays her role as the average Michelle Bluntschi, personally I find her annoying. <br /> <br /> The story contains a comedy combined with romance, which does not work as expected. The romance part is too tacky, and the comedic part is not fun at all, it's just a cheap rehearsal and it does not change throughout the whole movie. It's fun for 12-13 year-olds in kindergarten, but not for those who are looking for an entertaining comedy. Humor is weak, except for some photos. <br /> <br /> Dope? Cool! Theft? Cool! If you want the right comedy about the Swiss RS, make sure you have not yet released your military training, and even then do not expect too much! <br /> <br /> I'll give him 4 out of 10 stars because Marco Rima is pretty funny during his time on the screen. But not too much time on the screen
