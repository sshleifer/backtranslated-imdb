"Boom" has gained a reputation. With heavy actors Taylor, Burton, Noel Coward, Tennessee Williams and Joseph Losey, can you be tempted to think how bad it can be? Well, it's much worse than you can imagine. <br /> <br /> The sad and disturbing fact of the "Boom" seems to signal the fall and fall of these heavy players. Only director Joseph Losey fell deep thanks to "Modesty Blaise" and "Boom" (some would like to add "Secret Ceremony"), regained strength and in 1970 he created his best work, wonderful "Go-Between". <br /> <br /> The saddest of all is the work of Tennesee Williams. From the mid-1940s to the early 1960s, Williams wrote a number of plays that gained classic status, remaining in theatrical repertoire around the world, and many of them became very praised films. When William's muse left him, probably because of his known abuse of substance, she left him for good. Williams at its best is the dream of an actor that provides many unforgettable performances. (Was Ava Gardner or Deborah Kerr better than in the "Night of the Iguana"?), In particular Taylor, she shone in both "Kotek on the hot roof of a tin" and "Suddenly in summer". There is an anecdote in which Taylor allegedly asks John Gielguda if he will teach her to play Shakespeare, to which he replied: "if you teach me to play Tennessee Williams." If Gielgud saw "Boom," he would stick to his tongue. Taylor was simply never inferior, turning into a feverish action. Although her face is well-photographed, she is definitely nervous. In addition to physical collapse, she has since generally lost credibility as a serious actress with a series of completely forgetful (and worse) roles on her account. <br /> <br /> The same can be said about Burton. After short-time theater fame, he gained fame and fortune in Hollywood. But his work from that moment (1968) would be nothing short of extraordinary. <br /> <br /> Noel Coward has long since ceased to be a force in the theater in which his comedy in the salon has been replaced by likes of Williams and the British "furious young men." He seems to be having fun, but he barely manages to make fun of the man who had such talent. <br /> <br /> The only member of the cast who maintains her dignity is the young Joanna Shimkus, who in a few years would have lost her promising career on screen to become Miss Sidney Poitier. <br /> <br /> "Boom" reeks of indulgence; it just gets out of control. A rather sad career indicator went wrong, not a camp holiday, as some have suggested.
