I saw this movie for the first time on MST3K. And although I was laughing at my jokes, I do not think this movie is so bad. Sure it was a bit difficult to understand that this is certainly a low budget, but it has a very intriguing thread and I can honestly say that when I watched the version without MST3K, I was really funny. This film requires a remake in Hollywood.
