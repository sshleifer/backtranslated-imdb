I really can not think of anything good to say about this movie ... not one thing. The script is a nightmare ... the writer blurs the boundary between chemical and biological features and does not seem to understand the difference. One would think that at least they will get a technical adviser. The performances were bad for most actors ... although I do not blame them too much ... the material really stinks. The editing was just as bad ... I'll just stop ... everything is bad 2/10
