The "A Tough Winter" with two storylines completes the entire publishing schedule of "Our Gang" from 1929-30. First, Wheezer and Mary Ann, lonely at home on a winter day, decide to do a bit of taffy. Little Wheezer gives Mary Ann directions from the cooking show on the radio. Problem: Wheezer transmits information from various programs, and Mary Ann puts the soap in the mix! Funny moments happen when the rest of the gang appears to pull taffy - and end up in the whole house! <br /> <br /> The second story is about Stepin Fetchit, the neighbor / golden hand of Gang, and his interactions with Gang. <br /> <br /> "Difficult winter", to my knowledge, have never been shown on television, although they are available in home movies. The reason for this is the characteristics of Stepin Fetchit, which shows a variable, sly and slow figure. Producer "Our Gang" Hal Roach called Fetchit "a qualified comic" and used this entry "Our Gang" as the pilot of the comedy series Fetchit, who never saw the light of day. It is understandable that Fetchit's characteristics are offensive to many people today, which explains why the film was put on the shelf. <br /> <br /> Although there are some fun moments with both Fetchit and taffy, "A Tough Winter" is a plodding and winding effort. If one of the positives came out of this movie, Hal Roach Studios gained confidence and experience in creating gadgets. The sound in the film is good, and some sound effects are very funny. For this reason, this film partially paved the way for the excellent films "Our Gang" from 1930-31. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
