The only good thing about this movie was the shot of Goldie Hawn standing in her French bikini panties and fighting for a dozen other depraved women not to take off her scant cotton top while she giggled and cooed. Ooooof! Her loins compete with Nina Hartley's loins. This movie appeared when I was fourteen and this shot almost killed me. I forgot all of this, hidden in the naughty Roladeks of my mind, until I saw him one day on television, where they actually smeared her belly in this scene, a good sadness, reminding me of how a burning woman in Goldie Hawn was in the '80s. Kurt Russell had to have a nice life.
