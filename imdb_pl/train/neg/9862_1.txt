I could not believe it when I put this movie on my DVD player. I thought I would laugh because I played D & D for half my life. I had to turn him off because I had company and wondered what shit I was watching. <br /> <br /> I finished it later, and I should have left it in the soft-core gay clusters of porn beginning. No, they run a gameplay joke, jokes with cum, incest, racism, dressing up for KKK ... This movie is hopeless for anyone who has ever played D & D. <br /> <br /> No wonder it looks like Real D & D would not let them use their game. Who would want to be included in this name?
