This movie was on the Romance channel and I thought it could be a silly movie of the 80's, which would be nice at some level, so my brother and I watched it. The boy was sucking. The boy falls in love with the girl - correction, his * dream * - girl (apparently there is a difference, and I am surprised that he realized that he was his dream girlfriend - he was hit by her for over 30 feet, just shows the power of dream girls), the boy ends the masquerade as a woman, to be close to the dream-girl (creative in the sense that it is a far-reaching plan, but non-creative in the sense that there are probably better solutions that you can come up with), inconvenient situations, match (everything it seems to take place late afternoon - either the location was somehow responsible for this strange lighting, or the actors had to wait for them to get off) from their daily routine to approach the set, I suspect the latter). Very awkwardly done, very pathetic. Almost never is it funny * accidentally *, so there really is nothing to redeem. Unless you're interested in Chad Lowe's early days, before he finally gets a piece of cake with his role as a gay HIV-positive in "Life Goes On" or Gail O'Grady who was on NYPD Blue and probably had to stare in the buttocks of Dennis Franz. But these are unlikely motives - I would say that "systematic disruption of the senses" would be a more legitimate goal. I'm surprised that I watched it all. I think it's something like halfway you are * still * observing because of some morbid, self-flagellist internal problem and you think you might as well finish it, so you can tell your friends and family that I was actually sitting in such a horrible movie, with no chance that it will bring you some sympathy for the dubious state of mental health. Can you * take * a challenge?
