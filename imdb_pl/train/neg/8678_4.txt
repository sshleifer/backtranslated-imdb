After seeing "The Bodyguard" yesterday, I felt compelled to write a review. <br /> <br /> It could have been quite a decent movie, if it was not for the awful work with the camera. It was annoying. All angles were bad, you could not see anything, especially during the fight sequence. The close-ups were even terrible. <br /> <br /> The story has Sonny Chiba who hires himself as a bodyguard for anyone who wants to bring him to the top of the drug ring. Judy Lee approaches him, who is never quite straight with Chiba. Lee's involvement in the drug ring is deeper than Chiba thought, when the mafia and other gang of bandits follow her. <br /> <br /> The story was decent and despite terrible dubbing, it could have been a good movie. Given better direction and editing, I'm sure it would be a classic Kung Foo movie. How it is, it's more like another shoddy action movie from the 70s. <br /> <br /> Note: The opening sequence has a quote known to fans of "Pulp Fiction", and then continues to karate in Times Square, which is in no way no connection to the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 10
