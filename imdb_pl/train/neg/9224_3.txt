Style, but without substance. Not as much fun as it should be. Not as deep as he wants to be. <br /> <br /> This is another genre of films about the difficulties of filming. A young filmmaker is hired to complete the campus science fiction movie from the 1960s called Codename: Dragonfly. Think Barbarella, or Danger Diabolique. <br /> <br /> But Jeremy Davies is a rebellious filmmaker. He is not a hack, he is an artist. The film he wants to do is the diary of his life. Hardly original. <br /> <br /> All characters other than the filmmaker Jeremy Davies are thin as rice paper. We will present characters that may be interesting, such as his father, a double, or Jason Schwarzmann as hack manager, and then show the door without adding anything. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of sweetness, but when compared to other films about filmmakers like Stardust Memories or 8 1/2 it bled in comparison. These films are funny, provocative with well-developed characters. These films have lessons that are used outdoors. <br /> <br /> The movie wants to be comical and campy, but its derivative and there is not one funny scene. The creators of the film describe it as a shipment, but what is the satirical goal? Actors say it's a tribute, but I think I would prefer a full-length version of Codename: Dragonfly. <br /> <br /> Coppola is clearly amused by the scenery, which can be seen in the visual humor of the sci-fi film in the film. But he does not share with us why we should be amused. <br /> <br /> In addition to science fiction, it's just a mess. There are continuity errors, the creator chooses a sci-fi weapon after it has already been selected. What? <br /> <br /> Only because the director has a stage where the critics complain about the lack of a story, the lack of a point, the scene in which he admit to empty cunning, does not mean that he touched on these critics. <br /> <br /> I suppose if your Roman Coppola can escape from making a movie about an indomitable idealist filmmaker who does not know what he wants to say, so he says nothing. In this sense, it can be considered autobiographical. <br /> <br /> If I had a choice, I would watch it in Circuit City on the wall of full TVs. Watch the 15-minute Codename: Dragonfly videos on DVD as add-ons, then send them back.
