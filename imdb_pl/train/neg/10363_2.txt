I grew up on the interwoven stories of the Wrinkle Chronicle in time. My dream was that one day the screenwriter would come across his child sitting on a large couch reading "Winkle in Time" and he would think what an amazing movie it was. Unfortunately, the screenwriter failed, changed characters, lame humor and destroyed the plot. I know it's hard to change a good-loved novel into a movie. But why can not you stay true to the book? Why do you have to change the way you think and act? For those who have not read the book, pick it up, find a soft couch and let your imagination go wild.
