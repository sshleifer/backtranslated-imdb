Oh, man, how low serial numbers got in 1952! This boring thing is the kind of show that Annie Wilkes (from Misera) was upset with. The heroes not only flee from the traps, adding scenes that were not in the previous chapter (and which could not be there - tell me that when the villains blow up the plain in episodes 7 to 8, they will not see the characters jumping), but I think that the series has a world record record. I mean, most of it is movie footage! And not only from other series (apparently all flying sequences are from King of the Rocket Men, and cool scenes of "melted rocks" from episode 2 to 3 come from Adventures of Captain Marvel), but from yourself! The entire sequence "trip to the Moon" (which is probably the shortest in history, it lasts 30 seconds, and the characters never leave the Earth's atmosphere) from episode 1 repeats itself in episode 8! And episode 10 is ALL scenes from previous episodes! (Have you ever wondered why MST3K never made episodes 10, 11 or 12? Well, they had to stop working after 9, so they did not have to do everything again!). <br /> <br /> Do not take me started on the scientific factor. Get ready for the sunniest moon in history! And the Moon people who can not breathe their own world? What were they smoking? <br /> <br /> And if it is not enough, it is too talkative and acrobatics (usually the best in the series) are few and far away. Visually, am I the only person who thinks that a Commando Cody-shaped (or maybe lemon-shaped) bullet is completely ridiculous? Rocketeer was much colder, no matter how bad the movie was (and man was horrible). A tank-like vehicle is not much better, it looks like a group of kids did it for Halloween. The only positive thing I can think of is that the actor who plays the hero is familiar instead of the usual muscular hunk (hey, everyone has the right to be a hero!), But then he is so unattractive ... <br /> <br /> Even not worth watching because of nostalgia. Instead, look Captain Marvel. 2/10. <br /> <br /> (BTW, check out the Notable Quotes section for the true Lib women's pearl).
