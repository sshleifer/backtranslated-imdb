As a cinema enthusiast, White Noise was a complete disappointment, as the filmmaker the photos were quite good, nicely lit, good camera work, reasonable direction. But as a movie it's just as predictable as all other "so-called" horrors that have recently been flooded by the market. Although it had a bit of "coolness", the whole concept of E.V.O (Electronic Voice Phenomena) did not seem credible. This movie did not explain the reasoning of some events, but he went with them. Acting was far from blowing your mind, because the main character showed no emotion, like many recent thrillers / horrors. <br /> <br /> It's definitely not a movie I buy on a DVD and I do not recommend it to anyone to take care of it.
