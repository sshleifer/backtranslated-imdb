Wow. I do not even remember so much about this film, except it stinks. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically; the girl's parents neglect her, so this little PokeMon pretends to be her father. Am I the only one who is worried about this? Then this freak PokeMon kidnaps Ash's mother to pretend to be a girl. I do not care if he tried to make the girl happy, it's just disgusting. <br /> <br /> There was no real conspiracy. The girl was just an ugly brat who wanted things in his own way. She played with Unowns, she was the "daughter" of Entei and apparently she could grow and shrink with a whim with the help of her "daddy". <br /> <br /> That's all I remember, I think you can treat it as a hint and not see it. (Or if you see it, do not expect too much.) 1 of 10. <br /> <br /> Seriously. If you want PokeMon movie, rent "PokeMon; first movie. "
