This movie is not funny. It's not funny. It does not contain a single second of originality or intelligence, nor does it cause the slightest interest in characters or situations. Added to the fact that it is such a young movie, like everything in the latest memory. It's as if a group of 14 or 15-year-old high school students who have never met or had any relationship with a real girl, sat down and wrote a movie based on their erroneous fantasies about what an adult would be. This film is boring, disgustingly repulsive, and sometimes offensive and disgusting. At most, it contains one or two moments that make you laugh. In addition, it seems twice as long as 85 minutes of working time.
