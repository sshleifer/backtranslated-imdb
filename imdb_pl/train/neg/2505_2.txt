In interviews and performances, I saw enough of both Little Richard and the rather poor Leon written in these biographies of the 1950s and 1960s to know that Leon was not a suitable actor for this role. Leon was just as good as David Ruffin in The Temptations, but he completely misses the essence of Little Richard in this movie. <br /> <br /> Actor Miguel Núñez, who played Little Richard in "Why Do Fools Fall in Love?" was a much more appropriate choice, because he drew a powerful but effeminate personality music. <br /> <br /> If the performances are inconclusive, the film will also be. And that's what happened here. Glossed in full or missed are LR trips into homosexuality and voyeurism. What "The Temptations" did so well in getting the group up, nipples and everything, this movie longs for a wide sign. <br /> <br /> What's up with director Robert Townsend who started "The Hollywood Shuffle" so well? He is a talented, funny guy, but he did not provide anything similar to the first effort.
