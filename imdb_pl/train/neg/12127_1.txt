Sorry, Fulci fans, but I could not go through this. The soundtrack was as annoying as it appeared, the acting was childish, the story was made and done, and the direction did not exist. <br /> <br /> The massacre honestly looked like a movie project for children. But I have seen some of them and actually look better than it! It seems that he was so underfinanced that they could not afford ... Whatever! No doP, no director, no one even knew what acting was. It was a very poor film experience; one of my worst. <br /> <br /> It was the worst fete I saw, alongside Terror Toons, who is second after Killer Klowns from Outer Space. I have nothing else to say about it. <br /> <br /> Ocenia 0.1 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
