In Cold Blood was one of several films from the 1960s that created a new vision of violence in the Hollywood film industry. Capote coined the phrase "non-fiction novel" to describe the book on which this movie is based, and the spirit of this form was transferred to the film script he wrote together. Despite the fact that we were in the era of color film, Richard Brooks decided to present the film in black and white to emphasize both the severity of the landscape and grim history. This is the first problem with the TV remake - color changes the tone of history. In addition, limiting the filming of a television production reduces the possibilities of framing and focusing photos. As a result, we lose a dramatic clash that makes the second part of the original movie (police interviews, trial, imprisonment and execution) so claustrophobic. On the small screen this is the next version of Law and Order spin-offs. <br /> <br /> Searches for scripts in Hollywood are constantly returning to films that have been successful in a different age. Usually this is a mistake, and this is no exception. <br /> <br /> All actors are competent. The script is fine. Directing does not bother you. Simply, the movie does not work like an original precision instrument. It does not attract the viewer to ambivalence towards Smith and Hickock, which provokes the original film. At the end of the television version, we have the feeling: "Ho hum, who cares?" <br /> <br /> First, look at the original on such a large screen as possible, then watch the TV version just to understand why the first of them was such an important film in 1967. <br /> <br /> It would not hurt to go online and read a little about Capote and the original book. It will help you understand the extraordinary effort he has put into the material, as well as some controversy about the book and the film. <br /> <br /> Actually, I gave only 4, because I write the bottom three rankings of real bombs - those that enraged you about getting involved in spending
