This movie is unbelievably funny. I love horror movies, but this is the worst movie I've ever seen. I am a big fan of gore, but most of the deaths in this movie are not shown. It just shows us dead bodies, and the only death scenes that actually show in this movie are horrible. The graphics look so fake. The actors are terrible too. None of them has real emotions. Not only was I wasting time watching this part of the film sh * t, but I had to give in to the actual footage of animals being beaten at the beginning. If I could rate it -10, I would do it. F * ck this movie. It's nonsense. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this.
