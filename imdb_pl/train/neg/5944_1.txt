Not really my genre, this street fighting action on DVD is one that I met only thanks to the friend who founded it, while we had a few beers. I'm relatively open and I'm a fan of Eamnon Walker, so I sat back to enjoy myself. <br /> <br /> Blood and bone is the story of Isiah Bone, an ex-kon who becomes a street warrior for unclear reasons that eventually develop as the film progresses. Blah blah blah. <br /> <br /> What a boring movie. I understand that such films do not rely heavily on the story, but are they dealing with such a stupid, predictable and completely stupid plot? It may not be important, but thanks to the golly gum it annoys me. It is better not to have a plot and pure action than the art of tramping in a narrative. Inspired by a completely ungrounded and unattainable sentimental sentiment, he is the cinematic equivalent of a turkey with thin skin stuffed with a rotten interior. I should probably mention here at this point, which is obviously the starting point of the film: fights. Even the fight itself is rather weak. Bone manages to eliminate well-established street fighters in individual blows (a large oaf or two are bold attempts by filmmakers to remedy this incoherence); warriors who never seem to claim that attacking one by one is a stupid trick. Even this is repetitive and stupid, shoulders are broken and faces are kicked with constant lust, which we see again and again. <br /> <br /> The run of the mill, movie after the film, which fully deserves straight to the status of the DVD, not doing absolutely nothing new and everything we have seen again and again. And not even well.
