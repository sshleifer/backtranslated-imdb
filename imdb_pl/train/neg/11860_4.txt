If you have not understood what will happen in this video in the first five minutes, give it a few more minutes. Lilia is a widow. She has been on the shelf for too long and wants to explode. He has a teenage daughter who only emphasizes that he is not getting younger. By checking her daughter, she discovers a world she has never dared ... a cabaret in which she can dance her belly in scant sequins, while men throw money at her. The film is very misogamistic. This portrait of men is bleak. This is quite strange when Lilia bends down to shut them down, not for money, but for hell. When she manages to arouse, she makes her feel like a woman again. I do not want to connect with them, but it depends on the attention. The other dancers are mainly aging women who look like men in resistance and realize that their time in the spotlight is short-lived. Not short enough, I say. Finds an affair, however short, you guessed it ... We did not see any surprises here. Although the ending is good, you realize that it could not end up in any other way. Maybe this movie simply is not aimed at my demographic group - 30 men
