This movie is faked in the episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think MST3K was the best when they were playing this movie. <br /> <br /> Horrible acting, bad makeup, bad effects, chick in scant lingerie. I give him 2. <br /> <br /> The villain is difficult to understand because of makeup. Assistant says things like "not you" that sound like NACHOO !! (think about sneezing). It is only a poor oration. Long eyebrows are fun on one of the characters. <br /> <br /> I still do not know what "The Projected Man" means in terms of the plot. However, I missed a little beginning. <br /> <br /> What's happening with this 10-line minimum when sending?
