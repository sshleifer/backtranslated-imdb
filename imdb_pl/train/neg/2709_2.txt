The only way to get something out of this movie is to approach it as a comedy. Seen in this light, it brings. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a serious movie, look somewhere else. This film has absolutely no depth and offers little more than a cursory and one-dimensional study of "problems" without insight. <br /> <br /> Making a movie about stereotypes and then giving each character a stereotype in a film is a very weak strategy - especially when the same characters break their trite forms in a predictable, stereotypical way. <br /> <br /> Busta Rhymes and Ice Cube make the movie almost to watch, and Michael Rappaport has a good performance, but the script is so horrible, and social commentary is so trivial that it's hard to find something repurchasing.
