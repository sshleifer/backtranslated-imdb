I saw this movie last night and even after a few beers the only giggle that this movie seemed to me was when I realized that I was actually watching it. in a word, it is not funny. Not funny. I completely believe that the curiosities about Jack Black apologize for making this trash. I can not believe that Barry Levinson simply did not drop this script when he read the first page. Anyway, I can not believe I've watched over ten minutes of this. <br /> <br /> I gave him 3 out of 10 * because I love watching Christopher Walken making terrible videos for payoff. also the "cork" horse, simply existing as a character in this movie, is actually quite ridiculous.
