This movie "Joshua" is extremely disturbing and almost pointless. It makes me flinch at the thought that there are people who like to watch it. Without revealing the story, it is about the reaction of the young boy to his newborn sister, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. Throughout this video, the viewer is subjected to the most disturbing child behavior imaginable. Adding an insult to injury, at the end of this movie there is absolutely no real result, except for the fruit of pure evil at the hands of a child who has outwitted the whole group of stupid adults. There is no redemption, no justice and a whole group of adults who are not intelligent enough to see what is going on around them. Honestly, I did not like watching this movie. It was very disturbing. Even for those who can enjoy horror movies, this movie can be too big. Despite the fact that this film was well-preserved, the story itself is so disturbing that watching it was equivalent to a 90-minute waiting in the waiting room of a dentist waiting for a painful dental procedure.
