The fourth function "Trembling" goes back to 1889. "Legend begins" in the small city "Perfection", which was then "Rejection, Nevada". When history begins, seventeen miners are killed by ghostly "Graboids". Some characters from today's films "Tremors" in the past have ancestors, both figurative and literal. Michael Gross (as Hiram Gummer) is still the most obvious one. Unlike his offspring, Mr. Gross is clumsy with firearms; so he hires a gunman, Billy Drago (as "Black Hand" Kelly) to shoot them "Dirt Dragons". <br /> <br /> This one requires a little habit - as it is in the distant past. It's like a western with miniature versions of the original "Graboids" monster. These tamers of "Dirt Dragons" are nowhere as terrorizing as their counterparts "Tremors" (1990). Therefore, in this movie, characters spend a lot of time on the ground, which would not happen in the original movie. And it was strange that the citizens so quickly resigned from the fight when Gross temporarily decided to leave the city. Why so helpless? Why did Brent Roam (as Juan Pedilla) not mobilize people to fight without Gross? Disappointing. <br /> <br /> **** Tremors 4: The Legend Begins (2004) S.S.
