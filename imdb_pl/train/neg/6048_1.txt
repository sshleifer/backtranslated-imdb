Even boring, if possible, than the original (I hope I can say it according to the IMDb guidelines). FRENCH CONNECTION at least tried to absorb European influence to complicate the conventional view of the American police detective, even if the attempt was broken by Friedkin's ambivalence, Americanism and general orientation. (Relative) The artistic boom in the 1960s (especially with nouvelle vague) allowed for a huge influence of Hollywood cinema in Hollywood. This has imposed a new vigor and complexity of the tired medium, and in the best of them (eg BONNIE I CLYDE, the early Scorcese), a new subversion of the received practice. The original CONNECTION was part of this movement, with its difficult style and anti-detective character. TWO is a right-wing confirmation of American values ​​in old Hollywood. <br /> <br /> This is reflected in the very tiring dialectics of America - France. For example, TWO is shot dead like a French policeman from the '70s. Of course, the French insisted on the size of American films when they were ignored at home, and this is in a way a reclamation, a warning against Gallic presumption. This can be seen on the example of two films. CONNECTION has French gangsters invading New York, with the French style suppressing the American thriller - it leads to the disintegration of the detective figure and the unresolved conspiracy - the evil thief has escaped. <br /> <br /> TWO has an American returning to France, with American thriller values ​​imposed on the native genre - the power of the detective is again confirmed and conventional resolution is achieved. This is further refined in Doyle's relationship with French inspector Barthelma, whose dominant influence must shake off before he can control the plot. <br /> <br /> It seems that TWO follows the original, undermining the detective hero. From the very beginning, Doyle's importance diminishes at every turn. Despite the ending, CONNECTION is considered a hero. But he is an American in a foreign country, and his inability to control his language or morals means he can not dominate the conspiracy. He even misinterprets the police signs, confusing the informer with the criminal and killing him. <br /> <br /> The power of the detective comes from his power as an entity to watch and interpret, but Doyle spends most of the film watched, controlled, object, body (literally in scenes after he is abandoned by Charnier) to watch and interpret . At CONNECTION he initiated the action, chasing criminals, forcing a plot; here he is passive, tied to a bed, locked in a cell, addicted, dependent. <br /> <br /> This loss of phallic power is probably symbolized by the loss of weapons, and the film follows a depressingly familiar oedipal trajectory. In the heroin sequences, he is comforted by an elderly lady who says she looks like her son. His state of intoxication is like a return to the uterus, deprived of adult pressure. Her taking of the watch strengthens the timelessness of this state, which is doubly significant for a man whose career depends on schedules and precision. <br /> <br /> Oedipus was the first detective, and to avoid his fate, Doyle must reject this false mother who resolves her uniform identity and kills her father (Charnier) so that he can accept his accepted male role in society. Psychoanalytic theory was popular among scientists in the 1970s (ironically inspired by Frenchman Jacques Lacan), but it is rare for a movie to be so literally full. <br /> <br /> If all these facts were aimed at minimizing Doyle, the style of the film did not. Friedkin distanced us from his hero, refusing to empathize or motivate the characters, focusing on the mechanics of the story. Here, Doyle is a very conventional hero of Hollywood. Instead of getting lost in a dark, long shot, it becomes knowable and understandable to the viewer thanks to traditional devices - close shots, close-up, photo-linking etc. <br /> <br /> TWO is all about the fall and rise of Popeye Doyle. In this case, the plot is subordinate to action, which is mere hackmanship. Cold turkey scenes, despite their nausea, do not interfere. We can divide us rather than observe; it's a much less unpleasant experience. The scenes are also shot by lachrymos male sentimentality, which is very American. <br /> <br /> So while CONNECTION has tried to imitate the complex thrillers of Jean Pierre Melville, TWO is doing the opposite. A gangster appeared in LE SAMOURAI Melville, who initiated the film in its entirety, powerful, beyond the language, and outlined its disintegration. TWO begins with a disintegrated character, achieved in part by the inability to use a language whose domination begins when it goes beyond language - the final sequences of actions are largely without words. <br /> <br /> In the film language and language are important because they repair and undermine the detective, but when he regains his power (oriented in the return of weapons and the cathartic burning of the original defenselessness, the skyscraper in which Charnier held him), the surroundings of Marseilles it becomes more and more unimportant, and the mythical distance that can take place anywhere takes control. Compare the ends of the two films: one admits ambiguity and despair, the other to absolute certainty. <br /> <br />
