Man, even Plan 9 From Outer Space is better than this movie. This movie does not have enough plot for half an hour, but it has been extended for over an hour. Jet Li and Corey Yuen are quite good, especially in these exaggerated fight scenes, but things like The Legend of Fong Sai Yuk are much better than the pitiful thing that would be better left unpowered.
