Do you have your in-laws for the weekend? This is a movie that will speed up their departure if it does not trigger a catatonic condition that will bring welcome relief from constant teasing. <br /> <br /> The movie is supposedly set on board a luxury cruise ship, which is a more superannuated car ferry; the plot has more holes than the average colander and casting deepened from the depths of the D star list. An interesting addition is the game "Spot the Villain", when passengers join the ship. You will not be wrong !!!! With a scenario that sinks faster than brick, clichÃ© songs and copious amounts of raspberry jam doubling like blood, this film tries to include thriller, action and gore-fest genres, while it does not meet any of them. > <br /> He must watch a movie, if only to laugh about how bad it is.
