I wonder how much this movie really has in common with the 1984 film "Bachelor Party", with Tom Hanks in the lead role. Is this film even an official continuation? This film is missing in every department and apparently it is better not to watch it. <br /> <br /> In the case of comedy, this movie is simply not good enough or funny enough. It is based mainly on the stereotypical assessment of the character, not on the film, which contains a few good, original and funny moments. <br /> <br /> Of course there are also very few stories and naked breasts than script pages. Just wait until things finally start. There is a main plot there somewhere, but this one is so unoriginal and it is so badly made in the film that it seems to be something non-existent. I think that there is a message and a moral story somewhere, but it is again so unoriginal and badly done in the film that it just does not work. <br /> <br /> It's basically a typical teenage comedy full of jokes and sexual nudity, only without teenage main characters, which makes the story even more sad and tasteless. The film makes really bad jokes that are out of place for every type of movie. <br /> <br /> I regret that I have never seen it. <br /> <br /> 3/10
