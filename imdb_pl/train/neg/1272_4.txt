Has anyone noticed when they are in the car every time the camera changes direction. Similarly to one scene, it is one residential strip with pavements, and then on a multi-lane highway with a divider, next to a two-lane national road with double yellow stripes. I understand a low budget, but it was just a sloppy film job. <br /> <br /> I also read other reviews and I do not agree that it was a bad movie. I think if you're a fan of Paul Reiser and his comedy, you can enjoy this movie. However, if you think that his work / is not fun, I recommend moving away from it.
