I do not understand how these animated movies are still appearing and no matter how good (or bad) it is that people love them. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with my two children (5,7). They like almost everything animated (like most people who rated this movie). The theater was almost full and I could not wait to see a movie with its great cast. In truth, I was bored stupid. It was unbelievably predictable and simply indistinct. There were a few chuckles in the whole movie and that's all. Of course, they tried again and again to get cheap laughter, but they just did not work. My son almost always tells me he wants a DVD after watching an animated movie, but not on it. My daughter fell asleep halfway. Also, it seemed to the children that the character's animation looked strange. I have not heard about it since I saw the Polar Express who gave my daughter a nightmare. <br /> <br /> Trust me, I'm not the type who looks for a negative in everything. But quality is quality and just like many animated movies that cast there, it has very little.
