I rented this movie tonight because it looked like a funny movie. I came to the conclusion that you really can not go wrong with the Ex Girlfriend concept with super powers. <br /> <br /> ... but the film was confused and pointless ... <br /> <br /> it seemed that the writer still threw garbage at every step. Also, the writer was constantly throwing a lot of toiletry and sexual situations that only a teenage boy could love. <br /> <br /> It seems that drawing a story from the hero Fatal Attraction Super could be so simple, but probably not. <br /> <br /> This is not a funny romantic comedy in which she was advertised. You could not take your child to see it, and you would be embarrassed to see it was a date. <br /> <br /> If the writer could make a basic story around a high concept and clean it - the movie may have a chance to fight. <br /> <br /> A serious waste of time. <br /> <br /> B
