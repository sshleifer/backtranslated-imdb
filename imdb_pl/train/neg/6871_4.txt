Great concept went wrong. Poor acting, even worse writing ... After watching the first two episodes, I was wondering why he managed to get to the second season. The characters are forgotten, the letter is weak, the sets are just right. The special effects are simply sad - much better done at the same time - where is the money? The first episode begins interestingly, and then quickly disappears - the order of the whole show is simply stupid. Do not get me wrong, I'm a huge Sci-Fi fan and a "maniac" - but this program simply does not cut it. As I said at the beginning, I'm really surprised that he managed to get to the second season - much better was canceled after one season (for example Jake 2.0). This performance was simply bad.
