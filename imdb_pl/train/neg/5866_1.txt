I remember this movie when I was 13 years old (it seems that many reviews speak the same as AGE 13!) With a group of school buddies. We all wanted to see Billy Crystal in his first film and fell in love with typical commercials that told us it was a great comedy. We suffered for about 45 minutes and all agreed to leave the theater. It was grotesque and tasteless, and far from the ability of Billy Crystal to make us laugh, we did not laugh. I came across this review by accident and decided to register just to tell the rest of the world what a waste of film, now, if you rent it, you deserve what you get, YOU WERE A WINNER !!
