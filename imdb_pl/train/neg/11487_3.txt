The best shorts Laurel and Hardy are filled to the brim with disasters, accidents and destruction, caused mainly by Stan, but with Ollie receiving mass (!) Penalties - see the great "The Music Box" (1933) or "Towed in a Hole" (1932) like some classic examples. <br /> <br /> Here, however, for some reason (whether it was because it was based on a sketch by Stan's father?), the boys play it simply "in" the comedy "built around jokes and supposedly funny situations. It does not go out. It's just another boring comedy from the 1930s, heightened only by the personality of Stan and Ollie, who never really show any of their characteristic gestures (finger moves Ollie, Stan's blank gaze, etc.) Or comic skills. /> The movie begins with the escape from the police. Because we never see or know why, it is hard to believe or accept their fear of being caught, and thus hide in the residence of Colonel Buckshot. The premise of "humor", Ollie passing on as Colonel and Stan who gave up because both the butler and the maid are never very addictive. In this film, "Stan and Ollie" do not play. Their parties could be played by any of the pedestrian actors and it would be just as poorly. <br /> <br /> Stan could have done miming and doing anything to make it fun, but he has no chance to do anything here. He limits himself by saying too many dialogues to "move" the story, but none of them goes above the silly one. We are treated to endless comic third-degree comedies, such as a running gag that does not correctly pronounce the name of Lord Plumtree, "Call me a taxi! Okay, you're a taxi! "Joke, cops losing clothes and seen in long underwear, and non-sequential ending Stan and Ollie as two parts in painfully obvious horse dress when they run away on a bike for two, and James Finlayson still does his full bodily shot and jumps Keystone Kop. <br /> <br /> Stan and Ollie perform much better in the situation comedy in "Sons of the Desert" (1933), where we see how they do what we love them - be yourself. In fact, the years 1932-34 seem to be their best years. <br /> <br /> Because this movie does not play with any of its strengths, why bother? I have to give him 3.
