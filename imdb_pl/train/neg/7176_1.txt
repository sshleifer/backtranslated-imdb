I have nothing more to say, but it was awful. I can not imagine why Helen Mirren and others were part of this humiliating mess. And if some actors do not want people to question their sexuality, maybe they should refrain from making more films. I saw at least one thing that interested me. Only my opinion. ERROR to think what's going on with this movie. DO NOT ASK to reflect on what the minds of the actors who made the movie have gone through. Shudder at the thought process and voyeurism that took place in the minds of directors. As I said before his degrading mess. It is not even funny. As Ebert said about Caligula with Malcolm McDowell, it's not a good movie, it's not a good story, and it's not even good porn. JEHESHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ............
