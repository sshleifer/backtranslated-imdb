Is this movie suck !! Horrible acting, horrible scenario, horrible effects, horrible terrible horrible !! There is nothing here, even for the most die-hard fans of horror! A crazy killer persecutes college students. People appear worried in the corridors, but nevertheless the class is normal? After the fourth body, I think that they can allow students to break for a few days! LOL. It's as bad as people. This film should be shown as a means of torture for criminals. You have been warned!
