With this line begins one stupid, boring British science fiction movie. The great Vorelli from the movie "Devil's doll" is building a teleportation machine only so that Blanchard, a bearded man, had something on bow ties and men with big eyebrows. When his experiment fails, a good doctor learns that Lembach, the man who controls all the grants in the world, will stay in London for a few days. He tries to get to Blanchard's house with the help of his wonderful laboratory assistant, Sheila. Needless to say something goes wrong, and he looks like a rat. The rest of the movie is devoted to a good orange-haired doctor walking around London, shocking people with a mutated hand and wearing a diaper on his face. There are several more murders, a modest paperwork, and finally the doctor disappears where rats meet with doctors. Fortunately, no one has decided to continue.
