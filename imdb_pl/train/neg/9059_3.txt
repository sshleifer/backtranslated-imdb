I will just be foggy when it comes to my potential perversions. There are enough canned plot elements in this movie that they are essentially spoiled. <br /> <br /> This movie derives some ideas from the southern classic, To Kill A Mockingbird. I suppose maybe TKOM got his ideas from some source ... anyway, after seeing this, you'll say, "Oh yes, it's a rip off." <br /> <br /> I think it is a really funny thing about these McMovies that after identifying the story element you have to find out whether they will stick to the original or you will try to turn it. Few twists and turns in this.
