I was very excited about this movie when I saw the announcements for the first time. I usually see the preview well and I buy this movie straight. Something told me ... you know, look at it first. I'm glad I did it. Keira Knightley destroyed all future films for me with this role. In the second film Pirates, when it came out, I went to see him. I only saw Domino Harvey and I hated her more. I think it had something to do with her hair and the need to cut her off for Domino. <br /> <br /> Domino, who? Who is Domino Harvey? I still do not really know, I do not care. I do not know who she was in real life or who she was in this movie. I did not care about her character, and even Keira, who had become naked, was not worth the movie. There was definitely no way in this direction. The letter was trivial and shallow. The edition was terrible. I do not mind this style, just like poor abuse of it. He is for this place. A good example of an unstable style of MTV, a colorful edition (it is not known if there is an official name) would be Fight Club; only on the top of the head. Even the Enemy of State had a partially similar style of editing parts. It was used with taste and was not used as a stilt. I mean, the same guy who directed Top Gun and Crimson Tide. Tony Scott, please, give me my time. <br /> <br /> I understand that many people liked this movie. I think the idea that you will completely love this movie or hate it completely is a fair assessment. Honestly, I hate this.
