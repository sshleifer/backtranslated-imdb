This movie is mediocre at best. Angie Harmon is as much fun as a bag of hammers. Her bizarre behavior from "Law and Order" leads to an unsuccessful comedy attempt. Charlie Sheen is the only one who came out unscathed from this terrible anti-comedy. The only positive thing that can come out of this mess is the marriage of Charlie and Denise. I hope that this effort will bring better results.
