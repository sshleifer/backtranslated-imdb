It was thought to be the flagship work of the open source community, something that stood up and shouted on the world media to attract attention because we were not stuck in a marketing trap with our options to create a good job with open source tools. After downloading the basic version (extremely wide range here on the telephone modem) I finally got to my first hook. Media Player, Mplayer Classic and winamp did not open it in my XP box, and then Totem, Xine and Kaffeine failed to open it on my Suse server. Mplayer managed to run flawlessly. It will be difficult to distribute information about it if normal users can not even open it ... <br /> <br /> Film. Beautiful soundtrack, excellent lighting, master camera work and immaculate texturing. Everything looked real. And then the two main characters moved ... and spoke ... And the movie died for me. Everything except lip synchronization and animation of the two main characters (except for Proog on the dance stage) looked smooth and completely. The two main characters were so poorly animated that sometimes I wondered if there are any games with interludes on the market today that bring less realism than it does. <br /> <br /> Each frame in the movie is fantastic ... as a frame, and the thing is great if none of the actors are moving. I'm glad I did not recommend it to anyone. I would ruin my reputation. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the final fantasy had a clever and cleverly elaborated plot. <br /> <br /> this movie would get 10 stars if it was not for a tragedy on the screen.
