Why did I lose my money on this last Sundance day? I want a refund ... Can I get back $ 16? While watching this movie, I waited for something to happen, nothing happened. The only way I knew what it was about was reading a story that was not like a movie. Why did the director enlarge his handy camera and then reduce it? It was not very artistic. Why did the director show Lulu folding nails for fifteen minutes? Why did the actors try to speak, sound like they were reading? Or maybe that's what it was about? I felt that Phantom Love had no history at all and to be honest I felt that my friends' holiday films had a much higher entertainment value than the film.
