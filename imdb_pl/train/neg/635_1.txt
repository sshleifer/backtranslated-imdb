Luise Rainer received the Oscar for her role in "Good Earth." Unfortunately, her role did not. She did not speak much and looked pale throughout the film. The character Luise was a slave and then devoted to a marriage with the character of Paul Muni (he did a fantastic job for his performance). Both actors, settled in ancient Asia, were not Asian, but they were very convincing in their roles. I hope Paul Muni received the Oscar for his role, because it was Luise who needed to win the Oscar. She had to be a breakthrough actress, one of the first actresses of the method. It looks like something Hollywood often does. Al Pacino played in Italian and Cuban. I felt that Luise's performance was boring all the time, and when she died, she did not change the expression from the previous scenes. Throughout the movie, it remained the same; maybe she changed her face or emotion twice. If her genius acting was so subtle, I suppose I did not see him.
