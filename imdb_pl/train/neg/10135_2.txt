I just watched this movie on Starz. Let me go through a few things that I think may have been improved; acting, writing, directing, special effects, camera crew, sound and lighting. It also seemed that the authors had no idea what was related to the film. Apparently in 2007, when the dollar was stronger, you could buy a super advanced hidden bomber that could be completely invisible for 75 million dollars. Now these things cost about $ 3 billion and can not be invisible. Apparently in an hour you can fly from the USA to the Middle East. There was a completely random lesbian scene, which did not bother me, but it seemed to me a lame attempt to get more guys. The camera would randomly enlarge the actors and go to random scenes. Oh yes, since his film Steven Segal, which can be predicted as hell. In summary, I count him to Snakes on a Plane.
