I have never read the book "Wrinkle in time". Honestly, do you really want it after watching the movie? Well, I should not review this movie, I will start with this. Next, I will say that the TV movie is completely forgotten. Do you know why I say so? Because I forgot what is happening in it. I told you it was forgotten. Honestly, no TV movie will ever be better than "Merlin." <br /> <br /> How to describe a TV movie? I've never written a review before. I will only say that they usually have some stars. A wrinkle over time includes only one. Alfre Woodard (or Woodward, I'm not sure), Oscar winner. <br /> <br /> The film has tacky special effects, a slightly interesting plot, scenes that make you go "WTF". The film is incredibly bad and makes the game "WTF". What did I expect? It's a TV movie. They are usually not good. Like this one. Wrinkle in time is a waste of time and a waste of time. On top of everything, you will most likely forget about it in a moment. Well, maybe not the second time. But in a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Wrinkles in time: * / ****
