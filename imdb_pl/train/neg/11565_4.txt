So far, after the second week of "The lone of Beauty" I am a bit disappointed. <br /> <br /> Some acting is good as long as we're just a drama. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how people can feel that this FRACTIVE DRAMA is a "real" account from "Thatcher" - it's fine as a drama, but I feel that the award-winning book is still much better. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the BBC will ever give us the continuation and the next part of the drama and the years that will follow "Things can only improve", ending in 2006, and the fact that we're still waiting! with the promise of a government that is full of insanity.
