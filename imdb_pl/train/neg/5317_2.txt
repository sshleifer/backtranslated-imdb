For the first 20 minutes (I watched it on PS2, so I have no idea how much time it took) Alienator creates an interesting premise. I do not think I would see a movie with a stranger from another planet as baddie. However, interest quickly turns into a stunned disbelief when you realize that the "stranger" is a huge woman building a body in a steel bikini. Yes, Alienator is clearly ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Do not think I have it against. In the world of horror, horror, it can often be a good sign. However, the blatant stupidity of his premise lies in the fact that the film really deserves it. An alienator is funny as hell, but he is also a shambolic mammal of the highest order. Actors focus on unsuccessful attempts at seriousness, potentially genius lines of pure cheese are stumbling with disturbing incompetence, and the direction does not sum up either one or two decent pieces. Before the film finishes, you can barely see the original concept through a haystack of whole guts on which the band resisted. <br /> <br /> Add to this the fact that the "Aliens" simply kill people by evaporating them as opposed to doing "cuts" as such and you have a gigantic pulsation of good ideas left to rot. You will laugh at Alienator, but not with him. If it's your thing, go and check it out.
