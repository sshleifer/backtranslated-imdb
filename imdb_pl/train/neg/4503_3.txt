I admired Rob Marshall for Chicago, but Memoirs of Geisha turns out to be another failure in combining Western and Asian art. In general, the scene is beautiful, but after restless accents on exotic-oriented scenes, some may simply have enough of them. Excessive cherry blossom was honestly overdone. This is probably a cultural difference in perception: the final beauty is not a spectacular type, because a truly beautiful geisha would not be a pumpkin in the west. <br /> <br /> Other comments have rightly mentioned the biggest drawbacks. As a Taiwanese, I have no doubt that the actress is great. The actor / actress can play any role when it may look like this. Gong Li is great, but the power of emotions she showed in this film has not been translated into Japanese. I only saw a bittersweet and jealous Chinese woman. Michlle Yeoh, one of my favorite actresses, not even LOOK LIKE Japanese. Some commentary mentioned the specific delicate feminine features of Japanese women with whom I can not agree. They are so delicate that I assume that even all contemporary Japanese actresses do not qualify for roles in Geisha, not to mention two Chinese and one Malaysian actress who grew up in different cultures and probably did not know Japanese culture so much. <br /> Geisha is a good shot to arouse the curiosity of the American audience. However, it would be an insult to both the film and the art if the film won an Oscar for the best costume, best director or the best picture.
