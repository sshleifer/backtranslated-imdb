Primal Species (1996, directed by Jonathan Winfrey) <br /> <br /> International terrorists are surprised when their load turns out to contain living dinosaurs. The military team of commandos must now think fast if it wants to prevent the extinction of the human species, instead of reptiles. <br /> <br /> You look at the cover and get the first impressions from the movie. This is almost enough. Acting is only acceptable from several characters. The story is weak, the whole movie is based on the army and marines soldiers trying to kill the dinosaurs. This movie was released three years after the Jurassic Park. Instead, the film looks like it was released 13 years before "Jurassic Park". Dinosaur costumes are so badly made and I mean costumes. Of course, people are disguised, and this movie does not try to hide it. The scene in which the dinosaur flows down the corridor is created in such a way that it seems that someone is riding a creature. This is one good thing that comes from this movie. Short working time. In just 1 hour and 15 minutes he does not waste too much of your life, but still try to avoid it completely. <br /> <br /> "It's like a Friday nightmare." - Officer (Brian Currie)
