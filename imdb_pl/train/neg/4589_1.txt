Do you remember the person who quit smoking in the chain, revealed during 60 minutes a few years ago? It is her's. Many people have reviewed this film without checking what the filmmakers are doing. Manufacturers successfully use fake "lip-to-mouth" promotions without revealing the financial and philosophical foundation of this piece of marketing. If you believe in channeling, reincarnation, new epic thrill and all-day baloney, this movie is for you. If you want to discuss quantum physics or reality, look somewhere else. The purpose of this movie is to convince you that Ramtha is not so cute, so you give her some money. If you can stroll along the side of Ramtha, not yelling in disbelief, then maybe you'll think that the dollars you threw on this madness ad were well used. <Http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=ANSWERMAN>
