If you want a handicapped gay Karate expert to beat a few trying, difficult to invent Mexican gangsters in an hour, this is a movie for you. if not, choose another DVD from the bin 20c, which is the only place where this movie belongs. the acting was so terrible that I had to force myself to look at it to the end. The cover makes it look so cool, but it's just another cheap gangster class B movie, about 2g line and key, bloody streetz and threat. I would not buy or rent this movie unless you're stoned, plot, editing and acting really do not matter to you. it is really the worst movie in the history of mankind !!!
