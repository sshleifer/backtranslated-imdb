This is one of the worst 5 movies I've ever seen. This is not scary or any other thing suggested in the outline of the plot. This movie is painfully slow, and I was bored for almost 98 minutes. While acting is mediocre at best, the biggest problem is the script, which is poorly written, slow and has no real direction. Sometimes a ghostly mood is set just to break a useless line or event. I am not surprised that the entire cast was sick and rushed between the shots, but nevertheless they had to test the horrible scenario. As a big fan of good horror movies, I'm always irritated that something bad is happening. Save 98 minutes, you will never come back.
