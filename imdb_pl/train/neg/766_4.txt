Whenever Columbo's story deviates from the known plot (a colorful killer commits a crime, Columbo burns out an assassin, Columbo becomes a pest in this process), writers somehow are never able to match the quality and interest of most traditional episodes. This episode departs extremely, and results in a large flap. <br /> <br /> Would you believe: Columbo will never face the villain until the end? !! <br /> <br /> To be honest, he was tempted to shut it down for about two-thirds. <br /> <br /> Oh, sacrifices that our self-proclaimed reviewers are doing !!!
