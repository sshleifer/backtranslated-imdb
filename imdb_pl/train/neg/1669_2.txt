Here we are: two travelers from a distant futuristic world come to Earth ... one is in a desperate mission to save life, the other is an inhuman killing machine, determined to eliminate a woman who will give birth to the savior of the whole race. <br /> <br /> So what can we call this killing machine? It's almost like a destroyer or eradicator ... something like an exterminator or something like that. What word am I looking for ... something that ends-things? Hmmmm .... <br/> <br /> In any case, the guardian (who quickly removes the white tunic he stole from Luke Skywalker for the benefit of local clothing) finds the young woman first and infuses her with the future hero. The evil uhhhh ... "exterminator" kills some Rednecians and steals their weapons and clothing, and then tries to locate a woman, visiting her workplace and asking, scaring men's eyes and threateningly repeating her name. <br /> <br /> Then begins a desperate race for survival, when the seemingly immortal and unstoppable "exterminator" chases a couple around. At some point, he can buy shoes and a motorcycle, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> Maybe in an exciting finale he will try to crush them under the wheels of a huge tank. .. acid. Then the truck will break down. They will be saved ... but no! Then he will appear again, as strong as ever. He will kill the protector and chase the girl to the meat packing plant, where in a terrifying finale he is pushed into a large piece of an industrial chopping machine and destroyed once and for all. <br /> <br /> But maybe I extrapolate too much ... in the end, I stopped watching the movie after Mr. Protector magically fertilizes Sean Young, kissing her at the bar, and then says that the child will be born in three days. <br /> <br /> Costumes and effects are great in this movie ... I loved them for the first time when I saw them on Star Trek: Next Generation! Sean Young performs another great turn as a hopeless replicant, and Stephen Baldwin by profession is also on board as a Young Fat Boy. I do not know, however, where it fits the plot ... maybe it is an import from another James Cameron movie?
