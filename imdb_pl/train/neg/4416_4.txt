A less subtle sentence on the beliefs and teachings of the Catholic Church is given a darker shade of death at the end of the performance. Throughout the performance, dark humor plays the role of a medium through which a few commonly heard rhetorical questions are asked, especially "If God is so good, why does he allow evil to exist in the world?" <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton is perfectly at their role as an exaggerated version (though some may disagree) with a stereotypical religious teacher who spits out the "company line" and condemns half of the world to burn in hell. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of his school, he invites his first students to come back and perform the Christmas competition. <br /> <br /> However, when the quartet "updates" its art to parody "wrong" teachings of Sister Mary, the nun is pushed by the edge, sending the story into a spiral of unhappy events. Finally, the ending leaves the patient in the heart of the patient. <br /> <br /> Not recommended. Instead, watch the game.
