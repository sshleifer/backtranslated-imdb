I used to be fascinated by a cartoon in college. He had a lot of "Get Smart" charm. Although it had its drawbacks, it was rather pleasant. <br /> <br /> Of course I was very interested in watching the movie version. That was before I saw it. After words, I regretted that it had never been done. <br /> <br /> Other than that you were unsuccessful (who on Earth, though Broderick was even close to the role?), he just did not do it. <br /> <br /> The effects were reasonable and perhaps the ONLY thing I liked about the film; See live gadget action in action! What was missing was history and treatment that made her laughable or charming or interesting. <br /> <br /> The original was a crazy cartoon with a very light attitude. It was fun. The film became muddled and the FAR was treated too seriously. If he had a serious conspiracy or went crazy enough to give the impression of a "cartoon on film," it could be pleasant. <br /> <br /> Because it exists, it does not deserve to be part of the 'Legacy of gadgets'.
