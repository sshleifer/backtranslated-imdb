I have always admired Susan Sarandon for her honesty and integrity in her private life as well as her acting talent. That is why it was strange that he would appear in a film that distorted these facts. Saving her character from the South Pole was done by a Canadian charter company from Edmonton, Alberta, flying on the Canadian Twin Otter. The trip was rejected by the US Air Force, the Navy, and the Coast Guard, as it exceeded their capabilities. The same company organized a similar rescue operation a few years later to extract a man from the base at the South Pole. I feel that the movie quite represented a very thrilling topic and documented a very brave woman facing a terrifying task. I do not understand why the producers deem it necessary to ignore the courage of the rescue pilots and show the rescue aircraft as Hercules USAF.
