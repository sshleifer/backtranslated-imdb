The man brings his new wife home, in which his ex-wife died as a result of an "accident". His new wife has just been released from the institution and is VERY rich! Suddenly he starts to hear sounds and see the skulls everywhere. Is she going crazy again, is the first wife coming back from the dead? <br /> <br /> You probably guessed the ending, so I will not spell it. I saw it many times on Saturday afternoon on television as a child. Then I liked it, but I was young. Seeing this now, I realize how bad it looks. It is terribly played, badly written, very boring (even for an hour) and has a huge cast FIVE people (one is a director)! Still, he has some good things. <br /> <br /> The music is quite scary, and the setting itself with a huge empty house and a pond nearby is pleasantly romantic. There are also a few terrifying moments (I jumped a bit when she saw the first skull) and a slightly effective ending. All in all, definitely not a good movie ... but not a total catastrophe. He has a small cult. I give it to him. <br /> <br /> Also try to avoid editing the Elite DVD Drive-in (this is combined with "Attack of the Giant Leeches"). It is in a HORRIBLE shape with all the leap and scratches. It did not even look so bad on TV!
