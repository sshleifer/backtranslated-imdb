It is surprising that the film has some salutary quality when it approaches the end. On the other hand, this movie is really bad and bad, with a small budget, an insulting script and everything that goes with it. <br /> <br /> It's stupid that all the money is circulating in Christian circles never seems to have enough resources to make a decent movie. I'm not religious, so I did not really care, but making movies is a good tool for reaching new audiences in churches and raising people's interest and curiosity in reading the Bible. In this respect, these films always seem to be a wasted opportunity. <br /> <br /> A low budget really damages the film and lowers it. It makes watching the movie with its effects funny, and it just gives the whole movie a camp type B film like a feeling. <br /> <br /> What's more harmful to this movie is its writing. What's happening in this movie is simply offensive to intelligence, and then I do not even complain or talk about the religious aspects of the whole story. The way the movie develops is so unbelievable, and the people in this movie are doing so unlikely things that it's offensive to viewers. <br /> <br /> I also hated that the movie was sometimes like a soap opera. It seemed to me that it was simply difficult for them to turn it into a full-length movie, and they added a few characters and dramatic developments to fill everything. Sometimes I could not worry less. <br /> <br /> It must be said, however, that the film is becoming more and more solid and stable at the end when its story becomes more focused on its essence. Still, everything is predictable, but it prevented watching this movie, and when it comes to this type of films, it is much worse to watch, although I do not think that this movie won with any new souls. <br /> <br /> 4/10
