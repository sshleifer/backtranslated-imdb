I'm working on the Horror Classics 50 Movie Pack collection, and REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES is one of the movies in the set. I watch them together with my seven-year-old daughter, which makes most of these movies laugh. <br /> <br /> I had high hopes for REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES, after seeing White Zombie, which is actually a precursor so much that it is a zombie's mainstay in the cinema (think about the funeral scene of Clive Barker Serpent and the Rainbow and James Bond - Live and Let Die, NOT Night of the Living Dead). However, even if the title contains the word "zombie", it is little more than a love triangle with the anthropologist Armand Louque who is enchanted by Claire Duval; who in turn is taken with his companion Clifford Grayson. What a yawn, my daughter fell asleep halfway. <br /> <br /> I had a really hard time deciphering who these people worked for - allies or axes; but I think it does not matter. <br /> <br /> I was shocked to see Bela Lugosi in the subtitles for this film; but of course these were his eyes (with White Zombie) serving as a zombie mind control device.
