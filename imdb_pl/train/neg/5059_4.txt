If you want to see a movie about two completely unpleasant characters, then this one. Acting is great, both from the side of John Cassavetes, like crazy paranoid who, as they say, REALLY are able to get, and from Peter Falk as his best friend, to whom he asks for help. Big mistake, but because they are amoral gangsters and misogynist bastards, it's hard to decide who to root out LESS. Only the writer / director Elaine May could escape this. I thought it was interesting that in a long interview with producer Michael Hausman posted on a DVD, he revealed that the two stars had "very different ideas" about the scenario with which the director was almost impossible to work, that the director had the impossible to keep the crew she was furious that she must sit and wait. This mood of one big VERY dysfunctional family appears clearly on the screen.
