Apparently, the people who wrote on the back of the box did not bother watching this so-called "movie". They described the "blinding choreography of intrigue and violence". I did not see "intrigue." Instead, I saw a pathetic attempt at dialogue in the alleged kung fu. I did not see "violence." At least I did not see anything that would cause me to suspend my disbelief about what could harm a man with "impermeable" skin - but here I probably reveal too much "conspiracy." What's more, as a viewer of many different films (some of which include the occasional kung fu movie), I can authoritatively say that this piece of celluloid is unobservable. Whatever you choose, I will always stay <br /> <br /> Correct, <br /> <br /> Jonathan Tanner <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> P.S. Choreography did not blind me.
