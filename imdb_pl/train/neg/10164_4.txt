I just saw it at the Venice Film Festival and I can not decide. We have never been allowed to approach each character close enough to care for them. Maybe that's what we were all in "our own bubble", but these people did not make me worry about them or be shocked by their fate. In a little over an hour, the figures were not well developed. A lot of time was devoted to factory equipment (forklifts, belt conveyors, shovels); and slightly scary dolls for children with surprisingly realistic eyes, which most of the characters earned for a living, were somehow more interesting than living people. An interesting experiment, but somehow never met.
