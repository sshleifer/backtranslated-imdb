It's a really bad movie. My friend hired him because he is an idiot. But on the other hand, I must be an idiot because I watched the whole damn thing! The actors were on par with the geeks from high school, who think they are going to places. The only place they go to is to return to the tables in Luby. When I watched this "jewel", I was just thinking about how to do it. I mean, some "screenwriter" actually thought that the assumption was fresh, original and lucrative. Then some moron with money so much believed in the script that he decided to make some money with the naive misunderstanding that he was going to make money from it. The actors were cast, the locations were scanned, the make-up artists were employed, computer animators from the Al Collins graphic design school were introduced. things that I hated in this movement, but the only thing that drove me mad was the abuse of music. Every single minute of this movement was counted. There was not a single break in music. Sometimes it was mixed up rather than dialogue, not because you missed an important feature point or something like that. <br /> <br /> After the end we decided to watch the Mystic River. It was like driving a VW Diesel Rabbit 1980, and then switching to a BMW 740il. You can not get two more movies in terms of quality.
