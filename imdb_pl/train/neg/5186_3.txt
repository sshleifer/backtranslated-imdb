RKS movies have always been commercial films that fit the 90s, with GHAYAL, DAMINI <br /> <br /> His latest KHAKEE films were watched RODZINA by≈Ça bzdurna <br /> <br /> This movie is a decent movie , but, could be better <br /> <br /> The problem is that a lot of old-fashioned cliches have been thrown, and many scenes come out too concise and long <br /> <br /> the character of Ajay Devgan is shown very well, but his the character becomes heroic, which can be subtle <br /> <br /> A long retrospection can be avoided because the motifs are just dragged <br /> <br /> Even the street game in the second half seems too simplistic and almost not has the solution the message is well delivered. <br /> <br /> The direction of RKS is decent, though it may be better. Music is ok. <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgan looks good in this role and feels at ease mostly in moments when it looks bad on light scenes. Vidya excels in the media scene Pankaj has an improperly defined role and too transparent in his role Darshan Jariwala as a villain of old age, the rest is fine
