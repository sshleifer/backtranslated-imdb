In my eyes, this is an almost perfect example of the Hollywood ego, defeated only by the new King Kong movie. Superman is an original super hero and deserves respect, even if he wears tights. Brandon Routh was the worst superman I've ever seen, from the beginning of the movie you just want to put a piece of kryptonite into your throat. He just looks stupid in a costume. But enough about him, Kate Bosworth was a bad choice for lois lane, she should be a hard reporter, but in this film she looks more like a student. The plot was weak and predictable (WOW, he is in fact a superman, a son who would ever think ...), and acting was terrible. This movie has one good thing, and its name is Kevin Spacey. His portrait of Lex Luthor was brilliant, but even he could not save the movie. You needed a movie "lois and clark" (of course, except for Kevin Spacea) and another story. I watched this movie after seeing "the hills have eyes", and I was saddened to find out that there were worse movies then.
