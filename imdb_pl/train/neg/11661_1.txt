Essentially, it is too long, inconspicuous action / comedy. First of all, I would like to say that I liked Brother Wayans Scary Movie (1), and the sequel had its moments. Unfortunately, white chicks do not even give you half a laugh. <br /> <br /> The humor in him is absolutely harsh. If you like bouncing, farting, silly slogans, you should look at it. When he is not primitive, he is idiotic. The first 10 minutes of the film gave me everything, completely ridiculous, simply idiotic. <br /> <br /> However, I've been watching the whole thing since I was with a friend (otherwise I would not bother). The story is undeniably thin, it was also in a terrible film, but at least the laughter was quick and steady. I think this is probably one of the main problems associated with this movie, laughter does not come quickly enough. Some jokes are dragged too long when they are more disgusting than funny. If you prefer a comedy with a few brain cells, just avoid it. If you want a stupid comedy with more laughter, look at the frightening movie, the plane, hotshots 1 + 2. <br /> <br /> 1/10 Completely good, Thin plot, A movie that seems to be based on one idea, ie what if we dress as white chicks for a movie?), but we just do not have enough material.
