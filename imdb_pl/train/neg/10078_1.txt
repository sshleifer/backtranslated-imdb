Boy-girl loves romance / sequel with songs, only this time is a punkette, and he is a straight arrow. Movie-buffs there really like this movie? Has fans? I must say that the mind is spinning ... "Grease 2" is really a bad venture that does not even have courage, moksa or pure bile to take away the memory of its predecessor in flames (like "Jaw 2" or "Exorcist II"). No, he cries in slow motion and often just plays dead. It looks and seems cheap, with a large cast lost in the chaotic direction and out of focus service. It was the first time that a significant audience saw Michelle Pfeiffer and although she is not ashamed herself, it is a role worthy of oblivion. Break at the lowest level. NO STARS WITH ****
