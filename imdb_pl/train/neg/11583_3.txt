This movie presents quite a few characters and their relationships in the first half hour. None of them arouses interest or positive response. I waited for the intrigue to start, hoping that everything would improve and that it would end up bitterly ending, but there was no reward for it. <br /> <br /> If you want a summary, look somewhere else. For me, the action is not worth telling. Not that the story is so bad, I think you could say that I had some problems with the script - i.e. I thought it stinks. Looking at the loans will show you that there is quite a strong cast here, used unsuccessfully. Most old professionals do a good job in doing this; of the actors I have not seen before, I particularly liked Deborah Kara Unger. That's all I can find about this photo.
