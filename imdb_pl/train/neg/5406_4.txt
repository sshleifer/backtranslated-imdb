My first opinions about this film were obviously bad. I expected horrible, bad acting, bad entertainment, a funny film with special effects. What I got was not that bad. quite interesting, and the script was quite good and decent. Acting was not so bad, and overall I had a good time watching this movie. This is still a very bad movie, but it is not completely worthless, as I thought and I'm glad that this movie managed to impress me, even if it was not so good. Generally speaking, this is a movie to avoid, but for me it was not as bad as I expected. be.
