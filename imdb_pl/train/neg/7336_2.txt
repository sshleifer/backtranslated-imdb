It is a very bland and indifferent production of one of Shakespeare's most dynamic performances. I can only guess that the goal was to make the game as accessible and understandable as possible for an audience that was not previously exposed to Shakespeare. However, in doing so - making every line pure and obvious, they exhausted the game of life and turned it into a flat caricature. Somehow it is really boring - a very hard feat, considering such a great material. <br /> <br /> Acting is forgotten at best - Sam Waterston as Benedick and Douglas Watson as Don Pedro. Others, however, are not doing so well. Hero April Shawnham is a downy, breathless plane that often provokes crookedness. Don John Jerry Mayer is a nonsense cartoon character on the Snidely Whiplash level (though Snidley was much more pleasant). <br /> <br /> F. Murray Abraham (you know, the guy who killed Mozart?) He's not in that version unless he's disguised and his name removed from the subtitles. <br /> <br /> Given that the producer, Joseph Papp, is basically the god of the theater, this production is not only disappointing but also scratching his head. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about it. Instead look at Much Ado Branagh - his version is full of vitality and humor, not to mention great performances.
