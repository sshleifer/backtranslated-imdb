What Hopkins does with this effort as a screenwriter and director gives us the feeling that we absolutely do not know anyone in the film. However, this may be the problem. His film has many ambitions, and his intentions were of course complex and drawn from the depths, but they are so impersonal. No characters. We never know who is someone, so there is no investment on our part. <br /> <br /> It may be about the script writer mixing with his own characters. It is? Maybe. I do not mean that Slipstream is ambiguous; I mean, he does not say anything. Hopkins' movie is an experiment. At first glance, one could say that it is a would-be screenwriter who at the moment of meeting with fate realizes that life is a hit and / or success is a blind chance, because it is thrown into a "stream" of collisions between points in time, dreams, thoughts and reality. Nevertheless, it is so incredibly cerebral that it leaves no room for any traces of emotions, even for a small, quite primitive degree that allows us to connect with its characters. <br /> <br /> I did not think that the nipple and extravagant school of unstable work with cameras and machine editing disconnected me, but considering the movie, I begin to realize that it has a lot to do with it. There are so many movies from the last decade in which cuts or camera motion have sound effects, as well as other deteriorating game atmosphere. I suppose in this case it was justified that his goal was to compose the impressionistic reaction of dreams. However, while watching, I did not know anything about Slipstream and left in the same way. And I do not care, because Hopkins did not try to make us care. There are interactive movies and there are movies that sit on a rocking chair and knit, unaware of your presence. Slipstream is the second one.
