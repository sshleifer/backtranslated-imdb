As Steven Segal's films show, this one is at the bottom of the barrel. His best was just the food for bored teenagers. This tilts the scales and then falls off. All characters are cardboard. History is doubly bad. I can not spoil it by telling you the ending. You already know how Steven Segal's films end when you see them. Here he goes. He's a government agent who's too much trouble, and he knows too much to break free, so they decide instead of killing him, cheer for his brain until he remembers the squat. He escapes, of course, is arrested and is in the possession of his old general, who needs one man in a million experiences to recover an invisible plane that was handed over to the terrorist gang in Afghanistan by a dishonest pilot of the Air Force who surprises, surprise, Segal coached. All heroes, except for the character of Segal and his dark girlfriend, die heroically, and Steve-Baby saves the whole world with one blow or throws himself. Anything. Made from an excess of flying Air Force and Navy. And many booms. Instead, get a Popeye cartoon.
