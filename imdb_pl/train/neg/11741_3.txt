But he is completely unbelievable here as a leader, an eighteenth-century rogue known for his philosophy and great looks. His costar is, of all people, Akim Tamiroff. Some Frenchman!

There is a soubrette and at the moment a naughty girl. It disappears for a moment, but it appears in an unlikely situation. But she is good. She was always an attractive actress. Here is the closest to her typical role. <br /> <br /> It's supposed to be a bit naughty, a bit oh-la-la. It should have a light touch, but it is a lead romance from beginning to end.
