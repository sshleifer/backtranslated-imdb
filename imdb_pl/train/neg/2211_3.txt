Hahahaha !!!!!! Funny - this sums up the film in one word. What kind of nonsense was a "thing" because it could kill me to use a movie movie!?!? I hope that the director, writer and producer did not want this to happen, because it certainly was not! The scientist turns his son into a hammer shark, and the shark kills a group of scientists invited to the island !!! Gooooooodddd !!!! I hate this movie so much that when I watched it, I was laughing at all the serious parts because they were so dingy and unprofessional .... and they could not make the shark look more unrealistic, even though the "thing" had a slightly larger budget than most low-budget movies. All I have to say is to watch this movie, which is expecting to laugh at all the evil acting and stupid coarse dialogue, because if you expect a good movie, I will be very disappointed.
