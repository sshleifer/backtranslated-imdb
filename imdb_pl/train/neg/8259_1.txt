I saw the movie back when it premiered. <br /> <br /> He was based on the assumption that autistic children can communicate with written messages when someone else helps them and directs them with their hands. <br /> <br /> Suddenly these children, many of whom did not even watch the keyboard or screen, when messages were typed (in some cases they could look at the ceiling), but their moderators had eyes glued to the keyboard, began to write messages about abuses on the part of parents and other people, sending parents and childcare agencies in turbulent, left and right. <br /> <br /> All this turned out to be a mistake when the third person introduced the folder, opened it to the child and said "enter the image you see", and when the presenter turned the folder on the moderator, the fold would drop, revealing a different picture. <br /> <br /> So the child could see the dog, the moderator saw something like a boat. <br /> <br /> Each time, at any time, the name of the picture you entered was what the moderator noticed, never what the child showed. <br /> <br /> So who wrote? Never a child. <br /> <br /> This film still had a disastrous turn, as the poster from Australia said, the person who molested the child in the film was in a situation trying to help the child. <br /> <br /> If Melissa Gilbert never put her son in this place, he would not be molested, that's what the movie says. He was better under his supervision. <br /> <br /> If I return my child to your organization for help and he will be molested instead, do you think I will want to listen to everything you need to say after that? Probably not! I think it's a safe bet that all of these accusatory messages that these children wrote that this movie is based on have never accused someone as part of their operation, as it was here. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I'm reminded that the movie gave Gilbert a very good performance as an autistic mother, but otherwise the movie really did not do much. <br /> <br /> The worst part was that the child wrote Patty Duke at the end and we hear how the mechanical voice reads what he wrote. . . . . "We won!" This child was molested. If you cut off my leg and take you to court, and you'll be found guilty of destroying me, assault, anything, it's legal justice, but it does not bring my leg back. <br /> <br /> In my best condition, I will see it as an empty victory. <br /> <br /> Any chances of this child to what is perceived as normal with autism itself are further damaged by harassment. <br /> <br /> The "normal" child has enough to deal with such an experience. <br /> <br /> It is completely superficial to think that you have to look at every situation and go "we won" if that person is found guilty in court. <br /> <br /> Only poor handling of the situation and circumstances.
