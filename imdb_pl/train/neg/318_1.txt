I stole this movie when I was a freshman in college. I tried to watch him three times, the other two, because friends wanted to see him. "Sweet, Adam Sandler, I have never heard about this film, but because it is so funny, it must be fun." Wrong! I can not bring myself to look at this pile of rubbish after the war for a boxing dream / insult, where burning a good zinger causes the physical pain of the opponent. You might think that this horrible comedy hurts you, but after seeing this you will know that it's true. This movie is not worth the price I paid for it. I watched a lot of Steven Segal's films and even watched Crossroads twice ... but I still could not see it.
