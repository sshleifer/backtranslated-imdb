Weak, musty, tired, dressed; I want to be the Primary Instinct, but I miss the chance for new perspectives, new insights. Unclear, banal, grotesque and unnecessary brevity; oh, wait ... it was only 90 minutes ... it must have only * seemed * a lot longer! I would rather clean the toilet at the bus station with a toothbrush than sit through it again. I express my opinion here: I think that means I did not like it.
