The excellent performance of Alix Elias emphasizes the disordered and mixed heap of ruins. I've seen this movie, maybe 12 times, and every time I go, I find less and less pleasure. Why is Munchies so lusty? Has it ever been clarified? Are they a reflection of our mindless, gruff "animal self"? If so, why not make it more obvious? Why not cancel the subtleties that harass the film and make this connection clear? Another part of the movie that worries me endlessly - motorcycles. The jacket that the little monster carries on the front cover seems to suggest a "wise" traveler. Sunglasses say "pretty cool guy". With all this I am ready for Easy Rider meets Muppety. All I get is Munchies (1987). What gives? Stick to the Gremlins series if you're a fan of small, smart puzzles, reptile dolls.
