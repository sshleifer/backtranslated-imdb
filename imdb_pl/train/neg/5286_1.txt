I am a big fan of Jane Austen and I ordered a movie from Amazon.UK just to be able to see it without waiting forever for its coming to the USA. What's up with Anne running after Wentworth? The essence of Anne Elliot's character is that she was quiet and sophisticated. It is not impulsive and vulgar. And Mary, did she suffer from a stroke or something? Her speech was neither normal nor normal. There was no chemistry between the two main characters, which made their "romance" completely unbelievable. In the last scene, they even have Sally Hawkins in the same dress that Amanda Root wore on the letter scene. The same clothes do not make the same movie. In my opinion, they did not watch the version from 1995, which, despite having its drawbacks, remained quite close to the book. The book does not even seem to read it. It's a bit like the Cliff Persuasion movie. Hit all high points without explaining anything.
