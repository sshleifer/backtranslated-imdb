It is not Michael Madsen's fault. This movie was just awful. If you want to laugh and get bored, watch this movie. Words can not describe how idiotic it is. I'm sorry, Michael. The photos were dark. All other actors are unknown. When you watch it, you feel like in soft porn, but without nakedness or hot scenes. This movie had sexual undertones, because it's about the underground S & M killer. Acting was bad, except for part of Michael Madsen. He looked like he wanted to laugh. I hope he was well paid for this bad movie. This is something that I would not be proud of. This is not even a B movie for cable TV, it resembles F more and should never be shown.
