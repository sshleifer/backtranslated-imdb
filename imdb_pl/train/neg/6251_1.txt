I was able to withstand only the first twenty minutes of this low-budget film. The most blatantly absurd thing was that while all American prisoners in the North Korean POW camp reportedly suffer from serious food and medicine deprivation, without bathing, trembling in weak and dirty parks and sleeping on bare floors, and - let's not forget permanent torture - always they manage to grow impeccably hairy hair. With the exception of the severe Harry Morgan as the army's major, casting and acting are simply awful. Ronald Regan can not seem like one hero and instead creates a rather schizophrenic combination of old roles. For the most part, a Caucasian cast depicting North Korean camp officers could have been forgiven, but when allegedly Russian officers acting as Korean advisers circled around wearing re-dressed Nazi uniforms with breeches and boots (the obvious costume department processes from WWII films) with accents such like General Burkhalter from Hogan's Heroes, well, these are just six kinds of stupid people. Do not waste time on this.
