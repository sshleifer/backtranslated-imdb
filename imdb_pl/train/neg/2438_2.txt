This infamous ending of Koen Wauters' career drew my attention thanks to the "Night of bad taste". Judging by the index of comments, I was not the first and I do not have to be the last person in Western Europe who will find out that this musician (no doubt one of the best on our contemporary pop scene, even the Dutch agreed) was trying to be an actor. It should not be judged whether he should try or not. <br /> <br /> In "Intensive care" he is quite nice, but it seems that he feels uncomfortable with the movement in which he participates. No one can blame him. He deserves his place in the Hall of Fame of Verheyen by all means and standards. The story of a murderous maniac who is supposed to die in an accident, but is alive and angry, has been told several dozen times, and even without original phrases, the director can present something more than an average story through innovative settings and photos. /> <br /> The IC is contained in the hospital wing and several middle class homes. The tempo is boring. Tension loses the last part of its credibility in the musical score, because every appearance of the murderer is accompanied by a tedious melody, followed by orchestral explosions during murders, which, or to a large extent suggested, or at least as bloodless as a small budget can do them. The sex scene is unpaid but it is not very attractive. However, a couple with Amsterdamned could do it. When dealing with the topic of the pair: the entire thread between Wauters and the girl does not work. A more effective emotional connection could be established on the screen if they were only future victims who relax the nerves in the middle of the physical relationship. I will not even give other members a dignity record, because they were all cut into small, fat pieces. In fact, most of them do. The ones I remember are obvious to the species: a pretty nurse and two cops. <br /> <br /> Hence, the cavalry comes just in time to need help itself. (Anti-hero) must eliminate the villain, mainly thanks to clever thinking, because old red berets often do not take part in these films; they can overcome the illusion of invincibility that surrounds the killer. Translated into events, Wauters kills the doctor and saves you in danger. <br /> <br /> No people, I'm not done. It is not so. Wauters makes a heroic attempt, but is beaten by a fury that approaches "A Clockwork Orange," so it's up to the girl to kill the drill killer and break the brains of the doctors. Although this method ensures death of the killer more than regular 9mm bullets, the doctor survives to allow the IC to reach the mark of 80 min. <br /> <br /> I should have said what I mean now. Intensive care is a bad movie that only Evil Taste enthusiasts can use, who can verify Verheyen's catchy statements and think for themselves to sit down. For example, the (unintentional) value of the parody of the clown mask of the doctor (Halloween) and the final confrontation in the park (chase at the end of Friday 13). <br /> <br /> But let me finish by giving you a look at some mistaken items that give IC a bit of credit. George Kennedy is not one of them. All he has to do is endure a horrible monologue from another doctor / French actor and look scared when they let him go down in flames to mark his big name standing up. He could play his part of Naked Gun again to end up as beef, but with longer time on the screen. The finale can be one of them. I never saw a madman being brought back by firing fireworks in his gut to crush him with a flexible fence. It's a good idea for laughter. <br /> <br /> Name one good point of view for intensive care ... Koen Wauters learned his lesson and devoted his musical career completely. I wonder how many editions of the Paris-Dakar race must stop before you come to terms. <br /> <br />
