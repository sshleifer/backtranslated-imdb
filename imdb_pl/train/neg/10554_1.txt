Avent-garde is a nightmarish, unusually low budget "movie" that has a delusional magnitude. It's hard to sit. I get the message that hurting children is bad. Wow, a great revelation. I had no idea that I was wrong before I saw it. Yes, it's sarcasm. DO NOT watch this "movie" if you are offended by male or female nudity. DO NOT watch it if you are the least sensitive. DO NOT watch it if you care about acting. Second, just do not watch it. <br /> <br /> My rating: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: film making, premiere, interview with Kristie Bowersock, deleted scenes from the film, director's commentary, 2 versions of the movie trailer, music video The Azoic and video experiment in the classroom
