I went to this, hoping it would be a "thought provoking" little gem that he saw through it. I love indy movies and I expected that I will also dig it out. Knowing what a hot button is, I expect to be really funny, maybe even see the perspective from outside. <br /> <br /> all I can say is wow .... if you are in torture or mutilation, then maybe you'll like it. I personally do not like the idea that I will pee or cut, so I thought it was rubbish. bad script, bad acting, bad story, bad direction, bad editing ... I could continue. I have no idea why the reviewer claimed to create a political point, giving this film 10. He is confusing and unaware. voting for a film on IMDb is not a precedent! it just allows other people to think that such a junk bomb is okay to watch, if it's controversial (this movie is not, it's VERY hard, but it fails). <br /> <br /> you know that the movie is bad when you pray in it for 15 minutes that all the main characters die terrifyingly. Unfortunately, they die, but not in painful manners that would give the viewer some justice or justification for watching the 2 hours of nonsense they just endured. <br /> <br /> do yourself a favor, just do not worry. I have this movie in a container for bargains at my local video store for .50 and I feel cheated!
