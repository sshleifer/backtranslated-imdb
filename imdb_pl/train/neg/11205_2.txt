Yes, I definitely regretted that I gave up on Saturday night watching this strange but very long film. Apparently neither the main character stole two hours of my life. This is the personification of the antihero in "No regrets". We have this moron, so embarrassed, so wandering, so selfish, pointless and unlikely that it was extremely difficult to avoid the attractiveness of the incoming son of a privileged businessman, Jaemin, unless it was just a physical attraction. He says otherwise, it's love. But after seeing it is like darling of Charles Manson, because you're kicking a beard. (All right, it's not so bad, but it still has no real features that can be mentioned). I could never go beyond the reason why Jaemin has the endless stems of Sumin. Never shown, I was told that Jaemin loves Sumin. Perhaps this is a matter of culture that flew over my head: crazy / persecuting = crazy love in Seoul. It must be because a little more than half of the film is persecution of the other, and the last part is persecution back and forth to the point where I thought it turned into a screw comedy. I waited for the appearance of a tiger named "child". Okay, so Sumin works two jobs while going to school, so good that someone is trying to improve. But after the first taste of the attractiveness of his persecutor, he gives up his daily work for a ring of prostitution. What? OK, as already mentioned, the obsession does not cease due to a change in work / career, and if you throw in a group of other very angry characters, you will get one mixed up movie in which unbelievable events seem to happen without accumulation. A basic movie, not 100% scary, but you can do better with foreign gay movies.
