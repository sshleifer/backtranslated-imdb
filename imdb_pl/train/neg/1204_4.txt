I remember Devil Dog playing TBS almost 20 years ago, and my older sister and her friends watched him and laughed the next day. This is not so bad for a horror movie for television, but it is a derivative (mainly Egzorcysty) and factual, for lack of a better word. It will not blow you up in elaborate cinematography or great acting, but it is not a waste of time. It's a movie you watch to kill a few hours when you're not in the mood to think too hard. <br /> <br /> If, however, you enter the movie looking for laughter, you won Do not be disappointed. The early scenes, from Lucky the Devil Dog as a cute little puppy with the eyes of the damned children, are fun and not threatening, and the climactic effects of the blue screen of a giant black dog (with horns!) Are quite side by side. And watch out for the masked satanist in Maverick shades at the beginning. <br /> <br /> This is not a great horror in any dimension of imagination, but I would like them to continue doing such things for television.
