I could not believe it! Cropped sentences? Oh, jena! You know what? Everything is true! Real people say that way? Do not think like that. Good girl! Stout fellow! Stiffen the upper lip! Just the reason given movie 2 instead of 0 Gary Cooper such a dish. The film as a whole is funny, unless you like watching endless biplane fights. In any case, it seems to have no end. Think about everything that is called Franchot Tone's dialogue. When Crawford and Young make special efforts to sound in British, they are Irish. A handy tip - we Brits the words of a clip, not a sentence. And somehow we manage to draaaaaaaaa at the same time. But that's only when we were in a really good public (private) school.
