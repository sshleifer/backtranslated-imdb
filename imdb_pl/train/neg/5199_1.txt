During the first 20 minutes, every possible film was crossed out by the scriptwriter and director. He was the chief NTSB researcher with tortured family life; a politically tortured board member of the NTSB played by [I Can Kill EVERY TV] by Ted McGinley; tortured father of the accident victim; and torturing a poor lawyer chasing an ambulance. <br /> <br /> Hollywood still has no idea about the fragility of airplanes. The wrecked plane was 737 and sat mainly on the ground like a hippopotamus who decided to take a nap. The first third of the hull was intact, the rear half of the plane was intact, and the debris field showed no wings or engines. Most people should leave in the light of the number of people who survived this plane, which was crumbled in Iowa after losing hydraulics. Most of this television aircraft has not even been burned. <br /> <br /> It reminded me of the scene from the movie "Air Force One", in which 747 hits water, and then jumps over, as if it were made of thick steel. <br /> <br /> The show was so bad that you could not watch it. Even my wife, who is more acceptable than me, has commented on technical faults. What stunned me was how this point of sale could ever happen. Are the producers of these things so accustomed that they can not even recognize them? Someone read this script and said: Yes, I want to spend a million dollars to make it real. I would like to be the next appointment guest. I have a title for a wonderful bridge in New York that I would sell cheaply.
