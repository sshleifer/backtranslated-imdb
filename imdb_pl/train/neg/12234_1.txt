I think it was useless to produce the second part of the movie, such as "My Girl". "My Girl" was a very good movie, but it's funny, creating the second part of the movie in which one of the main characters dies (Macaulay Culkin as Thomas J.). The story ended after the first movie. I wonder why someone tried to find a way to make this story. It was pointless!
