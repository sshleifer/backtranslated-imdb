The story of a woman (Ann) on her deathbed, her two daughters (Nina and Constance) and her thoughts on the past. Retrospections relate to the weekend when young Ann is married to her friend Lili. At the wedding, he meets Harris, who will influence her for the rest of her life. Through all the ups and downs of his professional and family life, he remembers him as his true love. Her daughter Konstancja is older, more "responsible", she is the mother of two children and she has everything together. Nina jumps from boyfriend to boyfriend and does the work to do and is not sure in which direction she will live. <br /> <br /> Above all, good. The details of the period in the film are great. Dresses, hair, cars, houses, etc. They really bring you to a different time and place. The film is also a very good game. Vanessa Redgrave is pretty good at presenting the main character and her delicate mental state when her life comes to an end. Claire Danes is beautiful and does a great job as the main character when she was young (and she is an outstanding singer). Hugh Dancy brought a lot of life to the brother of Lili, Buddha. <br /> <br /> Now for the bad, which unfortunately is everything else. Things constantly disturb the story that is developed for us. Chemistry between young Ann and Buddy is great. They play and dance. Then ... you should believe that he really does not like him more than a friend, and that his piss only annoys her. And I thought that the whole, "he could be gay," was out of place and did not serve the purpose. <br /> <br /> Then we have Harris. The figure is wooden and frightening. If it was a different species, you would know that Harris was a serial killer from the very beginning. It is amazing to think that all these girls loved him so much (but they show other guys as very weak to try to help him). <br /> <br /> And the biggest problem with everyone. Why are not Ann and Harris meeting? They fall on each other. They have a great sex night in an old dirty gardener's cottage, they return home to learn about the tragic end of the Buddha, and then ... <br /> <br /> Nothing. <br /> <br /> They meet a few years later and have foggy eyes around them and I could not resist wondering why. WHY? The film does not let you understand why they were forced to marry other people, so it was hard for them to feel sorry for them. <br /> <br /> This part of the story is quite boring. Fictional good daughter and banal evil daughter. Nina changes during the movie, but I do not know why. I do not know what convinces her to change her life. There is a "moving" scene in which daughters reunite, which coincides with the old Ann who dreams that she is chasing a butterfly. It is really bad and embarrassing. <br /> <br /> "There are no errors", Ann advises us. This statement does not fit the story. And this is not true after watching the movie and regretting that they have not wasted the talent of such good actors.
