The charming Eva Longoria Parker plays Kate, who dies after an ice angel crushes her before "I do's" with her fianc√© Henry (Paul Rudd). After two years, Henry has not moved yet, and his sister Chloe (Lindsay Sloane) is very worried. Chloe organizes a conversation for Henry with an attractive psychic Ashley (Lake Bell). Ashley is to contact Kate's spirit, hoping to help Henry survive. When the psyche begins to attract Henry, the ghost of Kate seems to nibble the romance in the bud. There are a few funny situations; but if you've seen trailers, you've seen the essence of the movie. Also in the cast: Stephen Root, Jason Biggs, William Morgan Sheppard and Wendi McLendon-Covey. Personally, I thought that Bell stole the show from Parker. And Biggs hurts his ass as usual. This movie was still overdone.
