I checked it on DVD for a dollar, so I could smile easily when this horrible movie develops. every time you think it can not be worse, it's inevitable. Acting is absolutely terrifying. the plot does not make any sense at all. The title of "cold revenge" in the American version of DVD has absolutely nothing to do with the script. Action scenes are so obvious in their first shot. There are many mistakes during the dialogues, which indicates that there is no intention of making further attempts to at least try to make the film bearable. I do not remember seeing an inferior movie and I get bad movies from time to time - well, except for the unstoppable Wesley Snipes. No, who am I kidding, while angry, Unstoppable deserves the Best Picture Awards on Oscars compared to this piece of bullshit.
