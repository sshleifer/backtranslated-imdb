Honestly, I went to watch this movie, not because of the actors, not because of the story, but because in Luxembourg it was classified in 17th place, and the film must be really brutal or pornographic to put it in that category. Believe me, being a movie fan, I've seen a lot of brutal movies in my life (Ichi the killer, Irreversible, Hellraiser), but this movie was by far the most disturbing and brutal image I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The plot is stupid, the director is terrible, the acting was mediocre, even the music was a cheap copy of the so-called. "Horror Soundtracks". There is not one intelligent aspect in the whole movie, and some scenes are really difficult. (especially the scene in which you see embryos in glasses and hear the baby crying - terrible). I do not understand why the film was classified in 16th place in Germany, where normally the criteria are really difficult (eg Kill-bill (brutal, but they made fun of themselves and had great allusions to Asian cinema, and also a great director) even a movie like the state of grace is estimated at 18). No one can call this a horror movie, because in reality it was more about showing the gore than about frightening the audience (showing the face of "Creep" in the middle of the movie was a very bad decision); for me (sorry for the expression) is only one crazy director experiencing his disturbing fantasies. In some scenes, you see violence that has absolutely nothing to do with the plot or explain anything. The plot has holes and defects, the dialogue is boring, I can not honestly mention any positive aspect of the film, except for the British and Scottish accents. <br /> <br /> If I had something to say, forbid this movie from theaters, I fully understand why none of the big production companies have invested their money in this nonsense. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to get feedback to my thread and would be happy to discuss one or another topic. <br /> <br /> "Livin 'the dream baby, revive the dream" David Aames
