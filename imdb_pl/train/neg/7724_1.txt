Seeing all the negative reviews of this film, I came to the conclusion that it could be another comic masterpiece that was not meant to be. I watched the first two scenes of the fight, listening to the general dialogue that made Lungren terribly, and all the other actors in the movie, and found the movie so horrible that it was funny. Then Brandon Lee gets into the story, and the single-hats begin to fly, the plot breaks down, the writers start to drink, and the film is consumed, it is welcome, because it changes into the worst EIO action movie. <br /> <br /> Lungren beats his previous efforts in "The Punisher" and others, as well as all of Van Damme's films, Seagal's films and non-Rocky Stallone movies, for this distinct honor. This movie has the worst acting (check the face of Tia Carrere when in any scene with Dolph, it's worth laughing), with the worst dialogue in history (Brandon Lee's comment on the small Dolphie is the worst line in film history), and the worst costume in the movie (Dolph in full Japanese outfit). Image "Tango and Cash" with worse acting, meets with "Commando", meets with "Friday the 13th" (due to senseless nudity, and Lungren's performance is very similar to Jason Voorhees), within an hour and fifteen minutes of joke with film. br /> <br /> Good (if not horrible) performances go to the wrong guy (who still looks hardened throughout the performance) and Carrere (who somehow tells her 5 lines without bursting out laughing). Brandon Lee is just Lungren's helper and does a really terrible job. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible, awful movie. Fear this and avoid it. However, if you look at it, ask yourself why underwater photos are twice as clear as most underwater photos. Speaking of underwater shots, check out the lame scene of fighting the worst fight scene. This movie has every version of a bad fight scene for those who have short attention and fill in flashes of nudity. <br /> <br /> BAD BAD FILM !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
