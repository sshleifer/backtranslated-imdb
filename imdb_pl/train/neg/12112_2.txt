I can not believe that I wasted my time on this movie. I could not even call it a movie. It was so bad that I do not recommend anything. <br /> <br /> I like low-budget movies and weird cinema, but this one bored me to death. Badly performed and bad acting ruined it out of curiosity. You have to wonder what these people thought when they spent the money to make this movie. I wonder what I thought, watching it to the end. I do not recommend this movie to anyone. How did they spend it? Was there an audience who likes this movie? It must be because you can find it in almost every video store. But why? <br /> <br /> He deserves to be forgotten. <br /> <br /> If you like bad movies, this is for you.
