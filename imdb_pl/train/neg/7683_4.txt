"The Cobweb" is an example of many examples of films that are characterized by strong, sometimes remarkable performances and high points, but unfortunately they are crushed and slowed down by a dark story and very little to interest the public. He performs as Richard Widmark as a physician working in a psychiatric institution, whose life becomes agitated due to family problems and a rather absurd and overworked conflict that really does not seem like anything big. <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous. It is time for the institution to receive new curtains for the library windows. One old woman wants her curtains to be put on, but many patients want to do their job. And somehow this absurd and unwillingly crazy conflict breaks into a moment in which life is threatened and families start to fall apart. It sounds more like a conflict between very young children. <br /> <br /> Questioning the logic of the plot and whether it can really happen is so huge that you can wonder if only a real sleepwalker could buy it. Do not get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with acting. The cast of Widmark consists of other great actors, including many Oscar-nominated and winners. Sometimes there is a moment in the film that works great, but it always excludes a silly storyline about window curtains. Unfortunately, there is too much about Doggone curtains, so the film slows down. Many of them are long and made from the point of view of one camera, according to the slow pace and lack of interest in watching. <br /> <br /> In the short analysis, "Spider's web" is an unrecognized movie and it becomes obvious why viewers basically as soon as the plot focuses, does it quite quickly. Watching this does not seem very pleasant and I'm telling you that watching it does not make much fun.
