After about three minutes, I began to scroll quickly, stopping only during the nudity (why is it that the bad films always contain such a good-looking woman?). After ten minutes I finished and regretting that I can not get my money back from the rental company. People who write these films should be sanctioned by the MPAA. Come on writers - the wicked ALWAYS get in a car with a bomb activated by a good guy's pilot! This is how it has been done since the time of the Ottoman Empire! In addition, to add insults to injury, the "twist" at the end was so formal that it could come from any action movie written in the last 25 years. Burt Reynolds was doing well, but he should concentrate on real films. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a waste of time - Run away! Escape!
