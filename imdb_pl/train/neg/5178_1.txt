I feel that it is my duty as a lover of horrors to warm other people about this horrible and very bad film "horror film". Do not waste time or money on this movie, acting is bad, history is just one of the worst I've ever encountered, and the script was just awful. Nothing in it was good, in the end you think, why I'm watching this nonsense. The plot had so many holes in it that they never finally cleared up, it was just so bad, I do not know how to make such a scary movie. As I said before, I love horror movies, and I was so disappointed that I was 18 years old, but you can see some blood and no dreads or jumps. Also annoyed me, how stupid things took place in the movie, which did not make sense at all, like kissing brother and sister, why? all I can say. Just do not worry, there are many more great horror movies, just do not waste time, life is too short.
