Whoever would have thought that ANOTHER film "Alone" would be a good idea, should have a researched head ... The same thread, another kid, more villains (which leads to MORE infinite stupidity in traps). The other two films were bad enough, and that's where they hit the bottom. People can also watch other movies for the story, because they are all identical.
