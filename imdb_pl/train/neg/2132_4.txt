This film tried to be too many things at once: a prickly political satire, a Hollywood hit, a juicy romantic comedy, a promotion of family values ​​... the list goes on. All of them failed, but the interest was enough to keep me from turning it off. <br /> <br /> Although I appreciate the spirit of WAR, INC. awkward effort, especially when taken up by his goals, to reflect the absence of serious criticism, and not simply the weak writing, direction and production of this particular film. <br /> <br /> There is criticism regarding the corporation of war. But in this way, joking about it reduces the real crime of what is happening. It reminds me a little THREE KINGS that likewise trivialize the real reason for anxiety.
