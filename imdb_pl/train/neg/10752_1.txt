This movie was so disappointing. With blurb, which made me decide to see Phantom Love (why is that called?) I expected something artistic and thoughtful with beautiful pictures. He had some interesting paintings, but they often seemed accidental and did not make sense. In fact, it seemed that they were inserted to fill the time. Ultimately, the effect was apathetic. <br /> <br /> I think the film was supposed to be atmospheric, but it just was not. The lack of a coherent plot did not help. You could say it was mysterious, but I think it was simply incoherent without atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The main character seemed to be disturbed, but the conspiracy did not draw me enough to worry about her situation. Without looking at the cast list, I would not know that you see the main character as a child. The film has very little context for time, place or character. I'm not a pruder, but sex scenes (there were a few) seemed pointless and made me more wrong, I met Lulu, but I was not sure if he was the same man, different men, lover, her husband or prostitute. Only when I saw the credits I discovered, the hairy back was supposed to belong to her lover. This movie has made things that should be shocking (dream sequences with Lulu's mother) seem a bit boring. <br /> <br /> Making nails did make more sense because it gave some hints about Lulu's emotional state. I will not blame the actors because they did not have much to do. <br /> <br /> I do not know if the lack of context or flow in the movie was due to ineptitude or because it was pretentious but the end result was boring. <br /> <br /> I can not talk about it anymore.
