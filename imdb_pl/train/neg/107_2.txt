If the crew of "Zombie Chronicles" ever read it, here are some tips: <br /> <br /> 1. In the movie "Twist Ending" is not a good idea to insert close-ups of ANY DEATH IN THE FILM in the initial subtitles. It spoils the twists, you know ...? <br /> <br /> 2. I know that you produced it in a modest way and - to be honest - you worked on miracles with your budget, but please, hire people who can act. Or at least walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you ... <br /> <br /> 3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, do it only if you have props and costumes from that time. <br /> <br /> 4. The twisting ends are to be a surprise. Sure, we do not want phrases that do not make sense, but "reveal" signs as soon as you enter a character? This is not a great idea. <br /> <br /> Kudos for the guys for the test, but honestly, I'd rather not ... <br /> <br /> Only for zombies.
