My wife and I thought that with this cast and director the film would have to be at least worth watching. We made a mistake. In fact, we gave up after 45 minutes. The idea that Crawford, Young and Tone are British, but speaking with American accents, was impossible to avoid - it's hard to believe that it's England when nobody speaks with a British accent. There is no chemistry between Crawford and anyone, and to repeat the previous comment, the idea that Cooper and Crawford are suddenly announcing their love for each other without any reason is preposterous. There is no reason to care about any form, so we threw the towel halfway. It was hard for me to believe that Hawks directed it because none of the actors used the Hawksian trademark. So save time and skip this one.
