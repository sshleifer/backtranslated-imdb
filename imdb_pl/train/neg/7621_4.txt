As already mentioned, this formula has been filmed several times, most recently as "You Got Got Mail", with Tom Hanks and Meg "Trout Pout" Ryan. From several versions this is my least favorite. I think the problem is that the studio chose the charisma of Stars, which does not completely kill him here. There are no real sparks. Van Johnson and Judy Garland remind me of old donuts, nice but bland. And when the notes are boring, the rest of the movie can only come. Judy is particularly disappointing. It looks like there is no neck! I do not know if she was in pain or something, but she looks like a turtle trying to pull her head into the shell, everything hunched over and everything. I could not understand what Johnson was so hot about. I would make a bee line for this charming violinist. And Van was not great either. I've always considered him a typical Hollywood leader and he does nothing to dispel this picture here. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of stars or the beginning of the 1900s, maybe I'll like this movie. But there are many more fun romantic comedies that offer much more than a bite of stale sweetness.
