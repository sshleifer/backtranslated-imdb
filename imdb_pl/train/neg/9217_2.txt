Yes, the only thing that this movie keeps in mind is that he played the young Tom Hanks, who just a few years later would be the right star in Hollywood. However, this is not a movie that will show its talents at all, and the only other thing that can be considered a bit funny in this movie is the scene in which he thinks he sees monsters and leads a guy. Yes, this movie is about bad games that make a group of people use their imagination and try to come up with interesting scenarios. Essentially, a special type after school, about evil in the game Dungeons and Dragons cleverly transformed here as Mazes and Monsters. Apparently the creators of this movie thought that suckers should not play, unless they intend to go out and drink alcohol, drugs, have unprotected sex and harass other weaker children, as all popular children do. No, those bad guys were playing a game that actually required brain use, no sky! It's not that if they have a brain, they may be able to think for themselves and not be brainwashed by some groups. Yes, I think this movie is completely stupid and a waste of time. It is true that it can be a movie against addiction, but there are far fewer people who have died, taking Dungeons and Dragons to the end of their existence, rather than claiming that drunk driving within a month.
