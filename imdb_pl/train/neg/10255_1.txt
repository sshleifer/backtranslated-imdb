He has Christopher Lee, he has huge computer banks from the '70s that make Teletype noise when letters appear on the screen, has radioactive isotopes that not only glow in the dark but emit pulsating sounds, have volcanoes! evil aliens dressed as nuns! tidal waves! earthquake! exploding cars! exploding coffee makers! and the whole planet is the culmination. How did it happen that this movie was so incredibly stunning DULL? The answer, my friend, is that 90% of the film consists of shots, most of which involve long tracks, pans or close combinations, and sometimes all three that do nothing, except to provide the crew with something to do. Endless shots of our heroes riding, getting in and out of cars, driving again, walking, looking at things, getting in cars and guiding ... I just sat and watched the endless parade of nothingness in a daze, murmuring, "Say something, please, someone just say something ... Do something ... whatever! ... "<br /> <br /> Dialogue, when it arrives, is awful. <br /> <br />" Maybe their minutes are measured on a different scale than ours ". it was typically irrelevant. The scenario ends in the destruction of the world by film material, justified in this speech by Lee as the head of a foreigner: <br /> <br /> "Planet Earth releases excess disease, pollute the universe. All the light years of the planet will suffer so unless they are destroyed! <br /> <br /> This is writing a Neanderthal SF script. This is a kind of motivation that can be found in films with Japanese monsters from the fifties, designed for 7-year-olds. That's how I collect and collect such things, the most horrible line from the English SF film, since Buster Crabbe retired. This is the belief that this movie was released in the same year as Star Wars and Close Encounters. <br /> <br /> Lee, who always seemed to me a wise, useful actor with some knowledge of his limitations, delivers his lines as if he was going to kill his agent for putting him in this pile of Drek. I do not blame him.
