Just because someone is under 10 does not mean they are stupid. If your child likes this movie, test it better. I'm still amazed at how many people can be involved in something that turns out to be so bad. This "movie" is a showcase of digital witchcraft and NOTHING OTHER. The letter is terrible. I do not remember when I heard such a bad dialogue. The songs are unhappy. Acting is below the norm, but the actors have not received much. Who decided to hire Joey Fatone? He can not sing and is ugly like a sin. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is the obviousness of all this. It's as if the writers were doing everything to make everything as stupid as possible. Great movies for children are wicked, intelligent and full of wit - movies like Shrek and Toy Story in recent years, Willie Wonka and The Witches mention two of the past. But in the constant suppression of Americans, more and more people come to jump out like Finding Nemo (yes, that's right), the recent Charlie & The Chocolate Factory and squeaking rubbish like Red Riding Hood.
