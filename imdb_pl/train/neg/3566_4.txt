Now I have not read the original story to know all the literary points that have failed here, so I do not intend to follow this path here. <br /> <br /> But I have some time ago I learned that Stephen King's films are simply - they are not horrors, maybe with a few exceptions. It was not one of them. It started well enough, and for once I will not complain about acting, although Fred Gwynne was, as usual, wonderful ... I will also forgive the complete lack of parenting skills, because they were necessary for the story to get here ... <br /> <br / > But there was one coherent point that I could not resist irritation. And it was quite close to the end of the movie, and at least 2 characters took part in the activities of stupid stupidity. The moments I'm talking about are the following: A tiny zombie runs around the house. You suspect he's under the bed. Do you <br /> <br /> (a) approach the bed as you can, before you blindly raise the quilt, exposing almost your entire body to any damage that may be inflicted on you by malusieńki nieumarły kanibal, or <br /> <br / > (b) move away a little from the bed so that you can look under the completely open end from a slightly increased security position, or at least see the mini-terror coming to you, giving you some reaction time. <br /> <br /> I know, let's go with (a). I feel like giving myself to the slaughter today. Bleh <br /> <br /> However, a funny enough movie ... Just not very scary.
