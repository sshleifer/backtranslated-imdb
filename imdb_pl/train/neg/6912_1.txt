The only reason I gave him 1 in 10 was that the option of giving her zero to 10 was not allowed. It was the greatest waste of time I have ever experienced. For about 75 minutes you give in to the WORST game (and I do not mean it in a good way, like in KILLER NERD, which had great horrible acting) and a story that is not only absurd, but also absolutely NOTHING to do with the massacre. The reason I even rented this shit was because it had a massacre in the title. He said that there was only one murder in the entire movie and it was pretty bad. You spend more time watching children who are arguing and working in the yard than anything else. Speaking of children, a little boy is probably the most annoying child actor since Bob is at home at the cemetery. Did I mention that the film was also shot? If you want to throw away your money and over an hour of your life, just watch him. But if you relish your hard-earned dollars and time, move as far as you can.
