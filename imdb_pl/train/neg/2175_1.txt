Carlos Mencia, still, violently, with hatred screams "B ** ch!" In women is like a scream of "Ger **" in Black, unless worse. Remember that the word B, as opposed to the word N, is the only pejorative term that is still associated with violence every day. "B ** ch!" Is the last thing that women will hear before being raped, beaten or murdered. This guy perpetuates violence by using the language of violence hatefully. It looks like he can be gay trying to hide from a woman to sound like a straight guy. And what about all the Nazi white guys in the audience giving fascist salutes while their silly little white bimbo white women whimper at their side, clearly terrified to protest against this wave of hatred of women. Tee hee hee. Bet Mencia does not believe or support free speech for THEM! Come on, Carlos? Do you want women to be free to speak to you so loudly, violently and brazenly as you do, or do you think that "freedom of speech" is only for men who shit on women?
