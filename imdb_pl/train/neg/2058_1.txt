I can not say very much about this film. I'm sure the idea and script looked good on paper, but the filmography and acting I'm afraid of are not the standards I would expect from some very talented people. I doubt it would be high on their CV. Michael Caine sometimes seemed wooden as a Doctor, and I never believed in his character. The plot was unbelievable, especially with regard to the son of the victim. Some of the scenes were very similar to other films that sometimes wondered if it was a thriller. Sometimes the lighting was dark, which added to the feeling of watching a low-budget movie with a few big stars, wondering why I did it at all.
