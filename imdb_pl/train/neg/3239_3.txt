Ah, the infamous "Guinea Pig" series ... I really have to say that I was all disappointed with this whole series ("He Never Dies", "Mermaid in a Manhole" and "Flower of Flesh and Blood" being exceptions ... and even these are not great in any way ...), but "Devil's Experiment" are normal blows. There is nothing realistic looking beyond the climax (and maybe anti-climatic, depending on how you view it) scene of piercing the eyeball. The victim does not seem to care about what is happening, and he just whimpers or whines, subjected to "hideous" (more often "funny") torture. "Flower of Flesh and Blood" is a more violent and bloody representation of a false "snuff", but this movie also does not match the level of realism. I praise the Japanese for crossing borders, and they really have come a long way over the last two decades to wear a crown in "extreme" movies, but "Devil's Experiment" just can not stand it. It's worth a look if you're die-hard, if for no other reason than to see what's going on, but I can give this film an exceptionally generous 3/10, and that's just for a needle in the eye of the stage ...
