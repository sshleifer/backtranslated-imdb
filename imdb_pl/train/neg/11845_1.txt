... is the only way to describe this film about topics that should be reliable: scandal, sex, celebrity, power. Kirsten Dunst smiles through the role of the silent movie star Marion Davies, just as he thinks he's in Legally Blonde. The guy who plays William Randolph Hearst breaks to the point where you want to reach the screen and hit him. Eddie Izzard is pretty good, except he plays Charlie Chaplin and is oh, 125 pounds too heavy for this part? It is hard to believe that this wreck, an uneven wreck was directed by Peter Bogdanovich, but on the other hand, he failed to create a film that would be watched? 30 years? Sometimes there is simply no return.
