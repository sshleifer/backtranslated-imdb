Watching a video of 8 different Spider-Man cartoons from 1994-1997, I realized why I could not stand it when it first came out. <br /> <br /> I come from an old school where in 1967 Cartoon Spider-Man was the best and still remains the best. (I will not get to the awful psychedelic version - please, give me traditional villains.) Acting in new things is bad, read the card without feeling or taking over. Paul Soles, where are you now? This guy was the best in the vote for Spider-man. Nobody is approaching. Watching Secret Wars, a great idea for a mini-animated series, forced me to scream. Dr. Doom sounds like a comic version of Bela Lugosi. In the scene with Red Skull and Doc Ock, Red Skull does not have a German accent, while Ock is a hard Russian! The old series of Marvel comic characters from 1966 had a much better voice playing. Iron Man sounded like he wore an iron mask, Captain America sounded authoritative, not like a teenager. Paul Frees as Thing in the 1960s was the best thing ever. Former voice actors were pioneers and there will never be anyone like them. Have you ever heard the son of Mel Blanc? He can not repeat his father in any way. <br /> <br /> Animation is clumsy. Okay, so they have all the fancy shades of the form and the nicely painted backgrounds. Sometimes you can say more with less traffic if more traffic looks bad. Sometimes, when you let the computer take over, they become robots. I really do not think any of these animators know what's between them. <br /> <br /> Stories are badly written, and some lines that give heroes are terrible. Why, for example, when the characters first combine with each other, start to fight each other? In Secret Wars it was a bad excuse that led them to disagreement. I can see if the protagonist was dark, unknown and mysterious - like the Punisher, but why the Iron Man and Man can not keep their moods together, is ridiculous, and then joins Torch. This is just another of the later comics trends that will keep the characters away from each other for a few seconds because "everyone" wants to see these things. Give them a better reason to fight, maybe they can tear it, but "Hey, what are you doing here" and "Do not tell me what to do" are LAME's reasons. Another badly written scene is in Wesel, where Harry Osborne exposes himself to spoil Piotr's wedding. The whole scenario was horrible. <br /> <br /> Last but certainly not less important is what another critic calls Juvenile Violence - no blows at all. In Secret Wars, the Lizard carefully dodged the charge of Things. But Thing hits bad guys in a block of comics. He must simply return to lifting heavy things and mastering the evil man, grabbing him into fairy tales. Of course, these caricatures were not created exclusively for us adults, but for children under 12. That's why they can not have a fist punch because Mom and Dad do not believe in this kind of violence. But you can blow it up, these caricatures will contain it. As a child, before political correctness came in fashion, I saw comics striking each other. What's wrong with hitting chops? Are there less violence in the world these days because these slippery and insidious new cartoons have killed the blow? I find this to be the most offensive of all when I watch new things. They wrote a "blow" because we could all be hurt. <br /> <br /> Children, enjoy these stories, everything you want, I've seen enough. <br /> <br /> 3/10 rating
