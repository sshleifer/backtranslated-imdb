After watching the movie in its entirety, I am completely surprised by the admiration it received from critics and online users. Is this the worst western in history? No, I would not say that. But "the last great American western" that I saw in it more than once? Even close. <br /> <br /> The film, which tries to tell such a story, needs reliable characters who speak in a credible dialogue, and the dialogue in this film is one of the most hackneyed and banal I have ever seen. The film can be measured in groans per minute; how many times an actor or actress forced by the script to say something that no man would ever say in real life? There are so many examples that it distracts. Tricky lines come to you with waves; predictable, unoriginal and often. <br /> <br /> If bad dialogue does not bother you, then what do you say about bad shooting? Not many westerns can show you a shooting that is totally unbelievable, while you are desperately trying to force you to take action seriously. It is good if there is such a comic advantage in such shooting, as in Silverado, but in Tombstone a very staged and very rigid choreography of early shooting is another reason to leave this movie from the list of good westerns. The final game, in a sense, repurchases the director in this score, but by that time I was so disinterested in this film that it was beyond saving. <br /> <br /> In addition to these disadvantages, I can say that the graphics are stunning - well-filmed and all settings look great. Acting is passable, especially considering what actors have dealt with. However, if you're looking for the last big American western, do yourself a favor - instead use the Unforgiven option. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
