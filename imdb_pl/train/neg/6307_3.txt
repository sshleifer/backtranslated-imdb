I'll give him 3 just because he showed a story that we need to know to prevent it from being repeated. I agree with the comments from the Lord from Great Britain. The film was terrible. All stereotypes, no real plot. There are historical and technical inaccuracies. Look at the DE 529 technical specifications, or any Everts class escorts, and you'll see what I mean. Now I have a black month in the US and I will be called a racist just for saying so, but the story of this ship is not very good. They worked by escorting, chasing a "submarine", which turned out to be the hull that they had rammed. I'm sorry, but black people did a lot more in World War II, and this stupid movie gives them recognition. This movie makes them look like snakes. Let the name begin, I will manage.
