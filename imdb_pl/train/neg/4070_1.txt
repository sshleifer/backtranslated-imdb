Imagine the unbearable annoying Goth kids in a college movie in a scat movie, throw in a pinch of history and a lot of horrible acting, and you're still not even close to how bad the movie is. bad, bad effects, worse performance. Disturbed attempt of shocking terror. Everyone I showed it is a bit depressing. Erotic scenes are disturbing, not necessarily because of their content, but rather because they are simply something you want to end as soon as possible. The last sex scene is simply fouled before it reaches the guy. <br /> <br /> I am one of those people who love watching movies that people hate, that's why I chose it. But for your own good, save yourself time and avoid this disgust. It's so bad. I literally threw it in the trash.
