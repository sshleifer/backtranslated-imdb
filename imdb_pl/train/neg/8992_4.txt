It's a decent undertaking, but the guy who wrote the script seems to be a little in the dark, which makes the zombie movie cool. No, these are not CGI errors and software companies. Actually, I'm not sure if it was a software company - I saw it without subtitles, so I had to guess what they were talking about. In any case, I mean, instead of wasting time animating some stupid asshole, why not quit more zombies and more action. 2/3 of 20 minutes consists of newsletters, bugs, some guys shouting about something. And what's worse (more boring) most deaths take place off screen. I realize that this is too common for movies without a budget, but then there were very impressive effects (well, kind of) that made me wonder why the director (or screenwriter, whatever) decided to focus on how the epidemic began - It's short, no one will care.
