If you do not mind that your emotions will be fun, you will not mind this movie. On the other hand, if you like British crime detective stories, following the tips and seeing how everything logically works out late, you will be very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Here are some logical inconsistencies that lead to this disappointment: <br /> <br /> * While the police early uses CCTV cameras to collect clues about the mystery, a huge truck that stopped and blocked the view children just before it disappears, the camera is not caught. This is a key element of the mystery. The inconsequence is having a car in which the children were trapped in the camera, not a big truck that is so critical to the mystery. <br /> <br /> * The film tries hard to show how advanced the equipment is in tracking down movements of children, but there is no opportunity to use the same advanced equipment to track vehicles that could enter the crime scene from places visible in the camera adjacent to the crime scene as part of developing clues. <br /> <br /> * In England, the ride is on the left. The director does everything in his power to make the car in the parking lot with the crime scene on the right, a few meters from the kiosk with flowers, be able to park directly behind him or even from the side; as a huge truck did. <br /> <br /> * Criminalistics police are so meticulous to find a thrown cell phone in a sewerage system a few kilometers from the crime scene, but can not find any evidence of blood from a head injury at the crime scene, even though they have secured the scene with just a few hours after disappearing and without any precipitation. <br /> <br /> * Search dogs were not used at all to find missing children; it is from a country that is well known for developing a hunting dog for hunting and hunting. <br /> <br /> * It is illogical that such a publicized story would not reveal the probably innocent truck driver who has stopped at a newsstand. <br /> <br /> * It is illogical that the mother reaches such extremes and devotes so much effort to leave hints about the carpet fibers under her nails to finally investigate the murder case? even get the daughter to do the same - while she just could not crawl out of the unguarded mobile home. If she had had the feeling that she could ask her daughter to make carpet fibers under her nails, she might as well have asked her daughter to call for help, or even leave her mobile home in a crowded residential park. > <br /> * The suspect who kidnapped a little girl was depicted as mentally slow / domesticated - justifying his unconscious drowning of his mother? but he was clever enough not to cooperate with the police, and to take full advantage of his rights without burdening himself. <br /> <br /> There are more such inconsistencies that will disappoint a true lover. "Five Days" is a very weak British crime story.
