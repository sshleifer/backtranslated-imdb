Is this movie a joke? Is this a comedy? Certainly not a serious thriller? There is no suggestion that there is any intentional humor, but on many occasions poor acting, poor directing and frightening scenario made the audience laugh out loud at the cinema. The plot is acceptable - a promising young artist who has just reached his peak shot by a killer whom he mistakenly entered. The killer sees young artists who work in his portfolio and decides to take part in the exhibition of his works. At the exhibition, the killer meets the sister of dead artists and falls in love. All this is very predictable, and the end will not make anyone guess because it is so badly written. The film takes place mainly in Vienna and the surrounding area, in Austria, and shows what a beautiful city is. Do not waste time on this movie, unless you study how NOT to act, do not direct or write a script for a movie!
