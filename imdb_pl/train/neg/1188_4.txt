Kurosawa really did it. Any genius can fail. The concept is fine, but the performance is very blurred. <br /> <br /> This movie is fantasy, which makes it an artistic film. Poverty affected by Tokyo deserves a more just and realistic image. Many of them have interesting stories to tell. A very disappointing movie.
