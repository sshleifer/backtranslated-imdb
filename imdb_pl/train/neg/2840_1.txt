Two old buddies are sent to Japan to recover the results of genetic tests containing a video cassette that was stolen by the black ninja at the beginning of the movie. First, they must learn some ninja skills, because "only ninja can defeat ninja." <br /> <br /> Sakura's assassins try to be nice ninja-flickers, but they do it wrong. The whole movie is so empty and predictable that it's hard to say anything good: the same thread could be seen in different variations dozens of times, the characters are too short drawn, the direction is boring, and the scenario does not offer anything surprising, even on the final scene, which alone in itself, it reduced the value of the film (garbage). <br /> <br /> Even a ninja-flick fan from the 80's who understands the aesthetics of junk movies, it's hard to find this movie even a pleasant one. It simply does not offer anything new to the viewer, neither at the visual level nor in the story. Shurikens are cast, and katanas are swinging, but it is not enough to lead the film in the direction in which it was supposed to be, and repeat similar battle scenes, anesthetizing even the most horny viewer after the first 30 minutes. movie to everyone. Even the clumsy performance of Franco Nero in "Enter the Ninja" falls behind the American ninja Sakura the killer. Even at the visual level, the film has no balls and no time to look for great battle scenes in this movie: there is none. In total, one of the most futile ninja movies I've ever seen. He is not even interested in curiosity. Trust me on this. <br /> <br /> Â½ of 10.
