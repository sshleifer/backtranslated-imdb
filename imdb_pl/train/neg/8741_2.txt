Five minutes after this movie you realize that you've seen it before. This is the ROOM OF THE BOILER. This is COMPANY. And this is CONSULTING. And there are no new elements here. Except for the bright allegory of Bill Gates. Conpsiracies are always a good material for making movies, but why does it have to be so extreme? The boiler room is a good movie because - at least for a moment - it seems realistic. Everything is wrong in antitrust. How realistic is it, for example, that your boss pays a cheater to be your girlfriend, to work harder and control you? I would give him 1, but the soundtrack is OK, so 2/10.
