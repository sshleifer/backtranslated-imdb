Adjusting pieces to the cinema is often a bad idea, because they are two different media. Do you think it's a great idea to play ZULU on stage? Imagine that two brave redcoats are sitting in a tent, panting "Blimey there are thousands of them" Great movie and bad acting on stage <br /> <br /> To make theater art a great cinema, you need two essential things br /> <br /> 1) Great cast that creates on screen chemistry <br /> <br /> 2) Big dialog <br /> <br /> On paper Cher and Chazz Palminterri would be a good casting choice, but not in these roles. The story revolves around the hit-man played by Palminterri breaking into the house to kill the wife played by Cher, and most of the action takes place at home. I could not take these two characters seriously, although maybe it was the script's fault that she could not decide if she wanted to be serious or funny. Because the story is very static, it is extremely important that the dialogue shines again and again because of the bizarre tone of the script, which more than anything else embarrasses most of the conversations around sexual acts. if you want to see a great translation of the stage art transferred to the silver screen, give Faith for longing and watch 12 ANGRY MEN instead
