A former private bodyguard who took a look at his last job, he immediately gets the chance to return to his former profession. His task: to trace a mysterious French woman who recently arrived in California ... and apparently sought after by shoemakers. An unsuccessful attempt to update the genre of the noir movie, without a sufficient sting or wit (or involving the dynamics of the plot) in the scenario. The director and screenplay Paul Magwood (who later claimed that the picture was edited without his participation) does not impress that he highly values ​​films from the 40s, from which his "Chandler" comes from; his nostalgia is appropriately muddled, but also bitterly colored and somewhat indifferent. The service is interesting, commendable, and Warren Oates is well manned as a variant from the '70s in the archetype of a "private dick", but the movie has no problem. It's nice to see Leslie Caron and Gloria Grahame in the cast - though there's not much to do, and Caron's hot and cold anger all the time. Alive photos of Alan Stensvold, nice photos from the location, but no boiling. * 1/2 of ****
