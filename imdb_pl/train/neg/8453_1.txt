This film is a vague mix of cliches from the latest cinema. There are some promising ideas out there, but while the director apparently wanted to end up with an incredibly ambiguous movie, what ended up on him was a chaotic mess. The main actor Daniel Wu does a fair job, but without the main subject it seems that he has nothing to work with. What's more, the film is largely devoid of terror (though there are some scary moments in the honesty). <br /> <br /> * MILD SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> We have the mysterious death of a separated twin, devilish librarians, ghastly love interests, confusion of identity, death of wild monkeys, oedipal conflict, offensive stepfathers, sublime homosexuality and connections criminal gangs. The only real commonality of these elements seems to be that they make the hero express a vague sense of confusion and dissatisfaction. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of this movie is that despite the death of a brother, which monkeys are clearly visible on the DVD cover, the act itself is never directly portrayed. Instead, the director Julian Lee uses what seems to be a movie material of monkeys - not very scary. <br /> <br /> * FINAL SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> Avoid this. For a perfect psychological, ambiguous horror story, check out the Korean film A Tale of Two Sisters (2003).
