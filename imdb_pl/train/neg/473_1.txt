That's what my friend Brian said about this movie after about an hour. He could not refrain from napping. I was shouting about how terrifying it was and finally gave in and played because there were no adjectives to "boring". <br /> <br /> Imagine if you like, hack-work peak. Something so uninspiring, so impossibly terrible that all you want to do after watching it is to sit alone in the dark and not talk to anyone. Some people work with the illusion that this movie is audible. It is not, under any form of narcotic or brain damage. I would recommend it ONLY to someone to help them understand how unbearable it really is. Do not believe me? They gather around. <br /> <br /> Granted, as a nation, we in America do not always present the peoples of the Middle East in a tasteful manner. But what about a child in a shawl costume bowing in salaam-fashion on a pile of Castrol engine oil bottles? You will find it here. GET? ARABIC OIL. I could not believe what I saw. It would be more appropriate to bring the kid to a skyscraper building. Who in his right mind would think it was a funny joke? It is not even close to the "smart offensive". It just sucks and makes you want to hit anyone who gets paid to write this piece in the face. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the film, a group of five singing "Land Mines" enters the stage at the officers' ball. Okay, are you ready? The joke is that they sing TERRIBLY AND OFF-KEY. Why did I write it also in caps? Because the joke is FUNDUSZ, FUNDUSZ, FOUNDED IN YOUR HEAD with the HORRENDOUS marathon gags. They start quite average; cracking glasses, hitting drums with glasses ... that is, I am 100% serious, two-step stop-motion sequence with WOMEN'S OFF WOMEN'S SHOES. You read it correctly - the music was so bad, in one cage the women had shoes. In the next - shoes are off !!! Get it because the music was so bad that her shoes slipped off! What the hell???? <br /> <br /> Then there is an endless editing of footage to see that SINGING IS BAD. If any man actually suffered in this theater scene, not running like hell, I would be surprised. This movie is a sincere joke to see how quickly people were breaking the door. Robert Downey Sr. he directs comedy the way his son respects, without drugs. Wrong. Other things to watch out for: <br /> <br /> 1. Popular music was available whenever possible. Every time Liceman arrives, the really bad Iggy Pop song plays. In addition, all the actors are doing their best to behave as if for some reason it got really cold. <br /> <br /> 2. A criminal accent by Barbara Bach. It sounds like she was trying to talk like a child, rolling marble around her tongue. There are no nudes, and there are several scenes in which the boys moan and squeeze from the flash of her cleavage, as if they were in a class actary school and were directed to behave like excited delinquent people. <br /> <br /> 3. Liceman feeds his repulsive dog with a condom. Remember; when this film appeared by throwing "abortion" and "condom", it was perceived as "sharp". <br /> <br /> 4. Tom Poston plays a dark, hungry boy pedophile, when Hollywood thought that "pedophile" and "homosexual" are one in the same. Extremely embarrassing. <br /> <br /> 5. Watch the ending. There is nothing wrong with the VCR. This is actually the ending. Tell me you do not want to explode everyone who's ever made a movie. <br /> <br /> Watch this at your own risk. Up The Academy is known for making other films, such as The Jerk or Blazing Saddles, less fun just by putting a video tape around them.
