As a lesbian, I am always looking for gay and lesbian films. However, with this kind of nonsense - it would be enough to discourage the audience. <br /> <br /> I've been waiting for something that happened - whatever! make some sense. None has occurred. These were simply senseless scenes, unrelated to anything. The film failed to convey the character or depth of the character. <br /> <br /> After an hour or more of this nonsense, I just turned it off. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time on this absurdity. <br /> <br /> 1 Star - and does not even deserve it.
