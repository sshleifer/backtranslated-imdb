You'll notice that the chemist who appears in two scenes and says, plays Stephen King. "Do not give up on everyday work" is a standard thing to say, but it's unfair. King admits it quite sensibly: it is no worse than any other cast member and better than most. On the other hand, history is pure nonsense. Please, give up your daily work. <br /> <br /> I have never seen so many horrible performances - the most famous of which is probably the main actor (LEAD ACTOR!) - gathered in one film. Everyone works with a hammer, but not in any fun way; everyone somehow manages to cross the border without spending or manifesting energy. I blame the screenwriter / director Tom Hollanda. It can not be the case that ALL actors are REALLY as bad. What are the chances for this? I have never heard of any of them before, but I do not think I can enter the talent agency and come out with many bad performers, if I tried: ONE actor, despite my best efforts, would turn away to have talent. So what is more likely - that Tom Holland rolled a dozen consecutive serpent eyes, or that he wrote a bad script, and then directs him poorly? This would also explain why actors are bad directly in proportion to their meaning in the scenario. The more direction he had, the worse he played. ("Do you want me to bend like a hunchback, speak in the back of my throat, show all teeth and look bored, at the same time? Okay ...") <br /> <br /> This theory confirms the fact that Holland undeniably he managed to write a bad script. Several writers here commented on the fact that Billy Halleck is not a nice character, but this is a misleading way of putting it. He is not a known character. We learn everything about him before supernatural things happen because he's fat and all he can think about is food. ("Everything that I can think of is food," he tells us helpfully.) And finally ... <br /> <br /> (Sigh) I suppose I should put a spoiler warning here ... <br /> <br /> In the end, he becomes angry. Why? I can only shrug. Perhaps he is under some spell. Yes, that's probably it. By "evil" maybe I mean "inexplicable" - it's not so much bad as the socially undesirable suspension of the usual psychology of the end of the goal. In any case, his actions at the end do not make sense, no one makes sense, and this despite the fact that the characters do little, but explain their motivation for the good of the audience. <br /> <br /> By the way, here's my hammiest line / delivery candidate: "I do not think you like it. IN FACTS ... "[a big dramatic pause]" ... I do not think you like it. "
