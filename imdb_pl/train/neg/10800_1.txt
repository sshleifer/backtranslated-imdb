What was the meaning of this movie? What was the plot? I do not know. Shaq can not work, people do not know how to run, and I am Kazaam! A gin who raps? Come on. Maybe Eminem or Linkin Park will appear in such a movie. I remember watching it just to kill time. That did not interest me. I just remember thinking: "Who put Shaq in this movie?" The whole story also seemed stupid. It did not make any sense. I think the unrealized moral of the film is that you can find everything in the ghetto and everything can happen. I can not comment more because this movie is so terrible that there is nothing to comment on. "I would like" to let this movie go away.
