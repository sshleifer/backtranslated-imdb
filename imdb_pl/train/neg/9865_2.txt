I made this movie in the hope that it will be like "The Gamers" Dead Gentlemen Productions (which is worth recommending, by the way). Boy, what a disappointment! The film is shot in this fake documentary style made famous by the office, but it fails to implement it. The reason is partially rigid action, but mainly writing and directing. It's true that using any single stereotype can be fun when it comes to RPGs, but here it is done in such a way that it becomes extremely predictable. At the beginning of each scene you know what "a joke" will be about. But perhaps the biggest problem is that everything is presented in advance. In this film, there is no subtlety, if the words "LAUGH NOW" or laughter in the 80's style appeared, it would not matter. In some scenes, you can not think, "Yes, I understand why they thought it would be fun," but the way it is performed disperses everyone from the joke.
