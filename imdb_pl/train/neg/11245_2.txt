In 2004, I joined the Sky Captain theater, expecting a good movie. Almost every review of the film was positive, the effects looked tempting, convincing announcements. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, disappointment does not really describe the feeling I received from this movie. It was a rage. <br /> <br /> Besides the fact that the movie is boring and badly written, the reason why the movie gets 2 out of 10 stars is that everything in the movie has been stolen from another source. I understand the difference between homage and theft: it was stealing. More importantly, it seems that the filmmakers did not steal to expand the point or move the story. They stole to show that they can. It's literally pointless to show a wizard's clip from the land of Oz in the theater at the beginning of the movie, with the exception of setting a different scene (which I will not discuss) which steals from the same movie. Needless to say, every concept in the film was neither original nor even twisted on the old concept: it was just a reashation of something I've seen before, from pulp robots reminiscent of old Superman cartoons and the latest movie "The Iron Giant", to a silent martial arts servant of the villain that has been used in countless movies, most recognized in recent years as Darth Maul in "Star Wars: Ghostly Danger." <br /> <br /> About the real movie, most of the performances were completely wooden. Perhaps this is because the entire movie was made on a blue screen, and computer images filling everything except the actors. Honestly, it does not justify poor performance. If anyone has ever been a child, he understands that the lack of visual reference is not an excuse for not trying. <br /> <br /> There is no humanity in this film. The heroes are the only real human beings here. Almost all antagonists are robots, and the number of friendly characters that are shown during the movie can be counted on one side. If robots attack the entire planet, should not we expect that the masses of mankind will flee from them? The sub-par performance of the main characters prevents us from really doing anything here. <br /> <br /> The movie was not the worst movie there, that's why I did not give it 1 The film was rather an example of what is wrong with modern action movies: the film's creators tried to justify the film with special effects, but without the artistic vision or originality of any kind, it falls flat.
