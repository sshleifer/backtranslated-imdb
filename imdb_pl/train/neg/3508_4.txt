Despite the overwhelming cult of this sad "documentary", I must admit that I sincerely hated the film that hit our party as something more disturbing than useful information. Having said that, after watching a great stage musical taken from it, you can appreciate what the movie could have in better hands. <br /> <br /> You can suspect that many of us who were actively suffering from the movie could enjoy that any campaign impresses their cruel fans, who have destroyed the uncomfortable suspicion that too many of us - or those who have we know - there is only a mistake or two away from the deplorable situation of two crazy women who are present and who live and contribute to misery that seems incapable of controlling or escaping. <br /> <br /> The film leaves the viewer desperately wondering how anyone could have slipped to this level of degradation and, unlike the musical, offers no clues or explanations, only a horror that was not met by humor or insight . <br /> <br /> This crushing soul of the film makes reaching the stage version (hopefully it will be filmed eventually for cable TV) all the more remarkable. Act II is faithful to almost every detail of the discussed film, but strangely, placing a sad situation of prisoners in music, arouses human tragedy in art. More importantly, this act is preceded by a small Act I, in which we meet women before their decency in mutually possible madness, and they are offered instructions on how their isolated purgatory was created. In short, everything that the FILM is missing. <br /> <br /> To the merits of the filmmakers (or their successors), the excellent edition of Criterion DVD contains materials and bonuses that partly use the main movie - for the scenes photos, interviews and comments - filling some of the empty places that he originally edited consciously, they skipped in their quest for unpolluted horror and depression. They can not make an amateur film satisfying in itself, but they can at least make it a bit more comprehensible. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, however, only an unusual stage piece inspired by the author of the book by Doug Wright, composer Scott Frankel and author of lyrics by Michael Korie, raises the score of the original GRAY GARDENS over a single (generous) star.
