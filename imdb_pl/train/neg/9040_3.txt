I agree that although Melville's story may not be possible, it is not even a credible attempt. The transfer of history into the twentieth century outrages the original intentions and nature of the story; maybe you could move him to England, but it must be a piece from the era. Even our narrator of history - the owner - tells this in retrospection, going even further, somewhere around 1800. At the end of the 19th century, a strange disobedient employee would be rejected without thinking. And the twentieth century? Come on! Give me a deleted break !!! Even around 1800. This behavior did not work very well because of the ending. And the end of the movie? I do not know what it was because I did not watch the whole parody - I had to stop. It was like the "Streetcar Named Desire" setting in Elizabethan England.
