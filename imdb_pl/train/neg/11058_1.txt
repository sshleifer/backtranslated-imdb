Disappointing and undeniably boring movie about a real crime that poorly manned actor Jeremy Renner, lazily mumbling his way through the title role of Jeffrey Dahmer, who easily was one of the most recognizable degenerates / serial killers of the last century. Released straight on the video in early 2003, "Dahmer" is an overtly talkative, boring, badly preserved and practically bloodless snore-fest of a real crime drama that never really delves into the monstrous and insane psychology of a late mass murderer as if he had great potential ! But what he does, trying to do things for reasons unknown to me, evokes a kind of compassion for the human being, presenting him as a finally lonely, nebbishy and severely socially inept homosexual loser who simply looked like love in all the wrong places, unlike cold, the calculated and depraved madman and madman he was! In general, "Dahmer" from 2003. It's one that fans of real crime everywhere may well miss, because I'm not kidding when I say it's one of the worst serial killers in history! It's even more sad than other pathetic and exploiting trash, such as "Gacy", "Bundy", "Ed Gein" and "The Night Stalker"! (Turkey-Zero Stars)
