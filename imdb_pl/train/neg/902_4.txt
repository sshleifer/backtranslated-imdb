I suppose that this movie matters today because it was the early film of Sofia Loren. She was 19 when the film was made in 1953. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie because I wanted to see some of the early works of Sofia Loren. I was surprised when she arrived with a camera with brown makeup on the skin resembling an Ethiopian princess. Certainly today it would be seen as a slur and should be avoided during the creation of films. In fact, it has become annoying to see Mrs. Loren in skin color throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie would be better if real opera singers did this movie. Then the singing and real gestures of the faces of real artists would be obvious. I reject the comments of others about whether the real opera singers are older and heavier. <br /> <br /> As beautiful as Mrs. Loren at the age of 19 and is still today, the movie would be better received as though it was performed on stage. After all, we do not see beautiful young people on stage with "old opera singers" singing behind the curtain! Do not skip the success of using heavy opera singers. All you need to do is refer to the artist's most artistically produced commercial for J. G. Wentworth, and opera singers on the stage sing so professionally that they praise the company's product. This is one of the best and most entertaining TV commercials produced so far. <br /> <br /> The quality of film printing makes this production a bit inferior quality. The colored ink has faded a lot and you can not help it. <br /> <br /> To improve this movie on DVD, the production company should add subtitles in English so that we who do not speak Italian know what the lyrics say. It would help the story and teach her more than a narrator giving 30 seconds to the stage. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, not because of Aida's story or the fact that it's an opera. Apart from Ms. Sofia Loren, none of her actors is known or remembered by this writer. Instead, watch this movie if you are a fan of Mrs. Loren and want to see her at the age of 19 - regardless of production. <br /> <br /> Larry from Illinois
