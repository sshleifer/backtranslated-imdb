I did not know whether to laugh or cry because of this false interpretation of the history of Canada, especially because of the harm done to the history of horse police in Yukon. <br /> <br /> I will leave it to Pierre Berton, I noticed a historian, born and raised in Dawson City Yukon, author of the final history of Klondike gold fever, Klondike: The Last Great Gold Rush, 1896-1899, to express my irritation with stupid movie: <br /> <br /> The American idea of ​​an unbridled border, suppressed by individual heroes armed with six rifles, was continued in Far Country, another story about a cowboy from the American West - this time with Wyoming - a herd of cattle meat to the golden country. Image is the nightmare of geographical impossibilities, but true incompatibility is the main assumption on which the story revolves? that during the gold rush there was only one policeman on horseback in all of Canada's Yukon and that he could not deal with lawlessness. When James Stewart and Walter Brennan and the cattle reach the border with Yukon, the customs booth is empty. <br /> <br /> "Where's the policeman?" asks Brennan. <br /> <br /> "On the Pelly River. Trouble with the Chilkats - someone answers. He has a really hard job, this policeman. He patrols about ten or twenty thousand square miles. Sometimes he does not come home for two or three months. <br /> <br /> The historical truth is that the territory of Yukon during the gold rush was the nearest police state ever seen by British North America. Police in the north-west had been stationed in this area for a long time before Klondike struck. They controlled every path to the Yukon and did not have any nonsense. They collected duties, often as a result of the wailing of newcomers, made arbitrary regulations on river navigation and returned people back if they did not have enough supplies or just looked bad. In true Canadian fashion, they have established moral laws for the community. In Dawson, the Act on the Day of the Lord was strictly observed; it was a fine punishment for cutting wood on Sunday; and chubby young women were arrested for what the harsh police called "giving a risqué performance in the theater," generally nothing more than dancing evocatively on stage in excessively revealing pantyhose. <br /> <br /> In such a community, the belt was unthinkable. One notorious evil man from Tombstone, who tried to pack his weapon on his hip, was personally disarmed by a young policeman who had just thrown him out of the saloon for a shameful crime of speaking too loudly. The bad man came out like a lamb, but he protested when a policeman, after discovering that he was carrying a gun, told him to give him back. "No one has ever taken my gun yet," said the American. "Well, I take it," the policeman said gently, and he did it without further resistance. In Dawson, so many revolvers were seized that the police sold them at the auction for the only dollar and bought them as souvenirs to keep them on the fireplace. <br /> <br /> In 1898, in a big year of panic, there was no serious crime? let alone murder? in Dawson. The contrast with Skagway on the American side, which was an illegitimate city led by Soapy Smith, a man of trust from Denver, was remarkable. But in The Far Country, Dawson is seen as a community without any law that Soapy Smith from Skagway ?? the picture is called Gannon? can easily control. (In real life, one of Smith's men who tried to cross the border confiscated all his equipment and was again drawn in by the mounted police sergeant). <br /> <br /> {in the movie says lonely Mountie} "Yes, I am the law. I represent law in the territory of Yukon. About fifty thousand square miles of this. "<br /> <br />" Then why do not you have more? "<br /> <br />" Because yesterday it was a wasteland. We did not expect you to pour thousands. Now that you are here, we will protect you. "<br /> <br />" When? "<br /> <br />" A post will be created at Dawson in early May. "<br /> <br />" What happens from now to May? "<br /> <br />" Part of the time. "<br /> <br />" And what about the rest of the time? "<br /> <br />" Choose a good man. go in. Let it act as a marshal ??? <br /> <br /> The movie Mountie comes out and does not appear again in the picture. His amazing suggestion? that the American city marshal, along with the tin star, will be sworn in by a group of burghers living under British jurisprudence? is accepted. Of course, they want Jimmy Stewart to become the marshal; he clearly matches this part. But Stewart plays the role of Loner, who looks after Number 1, so another man is chosen to shoot him. And he does it. Others are shot. Even Walter Brennan is shot. Stewart finally comes to the unwilling conclusion that he must finish all shooting with his own photos. He pinches the old star, and he and the tyrant, Gannon, shoot each other in the inevitable western climax. <br /> <br /> Everyone who has knowledge of the north of Canada is a bald repetition, the story goes through a rational belief. <br /> <br /> fragment from Hollywood Canada, Pierre Berton, 1975.
