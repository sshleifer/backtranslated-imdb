This is very bad when the general summary of the movie has more information than the film itself. A long "thread summary" written on the video page contains details that I could not get from watching the actual movie. I found that I was constantly backing up to see what details I had just missed, what could have told me what was going on. Unfortunately, unsuccessfully - this movie leaves monstrous parts of the story, if you can call it history. It's as if they were trying to deceive us, thinking that there is a movie here, filming enough to make the story resemble and leave the rest of our imagination. Creator News: I paid to watch you shoot the movie. I can sit at home and imagine the plot and story for free. And Rosario Dawson? This is someone I've never given enough attention to to put a name on my face, and I can see why. She had one of the most artificial performances I've ever seen for a leading character in any movie, A or B. I thought she was all right, maybe she really did not want this role, she just got a strong offer for a movie she was not in? Wrong. She was listed as one of the producers. The next time you produce something, do not book as a leader if you can not act. If you can really, create a decent character. Also, someone here mentioned the problem of white / latino - yes, I hate to say it, but this movie turns out to be an act of revenge on white school-aged men who wear baseball caps. This happens when there is nothing in the film that would give the observer Latin characters. Adrian's character looks like a conceited moron who is no better than the antagonist of history. As for the Maya figure, she did not look like a real person. Anyway, I'm ashamed of Hollywood that this movie has even been made.
