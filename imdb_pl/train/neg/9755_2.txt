In 1974, Naschy was directed by Leon Klimovsky, and a cursory look at advertising photographs and packaging can make you believe that this medieval whistle lies somewhere between the "Inquisition" and "Sadomaniac." Unfortunately not. <br /> <br /> It is a matter closely related to PG, with gentle torture sequences, without nudity and with a slight advantage. Naschy (whom I am a fan of) plays his stuff as Gilles de Lancre, "antiguo Mariscal de la nacion". Unfortunately, he is more a pantomime villain than anything else. It feels like this movie that we saw him (and this) earlier. Strictly because only for Nasch.
