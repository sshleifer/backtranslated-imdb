When I bought this DVD, I thought: "It seems to be a nice light comedy about love and relationships created in Portuguese standards. Let's give him a chance? "I was totally incorrect! What a disappointing movie! First of all, it's not a comedy; it is a cheap drama that can be so melodramatic that it is even worse than many Portuguese soap operas! Second, the story is so boring and does not lead anywhere? It has no structure, it just flows like wind in one direction or another? Production is also bad! Audio mixing is terrible because sometimes voices are disconnected. It reminded me of some old Portuguese films from the 80s? Acting should be better too? In summary, it's not in movies like this Portuguese cinema will improve! In fact, it was one of the worst Portuguese films I've seen in recent years! Bad argument, bad behavior, bad production? I did not have much hope for this movie, but it was much worse than I imagined! Just forget about it!
