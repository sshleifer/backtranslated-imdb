I can not believe that some people really like it. They are still called Batman fans. He even went so far as to say that he is better than BTAS. Which one is not. They should be plagiarized for them to use the name Batman for this piece of nonsense. This is not Batman. <br /> <br /> The whole premise of the series is: "if you can not beat someone, get a bigger weapon to help you". He uses his batarang and the catch hook and the Batmobile. He does not invent any new ingenious technique every time he can not defeat someone. I do not know where the hell they came up with Batbot's idea. or whatever. They ruined all the criminals. Mr. Freeze went from a sympathetic scientist to a petty criminal who fell into something chilling in his veins. The Catwoman is now a 40- or 50-year-old woman with mute clothing. The penguin is now a ninja with a high hat 50 feet high. Ventriloquist is now called Scarface, which makes Dummy the central element of the character. They even got a stupid idea to make him a giant! wtf? and the two worst form changes are Joker and Riddler. they changed Riddler to a gothic / retro teenager. and The Joker for acrobats with dreadlocks. It looks like Bob Marley. they have a completely and completely battered batman, even more than B & R! I would like to meet the creators, writers and animators of this series in order to be able to punch them in the head with a metal baseball bat.
