Me and my friends rented this movie last night and we had one of the biggest laughs in a moment. Film should not be funny at all, but it is so funny and devoid of any realism. First of all, Phillippe (I forget about what his character is called and I really do not care) uses his usual employee ID to go through all the terminals with the highest level of security. Not only is it pathetic, but it is overcome when its enormous efforts end in finding such a terrible Lego room, in which there are super computers. That's funny. The tense mood we are about to experience is completely spoiled by the childlike look of the room. The ending, like everything else, is very shoddy, especially when the lawyer of the wrong guy appears "on time". In any case, this movie is a good laugh. If you need something that you can laugh at, definitely see it.
