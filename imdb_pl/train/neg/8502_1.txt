At the beginning, it seems to me an interesting film, a Spanish thriller in today's interesting Madrid, but it's nothing of it, in fact it is a film interesting only for future film directors, learning about what not to do when making a movie. In other words, it's even worse, even the presence of an Oscar winner (Mira Sorvino) is not enough to justify spending $ 3.00 to watch the movie, acting is frightening and it seems that the actors just waited for the end of the day to go home, they're nowhere to go and they are boring, weak and bad, do not spend time or money on this movie.
