I just watched this movie tonight and I have to say it's a mess. I love Vince Vaughn, but it ends up being more annoying, and the movie is more than just a remake of the classic "Santa Claus" from the 80s, but without the camp or the bad song of Sheena Easton at the end. The tale is your escape from a millstone black sheep in a family that comes back to face your family for the holidays, but with the North Pole. Obviously, Fred (Vince Vaughn) is a family who will screw up whoever comes home after a series of protests, including his girlfriend (Rachel Weisz as a cameraman), who throws him away, so he goes back home to face his parents and his more successful Brother Miko≈Çaj (Paul Giamatti) and crazy jins follow a bit of competition with siblings and a little anarky that threatens all Christmas. Now, if you think you know the ending of this movie, I think you would be right because it is predictable for the hill. When it comes to acting, Vince Vaughn plays the same dear loser, with whom he always plays, but this time it ends more annoying than pleasantly, Miranda Richardson plays Mrs. Santa, but the role is more than one note, Elizabeth Banks plays the assistant of Santa Claus, but There is not much of the character except the neurotic joke and the poor Kevin Spacey that basically ends up playing the same person he plays in the movie "Glengarry Glen Ross," but a little more anal. The only two actors who left this film with intact dignity is Paul Giamatti, who brings real honesty and is warmed up for the role of Santa Claus, but looks a bit embarrassing that he is in the movie and can not be blamed for him and Rachel Weisz, who manage to do a lot more with a small role than most major actors, which is a shame because both Rachel Weisz and Paul Giamatti deserved a lot better than what the script gave them. <br /> <br /> In short, a big disappointment.
