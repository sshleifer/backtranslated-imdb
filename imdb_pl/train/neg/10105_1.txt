Zombie Nation 2004 R <br /> <br /> Hey, I was bored. I looked into my little comic book to find a movie to watch. Zombie Nation? Hey, I love movies with zombies. He says that the filmmaker has a cult in the description. Funny, as it does not warn me before watching this movie. I could use this advice. <br /> <br /> Zombie Nation is the same as Troll 2 because it is completely misspelled. It has little (if any, depending on the point of view) to deal with zombies and takes place in one city. This movie revolves around a crooked policeman who is acting as bad as he can (he must try to suck so much) while he arrests women for trivial nonsense and then kills them. Yes, he is a serial killer. This movie is not only wrong in thinking that it is a zombie movie, but also completely confuse the facts about his serial killer. Serial killers like to kill, they live for it, and they connect with it. This guy knocks the woman and injects them some poison. He does not even make sex with corpses or smash them. Talk about boring! Eventually, one of the five women who will kill her, she did her Voodoo protection and for no apparent reason the five of them come back to life and manage to kill this guy. Everyone has been buried or thrown into the ocean, but you would not know that they are buying sharp, clean clothes that everyone wears. Women behave very badly and revenge. Oh yay. <br /> <br /> This movie was absurd in every category. Playing crap, writing nonsense, the worst sets and the worst makeup effects. Women do not look like zombies unless you count real dark makeup around your eyes to be a de facto definition of what makes zombies. Everyone can talk, act, think and act perfectly humanly. Gore is weak compared to even many PG-13 films, and nudity is timeless. You see shimmering breasts in the opening sequence ... Then exactly the same breasts later! Conjecture. Guess that only one actress was ready to go topless for this banal. The police station is so badly constructed that you can see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse in which they obviously film. You can see pipes and bad lighting and too rare settings, and even if you are not blind, you see that the director is not working. Avoid it, it's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> 1/10
