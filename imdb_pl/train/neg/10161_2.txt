I really did not expect much after this movie because it has people from Parkersburg WV who live playing in it. This city is boring, just like this movie. There were a few decent scenes in the movie, but I was distracted by all the bad landmarks they showed. This movie could have been good if it actually played in it, but it was not. If you're not from Parkersburg and you do not want to see what you see every day, stay away from the movie. Dialogue will make you sleep, the actress bores you with tears, and Steven Soderberg should lose some credibility after firing such nonsense. This is a predictable movie with no surprises. What you see is what you get and this is a 73-minute tour of Parkersburg West Virginia and Belpre Ohio without a narrator.
