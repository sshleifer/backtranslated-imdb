Dolph Lundgren appears as a Templar who arrives in New York when the archaeologist discovers a key that unlocks the antichrist, of course the demon is just a few miles behind Dolph and is not easily killed because it moves from body to body. (Like Fallen without tension) Of course, Lundgren has no element, and the movie is completely unobtainable. I admit that I'm a fan of Dolph Lundgren, like Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme, I try to watch his films while on TV. I caught the Minion and the boy, have I ever been disappointed. This movie is horrible. Because action sequences are so badly staged and poorly edited, you can barely get a coherent sense in the arena of battle. The worst thing is that Lundgren is pitifully unconvincing as a tough guy priest (!), And all this got worse because the movie is picked up from Fallen (which was good) and End of Days (which was bad but better than this) is the worst movie I've seen from Dolph Lundgren. He literally recommends nothing. It's awful and this is the lowest point in Lundgren's career. And I've seen Cover-Up, The Last Warrior and Masters Of The Universe. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * Out of 4- (horrible)
