My Take: a tired formula of Christmas comedy. Laughter is tired, and the talents behind him also seem to be. <br /> <br /> I love holidays the same as the next guy (even if I often have a bad case of Christmas blues), but it looks like it's just a dump for many holiday comedies that would be bad films every day of the year but it does not make them less painful in the season. As if we already had enough SANTA CLAUSE films (three and * gulp * still counts), who wants to see a movie about his brother? In the story, which would be at home with the Disney series SANTA CLAUSE (except for the unusual humor and "Little" Santa's helper in a short skirt), FRED CLAUS is a one-joke condition that lasts 116 minutes. Sure, Jolly Ol 'Saint Nick has a brother, but where does it come from? <br /> <br /> It's really a pity. FRED CLAUS is blessed with a cast who could make this a pleasant Christmas comedy that will probably melt with the snow, but it would be much better. Vince Vaughn is your typical snob, but we are convinced that he is a truly lost brother of a non-aging Santa Claus (Paul Giamatti) who invites his good brother to visit. Mrs Claus (Miranda Richardson) is reluctant, and even worse, the performance expert (Kevin Spacey) came to follow Christmas closely, and his LOW proximity was closed. Hah! And guess who plays Santa's mother! Kathy Bates, of course. Elizabeth Banks is Helper Saint Nicholas Charlene, John Michael Higgins is one of the elves, and Rachel You know Fred's girlfriend! I do not know if I would praise the casting or crush it. We have familiar faces here that add a bit of quality, but there are too few to work with. <br /> <br /> When it comes to humor, the best that FRED CLAUS could think of, the brother of Santa Claus is his exact opposite and wit about the elf DJ. I must admit that I had a few chuckles involving Fred, who is involved in group counseling for celebrity brothers (joined by Stephen Baldwin, Roger Clinton and Frank Stallone), but giggles start and end there. What's even worse, the film even succumbs to sentimentality, which is supposed to make us "feel good" and teach us the lesson "what really means Christmas". Apparently, what Christmas means for Hollywood is to get as much money as possible for Christmas shopping. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** out of 5.
