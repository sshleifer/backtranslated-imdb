I am Black living in a mostly black city. With that in mind, I have some serious concerns about Tyler Perry's work. I realize that some people feel the need to praise him because he is black and tries to present a positive image of culture. But, honestly, I believe Perry White, this movie would have NAACP, Al Sharpton and Jessie Jackson in his ass. <br /> <br /> I was forced to watch this movie all hell a lot lately and every second watch makes my blood boil. Characters are poorly written and work. The jokes are so bad, I have to say that something is fun. I'm going to break this big pile of sh-t. <br /> <br /> Madea = suck. The character could have some charm, but not anymore. When it seems that the only thing he does is to beat children and threaten with adult violence, he is less than useless. She is unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The situation with the wife of the fighting fiance was unbearable. If a woman was so terrified of her husband's death, why would she run away when she was sleeping in her bed? Would not it make more sense for her to leave when he was at work. Anyway, the characters in the bow were so annoying that I hoped he would throw her off the balcony and be torn up when he did not. <br /> <br /> Then there are two doves. The bus driver asks a woman, harassing her while he is doing his celebration. I could not believe it. I really could not believe it when she agreed to go out with him even more. But what makes a cake is that an adult male was brought back to throwing pebbles at the window and passing notes like a ten-year-old by castrating mega bitch. I do not use this term lightly, but this woman had only two modes. Morose victim and psychic mother. Regardless of which of the two faces she showed, she was one constant. The bus driver will not get any. He even married her without taking samples - WTF! <br /> <br /> Then there is the family reunion scene. Here we have a load on the mother, which includes the alleged taboos incest, grinding due to grinding, without a shirt, overly muscular, b-ball and the wonderful taste of Maya Angelou. When these babies dragged their asses outside and called a meeting, was not I right when I wanted the oldest to be considered a heart attack. All this shit happens during the reunion, in ridiculously easy to separate groups, and then they call. When they do this, everyone drops what they do, and they sit at the head to speak stern, just like the Pawłowo herd - WTF !! <br /> <br /> Then you have the last five minutes of the movie. We see in him how an offender fiancé is treated by his longtime victim and around the evil actress. It is an improvised wedding, in which Czarni are dressed like angels and hang from the ceiling - WTF !!! The only reason to look at it so far beyond testing the pain threshold is to hope that the second villain from this story will also get it. Guess what will not happen. Instead, Perry takes a challenging exit and plays safely, ending the movie with a tone of forgiveness - WTF !! <br /> <br /> I am sure that if I have a day, I will probably be able to write a doctoral dissertation on all the ways in which this movie sucks. Do not even start with Tyler Perry's other films. I will say it only. In my opinion, as a black guy, D.W. Griffith's legacy lives on. The irony is that he is doing it through Black, who will be praised for what the people of the nation did, selling us downstream. I just want Perry's movies to be dude, so I could kick them nuts. Thank you, old man !! What are you going to do about it in 2009, a comedy about rape and brutal beating slaves at Colonial America?
