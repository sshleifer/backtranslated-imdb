"Her Cardboard Lover" is the last film of Norma Shearer. She dropped films and, I think, joined the MGM Board of Directors. It was a good move on her part. Her Cardboard Lover was talkative and boring in parts. It was obvious that there were only a handful of actors with speaking parts, so they had a lot of dialogues to speak to keep this turkey on the surface. <br /> <br /> The story was a good idea about a wealthy woman (Norma Shearer) hiring a man (Robert Taylor) to be jealous of her fianc√©e (George Sanders). I am surprised that the director, George Cukor, did not cut many talkative scenes between Mrs. Shearer and Mr. Taylor. Mr. Cukor served Mrs. Shearer well in "The Women", but not in this film. <br /> <br /> Robert Taylor gave the best performance in the film. In the career of Mr. Taylor, he received the best comedy roles in this film and "When Ladies Meet" in 1941. In 1942, he gave his best comedy performance in "Her Cardboard Lover", and by that time his best drama in "Johnny Eager." He had a hard year. I think about all the MGM actors, Mr. Taylor worked with all the main and small actresses on the show. In addition, MGM gave all kinds of movies to Mr. Taylor - most of them were successful. That's why MGM kept him for 25 years. <br /> <br /> Mr. George Sanders was very good as a social heel. He played a similar role eight years later in "All About Eve", for which he won the Academy Award for his supporting role. As for Mrs. Shearer, it was one of her worst performances, it was not funny and too dramatic for this comedy. Strange that in 1939 she made a great comedy "Women" and gave her the best performance. It was obvious that he was too old to look for younger men in "Her lovers of cardboard." Besides, it did not help that some of her clothes were terrible. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that she and Mr. Taylor did not make another dramatic movie like their last movie, the great "Escape". The same comments about this movie can be said about another movie, "Private Property," which Taylor made in 1937. With Jean Harlow. It was too talkative, boring, and the actress looked old. Mrs. Harlow looked sick throughout the movie and no one in Hollywood noticed to tell her to go to the doctor, so in 1937 she died at the age of 26. What a loss! She became a good actress and gained better and better roles.
