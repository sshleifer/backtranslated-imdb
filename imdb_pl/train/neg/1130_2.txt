Too long a drama that can not make any real point. So she became an actress - so what? She learned to love - a big deal. There is some eccentricity between characters and dialogue and situations, but one that is bad for the film, often making it seem absurd. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix, the game at the forefront, talks and acts like a half-disabled person, so there is no way out how to watch a movie like a delayed girl who makes him in the theater world - which apparently was not intended purpose. We were told early (in this "similar to Barry Lyndon" narrative) that she had learned to hide her emotions, which certainly explains her autistic stone face, but the film suffers from it. She is basically like a zombie, and her success as an actress is not entirely credible, given her lack of emotion. Sometimes the movie had the boring, sleepy character of the movie Dogma 95. Is this one? I would not be surprised at all. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix is ​​the sister of Joaquim Phoenix and the late Phoenix River. Nepotism rarely works. <br /> <br /> If you want to see my Hollywood Nepotism Letter with more than 350 photos / entries, please contact me by e-mail.
