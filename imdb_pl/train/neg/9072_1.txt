This film has no plot or focus. Yes, it's supposed to be a stupid comedy, but screenwriters have no idea what a movie is about. Even the title does not match the movie. It should be called "Cool Ethan" or "Cheaters Never Win" or something like that. Characters are not developed and no one cares about what will happen to them! The figure of a girl's roommate (from that 70's show) was the only person who was worth watching. She was hilarious and stole every scene she found herself in. Others must make sure that their own university diplomas are in preparation because they will need a career other than acting.
