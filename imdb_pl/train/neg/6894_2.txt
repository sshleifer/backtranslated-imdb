It's sad when you can see what the movie tried to do, and it's pretty obvious that he's far from it. Film students should take it for the lesson and warning. The graduate has an idea. I want total control. So he writes, directs himself, produces his film masterpiece. Usually his concept goes well beyond his budget. Typically, he writes a overblown script full of all the tag lines he can come up with. Usually he is more interested in a big series of stories than the usual work with actors on individual stages. It usually ends with a movie that is weak in an attempt to create miracles with a small budget. It usually ends with a series of meetings (we can not do justice, calling them scenes) that seem to be written by a 12-year-old. And usually it ends with badly made scenes that do not catch the viewer. When you look at the judges from this perspective, you can immediately say that it is an ordinary fee.
