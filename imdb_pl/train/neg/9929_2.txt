Watching it was like getting a big mackerel hitting your face over and over again. Even when you thought: "This mackerel certainly can not appear again", * count * there. I'm not sure what they were thinking about. This is the kind of pilot I watched and wondered: "Did the actors know that they were on a doomed ship that was never to be transformed into a series?" Not only black stereotypes, but also Swedish and Indian. And although "Burning saddles" made these stereotypes a mixture of comedy and discomfort, these stereotypes were simply offensive. There was no plot line, the end was slapped, and the jokes were not. Still, if you're a comedy student, look at this pilot to see what you should not do.
