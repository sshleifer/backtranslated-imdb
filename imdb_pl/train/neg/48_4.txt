In this movie there are some nice shots that capture some landscapes with such beautiful light, in fact cinematography is probably the best asset. <br /> <br /> But it's basically more than a movie made for television, and although it has many plot twists in the story, which makes it quite interesting, there are no subtitles, and the key feature events are presented in the language Spanish, so non-Spanish people will remain a little lost. <br /> <br /> I had it as a Christmas present, because it's a family feature to work on the actor's films we're talented with, and Matthew Mconaughey was just amazing in "Time to kill" and "The Newton Boys" so I said that I want to see more of his work. <br /> <br /> However, as it is written on a DVD case, it's a Matthew Mconaughey movie and uses it as a marketing gimmick, it has several lines and is on the screen for less than a minute at the end of the movie, it's basically an addition and not It shines the screen exactly when it's on, so it's hard fans, again the ally is not worth it from this point of view. <br /> <br /> However, celebrity movies, Patrick McGaw is great though very easy in the eye, and his character is so nice and kind and caring, a real holy guy, he would be well-listed in ROM. <br /> <br /> So for the real Mcconaughey of the brightness of those I've seen, I recommend, "Time to kill," "The Newton Boys," Frailty, "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," "Edtv" and "Amistad" and also avoid "Larger Than Life" and "Angels in the Outfield", unless you feel like a movie for children or children around, because none of them indicates his talent, but they are fun movies for kids, again MM is like that really a supportive artist with just a few lines. <br /> <br /> When it comes to Scorpio, Springit is not a bad movie, but it's not a screen theft.
