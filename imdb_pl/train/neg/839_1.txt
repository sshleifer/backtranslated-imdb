The only exchangeable part of this movie was the price I paid. At least everything I lost was $ 3.00 and the time that passed by sitting through this bomb. A crew member who was responsible for continuity avoided the boat. When the leading woman and the FBI man went to the place of the alleged killers, the FBI handed the woman a revolver. When the alleged killer came through the door, the revolver magically transformed into a vending machine. It remains to be considered whether the FBP agent will give a weapon to a civilian? I think not. Mrs. Xavier seems to be a very attractive woman. It is a pity that R's rating did not allow her to see her. It would seem that the film editor cut out what could have been the best part of the movie.
