It's the worst movie I've ever seen. I can not express how bad it is. I honestly wanted to kill myself several times in this terrible experience to end the pain. I recommend instead of watching this movie, you are bathing in acid, or at least you will know a fraction of the pain without all the scars. <br /> <br /> I had such high expectations when I read the back of the DVD case, and when at the beginning she added that Jesus was following them, I was so excited ... and then I wanted to kill myself. I mean twenty-three minutes of introduction to the most annoying figures in the history of cinema ... ONLY PAIN! Monkeys could better edit this basket. At least they would throw away the feces and blot out some trash. It would be better not to see any horror. <br /> <br /> It was not that I did not get jokes, but that they were not only funny, but they were repeating themselves like twenty times. Apparently something is not fun unless you see it a million times. <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances see this. People rated "Manos the Hands of Fate" as the worst film in the world. I saw it too and I agree that it is bad ... but ALAS is only the second worst. "Fatty Drives the Bus" is definitely worse. <br /> <br /> It deserves all kinds of rough language, but I can not write it, so imagine that I swore a whole lot.
