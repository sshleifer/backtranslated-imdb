I did not read Lincoln's biography, so maybe it was an exact portrait ...... <br /> <br /> Or maybe it's because I'm used to equally repulsive and unrealistic performances that unnaturally deify Lincoln as a genius, honorary and savior nasza kraju ...... <br /> <br /> But why should they make a movie showing Lincoln as a buffoon? While Henry Fonda made excellent Lincoln, his image as "aw shucks, I'm a simple guy" seemed a bit offensive. <br /> <br /> [Of course, it was all Bush Jr. campaign so that we think he is an "ordinary guy", so we do not care that he is a rich and privileged moron - but it's a different story. <br /> <br /> Not only do the movie show Lincoln as a kind of simple (almost simple) ) the guy in the movie states that Lincoln just accidentally found himself in law, and that he was not even interested in the law - only with a falsely simplified idea of ​​law on rights and wrongs. In the film, he is not a very good attorney (he stretches with his feet on the table and ridicules witnesses), and the result depends mainly on the case / luck. <br /> <br /> In addition, partly because it was financed by the Republicans (in response to a game sponsored by the Democrats who left) and partly because it was only a sentiment of the time, the film is unfortunately religious, racist and conservative. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time on this movie!
