Since "Rugrats" fell from the category of good and funny comic series to the average and almost horrible dish for two-year-olds in the last three or four years, of course, tyrants in Klasky-Csupo should have no ideas. After stunning all the characters, adding even stupid new ones, replacing some of the voices (though I like Nancy Cartwright, she is NOT Chucky Finster!) And there is no sense of continuity (eg: in the episode Kimi I watched the second day, Tommy and Chucky got a new puppy, but in the next episode, the mentioned dogs will never appear), one would think that the creators can kill the show for mercy. But noooo. <br /> <br /> Everything I say about this particular is that it sucks! Although it is not as scary as the episodes of Kimi, everyone is even more stupid than they were, including grandfather (my God!) He was once the best character in the show, but now there is no real purpose). The ending is unnecessarily fluffy, and the only difference between this and other nonsense episodes ('98 -'01) is that children can interact with adults. Whoa, what fun! <br /> <br /> There are no stars for "The Rugrats All Growed Up" at all. Klasky-Csupo, please SAVE this program before it gets worse.
