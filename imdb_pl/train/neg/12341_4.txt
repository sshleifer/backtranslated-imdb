Scary scams are not only the 21st century. Before the "Scary Movie" series there were several examples of this genre, mainly in the 80's. But like the mentioned franchise, most of these films are a hit or a lack. Some such as "Elvira, Mistress of the Dark" usually rise above it, but others, such as "Saturday the 14th" and its sequel, do not give joy. But among all these types of films is one particularly great perpetrator, and this is "Transylvania 6-5000", the main waste of time for many reasons. <br /> <br /> Pros: a great cast who does it best. Some of the stupid humor is fun. A simple but catchy theme song. Some good locations in Transylvania. <br /> <br /> Cons: storyline plot. Mainly tedious stimulation. Most of the humor just does not cut him off. Monsters have little to do and little time on the screen. I thought it was supposed to be a parody of monstrous movies? A lame conclusion that will probably make the viewers angry. <br /> <br /> Last thoughts: This is a comedy? If so, why are really funny pieces so rare? Comedies should make us roll on the floor, do not roll your eyes and yawn, it hurts to end it. I can not believe that Anchor Bay has released this tired trash. I admit that this is not one of the worst films ever made, but it is not worth any time or money, even if you're a fan of any of the actors. See 'Transylvania Twist' instead. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/5
