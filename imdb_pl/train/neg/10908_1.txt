NIC in this movie is not fun. I thought that the premise, giving a man a libido ram, is interesting and should provide some laughter. WRONG! There is simply nothing funny in the film. For example, the main character, who goes to a goat in the heat in the middle of the farmer's yard, is not funny, it borders on obscenity. They play with bestiality in this film on one level, and it just is not funny. <br /> <br /> We all know that dogs will eat everything, anytime, anywhere. The main character doing it with everything, everywhere, is not funny at all. He becomes a clich√©. <br /> <br /> Rob Schneider is, I think, acceptable in this role. I mean, it's not a bad actor, but with rotten material, it's difficult to comment on quality. However, Coleen Haskell, the other half of HUMAN romantic tropes (or count the number of animals that the main character is interested in as romantic tropes too?), She seems embarrassed by the whole thing, as it should be. It seems to work in some void, detached from all other actors in the film. <br /> <br /> See this movie only if you want to be bored with tasteless, dull, repeatable material.
