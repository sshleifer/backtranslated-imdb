Yesterday evening I took part in one of the premieres and I have the following observations: <br /> <br /> 1. The fact that you have directed a lot of music videos does NOT make you eligible for making movies. The film had an excess of photos that did not make sense, horrible angles and terrible lighting. Editing did not help in this mess. When "Dixie" is late for a funeral service, her mother talks about her hand, but you never know what the hell he is saying. <br /> <br /> 2. The plot was promising, but the scenario was thin and full of Ford Truck size holes. We never understand what drives the characters, what really lies behind the conflicts that everyone has with them, or exactly how they solve them. Sixteen years of distance are erased within 4 days, it seems, by magic. Deep conversations were disturbed by stupid stereotypes. (In fact, the whole city was one big stereotype of southern life.) Half of the audience moaned when Toby stretched out his hand: "You have my blood flowing through your veins gurl" ... and we were treated to this bland line more than once, but TWO! The revelations were yawning, and dramatic confessions boiled down to "I was stupid and stubborn." <br /> <br /> 3. Acting was okay considering the wreck of the script that they had to work with. Toby was dark and brooding over most of the movie, but when he smiled and brightened, he was charming. It is a pity that he did not have more time on the screen. The Kelly Preston chops are quite rusty and it shows. Lindsay Haun is talented and it is certainly not her fault that the writers made her character so unlike the beginning that you do not blame her father for not looking for her. Burt Reynolds and Tess Harper were able to do more of this film, but they still looked more or less lost. (And indeed, their characters are getting lost in this movie!) <br /> <br /> 4. If you're a fan of Toby, you'll love songs. But often the movie felt like the scene was forced only to be able to present one of his songs - or artists on his label. For example, the official love song of the movie is "Crash Here Tonight". One would think that it would play around a delicate love scene, but no ... we hear about 45 seconds when going to a memorial service. It was as if they said, "Well, we have to use this song somewhere." The song "Broken" is haunted and the best of this movie. <br /> <br /> In conclusion ... the promising story never develops, and the movie is terribly uneven because it tries to be a vehicle to locate music and Toby Keith's products on Ford cars. From being about people who are rebuilding broken bridges, to being about the power of music, but the story is told so poorly that both points get lost in this oversized music video. I like Toby and I really wanted to like Broken Bridges, but the people he relied on made this movie go down and he deserved one of his famous shoes that you know where.
