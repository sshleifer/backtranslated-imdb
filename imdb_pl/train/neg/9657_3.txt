1) I am not a weapon expert, but I can even see the difference between the rifles of the American army in the First and Second World Wars. In the film, we see serfs, armed with "M1 Garand" (invented in 1932!), Not authentic "Springfield 1903" (alias "Silent Death"), which privates use until World War II. Difference - M1 can load 1.5 times more ammo and 3 times more fire! M1 was semi-automatic, Springfield needs reloading after each shot. Small difference ?! 2) The uniforms of the German army were also borrowed from 1940. Especially - helmets. German helmets have significant pike until the end of World War I, we do not even see one in the film. And if we do not do much additional research in the archives - how truthful is this "True Story"? I am surprised at how "truthful" film directors may be in pursuit of cheap propagation.
