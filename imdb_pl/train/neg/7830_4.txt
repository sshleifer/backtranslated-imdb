So far, Nightmares and Dreamscapes have been chaotic and disappointing. The first episode, directed by Brian Henson, could have offered some groundbreaking tales or real horror to a small extent, but at least it was well-focused, full of tension and visually interesting, with William Hurt's solid performance and very impressive special effects for the mini-series. <br /> <br /> However, the second story in the series was simply awful and not in style. The script is bad, requiring shallow, unlikely heroes to act illogically to move the story, and have characters dragging endlessly for clumsy, unnecessary exposure. Acting is exaggerated and unconvincing, and I felt much more empathy for a cold-blooded killer in the first story than for the newlyweds in the second. The director used a million tricks to create a frightening narrative, but thanks to amateur acting and writing, the end result looks like a movie school project at the beginning of the year, with camera movements for themselves and little on the plot or tension. <br /> <br /> If the rest of the series will continue this way, I will be very disappointed. I can not wait for a part of William H. Macy and I hope that he will get a decent director and screenwriter for his segment. So far, the quality is far too inconsistent to predict how.
