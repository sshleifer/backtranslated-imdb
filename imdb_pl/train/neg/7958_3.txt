Protegi operate in a linear manner; do not expect a quick action, or you will not find yourself bated, because there are simply no moments to sit on the edge. <br /> <br /> There is not much to be said, so do not expect one. I would not quit acting - the performance would be much worse if it was not Wu's acting, which was the only saving grace of the film. And, this sweet little girl. <br /> <br /> Humor is at best weak, and the show must just as well pass as an anti-drugs campaign that uses ordinary shock tactics (especially in the scenes with Zhang) to tell us things we already know - drugs, for example break up families, heroin drives you crazy, it's not easy to put aside, you will fall into a vicious circle. <br /> <br /> I know that this may seem a bit difficult, but I feel that the show is far from homogeneous and somewhat inconsistent (* SPOILER ALERT *: Take, for example, when Andy Lau was taken to the police station: what? I have all the tapes and evidence against you since 1997, "and this is the way he was caught in. No, without a chase action, just a jump from the place, which somewhat undermined the role of Wu as a secret.) I suspect that lack of creativity it results from the fact that it is after all the production of Mediacorp Raintree - a Singaporean film production company.
