A thin movie, made in the early 1980s, has a curse in which anyone who tries to end it becomes dead. Many years later, a group of film students tried to finish the film - also raising deadly curses of films. A great idea for a movie, but unfortunately "Cut" is another missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Australia does not have the best records in the world when it comes to horror. "Razorback" (1984) was ridiculous, as was "Holwing III" (1987), which was still a half American movie. As for our adventure with comedy horror, it's best to forget about "Body Melt" (1993). The problem with "Cut" is that the creators trying to create a clever satirical horror a la "Scream" (1996), but do not have insight into the genre or what makes it work. And although it sounds strange, I'm talking about cliches, but "Cut" really does not have a "heart". Sure, this is in line with the basic "rules" set up by "The Scream", but he does not want to play with the formula, instead he goes to a cardboard copy of the earlier one. <br /> <br /> Killer, Scarman, is probably one of the most boring and unflattering villains in horror history. His endless barrage clumsily, lame one-dimensional, it would seem that the porn dialogue looks like Shakespeare. Throwers never seem to be fully involved and appear to be waiting for the session to finish so that they can collect their checks. And the style of the film is such that it deliberately tries not to be frightening; more like the episode "Neighbors" or "Breaking the heart". By the way, these MTV-style tests, hyper-cinema during the "research" sequence, just look bad, outdated and out of place. <br /> <br /> If Australia ever has a chance to make a horror movie (Which I hope we will continue to do so) maybe we should take a leaf from the book "Mad Max" (1979). Instead of trying to copy the US, we should try our own approach to the genre.
