The film appeals to the public thanks to Ben Stiller's charisma and the notoriety of J. Aniston. It looks like we have a recipe for a successful title, but there is nothing successful in this movie. <br /> <br /> Polly is undoubtedly well played by Aniston. It's a kind of character that fits her perfectly. <br /> <br /> Bem Stiller is the same troublesome guy as in "Meet the Parents", but in this movie comic scenes are few compared to the title mentioned above. <br /> <br /> The script is very poor with nothing special. Thanks to these two well-paid actors, things can become much better - but what they can do when there is such a bad story and scenario. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
