I'm sorry, but it could have been terrible in 1978, when it came out, but nowadays it just can not stand it. The only interesting scene in the whole movie is the opening scene, in which Michael kills his sister, Judith, in a mask for Halloween. The most surprising moment in the whole movie is the moment when his parents stripped off their mask and saw their son killed their daughter. The film comes down from this place and does not rise until the last fifteen minutes, but by then it is too late, we, the public, have lost interest in history. There is almost no character development, and people are always amazed that Laurie is such a unique heroine when she really does not have much. I'm sorry that I do not agree with all who are terrified with this movie, but if you want a great horror movie, watch the Shiny Baby or Rosemary. These are the two best horror movies ever made. Halloween is certainly not in their ranks. I can not believe that Roger Ebert gave him four stars, because there is no way that this film deserves such a high rating.
