Do not pay attention to the comments behind the curtain! Most people leaving positive comments about this movie must receive royalties. It's a horrible movie in every respect. Imagine high school students without money and without a sense of humor, creating a comedy movie. They would receive D. Children from universities would receive F or ask to leave school. Because this monstrosity was created by "Professionals", I believe that there should be a time of imprisonment or at least a trial period of cinema. I like to watch bad movies, such as "Plan 9 From Outer Space", but this thing does not even belong to this category. The script, acting, sound and direction are so bad that you can hardly see them. If you enjoy watching bad movies that are fun with Ed Wood, blaxploitation or 70's horrors. After seeing this, you have the impression that you have wasted an hour and a half of your life.
