Oh, what a bad, bad, very bad movie! Surprised by Sylvester Stallone and with him appearing should be enough and included too many climbing scenes, dizziness, fall and biting of villains and unsuccessful attack in the air. There are two plots, both lame. One includes traumatic unsuccessful rescue, and the other includes bad people destroying the plane on the booty and killing various harmless people whenever possible. Usually reliable John Lithgow, perhaps depressed by the very horrors of the product, boils down to mocking and summoning those for whom he does not care about "Bostid!". in an unclear approximation of the English accent. Janine Turner, who was lively and mysterious, when she played Maggie on Northern Exposure, is unfortunately wasted by a lifeguard and pilot. Stallone is strong and tense. No immortal lines in it. No living lines.
