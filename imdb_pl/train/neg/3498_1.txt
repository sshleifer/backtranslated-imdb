I just watched one episode of this program and I could not even come to the end of the program. Every minute I watched this program, my I.Q had to drop by 10 points. This is basically a children's program, but with swearing. Even the curses and insults that she tells other people have not made me laugh. In any case, the story must have been written by a monkey, and people who actually put this script in the program to film had to be kept at gunpoint and had no choice but to film this delayed, disappointing, terribly played program. Sarah Silvermann should use the little money she has actually done with this program and get some goddamn drama lessons.
