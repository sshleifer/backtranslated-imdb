Slow and full of inaccuracies. Nader disadvantages are still an interesting account of the famous and heroic siege of Alamo during the Texas struggle for independence from Mexico. James Arness as Jim Bowie. Brian Keith as Davy Crockett. Alec Baldwin as Col. Travis. Raul Julia as General Santa Anna. David Ogden Stiers, Kathleen York and Jim Metzler also perform in this television project. Very good original music by Peter Bernstein.
