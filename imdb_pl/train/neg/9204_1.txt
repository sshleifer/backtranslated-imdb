I've seen this movie many times (and recently I read the book the movie is based on) and I want to hit all four whenever I see it. The fact that they do not point to the fact that the character of Tom Hank shifts his personality to D & D (oops M & M) :) ("Oh, he just works in character.") Outside the game session. This and the fact that after three months of therapy, let's destroy it all and feed its illusions! Such people are what makes RPGs a bad name. <br /> <br /> Also the old-fashioned "love ballad" and the music of "the cat on the piano" and "stop us if we become too annoying" are almost enough to sharpen your teeth!
