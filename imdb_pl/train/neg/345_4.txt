This can not be the last Mandy Schaffer movie. Someone, do something! :-( <br /> <br /> Argh. <br /> <br /> What a little life could have happened, the director's work, do not blame the cast, they did OK, even the winemaker is a younger brother was quite good, he did not even come to the cinema until half. And please, put Mandy in a few movies! She's too beautiful to bury her career at such a young age., heah .... <br /> <br /> Two specific criticisms in case someone cared for it (apparently no one liked this movie) First, the way Traci appeared at the right time, to see what she was going to see and never saw in return, was very annoying. Hollywood: stop giving the villains the perfect happiness that ends exactly when they reach the climax.This is stupid, use this lame plot device If your script is not good enough to get up without it, do not make it. <br /> /> Second Carmen would not have fallen as a trick with false injuries that Traci pulled. She has already touched Traci. More poisoning writing / directing. <br /> <br /> I could trash the film further, but mercy forbids it. Actually, I did not hate it as much as others did. It just did not have many reasons to be created, unless it was just a vehicle to show the charming Mandy. Oh, and for whoever did not think he was sexy ... the character was not well written, but how can you say she was not sexy ?! One of us needs glasses and I do not think it's me. <br /> <br /> MORE MANDY. (Not to be confused with "Moore, Mandy" - although I would like to see it again; ;-) <br /> <br /> P.S. Did I mention that I hope Mandy will make more movies for me? <: - D
