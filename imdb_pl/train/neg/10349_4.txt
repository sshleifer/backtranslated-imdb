First of all, I'm a big fan of Madeleine L'Engle and I was very excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books, A Wrinkle in Time. This film, however, ruined my excitement. I'm sorry, but Meg was described in the book as having fizzy curls and sunglasses and considered very unfeeling. The film has straight hair and no glasses and is a "sports type" with a deep voice. Not so Madeleine L'Engle imagined Meg was at all. In fact, Meg was based on Madeleine and depicted the way she felt when she was young. This is just one of the main examples of how the book and film are different. So I'd say that if you want to watch it for entertainment, look at it, but if you're a devoted fan of Madeleine L'Engle and her Wrinkle in Time series, I'd suggest skipping the movie.
