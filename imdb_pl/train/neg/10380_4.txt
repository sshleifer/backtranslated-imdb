I do not think anyone would sit down to watch this movie, would expect something to look like a classic ghost story remotely, but you have to ask when it will end if you've ever been scared. It does not really work at this level, but the cast is very old and the film does not stick to one of those happy endings. The story is about an American couple who travels to Kyoto, Japan, so that Ted Fletcher (Edward Albert) could write a book and bring his wife Laura (Susan George) and their daughter Amy (Amy Barrett). Their friend Alex Curtis (Doug McClure), who works at the US consulate, helps them find a home to live in, and he finds a haunted one. About 140 years earlier, in the same house, a samurai discovered that his wife betrayed him and killed them both, and then commits suicide. Their ghosts still live in the house, and when Fletcher comes, it does not take long before strange things begin to happen. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Sometimes ghosts inhabit Fletcher's bodies and start behaving like the Japanese they were before, and Laura begins to flirt with Alex which leads to romance. Meanwhile, Ted begins to behave more rigorously and after pouring soup into the throat, Amy goes to ask the monk for help. Unfortunately, ghosts make Ted, Laura and Alex play their death scene, as it did 140 years ago. <br /> <br /> The film was directed by Kevin Connor, known as a good television director, but he did horror movies and science fiction movies before and collaborated with McClure on some of them. Although it never approaches a terrifying or developing atmosphere, it has two things that I like. First of all, there is not one of those juicy endings in which the couple embrace after defeating the demons. Instead, a very bloody battle ends, in which everyone succumbs to evil spirits. Secondly, Susan George is in the cast! I've always been her fan, although she was mostly in schlock, but her performances are always top notch. She usually appears naked, which she does here in two separate scenes, and although she has no classic features, she has a unique tomboy, just like her appearance, and is one of the reasons she was so popular. But after appearing in stupid movies, such as this one, I think that this led to a way out of business or work occasionally. This is not a bad movie, but it is never convincing and ghost watching runs around when the monk gives an exorcism, is practically worth chuckling or two. The bottom line is that it's stupid and I hope George decides to resume his career.
