I'm not a fan of horror movies, but my wife's nieces and nephews are. I saw the first movie. It was macabre and strained, but not my taste. It's still good. For similar reasons, at the moment I am exposed to the sequel. <br /> <br /> The premise goes beyond the absurd. I can buy that disasters will occur in the desert. I can buy that there are mutants. I can even buy that events can be so strange and strange that the military can decide to get involved. It is unlikely, yes, but I am inclined to suspend my belief. <br /> <br /> HOWEVER, however, I am not inclined to believe that a military unit designated to carry out a search for such an area will not be able to resist attacks by mutants. As a member of the United States Army, I can assure you that while new recruits may not have the wise eyes and experience of combat soldiers, all such recruits will be integrated into a capable team. <br /> <br /> A unit of armed soldiers will not be taken by several mutants with knives. That's how it works. Movements of troops, much greater firepower and of course radio support would ensure no less than total victory. I am not saying that you would not have victims, but as soon as the area is verified as hostile, military training will take precedence, no one will go on their own even to use the bathroom. <br /> <br /> And if it was discovered that the area was so attacked by enemies that the unit was not able to cope with the danger, they would join the support. And trust me, their radio stations would not be disturbed, if there was a chance that normal radios would not work, the unit would have a military satellite phone. Chances are that if they are unable to check every hour, the search will be called. <br /> <br /> To accept this movie, you must accept the fact that our soldiers are incompetent fools, incompetent leaders and an incompetent chain of command. While it may be true that the most dangerous thing in the world is a lieutenant with a map and a compass, our military forces are filled with intelligent, well-trained, competent soldiers. Mutants with knives are much below our ability to deal with them. <br /> <br /> When a movie is made fully, depending on the unimaginable film, it can not be realized. Instead, we are expected to believe that our soldiers, sailors and airmen are unable to cope even with the most mediocre threats. <br /> <br /> As a veteran, I consider the film to be offensive.
