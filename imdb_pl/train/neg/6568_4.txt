It is interesting that the two stars of Meet The People are a pair of movie stars that have entered a new television medium and have become even more successful, and which both entered production and enjoyed the status of the mogul on the small screen. Lucille Ball was not the main star who would come with television. As for Dick Powell, he desperately wanted to make movies like "Meet People" and his salvation in a career will take place in the next movie. <br /> <br /> I think the only reason Dick Powell did this movie was because the young MGM player was cast a special number and then he saw it. His private time with June Allyson was much better than what we see on the screen. Powell looks bored and can not make any emotions at all. <br /> <br /> He was probably tired of making these musicals with stupid intrigues, such as those from the Warner Brothers. The original Meet The People performance was not a show of books, it was a revision and was held in the 1940-41 season on Broadway for 160 performances. When MGM bought it, they scraped off everything except the title and the title song. The rest of the score has been combined with various and diverse songwriters, none of the songs is unforgettable. Strange, if you take into account some of the source materials, come from Burton Lane, E.Y. Harburg, Harold Arlen and Rodgers & Hart. These guys just had to empty the trunk for material. <br /> <br /> The plot is stupid than most of the propaganda music of that time. Powell is the author of the Meet The People revue and is a shipbuilder who won the lottery with the movie star Lucille Ball. She is interested, she is interested, both are interested in the revue, but the creative differences keep them, of course, outside the finale. Here's the movie at a glance. <br /> <br /> MGM gave Powell and Ball some good musical acts that are the main reason for watching Meet The People. The great bands of Vaughn Monroe and Spike Jones are here, and the most important film for me is Bert Lahr dressed in a commander suit, like Lou Costello in the sequence of dreams in In The Navy. The song Heave Ho was written by Arlen and Harburg, who wrote for Lahr, number of Courage from The Wizard Of Oz. And as almost everyone in the world has seen this movie, you have an idea for Heave Ho is like. <br /> <br /> Another film by Dick Powell is Murder My Sweet, in which he finally bids not so nice adieu musicals. And Lucy would have to wait for the television before the world sees what it can really do.
