This movie was the most expensive mormon movie ever made. It made RM and Sons of Provo look like well-made films! It was supposed to be fun from what I was told. The best part was the best actor in the movie Travis Eberhard - if it was not in the movie, it probably would not have been created! He ruled! <br /> <br /> 10. It was not fun 9. It was a beat 8. He had a Thurl Big T Bailey who did not make sense 7. He was made in Provo 6. He was not kidding with Brokeback 5. He had Larry H. Miller It's 4. It was the first movie where Clint Howard was not funny.
