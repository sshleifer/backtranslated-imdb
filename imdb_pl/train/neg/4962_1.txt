99.999% pure shit. And the second .001% is a short moment when I thought that a blond chick would be disarming. No. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was legendary bad. The action sucked and there was no sex (the aforementioned blond chick is modestly dressed, unfortunately the whole movie). CGI had the dubious honor of being the worst I have ever seen in a film, and the anachronisms were numerous and blatant. Acting was mediocre, even from Ben Cross and Marina Sirtis, the only "names" in this film. And Marina Sirtis looked really, really bad. <br /> <br /> I saw that high schools are playing better. This is the kind of film that developed in MST3K. The heads should roll in Sci-Fi to let this steaming pile of air.
