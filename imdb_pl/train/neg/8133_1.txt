The film is just as much fun as staring at the sun. Sheriff Pataki is a total delay that does not like anything better than sitting on a fat ass, making a smoke ring with his puffy cigars and drinking alcohol while the doctor behaves like a zombie version Nicholas Cage sucks out all the so-called "Blood" that actually look like Fruit Punch. <br /> <br /> First of all, the conspiracy seemed very horrible to even call it a piece of shit movie. The rest of the heroes in this movie are total time wasted, the ending was awful, the contours were bad, and the scenes were terrible. What else should I tell you? My advice would be to shoot rabies if you've watched a movie. This movie can give you foam in your mouth if you do not get current photos.
