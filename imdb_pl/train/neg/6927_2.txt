Although I rated this movie as the 2nd for showing the total lack of effort in creating a high quality horror movie, it was 10 on an unintentional funny scale. I could not understand what was happening in the movie or who the people were, but I did not care because I knew every scene would have something that would make me cry with laughter. Dialog is the minimum in the whole film, but I believe that it's because they started filming without a script. The lack of a feature line makes the film extremely versatile. It does not matter if you sit down and watch the movie from the beginning to the end, or if you watch it in scrolling, you will be confused with pleasure. I particularly like the scene in which prisoners alternately run outside, beating themselves with sticks. I believe that the doctor calls it a treatment. Genius!
