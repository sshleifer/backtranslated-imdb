I'm not a huge fan of Slasher films as a genre, but even with low budget standards, this one is really bad. Even at the level of nudity-and-gore it is very boring (there are a few of them, but that's all ... meh). Before the video revolution at home, it may not even be released theatrically (though it may have: finally * Plan 9 from space * played in cinemas). There is exactly one good (and competently delivered) line in the entire movie; I assume they stole it from somewhere. <br /> <br /> Acting is one of the worst I've ever seen. I mean, even Ed Wood had a few competent actors, and the rest was usually funny, which can be nice to watch. Either way, most of his actors could be almost literary. Here, those who do not read their poems like Indians from cigars sound like they have learned them phonetically. And this film has one distinction: it manages to be underestimated by most of the film, and then ridiculously imposed at the end. <br /> <br /> (Update: I should have distinguished the actress playing the receptionist as it is not wooden. Not that it is good, but it is certainly not wooden.) <br /> <br /> Even the worst kitsch movies they are generally good for several puritanical meditations about their grotesque offense, in this case there is not even anything that would arouse moral outrage. <br /> <br /> And you know the funniest thing? They were clearly expecting to make a sequel! <br /> <br /> It's so bad and boring that it actually becomes fascinating in a weird way. I sat in many movies, wondering why someone would like to take care of it.
