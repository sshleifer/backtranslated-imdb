Who could sympathize with these two intolerable heroes? What was supposed to be a light, foamy comedy about neighboring children who can not give up the child's courageous game, even when they get well into adultery, falls out more as an exercise in cruelty and pathetic indulgence. As children, the couple are unbearably premature; as adults are unacceptably immature. It's a bad combination.
