Only recently did I learn that the Madeleine L'Engle novel was transformed into a Disney television movie and ordered a DVD. The book was my favorite when I was a child and I read it several times. <br /> <br /> Although some of the children's actors do not resemble the characters described in the novel, the Murra family is well manned, with a nice (if too pretty) Meg in the center and Charles Wallace who convinces as a wonderful child, not irritating. <br /> <br /> The first half hour is promising enough, doing a good job in establishing the relationship between heroes and setting the stage. Unfortunately, as soon as inhumane figures appear, the adaptation begins to unravel and when children leave Earth, the whole thing breaks up. Alfre Woodward is too young and too royal, like the eccentric Mrs Whatsit (I think instead of Miriam Margolis or Joan Plowright), and Kate Nelligan's face is such a mask and inexpressible, she had to visit the plastic surgeon Faye Dunaway in recent years. For some reason, they make her a Lady who looks like Glinda from the Wizard of Oz, when she should have been like the wicked Wicked Witch of the West. <br /> <br /> In the end, what really disappoints her is terrible. effects and direction of art. I understand that it is a TV movie, but CGI looked like something that could have been done 15 years earlier. The incarnation of Mrs Whatsits' centaurs is a disaster, as is a suit similar to Chewbacca for the aunt's Beast, which in the novel is a velvet, elegant creature instead of the Great Foot, which is clumsily depicted here. I could go on, almost every artistic choice is a disaster, presumably because there was not enough budget to do this justice, but also because the design work lacks imagination and good judgment. <br /> <br /> It would really need the miracle that Spielberg brought to his early films. What a pity that with the current popularity of the literary fantasy series adaptation for children, nobody thought about adapting A Wrinkle in Time and is the continuation of the great screen, giving it the range it deserves.
