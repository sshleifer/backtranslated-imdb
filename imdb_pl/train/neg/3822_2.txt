Being a fan of Buster Keaton is about breaking the heart regularly. Most of us meet Keaton for the first time in one of the brilliant films from his great period of independent production: "The General", "The Navigator", "Sherlock Jnr". We consider him the biggest character in the entire history of film comedy and we want to see more of his films. This is where the heartbreak begins. After "Steamboat Bill Jnr", Keaton brother-in-law, Joseph Schenck, pressed him to sign a contract under which Keaton took control of MGM. Keaton has become another actor for rent, executing someone's scripts. Then his alcoholism worsened. After "Steamboat Bill Jnr", Keaton never really made a first-class movie. Several sources describe the would-be masterpiece comedy that Keaton claimed * he did * at the MGM: the parody of the 'Grand Hotel'. Biographer Tom Dardis presented convincing evidence that Keaton invented this story. <br /> <br /> A heart attack increases because in the midst of Keaton's long, systematic fall, he just sometimes came up with a good movie ... like his short comedy "Grand Slam Opera". I'm continuing to search for lost material from Keaton's dramatic scene with Spencer Tracy in 'It's a Mad Mad World': a sequence in which a bitter Tracy policeman calls an old retired cheater (Keaton) and tries to recruit his help in stealing the cash of Smiler Grogan. This material almost certainly disappeared forever, but I'm still looking. <br /> <br /> "Speak Easily", unfortunately, is one of Keaton's films from the beginning of his fall. MGM tried to build Jimmy Durante (who accidentally played Smiler Grogan three decades later) as a new comedy star. Unfortunately, MGM tried to build Durante, combining it with Keaton, whose comedy style was simply incompatible with Durante. (I'm a fan of both.) Throughout his career, Durante was a merciless scene thief: praised, he knew he was being built at Keaton's expense, and Keaton was the only star Durante never tried to do on stage. <br /> <br /> Keaton was often cast as a victim of extremely cruel machinations. In "Speak Easily" he plays a didactic and humorless college professor in the Midwestern called Post (because he is wooden as one), who receives a letter informing him that he inherited $ 750,000, which must go to New York to apply for compensation. Is he calling to check it out? Does he even check the postmark? No; takes out the savings from the bank and rushes to New York. As soon as he leaves, the Post's servant acknowledges that he has written a (false) letter to push Professor Post out of his routine! <br /> <br /> A post who thinks he is a millionaire crosses the path with Jimmy Dodge (Durante) who tries to create a musical revue, but he has no money. Characters that these two great comedians play on the screen just do not bother. Keaton plays on one of those eggheads (like Mister Logic in "Viz"), who's all intellectualizing. Durante plays one of those annoying hepcats who can not make a simple statement, because the script always requires him to speak slang. There is a painful, uninteresting dialogue scene in which Durante tries to talk to Keaton about money, but instead of going straight out of it, Durante has to use increasingly fanciful slang terms such as "kale", "cartwheels" etc. while Keaton, of course, does not he has no idea what Durante is about. Let Keaton: his own dry and dusty prairie voice, his flat Kansas accent, is absolutely perfect for the character he plays here. <br /> <br /> Sidney Toler, he looks much thinner and is more handsome than he would have been a year later, impressive as the excitable director of Revue bankrolling (on tick) professor Post. Henry Armett, whom I never thought was funny, is even less fun than usual, offering a running gag with a stupid payout. Thelma Todd impressed me in the more vile version of the role she played in "Horse Feathers" (a much more fun movie). Edward Brophy, one of my favorite actors, is wasted. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem with "Speak Easily" is that supporting characters behave in a completely wrong way. Keaton's attorney appears in the Durante theater with urgent news for Keaton ... but he is not there, so the lawyer proceeds to reveal Keaton's personal interest to the first stranger he meets. (Fire this lawyer, Buster!) In another scene, Professor Post - a guy who is seen as bankrolling this musical - falls into the locker room of the chorus girls, and all the girls with the chorus immediately squeak and cover up. I know for sure that * modern * girls with the choir would never react in this way, and seriously doubt that the choir girls in 1932 behaved in this way ... certainly not in response to the "angel" controlling the shows of their performances. <BR /> <br /> HOST RECOMMENDATIONS. About half an hour after the unsuccessful "Speak Easily", the great Jimmy Durante settled himself at the piano, smiling at the camera, and performing a characteristic shake of his head as he began to play the melody. This is the moment when I thought that in the end this movie will finally give way to its entertainment. Unfortunately not. The most annoying is the ending of this movie, in which one of the most hackneyed and unbelievable clich√©s in the entire comedy is used: the one in which a completely incompetent fool becomes a star comedian of his own ineptitude. (Keaton would be forced to repeat this phrase in the episode of "Screen Directors Playhouse" from 1955; Chaplin used it already in "The Circus".) <br /> <br /> I almost cried - in anger and sadness - with wasted opportunities in "Speak easy." Mainly out of respect for the work that Keaton, Durante, Toler, Brophy and Miss Todd have done elsewhere, I will rate this movie 2 points out of 10. <br /> <br />
