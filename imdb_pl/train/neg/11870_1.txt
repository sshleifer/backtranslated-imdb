It's the most depressing movie I've ever seen. For the first time I saw it as a child, and even thinking about it now really annoys me. I know that it was at a time when life was difficult and I know that these people were poor and the crops were necessary. Yes, I understand all this. What I find difficult to do is that I do not remember a single light moment in the whole film. Maybe it was in line with life, I do not know. I'm sure that the acting was at the highest level, and the direction and quality of filming, etc. They were great and I know that every movie can not have a happy ending, but as a family film is terrible in my opinion. <br /> I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to play with a movie. I can not stress enough how this movie affected me as a child. I've talked about it lately and all sad memories have returned. I think it would do all this except callous Prozac.
