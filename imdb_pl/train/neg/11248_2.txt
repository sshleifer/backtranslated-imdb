And gave him "2" instead of "1" (horrible), because it can not be denied that many of them were stunning, many talents came into special effects and works of art. But that was not enough to save it. <br /> <br /> "Sepia", subdued colors, have been done many times in other movies. Nothing new. I see that there were some tips on hats for other old classic films. WELL. There is no problem with that. <br /> <br /> But the movie has to be fun and interesting, not something that would lull you. <br /> <br /> The plot and script of this movie It was awful, two-dimensional characters. Slowly moving. Some of the scenes were nice, but ultimately, as a whole, it was quite boring, I could not recommend it.
