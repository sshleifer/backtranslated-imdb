Writers probably did not have any experience in the army and probably never looked at the historical book, but I still give this cheap war film some recognition for the fact that I needed to look at the role of black soldiers in the Second World War for a long time. br /> <br /> The action is confused and unbelievable - every episode of the fight! has better production values, but the cast is interesting. Seeing New York Giant Rosie Greer was worth as much as I paid for it. The direction of art is the fifth - men wear uniforms from the Korean War and it was quite bad weather, before the American army reached Germany in 1944. Not so sunny, as you can see here, and I do not think the area resembles Northern California. The script never explains why black support squads are used as combat soldiers. There is a nice accent that shows that some people carrying Springfield rifles instead of M-1, whose second-class troops would probably have been spent. <br /> <br /> This basic idea (a racist southern officer commanding black soldiers) should then be expanded to great budget production and it is not too late to try now. You have to take it for what it is, and I admire the creators of this movie for making an effort. <br /> <br /> I remember that I saw it some time ago and I think it was set up in Italy, more sense, because in 1944 there were black war units.
