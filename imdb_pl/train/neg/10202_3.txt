Murder By Numbers is one of those movies you expect for TV, but it is not. Given that the only actor with any note is Bullock (although Michael Pitt seems to be switching to bigger and better things), it's not a big surprise that this movie quickly disappears from memory to replace it with more important things. Like ... remembering to close the front door when you leave. Or putting on clothes when you step out of the shower. <br /> <br /> Bullock plays Cassie Mayweather, a policewoman with personal problems (not everyone). Together with his new partner (who looks like wet Ben Chaplin), he is called to investigate the murder of a young woman. There is nothing unusual about it, except that criminals are a few teenage students who think they have planned and performed the perfect murder. As the investigation continues between Cassie and the main suspect, Richie Haywood (Ryan Gosling), a battle of will emerges. <br /> <br /> The trouble is that both are hopeless. Bullock, though very nice to see, is just as credible as a hardened cynical cop like Rodney Dangerfield (actually he would be better!). Chaplin, for all her sins, is a complete non-existence and I regret that he has to put this movie in his CV, trying to break into Hollywood. At least Gosling and Pitt, as provocative mocking suspects, acquit themselves accordingly. As if clever tracks were not bad enough, a story that will send everyone to sleep and a highly predictable (but illogical) ending, turns the film in his head before he has a chance to run. <br /> <br /> "" Murder By Numbers "has absolutely nothing to do, even the pointless bullock scene would not buy it back. Well, just a little, but still not enough to save it. Unforgettable, predictable and superfluous - this is one movie that will not move the genre forward. As Cassie probably says in her next case, there's nothing to see. Move on, move ...
