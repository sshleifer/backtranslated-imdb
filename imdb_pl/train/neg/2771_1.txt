The film was to be shown here, in Bangkok, with a whole fanfare, and even in the theater, it failed. <br /> <br /> Apparently, the writer simply does not hold water. Certainly something was missing. In my opinion, people must have a reason why they view it differently than a historical view of the past. The accuracy of history is not what we are looking for in entertainment. <br /> <br /> There is no substance in the film. The only way to make this movie in some way was to make changes that would become a legend, not just history. And the legend will have some elements that try to tell you something that people have forgotten over time, such as the meaning of sacrifice, nationalism, etc. This is called the main theme. <br /> <br /> The movie does not work, why should I watch it anyway? <br /> <br /> At least some weird legendary Flying Elephants, a psychic king or an eccentric king such as "The King and I" would be beautiful, something to be very appealing to the movies. I think that there was no appeal beyond the usual vanilla film. <br /> <br /> Once you receive the appeal, history is the next thing that we focus on. In marketing terms, we call this "must see". After hearing the title of the film, people would say: Oh, I have to see it. Where is the appeal at Kingmaker? Why not repeat the title and call it "How not to be king?" And create a black comedy of the old Siamese times, in the style of "Dr. Strangelove." That would be much more interesting. The narrative experience of the King's weaknesses from the first crimes of the first person would make the film extremely funny. <br /> <br /> Most movies today have such "must see" appeal, such as Spiderman, Men X, these titles speak for themselves. If they do not have character acquaintances, some other movies, such as The Island, had their appeal when the ad asks: "Do you still believe that there is an island?". <br /> <br /> Or in the film, repeated "How not to be king" may ask: "Do you still WANT to be king?" <br /> <br /> Parhat
