Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan belong to the class of actors they are always interested in, despite the review. I have always considered Mrs. Ryan to be a charming and attractive actress in almost all of her roles, and Kevin Kline is almost always worth watching. <br /> <br /> I say "almost" and "almost" largely because of this movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, Meg Ryan does not play a nice character, he plays a weak volunteer who begins to get in the nerves shortly after the initial credits and does not give up until a few days later. Even so, Kevin Kline's character is even more annoying and less pleasant. So even if you normally like these two actors, I recommend you this movie.
