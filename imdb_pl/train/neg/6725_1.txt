What could have been an engaging and emotionally charged study of character is completely undermined by a predictable factor. Fox is fine, like Nathaniel Ayers, Julliard a trained musician who dreams of playing with Walt Disney's orchestra until his attacks with schizophrenia push him into the street and eventually lead him away. Searching for a good story that would strengthen his waning career, reporter Steve Lopez {Robert "rehabilitation" Downey} meets him and tells his story. Considering all the elements of the classic movie "How we hit the skids", very freely borrowing from "Beautiful Mind", adopting fictional "feel good" in movies like "Rocky" - you choose the sequel number - and you also hop a lot of melodramas in the style The 30's that remained on the screen are the burned-out film crust. It is trivial, banal, completely predictable and too often plays on our feelings. I hate to say it, but it's a kind of movie that, if you say you hate it, will make you look bad. I would really like to say something positive about this film, but I really can not. The actress will compensate him a little, but it is not enough to give him more than one star. Strictly created for television movies. Not worth your time.
