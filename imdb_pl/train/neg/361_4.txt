After reading the book, I loved the story. Watching the movie, I was disappointed that so many changes were made. It is understandable that books and films are different, but they were two different stories, only the names and parts of the book's history remained. Read the book to better understand the movie. The book gives a better character development. These characters are extremely interesting and make you care about them. The locations were indeed consistent with the book descriptions. Some characters have not been included. Television has so many great books and stories, it is a perfect example. The author's entry does not always provide a good movie, but sometimes it can help.
