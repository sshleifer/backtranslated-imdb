Do not be mistaken, it's not a horror movie, not a movie. I strongly advise against viewing this 82-minute breakdown; the only reason he deserved the star was Chris Pine's presence. <br /> <br /> Nothing happens. You wait patiently in the hope that there may be a flash of twist, a note of surprise, a conspiracy to emerge - but no. <br /> <br /> Characters take irregular turns in their actions, and yet there is no time for development - thanks to frugal editors and honestly embarrassed writers - before returning to the idyllic and cheerful (assemble on rock teenagers) status. The only thing that could make him worse would be to add a perishable ethnic "companion." <br /> <br /> Their encounters with obstacles (be they human or physical) are short, confusing and completely pointless. > <br /> Chris Pine is struggling to stay above the surface while he is sinking into the misery of a light cast. Lou Taylor Pucci could not have been more dry if he had spent the summer with Keanu Reaves combing the Navada desert. <br /> <br /> Watch "The Road", watch "28 days later", watch TV during the day ... whatever but that; I beg you. He suffers from boredom, unlike you, that you can believe in a movie, this film is not a medicine.
