From the first moment, this "thing" is just a horrible sequence of extremely short fragments of blurred camera work. Although the entire story has every potential for a thriller, the story is so badly told that I can not buy it. From the middle of the movie, the actions of the heroes do not make any sense to me. Stop reading now to avoid SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> Ed's idea, for Edna to make coffee for them after shooting down her son's arm, is far below his alleged experience; it's just a very stupid idea. Domino does not question the fragmented orders Claremont Williams receives from the breakdown of the telephone connection. Should she not suspect that Williams turns them on? These FBI agents do not seem to understand, showing just one helicopter for something that has every reason to think it's a mafia shootout. Besides, what they do, stopping and leaking information in the direction of Cigliutti, is largely instigating murder; I think it's a farewell to justice if the FBI does. In fact, if they behaved in this way, they would have a mixed case without repair. We see a car accident that would normally hurt at least seriously if it had not killed most passengers, but miraculously leaves them all with just a few bruises. On the contrary, after the accident, there is an instant Domino's love for Choco, which from Domino's point of view is in no way based on earlier events, but simply depends on the eyes. <br /> <br /> The whole sequence of scenes starting with Claremont Williams' phone call, it seems to me that this is a dramatic daze. This, combined with the terrible, restless work of the camera, simply makes me dislike calling the movie. I apologize for the wasted effort of the main actors whose talent is not an option.
