Richard Dreyfus is not a star here. It has about three 20 second scenes and what does Gene Barry do in this movie? I have no idea, the director was probably his brother! It's a movie that does not make sense. Nieudolny wrier / director (the same guy) massacred the talent of all his terrifying ... works. I have a DVD for a penny, so I can not complain! But it's weird and makes you feel weird and it's not a good way. It was the '70s and it looks like the director was on a bad acid trip and he wanted everyone to experience what it was like to be in his head. It has a slightly interesting and controversial concept, but like a scratched plate it quickly plays a foul. It has "Manson family atmosphere on acid". <br /> <br /> I have no idea how another reviewer got everything they did from this movie? Maybe they worked in it when? In any case be prepared to lose over 80 minutes of your life, you will never come back. Yes, it's so horrible!
