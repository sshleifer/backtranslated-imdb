I was not quite sure what to expect from the comedy, drama, fantasy and science fiction genres, but given the actors involved, I thought I would give him a chance. The tone of the movie felt uncomfortable, going through the patches of each genre, but never felt balanced, so I finally gave up trying and concentrated on cinematography and individual performances, which I generally thought was good, considering each character had a small depth due on the nature of the story (he will not give anything back here). I must say that he felt much longer than his 96-minute working time, not in a good way. In the end I was looking for a closure, a certain measure of satisfaction, but it did not turn out to be a clever or ingenious piece that I hoped for. I think Tony made a mistake thinking that what he did at the end of the movie gave us this ... but it was a tragic mistake to try the previous 95 minutes with an unfortunate conclusion. In the end, I feel cheated. IMO would be better if there was no "ending" as a work of art ... simply. Or ... I could completely skip this point :)
