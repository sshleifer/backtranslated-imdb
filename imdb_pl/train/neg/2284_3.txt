Now I will not deny that when I bought it outside of eBay, I had high expectations. It was an amazing job with the imprint of a comedy master, which I like so much. However, I was soon to be disappointed. I apologize to those who liked it, but I found Compleat Al very difficult to look at. I have a few smiles, of course, but most of the fun comes from music videos (which I have on DVD), and the rest was basically a filler. It can be said that this was not the greatest achievement of the Al video (this is a distinction for UHF). To be honest, I doubt if it ever jumps on DVD, so if you're an Al-ultra fan and you have to have everything, buy a tape outside of eBay. Just do not pay too much for it.
