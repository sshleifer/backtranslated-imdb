In a word: excruciating. I was advised later to read a few articles about the philosophical meanings of this film, but after finishing 115 minutes of film and slowly crushing under his bloated symbolism and streamlined lava, it seemed better to simply report my reactions to the film. After all, who is going to see the movie with the curriculum in hand? And this movement was grim. Main actor Claude Laydu, from the opening of the film to the end, bears the same tiring and irritating mask of agony that it can hardly be distinguished from the eternal, grim reading of the film. Shooting one above the other could work better than submitting to the audience, because they basically say the same thing: the priest Ambricourt is a miserable man. The story of a persecuted priest who tries to help a troubled rich family does nothing to make her characters interesting or sympathetic, because the family is a group of unpleasant weirdos, and the priest himself turns out to be a nosy pest. The last 30 minutes suggest breathtaking news about the grace and suffering of one man equal to the suffering of others, but because of the indulgent closeness of Laydu and the vague subtext in Robert Bresson's scenario, all I felt was, Finally, it's over, let's eat ice cream. Interesting for fans of Bresson fanaticism, Paul Schrader, just to see how many elements of the character and set design Schrader introduced in his scripts and films, especially "Taxidriver", "Raging Bull" and "Light Sleeper".
