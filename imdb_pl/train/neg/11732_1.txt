IMDb guidelines state that you must declare whether your comments contain "spoilers". <br /> <br /> Well, this whole movie is something like a spoiler ... a warning story that glorifies what he warns about, a story of lost youth who does not know where he is going. > <br /> I just saw it at the Tribeca film festival. this movie was not just bad, it was really bad. <br /> <br /> the acting is inconsistent, the characters are mostly clich√©d offers with little depth, and Farnsworth's acting was particularly bad. <br /> <br /> from patronizing accents to a pointless storyline to out-of-the-box graphic elements to a repeating dialog box and scenarios ... sucked a big one. <br /> <br /> I think he was looking for something more nervous, updated "cowboy from drugstore" with a bit of "naturally born killers", but he is not as sensitive to heroes as the first one and there is no shocking (except some kind of brotherhoods) like a ladder. <br /> <br /> more than anything, someone really needed A) edit the script <br /> <br /> (there are a few things on which you can build and clearly <br /> <br /> offers with a worthy topic ... if you are trying to do this.) B) edit the movie. if it has been cut into the core, it can be passable. <br /> <br /> I'd be lower than 1 if I could ... maybe zero Kelvin.
