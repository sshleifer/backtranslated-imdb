If at the end of the 1980s you made a genre film, you basically had a 50/50 chance that he would either be under water or in prison (unfortunately we never got an underwater prison move). Accused of being murdered by the mafia boss Moretti (Anthony Franciosa), Derek Keillor (Dennis Cole) ends on death row, next to the brother of the mafia boss Frankie (Frank Sarcinello Jr.). But this is Derek's smallest problem, because a dishonest government agent (and mafia stool) Col. Burgess (John Saxon, who also directs) uses the prison as a training ground for a new superwirus. This is the only movie Saxon has directed during his career. For a guy who has worked with a lot of directors, it seems that the only ones who chose any tips were the Italian ones. Of course, there is a low budget, but this can not justify rigid staging, bluster shooting or clumsy exposure in the first 15 minutes. I must admit that Saxon did it a bit bloody and works in a funny nude scene (our advantage falls asleep during prison riots only to fantasize about a female scientist). Cole, who looks more like Jan-Michael Vincent, is decent because the Stoic leader, and Franciosa - who has a really bad rug - gives him everything as a banal mafia boss. The end is at the favorite place of Marta McKee, Bronson Canyon. Retromedia released it on DVD as ZOMBIE DEATH HOUSE.
