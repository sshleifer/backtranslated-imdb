Richard Farnsworth is one of my favorite actors. It usually gives solid performances, such as in The Straight Story and The Gray Fox. It is also quite good here, but the rest of the film suffers from low budget, poor writing and so on photography. The Miller-Movie formula gives him 4th. Richard gets 5.
