I'm sorry, but it's just pathetic. The girl was a brat, they were not nice characters, and the plot sucked. Besides, he was not even a gator when he wanted a movie. If you check the complete guide to reptiles, you will discover that it is really a crocodile, not a gator. Of course, they did not hire a real animal expert, because they would know that creation is a crocodile. This is a sad excuse for the film. Especially the ending. I almost fell asleep with it.
