Take revenge on us, maybe the viewers. I sat through this 2-hour movie and waited for the second act for the movie to fulfill its title. But Costner will never avenge his lover who dies and the movie ends. I wondered where the rest of the movie is. If the movie is called "Revenge", the protagonist will get a little better until the end of the movie. I had a choice to see this or Black Rain in the cinema, fortunately I saw a movie of other brothers in the cinema. there was one good thing in the film and it was a beautiful thematic melody. Listen to cd.dont, think it's awful. 1 out of 10
