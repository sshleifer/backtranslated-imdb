OK, so after watching this refreshing movie and wasting an hour and so many minutes of my life here is a basic summary: Genie comes out of the ghetto boom, gives 3 shades to a child with shaggy hair, a kid wasting his wishes, I forgot, shaq sucks rap and I think so . <br /> <br /> So I was mainly laughing, I was crying ...... but mostly I was laughing at the comedy of shearing, which came from great acting skills, nba player / rapper and boy with shaggy hair. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie for kids from college who drink beer with close friends and seriously need a good laugh. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give him 3 out of 10 only b / c the movie is based on 3 magical wishes. <br /> <br /> If I had 3 wishes, I would like to erase this horrible movie and for all of them pretend that Hollywood does not waste money on doing it.
