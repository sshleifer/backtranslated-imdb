This is one of the worst action movies I've ever seen. This is due in particular to the fact that it is unreliable (for example, an obvious agent posing for a Bank Credit officer who clearly says that he is talking to someone using a wire or scene in which scientists assume that it is safe to enter the virus it was released, although "he did not find a living host", he does not mean he will never find it), cheap sets (the bank looks like it was poorly constructed to resemble a sow) and bad action. This is the story of an organized crime group that has successfully stolen the capsule of a deadly virus. However, the head of honor, who decides to remove him from the deposit bank, does so at the same time as the bank robbery falls, at the same time the FBI agents were informed and a terrible earthquake broke out. Needless to say, the aftermath of the quake is a mess in many ways. However, the results are not a tempting action movie, but instead they are, of course, Z-class garbage from the beginning of the movie. (Perhaps that's why some screenshots on the packaging look more like computer graphics than real screenshots from different movie sequences.) What the hell is Ron Perlman doing, I have no idea. I wonder if he was so embarrassed that he was in it, as if I was watching him.
