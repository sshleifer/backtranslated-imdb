Although this tour certainly does not meet its predecessor, it has more than just a part of unforgettable moments. My personal favorite, just after dropping the waste to the block with his "Videodisc Cannon", we see a close-up of Nimoy's face. As a single tear from his left eye, we know that Nimoy is more than just a killing machine. The viewer can not refrain from emotional confusion and we understand that his earlier flat influence was only a fa√ßade. Absolute brilliance !!! Sex scenes present a nice balance, corporal, but not pornographic. Then I felt that I understood well how to work with the Magnavision video player. It is a pity they have not produced them for over 25 years.
