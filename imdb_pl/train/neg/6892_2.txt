Oh my God. It was a real big mess that could not be stopped. Jeffrey (Jon Heder) is a 29-year-old man who still lives with his mother (Diane Keaton) and does not plan anywhere. Until his mother meets a wealthy businessman named Mert (Jeff Daniels) with whom he can get married. <br /> <br /> It would be a good movie, if Heder did not play so annoying Jeffrey, start, there is no chance to like him, only worse and worse. In the end, we should like him, but there was no reason, because he did not change from the egoistic brutal that was at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> Keaton does not even look like he's trying and is in a terrible form after 2007, "I And Said So." Not to mention the shocking chemistry between Heder and Keaton, and where would they believe their mother and son? The only salutary grace is Jeff Daniels and Anna Faris, although they do not look very interested. In addition to a few small smiles, this movie really does not deserve the name of comedy, because almost nothing to laugh at! If you're in the mood for the last movie of Diane Keaton, watch Mad Money or Smother, which is much better than this terrible effort.
