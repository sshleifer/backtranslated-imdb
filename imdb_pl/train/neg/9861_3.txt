I just sat there in GenCon because it was quiet and I could have a nap. What a waste of time. Beverly D'Angelo and William Katt? WTF? Did the lady who played Flo and Abe Vigoda been busy or something? <br /> <br /> Really, a piece of hilarious garbage. The figures were stereotypical, meaningless (I think ...) and wooden, most of them seemed to be an autopilot. The so-called "happy" situations described in some other so-called reviews were so hacked, I was crying over the writers. <br /> <br /> I'm confused how anyone can find it worth their time, seriously. He only gives me 3 out of 10, because to be 2 or 1, he would have to be either five hours or have more Kelly LeBrock.
