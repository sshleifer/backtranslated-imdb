I am still trying to determine if the previous installment was worse than this or vice versa. Because almost fifteen years have passed since watching this movie, the fact that I remember so little about it does not bode well. Maybe just because I only watched it once or twice, but I doubt it. If there was something to keep in mind about this film, you can be sure that I will remember it. <br /> <br /> At the time this movie was released, the franchise was still in the dying phase, so there was a lot of information in the media he was assigned. It is never a good sign when the pop-up periodicals contain explanations about the basics of the story. One of these articles had to explain that Freddy was too weak to attack adults' dreams, so he decides to follow Alice's unborn son. So far, so good, but it's a writer's or director's job to explain to the public. There should be no unrelated publication left. <br /> <br /> Using the curiosities given in the third part about Freddy's concept, one would expect scenes that would abolish this joke from the category of "horror for babies", but unfortunately it was not. This shows the pure idiocy of the American rating system that a piece of B'harni trash, like this one, can get the same rating as a truly frightening piece, such as the original. <br /> <br /> Until then, the franchise could not attract anyone with an active career. Fortunately, or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, Lisa Wilcox was there to provide a quotient of competent action. Or maybe it just looks competently compared to the rest of the cast. Anyway, given that her last role was in what is called The All New Adventures of Chastity Blade, I doubt she really had anything else. Even the poor old Robert Englund was in better productions than in the last fifteen years. <br /> <br /> Considering that the profits from ticket desks were steadily falling, not just for this series, then we thought that the studios would realize that sterilizing their films does not make them more transferable. In fact, this particular film, like its direct predecessor, was so brave that it not only did not attract the new audience, but both managed to alienate the indigenous audience that originally supported the franchise. Still, the fifth part must receive some recognition for the lack of a clear, luminescent feeling that made part four so offensive to look at. <br /> <br /> I gave A Nightmare On Elm Street Part Five one in ten. Trying to appeal to everyone or the idea of ​​MPAA at all, it manages to attract anyone. Like the second and fourth parts, you can completely erase it from continuity and no one would notice the difference.
