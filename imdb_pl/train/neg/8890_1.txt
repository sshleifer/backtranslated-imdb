As for my first taste of Shakespeare on stage, I can not believe what these people did to make it perfect. <br /> <br /> - Let's start with what's good, should we? The rest of the actors had to connect him. <br /> <br /> Romeo, Romeo, why have not you died yet, Romeo? The actor, though not only completely wooden and immortal, could not read his line with enthusiasm. He was completely out of focus, he had difficulty even looking at Juliet in the face and absolutely WITHOUT Grace with the lines he received. Whoever threw it deserves to be punished. Julia is almost passable, but does not give depth to her character and does not appear to touch art completely. Mercutio was extremely frightening and completely devoid of character for all his dialogue. Benvolio was insensitive and ruthlessly agitated by his lines. <br /> <br /> I was forced to endure this half-baked production of Romeo and Juliet. Acting was stiff, and the costumes were nothing more than distracting. I saw pre-school puppet shows with more effort put into them. It is a pity that I can not give this film a zero mark.
