An interesting idea (four African Americans crushed by the heels of society's shoes are taking revenge by robbing banks) is ruined by the terribly slow direction of F. Gary Gray and the terrible script (by Takashi Bufford and Kate Lanier) full of unintentional amusing moments. Instead of making an eloquent commentary on the role of urban women struggling to stay in a world where men cruelly humiliate them, Gray, Bufford and Lanier prefer to hang their unsuspecting audiences with high images of operatic tragedy. It's the worst melodrama. Gray has his actors who stop at every tired line, and John Carter's lazy assembly refuses to decide to give up, choosing instead to hold the camera on the surprised faces of the performers. And they are confused: although actors such as Jada Pinkett, Kimberly Elise and Vivica A. Fox have some harsh talent (Queen Latifah is the fourth and as an actress is a great rapper), they need a firmer hand than Gray's to lead them and as a result they disappear as frightful and uncomfortable in front of the camera. Stay away.
