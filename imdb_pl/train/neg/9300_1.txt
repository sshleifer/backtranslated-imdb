Spoiler Alert Well, I think this movie is probably the worst movie ever made. Probably in the style of Ed Wood (without heart). The lightning is terrible. The music is very bad (piano and orgy ... come on!). Acting is ... well, there is no acting! <br /> <br /> There is a guy who actually goes to the forest to search for a missing wife and take time to have sex with a stranger. <br /> <br /> The killer is a thick, careless clown who could not overtake the turtle! <br /> <br /> Each member of the cast is stupid and the director puts all cliches effortlessly. <br /> <br /> The end is so stupid so far. Think about it: a guy (ken hebert) who has acting skills is more or less the same as his writing (he is the brain of this flop), invite a co-worker and two friends to his cabin for the weekend and kills them. .. On Monday morning, he returns to the office as if nothing had happened. <br /> <br /> The tragedy is that Mr. Hebert is trying to convince us that this is a family matter that lasts for a generation (his uncle is a clown killer) <br /> <br /> So of course, NONE cops will not question him after his co-worker kills ... <br /> <br /> WHATEVER. <br /> <br />
