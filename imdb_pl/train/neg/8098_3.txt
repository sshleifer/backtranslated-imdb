This is one of the most terrifying alterations I've ever seen. If they want to make a movie with a bad story, they should refrain from giving it the title of a great book. There is almost no relation between Wolfe's book and this movie except the title. I do not mind changes if they help to flow stories on the screen. At least the changes should not harm the final product. The last scene in the film is painfully unconvincing. Actors are wrong. The director and / or screenwriter obviously could not decide whether to make a lousy comedy or make an unconvincing sermon. <br /> <br /> If you saw this movie and did not like it, try the book. If you saw this movie and liked it, read the book.
