The guys who even THINK of watching this movie have some worries in their heads. This movie has nothing to do with Jack the Ripper (unless you thought) his next B, I mean class E movie consisting of a group of horny teenagers in some sex scenes watched just before their spleen splatter on a nearby tree . It is not scary, fun or funny. If you really feel like a mountain without a story, watch Cabin Fever, or at least the director did not fall asleep in the middle of directing this shit. Just watch it if you have absolutely nothing to do in life and the only thing on TV is Oprah Winfrey is crying on the TV.
