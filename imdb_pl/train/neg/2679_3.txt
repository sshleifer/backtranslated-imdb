(SPOILERS AHEAD) Russian "action actor" (and I use the term "loosely") that I've been trying to watch for over a year. In the end I got to the end and now I would like it not to put in a repeated effort. <br /> <br /> Trying to save you two hours of your life, let me tell you that a guy who has the opportunity to put a long blade on his arm is coming back to see his mother. Things get ugly after being beaten up by the mafia boyfriend of an old friend. He will take revenge on the guy when he takes the girl home. Mafia boys are sending their men to take revenge while the cops are looking for him. <br /> <br /> Not much is said. there is no explanation for anything (eg why block the girl in the asylum) and action, in most cases everything is excluded from the screen. The film consists basically of a guy who looks like Adrian Brody looking intensely and without saying anything, killing people (off-screen most of the action happens off screen). It looks good, it's well-preserved and if there was a reason for what was happening, it would be a good movie. Hell, I'd like some sense of real character development or history (we only know that the guy was chosen as a child). The film lasts two hours and looks six. If they did not tell us anything, they could at least raise the pace, so it seemed that it was moving too fast. No, instead we get a hero on a boat. The hero on the bus, the hero walking, the hero looking worried. Hero with his girlfriend. It really annoyed me because I think it could have been a good movie if they just did something or someone actually said something significant except the "get this guy" command. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10 There are about four hours (all my attempts to see this) I will never come back. Only for those who want to see a meditating Russian action movie with a very small action
