A guy walking without a motive ... I never regain those two hours of my life. The guy was still accepting identity and cheating on a pregnant wife. What was I thinking? How did you win the price anywhere? I understood that he loved his father, but otherwise the movie was completely meaningless to me. What was the purpose of so many walking and going to the funeral of a stranger without a clear reason. How did it enrich his life? Why did we have to see a dying old lady on her underwear ???? !!! Why ??? !!!! <br /> <br /> I thought it would be deep or something more interesting. I do not recommend film even after weaning during sleep ...
