Kareena Kapoor in a hmmmmmmmm bikini. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar ... <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor .... <br /> <br /> Maybe Saif .... <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor w bikini ..... <br /> <br /> Dobry baner .. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor w bikini ..... <br /> <br /> This is not one good reason not to watch this movie .... <br /> <br /> Or I thought so ........ Did not these people do JBJ ... <br /> <br /> Why about Why I forgot about that. <br /> <br /> Despite all the critics, the first half of the movie is not so bad ... <br /> <br /> There is a bit of intrigue and YOU FEEL THE SORT OF MIXED IRRITATION WITH THE PERFECTION I REACHED WHEN I SEE THE GUEST RITCHIE MOVIES AS WELL AS CLOSE THE MAGAZINE AND SNATCH. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor sizzles in a very thin model. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is Akshay Kumar, because only he can be. <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor is annoying, but a bit funny, ALMOST SHIFT THAT THE MOST TIME YOU CAN NOT UNDERSTAND IT. <br /> <br /> Saif is sidey ala Main Khiladi .. once again. <br /> <br /> From time to time he laughs and some giggles are, and a few goose bumps during the love story of kareena-saif (kareena in the rain, behind me on my bike hmmmmmmm). <br /> <br /> BUT THE MOST HALF IS EXPECTING MORE THAN THIS DELIVERY ..... <br /> <br /> THAT PROVIDES SECOND HORSE OF ALL DANGERS .... <br /> <br /> It was almost to cheer when the break was not only because of the wet kareena because of what people thought were things to come. <br /> <br /> WERE TREATED TO MAKE THE NUMBERING OF TORTURE WHICH ARE DIFFICULT IN THE WORDS. <br /> <br /> Suddenly seam like comical helper ... <br /> <br /> AMAZING SEXY KISSEN LOOKS ANOREKS, YOU ARE REALIZING THAT SECOND FLOOR IS NOW BLANK AND ITS FACE EXPECTS TO LARGE BODY (only girls can notice it and make others notice that the second top floor was my observation). <br /> <br /> ANIL KAPOOR AND HIS SIDEKICKS COME UP TO YOUR NERVES. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is the only one who realizes madness to some extent, but even after some time it becomes unbearable. <br /> <br /> EVERYTHING IF YOU ARE SUBJECT ON ANOTHER ABSURDATION AFTER ANOTHER. <br /> <br /> WHY ?? !! WHAT??!!! IF?!!! WHERE?!!! WHAT WE DID TO KNOW HIMSELF ... <br /> <br /> A collective sigh passed through the audience before every song in the second half, which was ordinary even without the film surrounding it. <br /> <br /> You can no longer free yourself from trauma .... <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION. <br /> <br /> THIS FILM BEGINS AS A BUZZ, WHICH YOU CAN FEEL EVEN, BUT AWAY FROM A HIGH BUT, COMES UP SLOWLY. HEARING HIMSELF AND THEN FASTLY FITS A FULL BLOOD ATTACK MIGRAIN. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie for any reason other than academic interest. <br /> <br /> + s Cast, Akshay Kumar, first half. <br /> <br /> +/- s what, when, how, who to big confusion (I need a book to fill it out). <br /> <br /> + cast, the whole other half (many pages are needed to fill it). <br /> <br /> total 3/10 (try to avoid 1s and 2s does not seem extreme, but do not make a mistake this movie is unseeable no matter how decent the first half is).
