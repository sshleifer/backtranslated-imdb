You bought this movie in a bargain basket at Rogers Video for $ 2. From time to time, I like a good movie B and I've come to the conclusion that it looks good. <br /> <br /> The film is quite trivial "seventies" and it is quite good for it. Unfortunately, the plot is difficult to trace and not much happens in the film. In fact, I turned it off after watching for 45 minutes and thought a week later that I should watch the whole thing no matter how slow it was. <br /> <br /> The film has good places, but you have to wait, wait and wait ... for them. <br /> <br /> If you're playing in B-type movies, it can only be for you, just warn you that the movie is slow and little really happens and I also mentioned few stories ... <br /> <br />
