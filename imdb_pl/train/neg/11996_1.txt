I'm waiting for this movie for a long time. Especially because Juhi Chawla is a great actress in this. <br /> <br /> This movie has six stories. It's a new concept from Hollywood. So this is not a new item. <br /> <br /> 1. Khamini (priyanka chopra) is a dancer. He wants to be famous and creates a boyfriend who lets her journalists interest her. But then Rahul (Salman Khan) appears and claims to be her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Priyanka Chopra is still not a good actress. When he screams, I get nervous. Salman Khan can not play comic roles. But in his serious parts he is wonderful. <br /> <br /> 2. Vinay (Anil Kapoor) is married to Seema (Juhi Chawla). He falls into the midlife crisis and is attracted by a much younger woman, forgetting what he really has in life; his wife and children. <br /> <br /> Anil kapoor en Juhi are born actors / actresses. They are great. But this story is thin for them. <br /> <br /> 3. Shiven (Akshaye Khanna) intends to marry Gia (Ayesha Takia), but he gets cold and blows up the wedding. <br /> <br /> 4. Ashutosh (Joh Abraham) is married to Tehzeeb (Vidya Balan). He gets an accident and suffers from memory loss. Now he does not know that he loves his husband anymore. <br /> <br /> 5. Raju (Govinda) is a taxi driver. He meets Stephani (Shannon Esrechowitz), who is a white woman in love with an Indian man, but is about to marry an Indian woman. Paradise must bring Staphani to this man, but he falls in love with her. <br /> <br /> I never liked Govinda movies. It is very irritating, not funny. But in this movie I liked him very much, as if he grew up over the years. <br /> <br /> 6. Oh yes! Is Sohail Khan! A game in Ram Dayal who is married to Phoolwati (Isha Koppikar). She wants to take a serious action with her, but every time her family comes in between. <br /> <br /> Sohail Khan is not a handsome actor, but he is funny! I like his films. <br /> <br /> Now the problem is. All these stories are not interesting. Making one story out of six uninteresting stories does not make the whole movie interesting! Here and there, stories touch each other, but they do not matter to the character. <br /> <br /> My application; Priyanka can not work! Relax this woman in the bollywood industry. Sohail Khan should do more films, this role was too small for him. Salman Khan can not play comic roles, but real serious movies. It is written about his life as an actor. This movie sucks and is a waste of cast of good actors and actresses such as Anil Kapoor, Juhi Chawla, Akshaya Khanna and John Abraham. <br /> <br /> It's like you can make a movie with Amitabh Bachchan, and you just let him sing a lullaby.
