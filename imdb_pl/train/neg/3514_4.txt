Philip. Film by K. Dickian. And a decent thing. Better than payoff (Woo) and this abomination called Minority Report (Spielberg). But let's face it, the twisting and cheesy ending was a bit too much for me. In the middle of the movie I started to be afraid of this kind of ending and unfortunately I was right. But that does not mean that the movie is not worth the time. No, not at all. The first half (as many have commented on here) is amazing. There are certain parts in which it begins to doubt whether the director intended to convey the message that showmanship is a very important thing in the future (we will do this kind of things forfeited, because WE CAN) or if it is simply a combination. But there is paranoia and a sense of "no common". Good.
