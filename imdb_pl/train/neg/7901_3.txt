. . . And this is a bad thing, because at least if it was Troma's film, it would have a senseless violence and a greater sense of anarchic abandonment that might have increased my assessment a bit. <br /> <br /> So what, instead, we have a very tame (rated PG), barely lukewarm, low budget (Roger Corman produced it with an unknown director who later remained unknown). Gremlins (1984) / Critters (1986) - with almost exclusively flat humor, little logic that made Gremlins work so well - fantasy logic or not, lack of tension, lack of sense of adventure and lack of violence or nudity to compensate. <br /> <br /> Although I am sure that some problems with the film are inherent to the script - let's face it, nobody can give these jokes, make them funny - it seems that the biggest guilt is to fall on the director's knees , Bettiny Hirsch. Munchies could be funny in more efficient hands. <br /> <br /> In the end, it starts like a lot of great adventure movies. Simon Waterman (Harvey Korman) and his son Paul (Charles Stratton) are in Peru on archaeological sites. Simon is a bit of a crazy archaeologist who always moves theories about the links between ancient places and alien civilizations. For example, he thinks he sees evidence of laser cutting on an ancient stonework. So they are in Machu Picchu, looking for more evidence for Szymon's theories when they happen in a secret chamber. Inside, they quickly find an animal that they later call "Arnold", one of the titular munchies. <br /> <br /> They take Arnold back to their small town in the California desert. Simon, who thinks Arnold is probably an alien being, must go to a friend's lecture and plan to tell his friend that he's finally got a stranger. Paul and his extremely adorable girlfriend, Cindy (Nadine Van der Velde), remain under the care of Arnold, but because they have not seen each other for a long time, they leave Arnold unattended when they jump into the sack. > <br /> Meanwhile, Simon's brother, Cecil (also played by Korman in a double role), the owner of a successful snack company, eagerly purchases the house and land of Simon - they are adjacent to his own. Simon does not want to sell, so Cecil tries to steal Arnold. Things gradually get out of control, and crunchy, which have a good streak and desire for junk food, begin to take over the city. <br /> <br /> It sounds better in the summary than the screen game. The best shots in the film are those with natural landscapes in the background, for example when the heroes ride on the outskirts of a desert city. The interiors, except Cecil's house, seem to look like badly-equipped, cheap sets, and more importantly, tend to show that Hirsch is not too talented in blocking and setting shots. Oddly enough, given the scarcity of a holistic production project, Cecil's home is a pretty gem, saturated with 80s style to the smallest details, and Cecil's stepson, Dude (Jon Stafford), was a funny counterpoint. It is a pity that he disappeared from the movie so quickly. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Korman is a funny actor, but he's much better here than Simon, not Cecil. Unfortunately, Simon ends up being absent for most of the movie. Cecil, who is physically differentiated by a funny wig and facial hair, is not only the "evil capitalist" of the film, he is one of Korman's classic mindless heroes - it was one of his specialties, often sketched on the "Carol Burnett Show" (1967). In contrast to "The Carol Burnett Show", which was usually successful, because the directors Clark Jones and Dave Powers explored the way they push the skits to the edge of chaos, Hirsch draws Korman too far, and Cecil simply does not work as it should . <br /> <br /> There are many other problems associated with the director, the smallest of which is shaky stimulation and editing, which completely eliminate any possible tension or dramatic influence of the film. Even scenes that should be the shoes to strengthen the drama - for example, when munchies harass an elderly woman on the road - are juxtaposed too awkwardly to have a big impact. <br /> <br /> There are also serious logical problems related to history. Where does Munchie come from in the chamber in Machu Picchu? The trailer of the film seems to show the answer to this question, but has been edited from the final version. The more serious problem is that, unlike gremlins, there is no clear reason for munchies to walk from cute, cuddly furballs to dangerous monsters. It just happens. In addition, because Munchies was kept in the hands of PG, and violence remains subdued, when creatures are in the phase of monsters, they are never very dangerous. They are also easily sent, at least temporarily. <br /> <br /> The essence of the film is not tension, terror, fascinating drama or any other thing, but humor. This is to be more of a parody of Gremlins and countless rip-offs. The only problem is that the film is simply not funny, although I chuckled several times. A surprisingly high percentage of jokes are bland stereotypes. Too much of the remaining material consists of elements other than sequential. Taking into account Hirsch's bad moment, everything just falls. There was the potential to make a movie which, though parody, was both funny and frightening, funny and disturbing, tacky and full of tension, and at the same time ala Killer Klowns from Outer Space (1988). It is a pity that Munchies is nowhere near.
