The sects that make use of this film are well known for claiming that they are taking the "message" of the Bible without any changes and non-sexual influences. The existence of this movie is solely due to the fact that there is no such thing. <br /> <br /> If you want to know what the Christian branch was born again in the seventies, look at the word "delight" in the dictionary of cults and sects. It's faster than sitting through this celluloid waste. <br /> <br /> Poor acting, uneven sound quality and a script that Jack T Chick might as well have written (a paranoid Christian conspiracy theorist for those who are not familiar with the Evangelical scene). You can not really include it in the category "so bad that it's good", so its only audience are either those who have a collection of brochures that wants to branch out, or extreme paranoia.
