** ZAWIERA SPOILERY ** <br /> <br /> Really excellent Sean Young (who in some scenes, with hair wrapped around looks like Elizabeth Taylor) hits his initial moments in this film. Sitting in the back of the police car, waiting for the bust signal, her face and body are strained and dispersed. Unfortunately, when the bust ends, Young's tense behavior never changes. This is one deadly actress. <br /> <br /> Just compare Young with the performer playing his co-worker and best friend, Arnetia Walker, to understand what is missing in Young. Walker is open, emotional and free all the time ... in that there is no clear barrier between what she can feel and her expression. She is an open book. Young, however, behaves in a timid, self-aware way that one can expect from a neighbor that they will suddenly appear in the film. Basically, he has no idea. <br /> <br /> With this great emptiness that appears in the center of the movie, we have to think about the unbelievability of this story. For example, after Miss Young's abduction by a criminal who drags himself in and closes in a closet, he breaks the door when he is alone. I admit that she is dressed only in a bra and panties, but in a similar situation, with a psychoporteur who is supposed to come back at any moment, whether you go to the door ... or spend some time to go over the dresser, take out your clothes and get dressed? I'm guessing that this and other scenes are trying to suggest the mixed emotions that Miss Young is experiencing, but Young is not able to convey this kind of complexity. <br /> <br /> There are several influential moments in the film, such as short police interviews with past victims of the criminal, but it is generally a pointless venture. It is a pity that Miss Young was mentioned during the shooting of comic book movies that could use her limitations with some humor (BATMAN and DICK TRACY), because her floundering when trying to play real people is strangely moving. Watching Miss Young tries to act, at least in this "thriller", is a sad spectacle.
