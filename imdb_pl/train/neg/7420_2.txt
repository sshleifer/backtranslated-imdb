romance without feeling, a drama of problems without a point (or drama) .... This movie is supposed to be everything and fails on every account, as if it did not try. Or as if the director / editor / scriptwriter really did not try. Actors are able - they need better support. <br /> <br /> One of the elements that does not disappoint is the result of George Delarue. Beautiful and moving. It is a pity that he is attached to this film. In a good movie, the words and movements of the actors and the music synchronize and amplify the effect. This editor has covered music regardless of dialogue and movement. The love scene is especially grotesque in this respect: an insult to the talents of the main actors. <br /> <br /> There is one more element in the movie: local photography. Especially the moment in Grand Central Station. I knew in advance what would happen; but how it was shot in this environment was breathtaking. <br /> <br /> Some commentators in this forum have pointed out that the American assimilation of criminal Nazi scientists actually took place during these years of frightening MacCarthy. At the moment when the film seems to look seriously at American society, it changes into a conventional romance; before any human feelings can move us, there is no (predictable) escapade of the thriller. <br /> <br /> Like a movie, it offends talents of actors, offends issues that it pretends (and fails) to take. <br /> <br /> You are warned.
