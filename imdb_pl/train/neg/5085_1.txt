this film starts with a simple funeral ... and so strongly persists in the ordinary funeral that I lost interest within 5 minutes of watching and started to avoid scenes. it seems to me that everyone who has made this film is affected to such an extent that he is trapped in a constant disease trance, unable to contemplate anything but death and destruction. Well, I'm not one of the dark kids from Southpark, I want a movie that will make me start an interesting story in 10 minutes, I will not sit and watch anything but funeral preparations 10 minutes. maybe she could enjoy this "movie".
