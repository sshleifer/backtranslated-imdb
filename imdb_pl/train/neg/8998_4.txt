Stephen Feinberg, who played Proctologist and was one of the authors of the film, died at the beginning of 2006. I met Steve in Portland in 1993, a year later, when he told me that he was a writer in Hollywood years earlier, working mainly on TV promotions. He asked me not to see "Tunnel Vision", but it was too late, I saw it already! Actually, I saw it years ago when it was released. At the time, I did not think it was such a bad movie. However, perception of this as an adult was in my opinion a bit different. Yes, it's a bit childish and outdated. Steve admitted that it was not a very good movie. He said he is just a little proud of the sketch of The Proctologist.
