I can sum up this movie with 20 words or less. A predictable story story that can be fun, but instead falls on your face. But I see 19 words, but I did not completely move this move with just one star, but instead I decided to raise to two stars, because Julie Bowen smokes hot and provided only enough eye candy to stop me from ripping the DVD straight from the device and blowing it up with M80. My advice, take a rental fee of 4.00 USD, which you would pay for watching this video and just send it to me in advance, thank you for saving time and frustration due to sitting on this train wreck, or you can send me a payment an equivalent of USD 50.00, which you would have to pay for taking twelve gages to use this piece of rubbish as a clay-throwing technique.
