No good game, no decent ACTION, no good CINEMATOGRAPHY, no decent SPECIAL EFFECTS ... I have to go further? The CAN review may contain SPOILERS. The actors seem to READ their poems and not very well. Most of the "actors" behaved as in the play of the SECOND GAME. The story was written by one of the above-mentioned second graders ... it's not so complicated ... it's so SIMPLE and DUMB that a person thinks he's missing something, so they think it's intricate. No, it's not, it's EXACTLY as easy as you think. I UNDERSTAND THE "MOVIE", THEN I KNOW THAT IT IS A STATION! Most of the movie just sat around people talking (reading their poems), trying to look ominous. The narrator was furious. "Special effects" were LAZY. I love low-budget movies. I also like Carolyn Munro, Tom Savini, Jack Scarry and Michael Berrymore ... just not in this movie ... you can say that they did not get paid or did not get much, because neither their heart NOR them. talents were in it. I LOVE Tony Todd ... but he was only right in this movie. In fact, Tony Todd's performance is the ONLY reason I gave him 3 stars instead of 1 ... and Tony was only in it for a whole TWO MINUTES (seriously)! I suggest rewinding the DVD to the Tony Todd two-minute segment. If I went to the theater and paid more than DOLAR to see this "movie", I would be P.O.'D and demanded a refund. I hope people who do it will do better next time.
