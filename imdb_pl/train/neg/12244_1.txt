This movie is horrible. CGI is a very cheap CGI in gray. The crocodile looks like a large gray spot. The worst thing is that you do not make any effort to make him walking or looking alive. This is mostly CGI with pictures that are placed in scenes and you almost are expected to see a hand that shifts the CGI streak across the screen. This is one of the worst examples of CGI effects I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of very bad Sci-Fi channel movies. <br /> <br /> In addition to the terrible lack of special effects, the cast consists of typical low-cost actors who probably work as waiters / waiters in local restaurants while they wait for their big breaks. Perhaps the most absurd scene in this movie is when one of the bad guys tries to sexually attack Kate, and the giant crocodile jumps straight out of the water to the second floor of the Villains Headquarters and through the balcony and pulls away the evil guy Kate and instead falls straight through the building (and crush Kate), Croc flies back to the water at the same angle. No laws of physics can apply to this film or special effects. Crocodiles have at least honor.
