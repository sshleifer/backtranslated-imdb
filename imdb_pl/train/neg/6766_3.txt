You probably heard this sentence when it comes to this movie? "Herbie: Fully Loaded with crap" and yes, it's true. This movie is really awful and completely bad. <br /> <br /> This was the second worst movie Lindsey has ever heard from a teenage drama queen. The only good thing about this movie seems to be the cast of talent, which is definitely better than a million movies and is the only point of the film's sale. I do not understand how such a respected actor, like Matt Dillon, could have been part of the movie, do not he read this horrible scenario before he appears in it? <br /> <br /> What I did not like about this movie is also based on how Herbie is surreal and fanciful like extraordinary abilities and climbs the wall and goes faster than a race car, after all this only beatles. I know it's a movie for children, but they've overdone it and it just turns out to be more stupid than entertainment. Little realism is needed, and history is too predictable. <br /> <br /> Last words: If children do not really have 5-12 years, I doubt that anyone can enjoy this senseless movie. What a waste of my money. I feel cheated. <br /> <br /> Mark: 3/10 (in class: F)
