I had no idea what the movie was about before I saw him, because Tashan had only harbingers of trailers during his promotion. So I asked my friends if they knew something about it and said: "This is the directorial debut of Vijay Krishna Acharya, who wrote scenarios for Dhoom 1 and 2, and Ibrahim Saif Ali Khan's son makes his debut in the movie, playing it as a child in his retrospective." < br /> <br /> After seeing this, I understood why it was not the right trailer for it because there was nothing to show in the film.The story was extremely proud and even a ten-year-old child could come up with a better story. There was almost no action, and the camera It was difficult to determine who kills whom. The action was also stupid and unreal, eg 1 man with a gun managed to kill about 100 people with machine guns. <br /> <br /> While watching Tashana it was like mi is 3 movies: <br /> <br /> Sin City: During initial credits. <br/> <br /> Koyla: The scary English Anila Kapoora as Amrish Puri in Koyli. <br /> <br /> Jhoom Ba rabar Jhoom: Scandalous funny jokes that are not even fun. <br /> <br /> I also heard that the budget is 40 crores, which is the same as Dhoom 2 and I do not know where all the money went. Anyway, if you did not like Dhoom 2, there's absolutely no chance you would like Tashana. The race was hot on his heels and that is a million times better. <br /> <br /> The only two good songs are Dil Haara and Challiya, and both songs are shot in Greece in good locations, but what is their use in a junk movie? Even the terrible English Anil Kapoor could not save this anxiety.
