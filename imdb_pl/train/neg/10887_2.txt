...... this movie is horrible, the only thing that stops me from being rated 1, was that unfortunately I did not see it. <br /> <br /> Jungle music, protruding demons and Fluorescent UV style blood / teeth / eyes give it a "horrible" look, and the script is horrible ..... this movie is more like a test to see how long you can stand it before you give up. It is also predictable, but not in a good way. Nothing that this movie does is good. I watched it 10 minutes ago and I thought I would be a bit off, so you are. (oh, and acting does not slow down the movie, it's also horrible)
