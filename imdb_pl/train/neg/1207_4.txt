Kim Basinger plays the role of Della, a desperate housewife with a somewhat offensive husband who gets in trouble when he is at the local mall shopping at the last minute. After placing a hastily scribbled note on a piece of paper and gluing this paper to the windshield of a car that occupied two parking spaces, he learns that the car owners are Rainbow Coilition villains consisting of a white guy, Mexican, Chinese and black. They confront her with a note, cover the helpless guard, and the pursuit continues. During the movie, Dell will go hunting for the hunter, freeing his internal Bronson. <br /> <br /> I think it's a bit of a thriller. Acting was good enough (except for a few scenes, "Why God why" was a little worth the anger in his bad mood) It's falling apart because of the pure fact that the villains from which Della are chasing are stupidly stupid. If they did not have the intellect of any "Lonely" badie, perhaps their final failure would be something that could be enjoyed instead of the reaction it evokes. The factor of unbelievableness that I would like to overlook, both as a director and one of the producers, took part in the transfer of "Shoot em up" to the screen (a film that cast credibility through the window was extremely entertaining). This film, never reaching the heights of this film, was good in its own right. <br /> <br /> My class: C- <br /> <br /> Anchor Bay DVD Extras: Comment with screenwriter / director Susan Montford and producer Don Murphy; 25 and a half minutes; trailer and two television spots for the film; and the forerunner of lower learning
