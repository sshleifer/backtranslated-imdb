Dear Richard, I know that we all loved you in Home Improvement with Tim Allen. But seriously, do you have nothing else to do besides the lame sequins of Air Bud? I would think Tim could give you a little role now and even be his personal assistant. I know it seems ironic, but the benefits of reward are much more satisfying. <br /> <br /> Everyone would see you around Tim and immediately thought "Time for tools". You would even get roles with Bob Vila more often. Instead, he appears for 10 minutes with the Golden Retriever and smiles. I know there was not a lot of script, but you could add it. Come on. Tim, he owes you. <br /> <br /> But seriously, this movie does nothing for the Air Bud line. On the contrary, false talking puppies are worse than watching dogs in sports. The original was better. And Mr. Richard Karn knows more about it than anyone else. <br /> <br /> This is the movie "F".
