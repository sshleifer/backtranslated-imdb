I just watched the movie 15 minutes ago and I still have no idea what I just watched. Mainly I think that this is a movie about the online "star" of S & M CD-ROMs that are as realistic as flash cartoons. She was murdered by someone, which means that her sister and the team of two FBI agents are investigating death. The local homicide unit in Big City, USA, also investigates, although most of his work comes from circumventing CD-ROMs, which he believes are as realistic as "real". I know. Wow. <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen is the only one in the movie who has some credits behind him. She's been in the movie for about 15 minutes, and half of them are pounding at the main girl seemingly for no apparent reason. I will not even explain the ending, because to be honest, I can not understand it. But before the final stage we are dealing with 3 or 4 minutes of editing everything in the film. Honestly, they could run it on the final scene and it would be the same effect with the perverse direction and everyone. <br /> <br /> In total, stay away from this movie. I have it because I love bad movies and I love Michael Madsen. I really could take advantage of these 80 minutes on something else and I was more pleased. For example, playing this game with a knife, where you stab your hand repeatedly. It would be a lot more fun for 80 minutes.
