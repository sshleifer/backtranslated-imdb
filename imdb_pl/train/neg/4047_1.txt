***** WARNING, MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS THAT WILL BE MORE ENTERTAINMENT THAN THREE NEEDS. **** <br /> <br /> Here are some good tips for anyone living in the UK Ever Channel 5 has a 80's comedy late at night, read the book instead. I am currently recovering from the robbery because of some comments on this video here. I am shocked that someone said this movie is realistic! All I can say is thanks to God that the Cold War never intensified, or we could as well give our Commie limits ... I consider this movie extremely successful, maybe it's just my British perception of what makes The movie is funny, who knows? But in all respects this movie is not simply awful, and its teeth are terribly horrible. <br /> <br /> I've never been a fan of Bill Murray, and his nonsense that justifies my feelings for him. Do not get me wrong, I loved Ghostbuster, which was made just three years after this movie. But that really sums up Bill Murray really. I can honestly say that I have not wasted my time so blatantly from the moment I saw the Delta Force operation for the first time, although these two films have more in common than you might think. For one thing, both have horrible action sequences from start to finish and the second. They are both overcrowded with cheesy Clich√©, throughout. <br /> <br /> Here's one thing, these guys should be in the "US Army." Nevertheless, they are allowed to wallow around the camp, Willy Nilly, seduce female Military Police officers, and then stupidly knock them around in the quarters of generals. Talk about Random! This movie is just awful because I'm scared. Do not get me wrong, I'm not a feminist sympathizer, but the fact that these two women really fall in love with the two heroes shortly after their arrest, letting them free themselves ... Twice, it's simply offensive to the female race. The fact that one insidious, fat ass (winger) and his unfortunate midfielder Ramis can just sweetly speak to the underwear of a member of parliament, to whom they insanely fall in love with both of them, is ridiculous. > <br /> Then there are training scenes where you can meet Squad "Phycho", which unconvincingly kills anyone who touches him or his things, and then an overweight guy (played by the deceased and the big John Candy) who claims he joined to the army to "avoid paying $ 400 for anger management classes." Leading to Murray's loud murmuring paying tribute to "Giant Toe" (WTF?) "Drill Seargent", who honestly could not organize the pi $$ in the brewery, not to mention his group of recruits. Everything you can do is a prelude to many battle scenes, with people saying "the way to the bottom"! all the time etc. <br /> <br /> The scenes then show a bunch of tag rags that make their own tits on the assault course, leading to a scene where one of them shoots wildly into the air. passing birds with an assault rifle, bullets nailing the clock tower. (Yes, yes, I told you that this movie was accidental ... It also escapes unruly in a miraculous way ...) Finally, it leads to a passing parade, where the unfortunate branch makes magic rotate within two hours . (Bugger me, Miracle!) Thanks to a few wise words by Murray, who then direct massively any military dance routine before the Geriatric "General" from the rest of the units. All this for the enormous pleasure of their two girls at the stand, who really should have arrested them ... Everyone laughs about it. It's a bit amazing. Then he chooses them to guard a new multi-millionth prototype armored vehicle in Italy (which turns out to be simply a mobile home painted green with lots of gadgets inside), claiming that "exactly this army needs it!". righto ... <br /> <br /> Then there is a terrible finale in which Murray and Ramis decide to steal this top-secret Military Vehicle prototype to pick up the newly acquired and somewhat Hyperactive MP Girlfriends in Germany. What the unfortunate captain (John Larroquette) learns and leads the Branch of fresh recruits on the mission of recovering this vehicle. Then they turn into the "wrong turn" on the route and end up in the Soviet property of Czechoslovakia, where they are captured. (As we did not see it coming ...) That's how the attempt to save Ramis and Murray begins + Birds in hand, which comes to a great fight, lots of shooting from the hip and blowing tanks. When they come back as heroes of the nation, they will humiliate the Russians, calling them "pussies", etc. End. That's right. No court martial, nothing. They have just stolen the prototype of a military vehicle, entered the Warsaw Pact country and almost caused an international incident that could trigger WW3! <br /> <br /> This movie is honestly more fun than diagnosing terminal disease. I know it's supposed to be a comedy, it has the right actors for it, but where the hell is it? Does channel 5 cut these bits? The only buy-back in this film is the repeated use of nude women taking showers and Mud Wrestling women. (as I said, Random) Not that it would help turn away from the fact that it's completely nonsense, of course. This film should be realistically addressed to immature 9-year-olds, but unfortunately we have to watch it. 1 star on 10 - Total Tripe. My advice, do something more useful in your own time. Like Castrating himself ...
