This movie starts slowly and then slows down. After watching for about an hour and seeing that nothing is happening, I left. I mean, nothing happened. Zero. ZIP. Nada. There is no history. The characters are vague images of the most boring people that everyone knows about. Producers of this film can be sued if they try to sell it as a "move". There is no traffic. I could tell the same "story" with a few still photos with captions. The script is a joke. It's just awful. I doubt that any doctor in the world could save him. I regret that I have not wasted 60 minutes of my life watching "Love In the Time of Money", but I missed a great opportunity to become a leader. I could have been the first to leave, but I waited a little too long. Instead, I watched as about 20 people leave in front of me.
