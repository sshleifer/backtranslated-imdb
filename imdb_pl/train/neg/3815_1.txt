Acting is a poor ham, ALL jokes are superficial, and the target audience is clearly very young children, assuming they are below the average IQ. I realize that it was intended for children, but the same as Malcom in the middle, and yet throw humor for adults and situations. <br /> <br /> What can we expect from a show run by Bob Saget, the only comedian in fact who is less funny than a ball hitting the man's groin, that's why he probably stopped to host the funniest home movies of America. <br /> <br /> Parents, do not let children watch this program unless you want to save money on college. Display children for stupidity and grow up.
