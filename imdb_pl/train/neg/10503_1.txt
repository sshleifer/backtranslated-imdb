I saw this movie yesterday .. I rented a DVD from Blockbuster. Actually, I know one of the actresses from the movie ... I will not say who ..! (It's kept secret ...) But I have to admit that it was not as good as I thought it would be ... Tom Savini? Hats for this guy ... But it's a pity that he was not in the movie for long. There is a lack of a movie, an idea, a script, sound, etc. It may look like a good movie ... but it was not. it's funny .. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm glad my sister paid 10 pounds for renting 3 DVDs from Blockbuster .. I chose this one ... and I was disappointed. In any case, thumbs for me ..! Not my cup of tea! 0 out of 10!
