The movie started well enough. This led to the fact that someone was hit by a glowing green meteorite, obtaining superpowers (telekinesis, X-rays, insensitivity, flight, ability to talk to dogs, superspeed, vision of heat and the ability to make plants grow large and fast), and combating crime. From that moment everything is down. <br /> <br /> Meteor Man gets a costume from his mum, fights with resident gangs and has many interrupted meetings with gang leaders that are used to set you up for a disappointing, long and stunning ending. <br /> <br /> It would not be so bad if it was not like a boxing match in which the two fighters pretend to hit each other while the audience looks ahead while the fighters are still dancing. <br /> <br /> Despite all these nonsense, the film has a good side. It clearly states that if you try to face the gang alone, they will come back to your home and hurt you. He states that gangs and communities must see their real enemies (great bosses who use them for their own purposes to destroy honest people in the ghetto existence). He also states that people do not need superheroes, if they want to work as a community, they destroy predators that harm them. The only thing that is really missing is that voters should ensure that their elected officials (Rudolph Giuliani, Marion Barry, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush) are not cheaters either. <br /> <br />
