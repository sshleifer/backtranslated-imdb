This long-lasting film turns out to be less connected with Berkowitz and its effect in New York, but more with the painting of caricatures of a certain group of Italian Americans, known locally as "Guidos". The problem is that Guidos are uninteresting, no matter what story or surroundings are submerged. They are already caricatures, so Lee just strengthens them, not just presents. <br /> <br /> When someone has their own caricature, they do not come home and say, "Hey, more ears and a nose!". That's what Lee did in this movie. The most interesting characters in the film are two (Adrian Brody and Jennifer Esposito) who want to escape from the "Guido" lifestyle. Add to this a boring story for the character, especially John Leguizamo, and you will get a nice movie that you can fall asleep. Especially considering that it is a long time of action. <br /> <br /> One more blow against him: for someone who announces himself a Yankees fan and grew up in New York, Spike Lee should know how to spell out Phil Rizzuto, meaning incorrectly written in endpoints.
