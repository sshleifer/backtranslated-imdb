this movie is really bad ....... I do not mean really bad. Tony Scott is a terrible director. of all the films he has made, I am only the enemy of the state, and besides, he is one of the worse directors of all time. the most horrifying thing about me is Richard Kelly (director Donnie Darko) who wrote the script for this. now Richard Kelly is a genius in my eyes, but being involved is hoping to learn his lesson. <br /> <br /> Now I love the new roles of Mickey Rourke, but I can not even like him because of the horrible story and its appearance. do not get me wrong, I still love Mickey Rourke, but in his time he made a few mistakes and this is one of them. I do not know what to say about Keira's knight, I think she's a bit too overrated. I just do not feel her in movies. <br /> <br /> all in all, this movie is bad. this is ....... 1/10 ....... j.d Seaton
