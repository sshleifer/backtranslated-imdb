I believe that religion will remain outside the government and outside of the movies. When I want to preach, I will go to church, but I do not want any of the movie. I do not mind some of the supernatural themes (after all, religion is as supernatural as you can!), But this movie told so much in it that I was really annoyed. The landlady reminded me of witches, which could be seen in other films. The bad guy even looked like he had horns. <br /> <br /> And what a stupid ending: the hero came to the meeting and shouted at all those old people, and that broke the spell. If life were so simple. I think that when films are so stupid, they should be disseminated with the warning: DANGER! HERE INCLUDES VOTE!
