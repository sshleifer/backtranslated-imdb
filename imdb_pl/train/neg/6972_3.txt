When I saw the cover of the movie for the first time (a gigantic mistake chasing a few nurses) And the name "Blue Monkey", I knew that I was not in any big Hollywood movie. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw Steve Railsback in this movie with a cheese ball that always does a good job in any role he does ... FX is pretty trivial, there's not much story, and I'm still not sure why the movie is called Blue Monkey, because in this movie it has nothing to do with the monkey. But come to people, what did you expect? It's not as bad as it seems .... If you like old 50's black and white blackout movies, this one is basically an updated version without special FX updates
