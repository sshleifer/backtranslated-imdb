I usually like the early films of Loretta Young: then her acting was light and airy, and she certainly knew how to wear clothes. But this one is just a loser from the beginning, with the exception of Glenda Farrell's entertaining tour. Young is a hatchery girl who tells her husband-writer (Paul Lukas) to become the bridge master. This is not the most cinema-based game, and the long, talkative central part in which their marriage only falls apart to the death of the film. <br /> <br /> However, there is one interesting piece. As Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk start their climactic game, a series of quick shots shows airplanes, trains, football matches, even a diver in the air, freezing while waiting for the event. This is the earliest use of the frozen frame that I saw in the American film. I would like the rest to be so ingenious and fun.
