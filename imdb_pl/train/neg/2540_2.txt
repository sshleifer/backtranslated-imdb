I thought I saw this movie twice. Then I read all the other reviews and did not fit together. A man and three young students, two girls and a boy, go to this city to study the alleged observations of the great foot. I am still convinced that this is a film I have seen, despite the discrepancies in the reviews. That's why I'm going back to the review: If you like the occasional movie "B" like me, then returning to Boggy Creek is a movie for you! Regardless of whether you set the sleep timer, whether you nod your favorite movie bomb or just meet friends. Boggy Creek, a mute button, and you have a fun night of improvisation. Watch out! Is the legend true? I think we can just find out, along with a very stellar cast. Will there be any hardware failures at particularly crucial moments of the film? Does our blonde, male, young hero have hair on her breast? Will the extremely advanced Technicolor survive the whole movie? You must convince yourself to find out.
