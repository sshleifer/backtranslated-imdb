If the name of this movie should be changed, it should be "The Jackasses of Hazzard". In conclusion, this movie is just 88 minutes of two immature country punks rejoicing in the famous Dodge Charger in 1968 in the city and in the village, chasing girls and avoiding the law. <br /> <br /> I was a fan of "Dukes" and what surpasses the movie is that the characters are out of the key. Excessive leniency of vulgarisms, sexual references and drug use caused that the good name of "Dukes" became a harbinger. <br /> <br /> After comparing to the TV series, acting was terrible. The only actor who did this was the famous Dodge Charger from 1969 named General Lee. Others have exaggerated the role of the character who has damaged the film. <br /> <br /> "Dukes" were another victim of the tragedy associated with the transformation of Hollywood television for the 21st century. Skip this movie and just buy a TV series on DVD. <br /> <br /> My rating: F
