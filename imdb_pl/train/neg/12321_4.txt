Seeing that I hate to read long essays with the hope of finding a point and disappointment, I will first tell everyone that this movie was terrible. Just horrible. And no, surprisingly for the reasons mentioned in the first review. I thought that I could agree with him, seeing that he gave the film the rank he deserved, but reading what he said he chided on his sadness. I am very embarrassed that I am taking the same page as someone who commented that the film "definitely lacks beautiful women". Let me be the first to say: "Wow! It was definitely a serious, deep review. My mind can not understand philosophical considerations about this film. " Seriously, however, the lack of "pretty women" should not be considered essential to the film. If you are desperate enough to "look good women," you should really watch other types of movies, not necessarily in the sci-fi category.
