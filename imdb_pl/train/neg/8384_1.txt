When I saw that IMDb users rated the movie in the bottom 250 films, I thought it was too difficult, but I did not know that the low score was absolutely correct. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of the Wayans brothers. I loved their terrible movie 2 and even enjoyed white chicks. Little Man, however, had little laughter, and the jokes were outdated. <br /> <br /> Of course, the joke will revolve around Marlon Wayans, who plays an adult dwarf who has recently been released from prison. He and his partner, Tracy Morgan, are stealing a diamond designed for a gangster. Things break down, and the dwarf has to put a diamond with the unsuspecting steam played by Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington. To retrieve the diamond, the dwarf pretends to be an abandoned child left on the threshold of unsuspecting couples. Of course, it is accepted and the drama begins in search of a diamond. <br /> <br /> There are several actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live in the film, such as Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider, as well as In Living Color. All these talents, however, can not help bad scenarios and jokes that just were not fun. <br /> <br /> The special effects that made Marlon Wayans look like a dwarf were fine. I mean, it was not 100% reliable, but it was OK ... no big deal. I just want the Wayans brothers to do more to develop a script with good jokes instead of trying to reinforce their poor script with episodes from their famous actors and comedians. or television. It really is not worth any amount of money.
