An updated version of the theme that was made earlier. Although this is not bad in itself, this film does not reach the ring, as other "hostile and pure" bad people do. <br /> <br /> Predictable, ambitious attempt that does not meet expectations. It is not worth sitting behind a tired, imaginary ending.
