Let me first say that I like watching "bad" movies. It's funny that some of these movies leave a more lasting impression than the really great ones. This movie is bad in a disturbingly malicious way. This vehicle of the mischievous ego of Sam Mraovich is not limited only to hopeless ineptitude, but has redefined the meaning of words. This should be a barometer for bad movies forever. Line type for the Mendoza movie. Mr. Mraovich writes, directs and plays as a dull subject, which Arthur Sailes fights with despised wives and Christian forces of evil, when he and his partner Ben "died behind the eyes" Sheets are fighting for marital equality. As a libertarian, I believe that gays should have the right to marry. Ben and Arthur do more damage to this matter than the army of homophobes. The presentation of all Christian things is so ugly and scant, the trademark of Mraovich, that they can not be taken seriously. Brother Arthur, Victor, the Bible totally enchanted by Jesus, is so terribly exaggerated evil / effeminate gay that you have to wonder how he was cast in this role. This is because Sam "multitasking" Mraovich was also a casting director. Sam Mraovich is the worst. When do you think that the leading person means the words of the paste, baldness and fat? Sam also provides lines such as domino, cold and usually wrong pizza. Last result: you're involved in writing, directing, acting and casting. It's a four-fold Ed Wood crown. I congratulate you on this terrible little man.
