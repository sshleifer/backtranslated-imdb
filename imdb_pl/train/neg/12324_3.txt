It was the rip off of the trash we had to see host Bob Saget within half an hour earlier. Dave Coulier only thought it was funny and it was the same show as the funniest American movies except the host who has a total of three IQs. Tawny Kitaen really needed money, and Coulier had to go to the basket for jokes. It was enough torture when I saw him imitating Popeye, and other cartoons started on Full House. This one guy who played all the jokes at all deserves to be at the end of class A. Coulier had to have money to please Alannis Morisette when they met.
