The film has a good start by presenting an interesting and strong Shannon Lee and presents two very nice side characters in the first half. But then something happens and suddenly Shannon turns into a simple bad girl, and the movie gets lost in its own context. In the second half there is a lack of charisma and it is full of stereotypes, bad acting, terrible plot and even worse stunt coordination. Not to mention the horrible actors they chose for the Chechen mafia gang. <br /> <br /> "Game of Death 2" was angry and upset by Bruce, but his daughter is at the top, which makes her even more embarrassed than double, then played Bruce Lee. I really believe that it can do much better than now and I hope it will participate in better production next time. <br /> <br /> If you're a real hard core fan and you do not care about quality, keep going and see this movie. Personally, I could not wait, but I was very disappointed.
