This rapid pace of this film discourages us from any shocks it can provide. There was no real tension. Most of the characters were bland. Chesty Irish priest was as bad as interest in love. Interest misleads. The girl they chose to ensure the sensuality of the film may be better. The central conflict of the main character was unchangeable. This movie is completely devoid of positives. It's like a boring exercise for someone who did not want to go to the gym that day, but anyway.
