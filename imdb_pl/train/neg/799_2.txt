In a sense, the concept of the story was rather an interesting mix of several typical types of films in an interesting combination. However, no point in the film was so obvious that it did not deserve long shots. I felt like I was defeated by the so-called mysterious explanation of a disease killing people. <br /> <br /> It seems that the writer simply picked up stereotypes from other films as a substitute for a customized writing line for the actual characters. The actors did not help. No chemistry. I think that they were to develop an attraction, if only because it is an essential element of these stories. However, the writers have not worked too hard to develop chemistry. Of course, both are attractive, but whether they are attractive to each other seems to be an open question. <br /> <br /> The certainty that Turner's character appears in Sabato, has evolved too quickly and for no particular reason. Sabato is supposed to be a discredited doctor who simply can not play according to the rules. Think about the character of Jeff Goldblum on "Independence Day". Usually, this character is supposed to show some talent or brilliance. Sabato's figure is not. He is Cassandra with crazy and all prophetic skills of the magic figure eight. There seems to be a chance chance. <br /> <br /> Death scenes are comical. Every actor really tried more than a little to demonstrate their agony. The symptoms looked like a bad claymation, a kind of video from the 1980s, Peter Gabriel, I think.
