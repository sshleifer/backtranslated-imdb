The film is about a young man, Michael, who cares about the elders. One day he decides to kill some relatives of his clients. At about the same time, he decides to model his killing after the 1960s Zodiac Killer. He makes contact with the author of the book about Zodiac Killer and creates friendship. Michael has a gun (apparently the only gun, because it seems to be in the hands of other actors, but is not presented as the same gun). Original. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie if you like B movies. I thought the idea of ​​the movie was good, but the editing and acting really drowned the storyline. I thought "blood" is just too false, in some places the lighting is awful and the dialog box is too standard. The film was shot on video, which is okay, but the movie has just been prepared for the strange scenes "Plan 9". This is not a bad movie for fans of the B genre, but if you want something more Polish, go to something else.
