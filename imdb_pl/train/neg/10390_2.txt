I just rented and watched the movie just to see what it's all about. Here are my reactions to this. It's easy to see that it's a low budget movie with poor actors. The main topic of this film is a woman revenge on rapists. This concept, if done correctly, can easily turn out to be a truly provocative movie. However, the film does not shock or disturb me at all. It just bored me. This video can be easily reduced to under 45 minutes. All scenes are mainly to fill in time, as scenes of scenery and some scenes described below. <br /> <br /> ************ Includes a spoiler ***** ******* I believe that rape scenes are quite tame. I do not know if I saw a cut or uncut version if it really exists. I also found many holes in the plot of the already badly written plot. Here is a list of my thoughts. <br /> <br /> Why the rapists will not rape Jennifer the night she left the house to find out what the noise is. That would be a great time. <br /> <br /> Why they just do not rape her, instead of delaying some of the rapists' pleasure and extending Jennifer's passion for such a long time. It would probably be more shocking and disturbing in this way. <br /> <br /> I think it's really stupid that the rapists left her in the woods and returned home. Perhaps to show that these rapists are really imbeciles. <br /> <br /> These rapists should at least know that if you want to do a dirty job, you should not send a cowardly imbecile to do his job. /> <br /> Why did not Jennifer call the police when the rapists finally left? What should be the first thing that appears in the mind of most people, especially for someone who is a writer. <br /> <br /> Why did these rapists not feel a dangerous distance when they saw that Jennifer was alive? <br /> <br /> I find it amazing that a slim lady, like Camille, can pull a man out of a tree and hang it. ************************ Ends spoiler ************ <br /> <br /> But hey, it's the movie is not without merit, Camille Keaton is wonderful and I hear one of the funniest lines I heard last time when Matthew protests about returning home and kills Jennifer, "Why me? Why me, not even me!
