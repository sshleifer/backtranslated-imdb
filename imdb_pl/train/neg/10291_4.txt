80 minutes and I felt twice as long! A short passage is not short enough. Indeed, the first 50 minutes consist almost exclusively of a dialogue (really a monologue) of a woman approaching middle age, boringly "men", disappointment, sex, aging and the recent breakup of a French teenager she met in the canteen on the ship. <br /> <br /> A tedious monologue continues when they go to the duty-free shop and to the bar, where finally its self-proclaimed rim repels him. "History" can not end here, of course, so he convinces him to listen to her drone more when he brings him to his cabin. <br /> <br /> What kind of romance, sex or whatever it is, whatever this movie has besides bitter rituals, is not enough to justify the price of rent, unless you're one of those who love dramas where nothing interesting It's not happening. Yes, the ending is very nicely done, but the modest reward is to submit to what is transformed into a virtual therapy session with a narcissistic groan. <br /> <br /> Of course, some people like it. I might be wrong.
