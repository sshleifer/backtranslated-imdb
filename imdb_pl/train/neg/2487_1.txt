Take "Rambo", mix in "Miami Vice", cut the budget around 80% and you have something that a few ten-year-old boys can come up with if they have a large enough garden and too much access to the "Penthouse". A police officer and a former McBain commando (Busey, named McBain, you know it's as tough as it appeared) is being recruited to recover an American supertank that has been stolen and hidden in Mexico. Captured with the tank were hard Sgt. Major O'Rourke (Jones) and former lover McBain Devon (Fluegel), an officer commanding and now meat for depraved terrorists / spies / drug dealers who have no sense of propriety, blah, blah, blah. There is a lack of action and little sex in the action film with sex corrupted. A joke about the fact that McBain is shot all the time and survives, keeping the balls as souvenirs. Apparently, the writers did not see the "Great Seven" ("Man is the one who gave this face to us"), nor did he think to give McBain even the appearance of intelligence. Even in the case of budgetary activities, production values ​​are weak, with distant shots during dialogue and very little traffic. The main support, the tank, is stupid enough for Ed Wood. Fluegel, who could have been blonde Julia Roberts (she had a much bigger role in "Crime Story" than Julia!), Must go from simplicity to scared to kick butt again and again immediately. Jones, who is in an amazing range of movies, almost hits here. Both he and Busey probably came out with some easy money and a few laughs. Look for the talented, future character actor Danny Trejo ("Heat", "Once Upon a Time in Mexico") in a stereotypical, dangerous part. "Bulletproof" is too boring even for pleasure because of guilt, but it's still loud enough to play when you leave the house, but you want people to think that there is someone at home.
