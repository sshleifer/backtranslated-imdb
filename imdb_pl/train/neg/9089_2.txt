The film has only one disadvantage, unfortunately this defect destroys the entire credibility of the song. <br /> <br /> It starts with the condemnation of the Israeli occupation of the disputed territories. It does not refer to the reason for the Israelis there. Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Jordan attacked Israel. That is why Israel "occupies" its land, because these countries lost it in the war they had begun. <br /> <br /> The film also claims that Israel has opposed the UN, failing to comply with resolution 242. The problem is that 242 was rejected immediately after its inception by the ... Palestinians, making it invalid. <br /> <br /> Many movies are well-matched and can really show footage that changes your mind, but remember, watching something, do not believe what you hear and only half of what you see. <br /> <br /> All the participants in this film are famous critics of Israel, and some have made many anti-Semitic public comments, removing all possible credibility of their words. <br /> <br /> All participants urgently need a real history lesson taught objectively, and not by any Palestinian sympathizer.
