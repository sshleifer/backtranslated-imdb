I watched the movie at three o'clock in the morning, the day I'm usually very open when it comes to movies. But I still think it was not good, this movie was not good at all. Reasons why there are many of them. <br /> <br /> Acting is not that good, and each time the situations that appear in it remind me of Chevy's comedy from the 90s. I mean, how the situation in handcuffs and the poker situation among the servants ... This movie was so clearly based on the first one and that's OK. But if I did not see the first before I saw it, it would be even worse. Like the ending, it happened very suddenly and I felt that I had no closure, what ever ... Sebastian changed very suddenly, and this movie seems to be created only to explain No. 1 and how no time or effort is used to doing anything good. The result is the same as in the first and was not at all a movie ... <br /> <br /> They should have dealt with situations with more style and class, but they did not have and that's why this movie turned out to be bad ...
