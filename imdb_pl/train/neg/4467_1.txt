<br /> <br /> I am not sure who decides to which category the film fits, but this movie is NOT a horror film. When it comes to history, it was quite interesting, but rather slow. However, I was particularly disappointed with the ending. <br /> <br /> ** spoiler ** <br /> <br /> Tell me why he is running to his uncle's home on Earth? first detective or police? He knows exactly what is happening at the moment, and also has a video tape as evidence. Instead, he runs there and starts going crazy, saying: "I know everything, I have proof! You did not expect proof, right? "Then she behaves in astonishment when her uncle gets up and begins to approach her, as if to hurt her. Well, DUH! Of course he's going to harm you, you just told him that you know everything and have proof to reveal everything. What a stupid ending.
