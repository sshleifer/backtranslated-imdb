I am 17 years old and I still like most Scooby Doo movies and old episodes. I love movies from the 90s, and recently we've been treated to one of the better shows from Scooby Doo's decade, Scooby Doo and Goblin King, which I did not expect to be as good as it was. In any case, come back to get a clue! I watched some episodes, expecting something very good, but from what I saw, I was not impressed. First of all, I hated animation. It was a flat, empty and very Saturday morning - a cartoon standard, easily the worst aspect of the series. Even some of the programs that I really hate have had a slightly better animation. To make matters worse, Shaggy and Scooby looked like a stranger, and I really missed Fred, Velma and Daphne because they added a lot to the old episodes when Scooby Doo was positive. I also hated character changes, because it seemed that instead of solving secrets, Shaggy and Scooby were now playing a superhero, what they would never do in movies or in Scooby-Doo. Where are you? show. The song was not very good, I do not even remember it, and the jokes were bad and fancy. Although I admit that there is a very talented voice, if they had better material and were not told to sound so different than the original voices, as much as possible, what they did, I can add. In conclusion, I personally thought it was awful, and I'm not trying to discredit it, that's what I personally feel. 1/10 Bethany Cox
