A pitiful attempt to use science to justify religion / philosophy of a new century. These two things have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said about quantum physics in this mess is simply wrong. <br /> <br /> Examples? Quantum theory supports ideas in Eastern religions that reality is an illusion. How? Well, in the subatomic world, you can never definitely predict the location of particles at a given time. The chances that it will be exactly one place, you can give only once. In addition, the observation seems to affect the event. Solid particles can pass through barriers. All this is accurate so far. But then they say it means that if you've sincerely believed you can go through the wall, you can really do it. This is a complete poppycock. Instead, the theory ensures that you can go through the wall at our level, but this is only a coincidence and has nothing to do with faith. You would also have to go to the wall so that eternity would have even the slightest chance of passing through the wall. Chances are so astronomical. <br /> <br /> This is just one example of how to misrepresent science. But the more annoying is the narrative with the unhappy photographer Marlee Maitlan plays. About halfway through the picture, he becomes so confused that he is incomprehensible. Something to do with negative thoughts that lead to addiction and self-hatred. There may be some truth in it, but quantum physics has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> Plus, string theory is currently a hot novelty in physics. Instead of wasting time on this thrill, I suggest to hire The Elegant Universe, an amazing series made for NOVA on PBS, which gives the history of physics from Newton and gravity to Ed Witten and M Theory in just 3 hours episodes. Quantum mechanics is explained there quite well if you want to know it without metaphysical fog.
