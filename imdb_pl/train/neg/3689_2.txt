The main aspect of Superstar films at its later stages was the frequency, the gap between one movie and the next. Being the established star of the Southern Indian cinema, the feedback he received from Baba was great. <br /> <br /> From Nattukku Oru Nallavan (1991), the number of films that Tamil played as a mass hero in 11 years was only 11 exactly at the rate of 1 per year. All this was a huge hit. He had a picture that many thoughts could not easily be liquidated. <br /> <br /> But after Padayappie (1999) he went into hibernation. His fans all over the world, especially in South India, were ready to watch all kinds of movies with their superstar in action. Thus, the Tamil cinema industry decided to come with Baba. <br /> <br /> The creators of the film thought that the fans would take everything they showed in Superstar. But that clearly did not work out in this movie. As usual, the hype of the media and fans' expectations were far beyond the borders. <br /> <br /> Rajinikanth's image has been completely damaged. The fans went crazy. The film collection has not reached the expected level. The reputation of great people has fallen. <br /> <br /> The only positive aspect of this film were A. R. Rehman's songs. Rehman is known for composing good music for the worst films, such as Tajmahal, Kadal Virus, Alli Arjuna, Paarthale Paravasam, Star, En Swasa Katre, Vandicholai Chinnarasu, etc. I never thought that this movie would join this league. > <br /> You feel very depressed, not because the movie was bad, it's because the image of the superstar falls. It took him five full years to regain it entirely thanks to two films: Chandramukhi and Sivaji and giving fans what they are really looking for in a superstar movie.
