It would help to know why it took so long to adapt the book as ready for the film as "The House Next Door" for a movie or TV. The book was copyrighted in 1978. One of the reasons may be problems with "home" design. The house in this Lifetime movie is so ugly that I can not imagine anyone buying it. In fact, it is so ugly that someone would probably come and destroy it when it was built. <br /> <br /> I'm not crazy about horror books, but this one was hard to bear when I came about ten years ago. The main characters are not people who are looking for something occult in life, and this is one of the strengths of the book. They are not people who would say that the architect was some kind of demon ... (or the devil's personification) without being a witness and analyzing events so well described in the book. However, this is mostly a downbeat book and I do not think it appeals to people who run Lifetime. Maybe someone will come up with a different version of the book in the coming years. Better home ... better music ... better scenario and darker lighting ... it would definitely help.
