A friend and I went through the (many) years ago choosing the worst horrors in the video store for evening entertainment. For some reason I bought this one (probably v. V. Cheap). <br /> <br /> A cheap synth soundtrack is a classic of time and genre. There are also some very funny scenes. Among them is the scene in which the man is attacked and defends himself with a few unbelievable objects, which then made me laugh (I do not think it's too funny in retrospection, but it's there). <br /> <br /> Besides, it's complete nonsense, remember. But it's probably worth a look if you like movies like "Chopping Mall". Yes, I saw it too.
