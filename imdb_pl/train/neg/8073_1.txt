If the writer / director reads this (and I imagine you are, because you can not work now), then I have to tell you - I saw bad movies in those days, but this one has the distinction of having the worst assumption I ever heard. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS - Nothing happens! <br /> <br /> Total waste of time. At the end I laughed loudly. <br /> <br /> SIDE NOTE - (if the whole movie was in a coma, does the scene in which he sleeps with this guy mean that someone raped her when she was knocked out?) <br /> < br /> Total rubbish.
