I just finished watching American Pie: Beta House and I have to say it was such a junk pile of nonsense. The first 3 American Pies were hilarious, the last 3 were a joke and should not be called American Pie. <br /> <br /> As you guessed from the movie, Beta House, it concerns a brotherhood, a first grader, a girl and the most original part of them falls in love. Of course, the guy who is dealing with the chicks is Stifler, who along with his buddies is trying to do another, seemingly impossible task. It was unrealistic and super fake. It is really predictable and the plot is so poor. Both sides of the fight in college to see who will get the whole thing (something like that) To sum up: terrible action + boring script + misuse of American Pie franchise = total waste of time! This movie is unbearable. I give him two in ten, although most of them sucked, there were a lot of nudity and beautiful girls, like 2 funny scenes :)
