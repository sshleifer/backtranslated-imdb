I did not see the original, but I just wanted to send a quick note to anyone who is just going down: Wicker Man is the worst movie I've seen this year. Maybe even in two years. I would like to be able to ask the theater for a refund or turn back time to warn myself not to see it. <br /> <br /> I give him two positive nods: the sarcasm of Cage's character is at least a little laugh from me and the scenery of the island was beautiful. I'm sorry, that's all. Taunts come. The plot of the film is driven only forward, because the other characters do not give Cage any simple answers - and he endures it !!! How it can last over an hour of my time (much less days in the movie) is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that the plot is full of holes. You leave the theater with enough unanswered questions to fill the library. How could anyone read this script and think, "Yes, people should pay $ 11 to see this shaded outline of what the movie should look like" is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Do not go see this movie. Or even rent on DVD.
