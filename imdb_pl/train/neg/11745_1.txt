The fact that I did not like music is a very personal opinion, and historical inaccuracies are not. I realize that this is an opera, not a document, but some important aspects are missing, especially if other people comment falsely about it. <br /> <br /> Abbu Abas was the brain of this operation, which was issued and reorganized due to a discovery on board the ship, in order to free 50 terrorists from Israeli prisons, one of whom was Samir Kuntar, a shameful terrorist whose story can be found by searching for "klinghoffer samir kuntar" in google. Abbu Abbas was responsible for many other terrorist operations, even if he never set foot on Achile Lauro. Ben Laden never set foot on airplanes that hit the WTC, right? <br /> <br /> *** possible spoilery *** <br /> <br /> The film almost justifies the actions and reactions of the terrorists because of the horrors that they could survive, always stressing and exaggerating how the Israelis have done them harm . However, they never show the harm that the Palestinians ever did to the Israelis. The film uses (quite horrible !!!) images from the horrors of Sabry and Chatila and nothing is said, not understanding the general belief that Israel was responsible, not to mention that the Syrian-Lesbian army carried out a massacre. <br /> <br /> Acting was generally very bad, but I think that you can expect from opera singers? <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I am shocked at how a man can justify a terrorist killing a hostage because a hostage tried to move 400 innocent hostages against armed terrorists and add that he should not be considered compassionate because he is a supporter of Zionism . Imagine how unpleasant his wife was, spitting on the terrorists who shot her husband and threw his body into the sea. I hope that nobody in the world is as cruel as her (blink)
