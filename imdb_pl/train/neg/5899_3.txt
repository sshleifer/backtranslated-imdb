By all those people who sat down at Miike and his work. I sat down in this movie today. I came to the conclusion that if it is half as good as the Ring, as I suspected from these comments, it will be worth my time. <br /> <br /> There is no happiness. <br /> <br /> Everything for finding the next great director (or writer), but I do not think Miike is the one. I do not have a fine arts degree from NYU, but I know a lot: the horror must have a pace. It must also give the viewer greater credulity than the film. <br /> <br /> The pace of this movie forced me to shake my head. Some of the scenes at the end stretched so much, I went to the fridge and stopped there while Kou Shibasaki stared at the camera for seemingly long minutes, eyes wide open and agape. The famous director once made a statement, and I paraphrase that the film can be done by turning the camera on a beautiful woman and letting him roll. Kou is not a good enough actress to do this job. She looks paralyzed at an undead girl on more scenes than I think. And not only she plays the deer in the headlights; other cast members apparently feel the need to imitate this inefficiency. The script gives them little space for too much time. <br /> <br /> I like Asian cinema. Hong Kong Action Cinema from the last 30 years, Korean horror, like "Phone" and "Koma", Ang Lee's work, some of the cheap but fun Filipino movies with free sex and fight, and more. Chakushin Ari, without which I could do without.
