This movie attracted me when I looked at the list of casts, but after seeing this I must admit that I felt a bit disappointed. The main problem with this movie is that actors are not able to keep the film on their backs. Why? Because of the bad scenario. Although Dillon, Lane and Jones try very hard to take this film to another level, there is no innovative story, and the direction is too ordinary. For fans of Matt Dillon, it is a movie that can be watched, just like for fans of beautiful Diane Lane. Legendary Tommy Lee Jones is always great, but this is not a movie for him; far below its level. So if this great cast falls into your hands, look at it, but do not expect anything big or extraordinary. The only thing you will remember about this movement are Diane Lane's scenes; the rest is very forgotten.
