The cover (depicting a man holding a terrible pellet gun) will make it a movie about martial arts. (Trudno.) <br /> <br /> I find it interesting that the real title of the film is Trojan Warrior. (Trojan is a brand of condoms in the US) This film is full of homoeroticism. If you like it, then this movie really is not so bad. However, consider the following: <br /> <br /> There are many close-ups of groins and actors' acts (all actors with erection bulge in trousers are in one scene). colors such as lime, peach and red. From the operator's point of view, this movie is a drag queen! In several scenes, the characters stand VERY close to each other, occasionally touching them when they talk. Also, the cousin of the hero likes women, and every other guy in the movie tries to kill him. Is there a message that filmmakers want to convey? <br /> <br /> Should I go to battle scenes? (Yes, somebody's private parts get caught in one battle.) The martial arts scenes are short and devoid of imagination. There are no fancy things here, just standard moves that can be seen in Chuck Norris' old movement. There is also a car chase scene that can be the first ever low-speed chase.
