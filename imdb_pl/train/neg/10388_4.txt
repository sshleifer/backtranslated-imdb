From reading all the comments posted here in IMDb, this movie seems to be very uneven, but I did not think THAT was so bad. I saw much worse, actually. <br /> <br /> "The house where the evil lives" is a story about the spirit of her husband and his wife, Ted and Laurie Fletcher, and their daughter Amy, who are moving to an old house in Japan. Little is known, the Japanese ninja brutally murdered his wife and her lover, and then he killed himself 100 years earlier with a samurai sword. As strange things happen at home, the ghosts of previous residents begin to have living bodies and plan to recreate the bloody murder that took place 100 years ago. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie and decided to give it a chance, the cover looked like a decent ghost story. It was routine and it was trivial, but I've seen worse in my time. The ghost sequences were a bit over-sized, we see transparent, blue-colored figures that randomly appear around the family and take over their bodies. To be honest, the ghosts in this movie reminded me of the ghosts of a haunted Disneyland mansion ride. I may be wrong, but after seeing it, it seemed to me that the Japanese horror movie "Ju-On: The Grudge" and the American remake of this movie were a bit torn. An old Japanese house where brutal murder took place, ghastly activity, curses at home, etc. But I can be wrong. <br /> <br /> In summary, this is a pretty trivial story about ghosts. Do not go out of your way to see it, but if you like it and it happens that it comes on TV, you can do it. 4/10.
