In 1941, Columbia was a full-fledged main studio and could produce a movie with the same Polish technology as MGM, Paramount or Warners. This is the best thing to say about "Adam Had Four Sons", a lead soap opera, in which the performances of Ingrid Bergman (for the first time in an American film) and Warner Baxter are almost nondescript. Bergman plays a Frenchman (it was an era in which Hollywood thought that one foreign accent was as good as another) employed as a governess for four of Baxter's sons and remained in place (with one break caused by stock market crashes in 1907) Until the boys are adult men serving in the First World War. Almost everyone in the movie is so good that it's a relief when Susan Hayward, when the wolf enters half in them? is the only person you can see in the movie, although it is clearly conveyed by Bette Davis and Vivien Leigh; is also the first of long alcoholic roles? but the script remains saccharin, and the ending is completely ridiculous. No wonder Bergman rejected the "Decision Valley" in a similar way four years later.
