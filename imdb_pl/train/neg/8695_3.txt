Elizabeth Rohm was the weakest actress in the entire Law and Order ADA, and her acting here is even worse. Her attempts to accent Texas are amateurish and unrealistic. It is also unable to properly recall the intense emotions needed to play the mother of a kidnapped child; sometimes, when her daughter is missing, she manages to sound a little annoyed, as if she did not remember where she left her keys. <br /> <br /> This is an important real story, so it is a pity that the terrible acting of the main actress distracts the message so much. The rest of the cast is talented enough, but it simply can not overcome Rohm's tendency to simply focus on the particularly thick mimicry of the southern stroke every time the right action is required.
