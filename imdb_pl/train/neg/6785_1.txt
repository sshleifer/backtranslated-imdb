> you are warned that it is a spoiler! > This movie is so bad that I doubt if I can write enough poems. great direction photos were well thought out. the actors were very good, especially Richard pryor, I would like to see him more. Madeline Kahn and john houseman were classic. Dudley More God bless him could do better. John Ritter, I'd like to see him again. In my opinion, this failure is entirely due to the writer's failure. Maybe the manufacturer could have pulled out the plug when he saw what he was creating. It is a pity that so much money went to this boiler, when with a small change here and there in my opinion it fixed it. They had to pay the writers standard rates. To produce one giggle.
