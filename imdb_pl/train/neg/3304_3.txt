Greenthumb Grace is penniless after her husband's death, so she turns to the growing ganja to pay the bills. Sounds promising, and Brenda Blethyn is not disappointing, but the material is thin as sitcom. There is a scene in which Grace asks her young gardener about "Give me one" (toke) and thinks he is asking for sex and is uncomfortable. Yes, it's humor, so the nun will be bored. Saving Grace does not seem to know what she wants to be: stunning images and dignified pace recall memories of Daughter Ryan, while the carefree caprices of the rural people can be abolished from every episode of Antiques Roadshow. It speeds up after the first hour, but by then it's too complicated to worry about. The climax seems to be unpredictable only by introducing the most shameless Deux ex Machina I have ever seen.
