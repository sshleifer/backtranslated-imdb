I am a huge fan of the movie from the 1930s and I will watch most of everything I see in Turner Classic Movies, which is new to me. I gave it a chance, because it was big Harold Lloyd who competed with Chaplin as a great comedian of a silent movie. I watched much less Lloyd's movies than Chaplins, but I must say that I am a much larger fan of Chaplin. Anyway, this movie was so flat to me that I did not finish it. I can understand why his sound career was so limited that he did not have much material for work. After watching Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, The Three Stooges, Martina and Lewis, The Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy do boxing parodies (or violence in general), this one is very much forgotten. I was also interested in watching Adolphe Menjou, because I really liked him in Paths Of Glory, but his role here also did not do anything special for me. Maybe they should get into the pits earlier, because at least half of the movie (at least it seemed) is before entering the ring. I can say that there are many Lloyd fans here and it will not be a popular review, but I have to rate it compared to what was there at the time, 4 out of 10. Do not watch it with anyone trying to like old movies, because they can no longer watching the next movie, very flat. As an alternative to anyone who really liked it or looking for a little-known comedy, I recommend "Kelly The Second", made a few years earlier, another that does not become a boxing comedy with Patsy Kelly and in the supporting role of Charles Chase. Both were shown on the Turner Classic Movies channel.
