It's a very bad movie. But not as bad as his reputation suggests. Production values ​​are not too bad and there is a strange scene. And it has oxidized veneer from the 80's, which means it is always fun. Also watch out for the short look of Jimmy Nail - his attempt of the American accent is so amazing that it is fantastic. Sybil Danning's breasts are also fantastic - they appear shortly in the film, but the scene is repeated several times in the final subtitles in what can be described as a remix of 12-inch Sybil Danning tit. As a horror it is not terrifying, the effects are stupid, and Christopher Lee appears during a sleepwalking dream, thinking that he was buying a new home and needed some money for a deposit. woman - they were so insignificant that I forgot almost everything about them and just watched the movie tonight. Werewolves are noticeably less impressive than in the original movie, in fact, strangely, sometimes they look more like badly burned monkeys. The European setting is quite good, and the music provided by the new wave band Babel, though it is awful, at least gives the film some cheese. <br /> <br /> In general, good for laughter. Do you seriou sincerely expect it to be so? At least you always have Sybil knockers.
