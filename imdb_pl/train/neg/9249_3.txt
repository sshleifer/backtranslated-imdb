When watching a movie, I'm not sure what way to take it. There is a reason why a writer should not run his work, or even act in it, you can not do everything. I felt that history really suffered in this film, because the director had so many hats on. Mrs. McTeer is a movie. To add her amazing talents, her portrait of this woman was the reason for my commitment. Here's a British actress who can do anything. In my opinion, conflict is what makes a drama and great story. I felt that this movie does not exist. For the heroes, everything was a bit easy, there were no obstacles preventing the chahracers from getting what they wanted. Watch the movie for sweetness, but most of all for the brilliant performance of Mrs. McTeer.
