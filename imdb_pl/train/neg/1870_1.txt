I've always loved this bill because of its great script and characters, but lately I feel like it has become an emotional kind of soap. If you look at the bill's promotional pictures / posters, you'll see that two officers are hugging / kissing or having something to do with friendship, while promotional photos of the bill would show something to do with crime a long time ago. It proves that it has changed a lot, from being an absolutely amazing police drama to regular television soap. When I watch this, I feel that I am watching the police version of Coronation Street or something similar. I must say that I still like the bill, because I'm interested in working in the police and things like that, but I really miss the magnificence Bill had. I want to rate it as 2 out of 10, because I must admit that it was completely ruined by people who took over the bill. <br /> <br /> As for the script and characters that both of them came down, most of the great characters are gone (though some still remain), and I'm not saying that the newer characters are poor or whatever, because they definitely are not, after they just lack the difficult looks, personality and script lines that all the old characters once had, because most of the new ones are now associated with stupid relationships and family problems. <br /> <br /> In general, is one of the only police programs on TV, The Bill will always be an interesting thing to watch, but as I say, it lost a lot of its uniqueness (if it is the right spelling) and now it would be classified as horrible, unreal TV soap. It is recommended to observe good laughter due to the stupidity of the involved police officers - 2/10
