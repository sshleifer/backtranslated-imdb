What was the deal with clothes? Everyone was dressed like something from the late 70's and 80's. The cars were even outdated. The school was outdated. The nun's costume was outdated, and the hospital looked like something from the 1940s, with its covers and wooden stairs and things. Nothing in the whole film suggested that it was in 1991. My mother laughed, saying "Geeeee-od! WHEN WAS this movie MADE? "When we pressed" INFO BUTTON "on our remote, we were sure that 1991 had to be a typo! Has anyone noticed this? My FAVORITE part was, however, when the woman tells her small husband on the phone, about a mirror in the mirror, and he just says, "Listen, I have a congress meeting. I'll talk to you later. This line was just classic. JUST HOW MAN! The favorite part of my mother was that they gave the "Spawn of the Devil Child" of their own Rottweiler. My mother said, "Just what the Devil's man needs ... Rottweiler." She also liked all the people who collapsed in the churches, holding their breasts. Her other favorite part was a guy in a school car park, driving 5 miles an hour, going straight to a garbage truck / dump truck / front loader. He had about 20 seconds to stop the car ... but he just kept going, with a real stupid blank expression on his face. I mean, how fast can you go to the school parking lot?!?! Anything!
