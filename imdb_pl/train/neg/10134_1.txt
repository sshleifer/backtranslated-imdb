Steven Seagal's films have never been Oskar's material, but with each subsequent release they are getting worse. <br /> <br /> This begins when Seagal is picked up by the FBI because he killed several people "in self defense", he is an active army so he is saved from prison to save a stolen Stealth plane that will be used by the evil one, the evil English villain that Hollywood obsessively covers, also these days. <br /> <br /> Just to say that the movie is a horrible dialogue that almost always comes with lots of cheese and a lack of acting talent. The story is not interesting and there are fragments that absolutely do not make sense and add nothing to the story, the heroes of the movie as a whole, such as the "lesbian" interaction between the two main female casts, which is purely a title to get viewers, and nevertheless, it is not even confusing because it makes no sense why it happened when there was no need. <br /> <br /> In short, a scary script with a bad dialog, delivered by sub-par actors, boring and sometimes bad choreographic action scenes, and irrelevant parts that only serve to achieve almost impossible and even worse shoot. <br /> <br /> Save 98 minutes of your life and give this longing, even if you are the most passionate Seagal fan.
