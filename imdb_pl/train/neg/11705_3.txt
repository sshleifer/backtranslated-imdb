This stuffy melodrama is quite a difficult movie with Ingrid Bergman, which I saw. Even her luminous screen can not save this immensely slow and meandering movie that is almost impossible to pass without fast forward. <br /> <br /> Only for die-hard Bergman fans; others will probably fall asleep. I suggest to watch "For Whom the Bell Tolls" instead.
