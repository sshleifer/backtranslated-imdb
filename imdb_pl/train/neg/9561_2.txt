As many others have commented on here before, I must say that this movie is bad, but not the worst I've seen. In this comment, there will be no direct references to movie threads or sequences, because I hate spoilers. <br /> <br /> I felt that I was watching a TV show episode or something like that, in which they got an extra $ $ to spend on CGI (I've seen worse) ... All in all, it's quite an insult to the viewer, at least if you have any knowledge about computers and / or technology in general. There are too many such moments of insults to feel comfortable, and I began to beg for everything to end - quickly - in the middle. In addition, there are innumerable "easy-going" scenarios that are also an insult to your intelligence as a thinking man ... <br /> <br /> This movie is completely out of comparison with the old "Wargames", and I think it's a damn shame, that they even called it a sequel. <br /> <br /> Two stars from me, because of one thing and only one thing: the performances of the actors are not half bad, given the abandoned shit of the script they had to work with. Still, they should never have signed up for the movie. It's not really a career, but I think we all have bills to pay. <br /> <br /> Those of you who gave the best result in the movie ... you have to be on the payroll of college or something, this is my only explanation. <br /> <br /> To all those who have not seen it: just look at it and think about it just in case. But lower your expectations to the floor (and then a little).
