This is only the second time I've stopped film / DVD in the middle. <br /> <br /> At first I wanted to give this film the benefit of doubts, despite the fact that he managed to be both shallow, stereotypical and stupid .. And helpless, plodding and pretentious. <br /> <br /> It was like Special School after this bizarre nine who thinks nobody understands him ... terrifying and sad, with a narration that only the smartest youth would consider poetry ... and some singing , and ... no, really, the suffering of a poor child ... <br /> <br /> It's enough, especially when it turned into an insolent, clumsy and offensive Orange ripoff. And did I mention singing? <br /> <br /> It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely the one I felt the least. I do not recommend it to anyone.
