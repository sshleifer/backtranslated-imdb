Of course, to show the famous strippers Misty Ayers from the 1950s. It is a pity that it can not work. <br /> <br /> A boring story about sweet, innocent Sally Down (Ayers), who is drugged and forced into white slavery (prostitution). Then he meets nice Tommy Cole, who falls in love with her instantly. I want to help her escape, but maybe? I really do not care. <br /> <br /> There is no real skin - Ayers just relaxes SLOWLY to his underwear (twice). The rest is just a boring little story about bad acting, a horrible "comedy" (it was never thought that prostitution is fun, but what do I know?) And a horrible dialogue after dubbing. I admit that there was a phrase at the end that I did not see, but that's not enough to survive. Ayers' rehearsals in acting are also hysterical! A real bomb. Avoid.
