Let's see, here are the "main attractions" of The Brain Machine: 15 establishing photos of the pool and house; 15 photos showing an unspecified office building; 5 deductions by a neuter technician; 7 close-ups of a dangerous guard; and a countless amount of technical gibberish to show us that this is a technologically advanced experiment. <br /> <br /> Various posters commented on the discrepancy between the copyright date from 1972 and the release date on the DVD box from 1977. This is easy to explain. This dog just sat on the shelf unreleased for five years, until someone dusted it, thinking that it perfectly suited the mood of distrust of the government after Watergate. After I saw The Brain Machine now, my only miracle is that it was spent!
