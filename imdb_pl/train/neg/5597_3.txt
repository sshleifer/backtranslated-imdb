I will say that at least the movie makes sense, but it is bad. Acting is not good at all (I think only Sky showed a promise) and you feel awkward watching it. All scenes that should be meaningful are really shallow, like when Ng goes to his parents. There are many trivial details, such as the kanji tattoo on the shoulder of Heaven, the magnets on the girls' fridge and the awful design on the set ... and music ... and clothes ... and everything. Real life has never been like this movie. The boy says at some point: "I'm gay, not banal." And unconscious. Even the comment is horrible. I turned it off after Ng talks about how funny she was playing lesbian.
