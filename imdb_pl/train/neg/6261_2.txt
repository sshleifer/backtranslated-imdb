The couple moves to their dream house, unaware that with their neighbors it was built on a site formerly used as a cemetery. It is said that the film was based on a true story, although it is not known how much of it is to be true. The plot is not unique - see Spielberg's Poltergeist (1982). In a short time they experience different supernatural phenomena: from disturbing - mysterious shadows, through serious illness of the daughter - to be honestly ridiculous - the toilets are constantly rinsed off and out of control garage door. The story is not deep enough: after establishing that the land was used as a cemetery, we do not learn anything more. It seems that the plot is not developing. The heroes are not particularly well drawn or in any way memorable, and the atmosphere is not particularly unique. The movie can be disturbing for some viewers. There is no point in catharsis or any positive message in this.
