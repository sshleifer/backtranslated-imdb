I would like to give this film a zero. Trashy effects and action. The only reason to see this movie is that you can see how bad it is. Let's start with the kid who plays Brian. What a maniac! I could not believe in the mullet! Then he spoke to himself. I guess they could not just be silent, but still. Of course, they also had to have him lean, not something I wanted to see. But Jared gave a great performance compared to the special effects department. Everything from a bear to a catastrophe was something that I could do myself and better. I really doubt Gary Paulsen had anything to do with the production because the movie was not even called Hatchet. Finally, I do not think the writer ever read the book because nothing was the same. I think the book was great, but this movie stinks like a stinky goat!
