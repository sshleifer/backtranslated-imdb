Yesterday evening I saw Brigadoon on television (September 12, 2009). I'm 61 years old and I watch movies for as long as I can remember. I can honestly say that Brigadoon is a lonely and by far the worst movie I have ever seen. The accents were disgraceful. A local children's club would create better sets. The figures were so wooden that they probably got infected with a dry rot from the tears of patrons who had the misfortune to see them. It is to be hoped that the stars of this film had thick enough skin to protect them from the embarrassment they had to face seeing this movie. The owners of this flute should perform a great service for humanity and destroy all copies of this film.
