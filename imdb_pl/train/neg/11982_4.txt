In 1925, childhood friends Marie Dressler (as Maggie Warren) and Polly Moran (as Lizzie Praskins) supervise the marriage of their children, Anita Page (as Helen) and Norman Foster (as John). Before Christmas, Mrs. Dressler changes the reign of her little town to her son, Mr. Foster. Six years later, the big crisis brings many bank closures and financial uncertainty. Banker Foster is able to survive thanks to the wise planning of Dressler's mother. But Mrs. Moran is worried about her fortune and demands loud withdrawal. Other clients of Warren Bank hear Moran's wrath and begin to question their solvency. Soon, the family is in a financial crisis. <br /> <br /> The huge critical and financial hit of Dressler's "Emma" was released at the beginning of the year, and MGM had to want to get a new Dressler movie as soon as possible. Dressler's hits from 1931 "Reduction" and "Politics" still earned a lot of money; and, Dressler became US Office 1 Star 1932, according to the industry standards list developed by Quigley Publications. "Prosperity" certainly celebrated Dressler's status, but the production seems unusually messy and hurried. The staff does well considering. Some care in the direction and assembly, and some repetitions, would help? evidently they needed him in cinemas for the holidays. <br /> <br /> **** Prosperity (11/12/32) Sam Wood ~ Marie Dressler, Polly Moran, Anita Page, Norman Foster
