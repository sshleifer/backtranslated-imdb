This God-forsaken movie is about three stupid millionaires who gather a group of people to play a deadly game, and the winner gets a million dollars. First of all, acting is terrible, and the film does not make any sense. It is not scary at all, it is so stupid that it made me laugh, that's why he earned this 1 star. The film is not at all violent, but it is quite miserable and focuses mainly on women's breasts, and some characters are very annoying and cranky. Plus, the monsters in this movie are so tacky and fake and not scary that they make you want to throw something on the screen. Last but not least is the ending. I do not want to give it away in case you're strange enough to see this piece of rubbish. AVOID ALL COSTS !!!!! <br /> <br /> Not rated (but it should be R) for nudity, profanity and gentle Gore.
