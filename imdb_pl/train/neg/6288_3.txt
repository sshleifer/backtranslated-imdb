After reading a lot of comments here, I'm surprised that no one recognized it as a basically too long remake of the Twilight Zone episode from 1960, titled "Mirror Image", starring Very Miles. Rod Serling made the terrible story much better in 24 minutes than Sean Ellis in 88 minutes with this tedious nap. A short song can be effective with a mysterious and unexplained ending, but in a feature film should be a bit more content, and history should make sense. Unfortunately, substance and meaning are two things that are missing in "Broken". Yes, it has a few moments, but it is not enough to justify your time. Another observations: although it is clearly a contemporary story, no character in the movie has a mobile phone! And although the car accident is the event that triggers this story, there is never a reference to the insurance company, to the person who ran the other car, or to the police who would be required to make a report. My advice: skip this boredom and watch the original instead!
