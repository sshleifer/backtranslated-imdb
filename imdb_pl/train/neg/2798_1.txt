This movie is bad. If you think about watching it, there is only one decent scene in the film that lasts about 5 seconds (topless scene by Amanda Carraway). The rest of the movie is awful. I think high schools are probably playing better. The plot does not make any sense at all. The set was pretty bad and it was not even good to laugh. It was just boring and very bad! I watched it on Starz, so I thought it must be at least decent. The mini description sounded like it was fine. The girl kills herself seemingly for no reason at the beginning of the movie, after you have to watch some horrible music video. The transitions between scenes are VERY violent and as if someone put a lot of clips into the movie without even thinking about how to move them. It simply cuts from one stage to another without smoothness. Something like my random switching from talking about how bad the movie is to explaining why the plot sucks. The sound weakens in some moments, where it can barely be heard, and then loudly with gay "screams of horror" cast in random places in the film. This is the same sound every time. This is officially the worst movie I've ever seen. Acting: 0/10 Effects: 1/10 Story: 0/10 Music: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Lame-meter: 1,000 .000 / 10
