I saw this movie in my time when having an illegitimate child not only ruined your life, but also conquered your child as a bastard. Nowadays, "lonely mothers" that may seem very far-fetched, but it was very true. And I'm not crazy about laughing at someone who stutters. Between these two problems I had difficulty finding this funny movie. At that time I did not know who directed it, or what a great reputation it had. I knew who Betty Hutton was, and she only upset me because she was so crazy. I loved "Bringing Up Baby", but I find this movie embarrassing. I'm sure that hitting some of the church's functions probably has been tightened, but I needed a drink after seeing it again. The idea that the girl will have to be drunk to get married and get pregnant just contributed to the unhappiness. Under these circumstances, the whole city can turn on you, so the result of the movie is really funny. Of course, shoot me, I do not like "It's a Wonderful Life."
