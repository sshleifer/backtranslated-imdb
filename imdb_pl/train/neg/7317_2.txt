After reading the other comments for this video, I would like to share my opinion that this is one difficult movie to watch, unless you are a complete Brooksophile. I'm not. <br /> <br /> Looking at the purely objective observer, the film is an unbalanced narrative that presents us with more unfathomable neuroses than they are able to absorb into one sitting. It is quite difficult to watch. Brooks's character (Robert Cole) is so unpleasant and unpleasant that it is difficult for him to connect with him - not to mention his rooting in him, when he stumbles from one dysfunctional self-absorbed situation to the next. I NEVER should make a topless scene and expect serious treatment in a romantic context. No man can have leaves so exposed and should turn on the child, like Kathryn Harrold - unless of course he is Albert Brooks in production controlled by Albert Brooks. <br /> <br /> "Modern Romance" has its fun moments ----- but they are fragmentary and rare. More often than not, I felt like I was in a closed journey with a completely disliked man and regretted that it would not end. This confirms problems that may arise when too much control over the film is placed in only one person - someone who has no self-discipline to be able to withdraw and see what is clearly happening. <br /> <br /> As most people probably know, James L. Brooks, who played the director in this film, is actually what he introduced. Six years later he cast Albert Brooks in a very successful "Broadcast News". James showed us how Albert can shape a credible and funny comic performance. Albert let us see James (usually not cast as an actor) who is doing a rare comic strip in a surprisingly effective way. <br /> <br /> Fans of "Modern Romance" will go to the next praiseworthy commentary about it. I say to you ----- there is enough pain in the world without having to find it in a movie intended as entertainment.
