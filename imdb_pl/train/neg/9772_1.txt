Just too many cases of violence. <br /> <br /> The film goes from one scene to another, and almost every violent outbreak. <br /> <br /> Now I am not the one who is shocked by violence, and for me a movie without a fight has something missing. But please, not one by one. My reaction was not shocking or frightening, it was: "We're going again." Between the scenes of violence there is some semblance of the story, but two thirds of the way through the movie, which I completely turned off, and I could not wait until the end. <br /> <br /> If this is the best the filmmakers can do, they should find something else to do in their pathetic life, such as making shoes or delivering mail.
