It's a terrible movie. Two young women with dementia seduce and torture a middle-aged man. There is not much to give away in relation to the plot or "spoiler". I would just like to comment that the ending is almost the most preposterous part of the movie. A significant part of the film is associated with Locke and Camp, who giggle unbearably, all the while smiling mentally at the camera. Add to this a soundtrack that repeats itself repeatedly, including a vaudeville song about "dear old father", which suggests an incestuous quality that the viewer never sees. At the beginning the music is annoying and then subject the viewer to torture worse than on the screen. The leitmotif is the youthful run of amok, understood as a reaction to the 1960s, but made with little imagination and style. Avoid this!
