It is a pity that people call kamal hassan "ulaganaayakan", maybe I'm gonna slay tollywood for them! comeon guys .. this movie is a thriller without emotions ... <br /> <br /> get out of your sobriety and just watch high-class thrillers like The Usage Suspects or The Silence of the Lambs. <br /> <br /> technically good, but the style above the kamal substance does not look like a policeman, there are no emotions dragging and boring to the end you can save 3 precious hours of your life if you do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Kamal at its best is the best in tollywood
