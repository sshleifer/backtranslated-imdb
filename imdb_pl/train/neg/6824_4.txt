After watching Koyaanisqatsi two or three dozen times and loving each second, I finally had the opportunity to see his sequel Life In Transformation. I was really disappointed because it did not meet the high standards of the first one. 90 minutes of people with baskets on the head is not my idea for a good movie. Philip Glass's result had neither beauty nor correlated first strength. Compared to Koyaanisqatsi, this film seemed slow and pointless. Diluted version of Baraki, which is the same idea, but it is better. I sincerely hope that the third film in this series will not follow the example of this waste.
