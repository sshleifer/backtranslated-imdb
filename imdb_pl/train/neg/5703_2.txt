For a while, Disney creates one of those movies that surprises everyone. One that makes you wonder until the very end. According to the tradition of the Pirates of the Caribbean, this movie will certainly turn into a ghost and kill and rape your village. This is horrible. If you want a mindless, senseless, predictable action movie, go ahead. I believe that young children can enjoy it, as they like it, when they win ALWAYS ALWAYS. But I like movies in which it is throwing who will win. This movie never allows Bad Guys to have an advantage. At the end, when the characters stay in the "inevitable" bottom, you just KNOW they can get out. Everything works perfectly for Cage and his friends, he never has to think about a puzzle or clue for more than 10 seconds, no matter how complicated the problem is. See this movie if you want to see impressive stage design projects, and not if you want to see a good acting game or a good movie. Watch the movie about the superman, it would be much shorter, and the children would like it more. For example, a scene in which Cage escapes from armed armed bandits, and bullets are reflected by a fire escape rail. (And I'm not talking about a fence or anything, only ONE SMALL FIELD) This movie shows the breakup of movies and the film industry into cheap gags and boring, unrealistic activities that this film delivers in huge quantities.
