Not that I want to be mean, but this movie really surprised me. During the whole movie I was like ... erm ... what is this movie about? I do not get animation at all. Probably this movie will be suitable only for those who belong to the 80's. A group of people came out during the film. After the film, many people said, "This is it?" To be honest, I can not believe that this movie received the best children's film award. If you think about watching this movie, I definitely do not recommend it. You will regret it. I am not joking. You will find that you are simply wasting your time and money and go and watch it.
