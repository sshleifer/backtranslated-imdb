I have never seen this movie, but I can say one thing about its production. While DJ in comedy / oldies radio in 1988, I received a phone call from a production company. They asked me if I am writing and recording a little, that they will fall into the soundtrack as sounds emitted from the TV (the TV screen itself will never be shown). I said I was sure, I wrote a parody of stereotypical science fiction monsters from the 1950s, I completed some sound effects and called another DJ, Pam Landry, to play the female part. When she was on the air, she turned on a long song, joined the microphone in the production room, and cut the voice in one shot. Giggling, she went back to her show, and I got mixed up with silly sound effects. We would never have done it if we knew that the "Pickling Massacre" would be such a turkey - but then we never paid for our efforts! - Gary Theroux
