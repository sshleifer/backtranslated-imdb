I'm a big fan of Randolph Scott, but this movie is a dud. The whole impression is that it is in a can, fake, sound, with a really awful projection on the back screen. He has a good story idea, which the screenwriter successfully buried in a thread-like script, which prevents the audience from submerging in the action and really cares about any of the characters. Targeting is for pedestrians and only emphasizes how bad the script is and not helping to improve it. I've seen a lot of very nice "production of sound scenes", but this is not one of them. All this makes you appreciate the more sharp Scott / Boetticher movies. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is tanned, finished and shines with this millionth smile. It is always a pleasure ... even in the worst movies. In addition to Scott, another main reason why I wanted to see this movie was how much I liked Mrs. Wymore in Errol Flynn's film "Rocky Mountian". In "Man Behind the Gun" she is equally beautiful and you can say she is a good actress, but she was forced to say a few stupid lines, and the blocking she got from the director was really awful. I only saw Phil Carey in "Pacific Operation" and he plays exactly the same hero here ... arrogant butt pain that you want to defeat in the unconscious. I think that proves that he is a good actor ... he made me hate him. In my opinion there are some bad attempts at comic relief that only make the film smaller. Although there are many elements to knock, I must say that I really enjoyed two Spanish songs sung in the music numbers ... But that's not why we're watching Randolph Scott's movies, right? <br /> <br /> There are definitely worse Scott films, and this one is certainly not unbearable, but it certainly can not be considered something more than average.
