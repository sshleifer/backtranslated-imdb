Because I'm not a fan of blood and guts, I think bloody scenes are completely unnecessary (spell it) and too realistic for my preferences, if you're the type of person who gets stupid on the Internet or makes movies and say "go to him" , it carries the conviction of what kind of person dreams about this sick shit. <br /> <br /> In addition, he had the potential to be a great movie, the music was also of the highest class (through the film and especially the final credits). Some parts, however, were somewhat unbelievable, like you just found your girlfriend trusting that they are waiting for torture and death, and all you do is tell her what happened and how you got there (why he did not ask her if she happened, that she had some handkerchiefs or even fresh air or a piece of rubber when he was on it?) Come on now, most probably just shout "hurry up and untie me, and then let it jump FAST!" Where were the flies, worms, etc., and when the girl accidentally stumbled into the place, surely the smell of a rotten body would sound like a few alarm bells! I recommend this film only to friends of Dennis Nielsson and the like, I am sure that such a film will make the sick people have a very happy Christmas.
