WELL. So this is a low-budget "movie" (I used quotes because it was shot in Hi-8 video). Acting is universal, the makeup is funny (the blood looks as if it came from Sherwin-Williams and I saw more convincing bruises from Halloween ghouls), and the lighting generally looks like someone used the Toyota pickups headlights on the actors. <br /> <br /> Maybe I will be able to forgive those low-budget features if there are any real content if the movie tries to tell a story. This collection of video recordings can not boast of any plot, real characters or panache. It is an unstoppable mess. <br /> <br /> And do not worry - there are no spoilers, because there is absolutely nothing to spoil.
