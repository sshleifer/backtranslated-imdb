The fact that IMDb makes positive comments about Dan in "Real life" only makes me aware that their employees are working hard trying to get people to watch this awful movie. <br /> <br /> I have no words, I have no idea where to start describing a really horrible movie in which I sat for the last night - Dan in real life. Steve's characters in previous films led me to believe that I feel something for his character and I enjoy dialogue, but like other posters I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed by the cast. <br /> <br /> Dialog was so invented, Walton's family or family was the country of cookies, and the film was so many times that I was shocked that someone thought it was an original idea. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and make a pass for this terrifyingly bad movie and don I believe everything you read on IMDb, because the first comments were clearly written by people sitting in a different theater watching a GOOD movie.
