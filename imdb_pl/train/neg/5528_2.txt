With this movie, which only lasts 61 minutes and there is nothing good on television, I decided to show off Revolt of the Zombies on DVD to kill time. Even realizing the era he comes from, I was very disappointed. It started with the oddly optimistic quality of the initial score (what - without thoughtful music?), And then rather slowly moving opening sequences. Man, I thought a zombie movie - even from the thirties - would have SOME shivers (White Zombie, with Bela Lugosi, for sure), but it did not have any. Zero. It was not even dramatic (except for a few moments with burning eyes imposed on the film, which indicate the hypnotization of someone). Like the boring King of the Zombies, this movie can be an interesting property, but nothing more.
