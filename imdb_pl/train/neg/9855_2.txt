Let me start with the fact that I am a huge fan of fantasy. However, this movie is not for me. Many of the pulled arguments attempt to confirm the claim of the movie that dragons ever existed. The film mentions links in various stories from different countries, but does not examine them in more detail, which could give the film some credibility. The movie uses (nice!) CGI to tell us a fantasy story about the life of a young dragon. It is combined with flash-forwards popular in the style of TV-show-CSI, to make them look like something scientific, which is definitely not. In many cases, the arguments / tips are far-fetched. In some cases the tips used to show the dragons probably existed, either flew or spatter fire is simply unimportant. To see this, I have cramps in my fingers. Even a fantasy film requires a certain degree of reality, but it simply does not exist. Bottom line: this is a pretentious CSI fantasy document that is not worth seeing.
