with a title like this, you know that you do not expect a great horror movie. But it was really bad, even with low expectations. The plot is really offensive and stupid: the escaping criminal wears a mask for Halloween, so everyone around him thinks he is someone else. this joke can actually work for 5 or 10 minutes, but not during the whole movie! the actors are not so bad, but their characters are rather stupid, and the story is boring and even stupid. No tension, no emotions and little gore (very cheap). Little Helper of Satan is trying to combine horror (...) with comedy and dramatically fails. At the end it became so boring that I stopped watching 10 minutes before the end. I did not care what happened. Amanda Plummer was great at Pulp Fiction, but she came ... it was 13 years ago, and then she did not do anything decent. No wonder it must have dropped as low as this piece of nonsense .. Avoid or be warned ...
