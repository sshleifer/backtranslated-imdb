It is hard to believe that the director Barbet Schroeder used to make majestic and very funny Maitresse (1976), and now he seems to be doing only "by numbers" of Hollywood thrillers. <br /> <br /> This is a very light material by John Grisham, crossed with the story of the TV movie. Bullock is Cass Mayweather, a pugnacious and independent investigator specializing in serial killers. Ben Chaplin is her reserved police partner Sam Kennedy and together they form an uncomfortable duo. Not good, when two unbalanced Maladies colleges (Gosling and Pitt) decide to send them on a wild goose chase - planting very clever and misleading court evidence at the scene of the crime. <br /> <br /> It's enough, but while Bullock and Chaplin do not create sparks, we also have to put up with some boring, too-melodramatic flashbacks illustrating an important event in Cass's story. Of course there are also frequent shots in a cliff hut, where there is absolutely no doubt that the ending of OTT will be set. Oooh ... atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Watch the episode of CSI instead. It's to the point and much more exciting.
