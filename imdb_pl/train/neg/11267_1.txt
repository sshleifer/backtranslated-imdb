Fine. There are not really so many great movies. The latest jewels, such as American Dream, The Straight Story, and even Toy Story 2, are usually not so close together. But boy (!) Does this film defy quality? <br /> <br /> I have no idea what these people think they are doing. Are financiers in this world so easily convinced to finance such a pot ****? I can see it now ... <br /> <br /> Producer - "So we have Joe Fiennes. It's sweet like a button and it was pretty good at Lovers' Shakespeare. And we have Rhys Ifans, who is not sweet, but cool in Notting Hill. We're mixing a really average score, some unminiscent post-Britpop melodies, rusty roots and lizards and hey, I'm glad you have the worst film of the new millennium. And believe me, it will be hard to do something so bad in the next thousand years. <br /> <br /> Bank - "I like it! Any unnecessary sex? Bad camera movements? about the worst accents on this Devil's Own page? <br /> <br /> Producer - "Yes, we have a lot of them." <br /> <br /> The Bank - "Sounds great, where are we signing? "<br /> <br /> Please.
