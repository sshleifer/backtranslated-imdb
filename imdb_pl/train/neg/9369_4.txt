Although I heard that this movie was a bit dry, I'm watching everything about Scott Bakula. At the beginning of this movie I had high hopes for a classic tacky but pleasant Scott-gets-girl ending and up to 20 minutes before the end was going great. The return of the action was crazy, unexpected and very clever. I kept my fingers crossed for being successful and it would be a terrible misunderstanding, until the loans were rolled and I realized that there would be no happy and satisfied ending. Unfortunately, I regretted having looked at him and hurriedly made some quantum leap to restore my faith in the goodness of Big Scott!
