I have seen this film several times at various short festivals and it always gives me the impression that I saw the movie trailer! <br /> <br /> The school movie is very well produced and directed, but the story ... well, he needed something different to be a bigger and interesting movie. A character named Tim Watcher needed a certain approach. This is something that is missing in some Portuguese short films - the script is always superficial. <br /> <br /> But still ... I liked this movie ... <br /> <br /> Parabens! (Congratulations!)
