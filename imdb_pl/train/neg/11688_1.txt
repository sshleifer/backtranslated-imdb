My wife and I found this film highly unsatisfactory. While the plot makes you interested and busy wondering what's going on when you leave the theater, there are too many loose goals that do not make sense at all. (SPOILERS AHEAD) Christopher Plummer, the unusually rich boss of the New York bank, has a terrible hidden secret. Drawing on the benefits of World War II, dealing with the Nazis and hiding loot stolen from Jews, he keeps evidence (including diamonds and documents with a Nazi swastika) in a safe in his bank. Why? If he wants it to never be revealed, why did not he burn and destroy documents from years ago? And diamonds? Of course, he does not need them - why keep them and not get rid of them? How did the bank robber learn about his secret? How did they know that it is worth going to this very safe safe # 232? Ace detective Denzel Washington also discovers bank records showing SD boxes 231 and 233, but not # 232. Curious. He meticulously found the time to conduct an exhaustive search for bank records to discover this one strange fact. All this time is dealing with the hot situation of hostages and bank thieves threatening them with immediate execution. Wow! Talk about the super powers of the detective. <br /> <br /> The bank robbers leave millions of dollars in a loose currency in the treasury they opened. They only take the contents of SD Box # 232, allegedly to blackmail the bank's president. It opposes any rational attempt to logically explain what the film depicts as a criminal brain, or its minions with a smaller brain. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster, using his political connections with the mayor of New York, gets permission to enter a bank that is controlled by bank robbers, holding many hostages. He offers the head of bank robbers a contract to buy back documents that he has in hand, but he is not interested. So what does he mean (if at all?). <br /> <br /> My wife was offended by the arrogance of all players, Christopher Plummer (bank president), Denzel Washington (detective ace) and Jodie Foster, cracker trouble shooter for high-power problems. <br /> <br /> The last movie of Jodie Foster, who I saw, "Flight Plan", was also full of holes that did not make any sense at all. I thought I liked Jodie Foster, but I will probably avoid her future films. <br /> <br /> Now I have a problem with the fact that I can rarely convince my wife to go to the cinema. I can not disagree with her in this matter ... "MONEY WAVES AND WASTES OF TIME". Be forewarned. A well made movie, great actors, bad script writing.
