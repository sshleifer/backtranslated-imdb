Western society received ideas that India is a poor country. Such films only reinforce these beliefs. Such illustrations make it increasingly difficult for Indians to be accepted abroad. Agreed that in India there are poor and homeless, but why there is no representation of educated people, if not those who have been successful. <br /> <br /> I completely hated the idea of ​​a movie showing Patrick Swayze as another Mother Teresa. In my opinion, this film showed India in a very bad light, giving misconceptions. Discussing only one aspect of society is unfair. Exactly why people ask me: "When we go to India, can we hire an elephant just outside the airport so that we do not have to walk on roads so full of dirt and snakes?" <br /> <br /> Those who want a second opinion on the subject of contemporary Indian society, they should watch "Monsoon Wedding."
