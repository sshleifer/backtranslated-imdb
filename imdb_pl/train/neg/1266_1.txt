If there is a hell, it contains a projection room in which GRAND CANYON plays on an eternal loop. One could hope that the presence of so many great actors - Danny Glover, Alfre Woodard, Kevin Kline, Mary Louise Parker - would help compensate for the presence of Mary McDonnell (whose penance consists in watching their own films for all eternity). . But no. Apparently, they injected the McDonnell serum with other actors. The whole thing is pretentious, cursed, offensive (if you're deaf or know someone who is, be prepared to boil blood on a funny TDD scene). GRAND CANYON is full of unbearable, committed people, but he never gives us reason to like / understand / sympathize with them and even tolerate them. With rare exceptions, they are unbearable losers, which would be better without a gene pool. There is no conspiracy, no character development (these people will never grow), no breakthrough performance and the archives you will ever encounter in the movie. The best thing about GRAND CANYON? His title. This is one big movie HOLE.
