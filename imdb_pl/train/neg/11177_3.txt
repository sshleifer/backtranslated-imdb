In what seemed to be the longest 1 hour 35 I had to endure for a long time, Al Pacino provides accurate performance to be sure. Not his usual typing, which was nice. But his character was really pathetic. Someone who is sorry when he stumbles about forgetting meetings because we realize that Hollywood social life has deprived him of his life energy. But in this movie we needed someone to like. And for some reason, every character in the picture said, "I do not know why I like you, Eli" to Chracter Al Pacino and I could not even get close to his sympathy. other actors played their usual styles. Tea Leoni, Richard Schiff and Bill Nunn have done nothing to change their established characters developed on television or in earlier movies. And Kim Basinger was not even in the movie long enough to ensure the performance of any kind. <br /> <br /> The story of the film did not have momentum. Most scenes never drive history, but rather collect factoids about characters that later came into play in an anti-climatic ending. He had potential, except for reluctance to tell stories. <br /> <br /> What is the meaning of the movie? Daniel Algrant and Jon Robin Baitz would like you to believe: "When Hollywood is gone, you can not get out." Yes, sure! And that's why so many people are laid off in Hollywood.
