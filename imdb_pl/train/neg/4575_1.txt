I admit that at the moment I'm just a college student in this direction. At the time when I saw this movie, I was a high school student - I want to say that it was a year younger, but maybe he was older, difficult to remember. My experience with quantum physics is largely due to my course in physics of honors, interest in quantum mechanics, which led me to read about it in many books on theoretical aspects of the field, as well as any articles that I can find Discover and the like. I'm not a doctor. <br /> <br /> That means ... <br /> <br /> This movie is simply awful. It was designed to appeal to the scientific mind of the average New Age guru who desperately wants to believe in the uniqueness of everyone. My mother is such a person and since she saw the movie, she tried to get all friends to see him and buy a copy of the movie. I tried to point out the various drawbacks and problems that I saw in the logic of movies and science - and they are numerous - and rejected my claims because "oh, so a high school student knows more than all those people with doctorates. "In this case, apparently yes. <br /> <br /> Leaving the fact that getting a PhD does not necessarily require that the person is correct or, in fact, intelligent. Leaving behind me the fact that my basic understanding of physics is enough to overthrow half the movie. Leaving it behind, the filmmakers completely manipulated their interviews with at least one of the participants to prove that he supported their beliefs when in reality he completely opposed them. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but I think the intuitor did a really good job of putting down the movie, so read if you want to do it. <br /> <br /> http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/bleep.html
