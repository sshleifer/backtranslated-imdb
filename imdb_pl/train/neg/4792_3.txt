Spectrum .... Class. Phantasm II ..... awesome. Phantasm III ..... erm ..... terrible. <br /> <br /> Even if I want to start in this movie, I just can not. The movie seems to be "sold out". The first bad signs appear when the video contains trailers of other movies at the beginning (something others did not do). Also too many pointless characters, the best examples of a kid (who is a hit, initially funny, but you want to kill him soon), a woman who uses karate to fight balls (erm will not work, or rather should not) and blooming zombies (which there the hell they do, there is no connection in them in other Phatasms). There is also a serious lack of dwarfs running around. <br /> <br /> The only good bits are the beginning of cracking and, of course, Reggie B. <br /> <br /> (Possible approach of SPOILER) <br /> <br /> For me this movie seems to be filler between the second and fourth, because additional characters will just go away at the end, so they can continue with the main 4 in IV. <br /> <br /> Generally very, VERY disappointing. 3/10
