A really horrible, pretentious, endless movie. Director Bellocchio seems to be enchanted by the beautiful face and the figure of his actress Detmers - and who can blame him? But maybe, maybe he should focus his attention a bit on creating a good, engaging movie. I hate it when sex is an "artistic film" to become more "respected". Frequent, sometimes hot sex scenes are the only reason for this movie. It is a matter of taste whether it is worth to sit for the rest of the painting. (*)
