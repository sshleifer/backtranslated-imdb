The film, written and directed by Neil Young, "Greendale", is not much more than an 87-minute music video set for doxen or in the composer's songs. Instead of dialogue, the film is based solely on Young's texts, which are heavily entwined with socio-political commentary to tell the story, while the actors play scenes. <br /> <br /> Taking into account the hammas and cheesy graininess of the image, the effect is equivalent to Young blowing up some of his own home movies and releasing them for public consumption. Although the movie apparently has a "history", we really have no idea what is happening, mainly due to the unrefined appearance of the film, the lack of dialogue and the amateur ineptitude of acting. All we get for eighty-seven minutes is a group of aging hippies who silently parade through incoherent narratives, while Young's songs play endlessly on the soundtrack. The whole turns into a tedious exercise of indulgence. "Greendale" gives low-budget movies to off-Hollywood films.
