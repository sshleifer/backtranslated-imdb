As we all know, Hollywood likes to change historical events around us, and 44 minutes is one of those Hollywood movies. For example, bank robbers never returned to the bank when they started shooting LAPD in the film, we see them returning inside twice! Another example is the number of LAPD officers who were shot at the end of the film, this is far from the truth! But of course, Hollywood must have a good bloody ending, so * they * add more blood and guts. Some events have been combined, and many of the main actors have played a few different people, but that's what Hollywood has always done, so why complain? I think the only sad part is that I've watched some hourly documentaries about North Hollywood shooting on TLC that were much better than this!
