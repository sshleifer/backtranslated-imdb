This movie is not very good. It's boring and little blood for horror. The story just goes on and nothing happens. And I think the vampire was so stupid. She had many chances to kill the vampire hunters because she shows her that she has reflex lighting. But every time he has one of them pinned, he simply takes his time and something always happens when he does not bite. No wonder it went straight to the cable. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERSION: Not as good as the first vampire movie. You are HAPPY if you lose time.
