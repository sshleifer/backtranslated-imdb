This movie is blowing - let's get straight now. In this pile of nonsense there are a few gems of the scene, but none can buy back the inert story. Colin Farrel looks like Brad Pitt in "12 monkeys" and behaves in a similar way. I usually hate Colin because he is generally a fairy, but he's fine in this movie. In this film there were two fictional lines - one about a kid who throws stones through the windscreens of moving vehicles and the other about a woman with a mustache. Let's face it - this movie has no fancy image of what he wanted to say or where he wanted to go. Heroes' plot lines are interwoven at some levels, but in no way deserve to be included in the scenario. The whole thing is weak and pointless, and then there is an occasional scene OK. But generally - do not worry until you love Irish accents so much that you can watch mediocrity and save anyone who sounds like an Elf Lucky Charms - an American fetish that led to really bad movies.
