Poor Will will fall over in the grave if he manages to do this terrifying adaptation of German television in his classic game. It is obvious that very little money was spent on it. The vertical platform, runway and some randomly placed columns pass as a set. The film was ineptly dubbed in English, and English actors were muttering from time to time. The whole production had an extremely dark and gloomy impression. And besides, where was Fonterbras in that movie anyway? MST3K gave this beautiful production the treatment that he rightly deserved. <br /> <br /> To be or not to be? I would like this film never to be in the first place.
