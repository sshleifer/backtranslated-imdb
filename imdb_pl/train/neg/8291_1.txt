An idiot dentist learns that his wife was unfaithful. There are no new stories here. However, the authors managed to create a stupid, disgusting movie. If you like watching children vomit or see a dentist imagining that he is pulling out all his wife's teeth in a bloody type of horror movie, go see (or rent) a movie. If not, go to something else (MY FAIR LADY, someone?)
