Nick Millard, also known as Nick Phillips, should be lonely enough when he created "Criminal Insane" 10 years before spending this terrible waste of time and effort. The fact that the original "Criminally insane" lasted less than an hour should have been attributed to the fact that he probably spent the story for everything he was going to get out of it ... but instead decides to use TONS of material from the original in this one, even to the point where you could repeat the original opening sequence! Unfortunately, the restoration of the rapidly aging Priscilla Alden did not save it. What part of the original footage in this movie looked like it was filmed using a rented hand camera! If this movie cost more than $ 100, I would be very surprised and I would be equally surprised if he did something similar to this amount! Avoid this and watch the original!
