I do not know who Sue Kramer is, the director of this movie, but I have a strong suspicion that A) she is a lesbian and B) she somehow embarrassed everyone involved in this project to prove that they are not homophobic. <br /> <br /> I can imagine that everyone thinks: "My God, it's terrible. Not funny. Walking. Completely lame. " But keep your mouth shut for fear that they will be called anti-gay or "not get" gay lifestyle. (That's probably why Kramer did NOT cast homosexual people to play gays too.) In any case, it's not even worth reviewing. All actors are directed to play every scene completely above each other, so there is no sincerity or credibility in anything they do. He is full of stereotypes and there is nothing in this film that would be the least funny - much less funny. <br /> <br /> I hated it and I'm not afraid to say it. It is a pity that people without glands who gave Kramer money to make this bomb were not so impartial in their assessment.
