One would think that with Ingrid Bergman and Warner Baxter this movie would be much better. Unfortunately, the film suffers from difficult to believe characters, as well as a serious plot problem that makes some characters seem to be addicted to the brain. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the arrival of Ingrid Bergman to the Stoddard family. Everything is so peach and intense - the family loves Bergman, and things can not be more perfect. Well, I mean, until the mother (Fay Wray) dies, the stock market will fall in 1907 (Erasing the family fortune) and Bergman is forced to return home to France. This part of the movie is a bit sticky sweet, but it's not bad. <br /> <br /> Later, after the family estate has improved, Bergman returns. The four boys are now adults and there is no reason to employ her again as a governess. But, in short, everything is swelling again. But when World War I comes, all four go to war - wounds! At that time one of the sons (David) brings home his new wife (Susan Hayward). Miss Hayward's figure is as black and white as the others, although everyone is good and swollen, of course he is a horny devil. Worse, he lives in his family home while David is in war. <br /> <br /> Now the movie is getting really stupid - stupid stupid. Hayward starts an affair with one of David's brothers, but when his father sees the silhouette of lovers, Bergman enters the room from another entrance and pretends it's her, not Hayward with Jack! WHY?! Why would anyone be wise to do this to save the butt of an undoubtedly evil and seductive woman? It was exactly the requirement that Bergman needed to get rid of Snipe once and for all! It's just a case of bad writing and it made me crazy ... and most likely did the same with the audience in 1941. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie consists of a missed opportunity after the unsuccessful opportunity for Hayward evil to be exposed. It only flies against common sense and made the film a stupid melodramatic mess. However, as expected, the truth finally comes out and everyone swells again - happy to be one big loving family without a whore, Hayward. <br /> <br /> The film suffers from poor writing. The Hayward case did not make sense - at least in the way it was done. And, with characters that are so damn good or bad (without anything between them), they sink the film on the level of secondary soap. The only thing that saves him at all is acting - they tried the best they could with a rough script. Suffice it to say that the Columbia Pictures writers who made this film should be slapped on a dead chicken!
