Cassidy (Kacia Brady) puts the gun in her mouth blowing on the back of the head for boyfriend Neal (Jason Dibler). Cassidy was the lead singer of the rock band "demons and death", who could not get rid of the sad feelings of his boyfriend's neglect towards her (you know, I can find other reasonable ways to solve this problem other than by putting a bullet in the head). She returns, however, having the soul of her friend Dora (Jill Small), who is to replace her on the vocal, so that the band could end the album haunted by Cassidy's untimely death. But Cassidy has made a deal with the dark, and the souls are to be collected. He is absorbed in this anger mainly on Neal, but all members of the band or everyone in the music studio are killed when they fall victim, to which they believe that rather desperate Dora..nie Cassidy returns for repayment. <br /> <br /> A bad microbudget horror seems cheap, has a cheap cast, which should make plans on a different line and offers cheap kill scenes is not effective.
