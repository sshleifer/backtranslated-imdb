I apologize to my Nevada City neighbors, but this one is bad. <br /> <br /> Brian had to have too much Botox because he had very little expression in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Alice seemed to have a backboard attached to it. Throughout the movie she was stiff. <br /> <br /> I checked both Alice and Brian and was surprised to see an extensive biography of the work. I would guess they were freshmen. <br /> <br /> Ed Asner and Peter Jason brought the film honestly with jokes and ease on every line. Ed certainly did not lose his charisma. I would like to spend time to meet him when he was here. <br /> <br /> I love snow scenes and scenes from shops and the church because I was there. I'm making Nevada City my home and I've been waiting impatiently for the premiere. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> Sorry.
