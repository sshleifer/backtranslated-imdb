A team of uninteresting and dissimilar characters twists and passes through a frail story that can be interesting if you can only take care of it. This "twisting and turning" that I am talking about does not refer to the story (which contains the whole tension of a tuna casserole recipe), but to the director's inability to keep the character's face even in the spotlight. On the other hand, Angie Harmon has a very nice nostril and left ear. <br /> <br /> The only real surprise in the movie are the big names that convinced you to do it. If you think that this movie has never been released in cinemas, even though it has been popped with a star, you may be inclined to think that something is stinking. <br /> <br /> And it really is.
