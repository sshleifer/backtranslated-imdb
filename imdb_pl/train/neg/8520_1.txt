When I noticed that "Hamish Macbeth" was broadcast in the United States, I was delighted. At the time I was unhappily watching this damn thing. I love M. C. Beaton's book about a wonderful Scottish constable. Characters in the book are fun and well written. The authorities who are responsible for this mishmash have apparently never read any of Beaton's books. Only the name "Hamish Macbeth" has something to do with the series. In addition to the lack of famous characters, the whole performance is offensive loud. It seems that the actors feel they must scream and shout at each other. If you love the charming Hamish Macbeth M. C. Beaton, do not waste time on this trash.
