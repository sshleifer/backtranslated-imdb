When assessing documentaries that bring together a relatively small group of ugly ultra-right and conservative groups in the US, the following issues should be considered. The United States of America, with 270 million inhabitants and a complex history as an aspiring democracy and its hopes and desires to defend human rights, has its drawbacks and disadvantages. Of course, extreme right-wing groups and ultra-conservative groups are expected to exist in a large number, but are very small and isolated in relation to their population size. On a per capita basis, Europe, the United Kingdom and even Australia actually have similar right-wing groups on a per-capta basis, and the actual size of neo-Nazi groups in Australia is actually higher than in the United States. For the above reasons, the humiliation and denigration of the American people and its level of debate in the Educed American Society by the very fraudulent and deceptive portrayal of this extreme right-wing group of psychopaths as representatives of the American Society is unjustified. In doing so, Greenstreet consciously chose small and isolated groups on the opposite ends of the spectrum to create an image of America that is a scandalous and deliberate sensational lie. This film is clearly designed to ignite and deepen the views of people who hide this subconscious and morbid hatred of the American people and a way of life under the guise of a purist fashionable and stereotypical idealistic leftist ideology. This film was made for profit not for the promotion of the truth about American society and the human condition. Greenstreet can create documentaries that concentrate on ultra-right conspiracies, the Military Industry complex, but fail to present intelligent and balanced factual debate, let alone alternative solutions to the failures of a living democracy. The film screening is exhibited as anti-American thanks to the support for this basket. SENSATIONALISM in the worst shameful anti-American rubbish.
