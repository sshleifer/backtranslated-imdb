This topic deserves a much better scenario and final result than this movie. The screenplay is full of holes because it has never been conceived as a story, but rather a series of nightmarish scenes loosely woven together. Gaps and loose ends of the story are numerous. The scene in which the kidnap victim was informed that her parents are not dead and have been looking for her since she was taken away is simply strange. It is written as a moment of catartic therapy with the head of the shelter for refugees handing her a "missing poster" when she was eight years old. In the real world, if the head of the refugee shelter had found out that he had a broken kidnapping under the roof, an immediate police summons would take place. It's a matter of law enforcement, not a 12-minute segment for Oprah. Everything from the end to the end is so short that I can only say that the first 90 minutes were pure unjustified exploitation. Funny, this is what the movie is supposed to condemn. In the end, it seems that he joined.
