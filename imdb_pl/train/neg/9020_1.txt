I did not sleep last night by mistake watching this thing. The only thing I can say right about this horrible movie is that it can be used by film schools to show how not to make a movie. There is no proper development of the form, wait, I'm not even sure if they were heroes. The settings were hokey and inane, and the misuse of split screens was wasted because sometimes they could not even synchronize with alternative shots. If I could give him a zero or minus rating, I would do it. Unfortunately, it is not even worth the time for a few laughter. <br /> <br /> This is just a sad example of the money wasted by Hollywood, and now I'm wasting my time, even thinking about it.
