It's hard to describe - if you've been a fan of Russ Meyer's films in the past, you'll be pleased to see that Haji still looks really hot, although Forry Ackerman did not do so well (what does he still do if I'm still doing these movies? will it be in my movie?). It was quite a funny assumption - a superhero whose giant mums are her secret weapon - but sometimes it did not move all the way, and the jokes were on the level of the average comedy Joe E. Brown (or, Abbott and Costello, if it's your thing - just bad puns. Still, I find the film fascinating to watch and for more than 2 reasons: good work, but still poor production.
