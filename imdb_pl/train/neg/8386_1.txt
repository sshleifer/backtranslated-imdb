Breaking this movie is like shooting fish in a barrel. It is too easy. I'm going to challenge myself to recognize the positive aspects of Little Man. First of all, I'm impressed with special effects. It was as if Marlon Wayans's head was attached to the body of a small person. For a moment I did not doubt it. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I loved some of the unexpected scenes. David Alan Grier played an annoying restaurant singer, and his versions of "Havin 'My Baby" and "Movin' On Up" were invaluable. John Witherspoon, who accidentally played Grier's father in Boomerang in 1992 (if you remember, he "coordinated" the fungus belt with a mushroom jacket) now plays Vanessa's father in Little Man. It was funny. <br /> <br /> Besides, this movie is just as credible as White Chicks. How stupid is it that even a doctor can not say that he is a 40-year-old man, not a child? Has a full set of teeth !!! How is it possible that no one notices that it is not a child? Little Man is so bad it's Rob Schneider's cameo. And please, if you are stupid enough to waste $ 8 on this movie, at least do me a favor and do NOT bring your children. This movie is too sexual for young children (a lot of jokes and insinuations about sex, going downstairs, eating, etc.), And I felt embarrassed for the parents who brought their children to a show that I had to endure. If you insist on watching a stupid movie, save children from pain and suffering.
