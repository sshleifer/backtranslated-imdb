I watched this movie and the original Carlitos Way back to the back. The difference between them is disgusting. Now I know people will say that the prequel was made with a small budget, but that never had anything to do with a bad script. Now maybe it's just me, but I always thought that the prequel was created to set a different movie in which the key characters performed and perhaps a little about the life we ​​did not know. Rise to Power is just a movie that has the name Carlito. The original movie should have at least a few characters, the ending does not make sense in relation to the original. At the end of this movie, he's retiring with his sweet heart, but how the hell do we get him out of prison in the next movie? And his woman is not even the same woman he talks about as his only love in the original. I would say that the movie is slightly funny in itself, with a few decent beats, but it fades when it is kept in the hands of an older brother. Do not sleep at night, wait to see it, watch the original again if you really need to hit.
