I think Stuart Bliss is the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Acting was awful and the plot was ridiculous. I understand that the wife of the main character who left him caused a mental breakdown, but it became so stupid and boring, after some time I could not care less about any of the characters. <br /> <br /> The film continued the same ideas over and over without adding anything fresh or surprising to the story. The whole thing about the Geiger counter after some time came after Stuart opened the wall to see what was behind her when the meter pointed out that something was there. <br /> <br /> Then there were repetitive scenes with leaflets and misleading, where he meets himself. <br /> <br /> I should have guessed that this movie was a flop when I did not recognize any of the actors. Do yourself a favor when this movie appears, read the book! You will be better.
