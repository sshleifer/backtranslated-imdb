I recently browsed a site that contained videos from the public domain. In their long list of films was this movie and I thought that I must have hallucinations on such an offensive title and assumption. But no, it really was. And because the movie was only 27 minutes long, I decided to give it a try. If it was a porn movie, I would stop watching. Instead, it turned out to be the most bizarre movie I've ever seen. The Danish production team tried, with a budget of about $ 49, to make a Star Trek movie about a gay crew who traveled through the galaxy, destroying the oppression of women, killing all women - just as the Earth did! And in each case they met with cheers and gratitude from now homosexual men from the planet. <br /> <br /> Subtle, it is not. With some of the most obscene and young character names I've ever heard, I do not even think I can write them on IMDb without removing my review! However, despite all this stupidity, everything was strangely visible and worth watching. But, as I mentioned, because of the primitive names and strange subject (although there is no nudity), this is an adult-only movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, this movie left me 1001 questions, WHO would do it, WHY and WHO was the intended audience ?! Maybe this is not the absolute worst thing I've ever seen, but it's probably the weirdest and probably the most offensive!
