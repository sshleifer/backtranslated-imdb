Regardless of whether you want to spend almost 2 hours of your life, watching this depends on how you like your horror movies. If you like them, so damn horrible that they are hysterical, be careful. Jigsaw is undoubtedly the worst movie I've seen in my life (and I've seen "Long Time Dead"), and I say this as a fan of a low budget horror / gore genre and seeing some good ones compare it with. I'm not even going to delve into the details of it what makes this movie bad, the only good thing is that it's so horrible that it's one of the funniest things I've seen in years. If you can find it to rent cheaply, it is definitely worth seeing if you were involved in its implementation - shame. : o) IMDb must enter the 0/10 ranking, especially for this movie, it deserves it.
