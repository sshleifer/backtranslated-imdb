Manmohan Desai has made some fun, though illogical movies like AAA, PARVARISH and NASEEB, but he did some things like COOLIE and MARD, and then GJS <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the worst movies he's ever made . Mard ko dard nahin hota, but the movie is so bad that you're sticking <br /> <br /> The British are making caricatures, and the movie looks so strange The scene in a British hotel is damn stupid <br /> <br /> the movie has a lot foolishness, such as Amrita attacking Amitabh, and then the whole scene plus towards the climax, the film becomes even worse. There are more gems, such as a horse statue animating, Maski Amitabh haha ​​and more. Managing the Manmohan Desai is bad Music is ok. <br /> <br /> Amitabh has his style with style, nothing other than COOLS, roles like LAAWARIS Amrita Singh is okay Satyen Kapuu is okay Prem Chopra is as usual, Nirupa Roy is her usual Dara Singh's self is also as usual
