Oh, brother. The only reason why this very annoying movie avoids a total "bomb" from me is that it is at least historically remarkable as the first movie "Three Stooges" (when they were not yet alone and still burdened with this painfully distasteful Ted Healy) . But even as a longtime Stooges fan I would have to say that young Moe, Larry and Curly are misused as the three caretakers of the janitor to the higher general Healy. They are not regularly shown in the film, and their stupid and unfettered reflexes paint them more like zany hyperactive cartoon characters trying too much to play. <br /> <br /> Most of this toothache concerns Jack Pearl is looking in vain for audience chuckles as a man pretending to be Baron Munchausen (here is a good example of the level of humor: "I object!" "On what basis?" "Ground coffee!" ). His helper is none other than young Jimmy Durante, but even schnoz himself is boring.
