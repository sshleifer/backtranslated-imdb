I paid one dollar for this DVD and at first I felt cheated, but then I started thinking about it and I should be grateful. I found the Holy Grail, a real milestone of bad cinema. If you think that the initial dramatic shots of the empty stadium have expired because of the uncomfortable monologue of Evel's address, wait for the opening inscriptions to become on the rear of the chauffeur. The script appears to be pasted together with press clippings and ESL textbooks. But ..... I just can not believe how bad George Hamilton is. It seems he has nothing to do with what he says, the only internal monologue I can detect is "God, I bet I think I'm cute. Really sweet! " This is a revelation! Now I know how bad it can be.
