I was excited to hear someone did a documentary about what it's like to be a Puerto Rican. When I heard that it was Rosie Perez, I was wondering ... if he could really know how to be a Puerto Rican. As far as I know ... she was a Nuyorican. In any case, I sat with impatience to watch the popcorn. I realized 10 minutes that my first fears were right. Rosie Perez has little knowledge of being a Puerto Rican. This "document" is a more personal first-hand account of what it's like to be a Nuyorican ... and what it involves. She (like most Nuyoricans I know) has a watered, partial, and sometimes twisted sense of history. (How could they not ... live here.) Yes, everyone is proud. How should it be! But most of them do not know the secrets of real culture, history and political background or language. All this became very evident thanks to her participation in the Vieques problem. Regardless of my personal approach to this issue ... at least I know what this hell is for. She is arrested for something she did not know much about ... and she participated only because it was the "Cause of Puerto Rico." I really do not understand how he is not ashamed to admit it. For those of you who are not Puerto Ricans, please read this as a partial account of the woman's journey of discovery and acceptance. Do not take this for the gospel ... many of them are not even true. Please consider the source. Rosie is an actress; not a historian. This film is not and should never be the basis of their information for other Nuyoricans. Instead, all you have to do is step towards finding more information, learning and debating what reality is. Not just this woman's eyes.
