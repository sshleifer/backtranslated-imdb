Please, someone will stop Ben Stiller from acting in ANY movie. Write to the studio, hell, even write to a local congressman. I got more laughter at the funeral, and then I watched EVERY STILL. Jack Black is trying to create something about comedy about dying dog shit, and Christopher Walken, perhaps one of the greatest actors of his generation, just looks embarrassed that he is there. Stiller is his hateful self, but now, even with someone who saves him, he proves that he is overrated like a comic. It is not surprising that this film was badly filled and was available in the dollar auctions after only a few weeks. I warn you, and you have to warn your friends, Do not watch this movie, it's just awful, worst than Gothika (personally, I would never think, so to speak), worst Plan 9, Worst Ishtar, worst then The Golden Child. Please, Hollywood, stop letting Stiller film your movies, he's not funny, he's a terrible god actor and he brings others to him. The following video has been ranked first, because there are no negative results, so when the board says one thing, I'll give it a zero.
