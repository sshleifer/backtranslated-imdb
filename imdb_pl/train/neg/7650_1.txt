I know I'm in the minority, but ... Uwe Boll is as talented as a frog. <br /> <br /> Even toad; just a frog. It resembles about one hundred other non-talented burglars who release one useless festival after another. <br /> <br /> This movie? It's a shit fest. Slater's talent is used only to a minimal extent, which leads to the belief that he means other things (such as his failed relationship). Reid acts as if she forgot her acting lessons, was seriously hit in the head, and MADE forgot her acting lessons or has one of the worst directors in film history. I vote for the third choice myself, although the other two are always possible. <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll never did any of the things I took the slightest pleasure from. Honestly, I'm glad he did this stinker. I dealt with Bloodrayne competition with "Underworld: Evolution" for ticket sales. Now I am convinced that Len Wiseman has nothing and I do not mean Nothing, worry about it. <br /> <br /> This gives a rating of 1.0 / 10 for this mess, zawiÅ‚e bzdury od ... br /> <br /> Fiend :.
