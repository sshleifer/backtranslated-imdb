This movie is a total waste of time, the plot is terrible, the dialogue is terrible. <br /> <br /> Acting is fine, but the actors have absolutely no plot or scenario. Photography and some special effects are also OK, but there is nothing interesting to watch in this movie. There is no logical progress in history, the plot is complete nonsense. It is not even scary. For the film to be frightening, there must be at least a small element of credibility. This movie has no credibility. <br /> <br /> There are only three characters in the movie. Each character is shallow and has no personality. <br /> <br /> Most of the special effects and make-up are poorly made or mostly mediocre. <br /> <br /> I hope you read this and do not waste your time on this movie, unless it's interesting to see a totally awful movie.
