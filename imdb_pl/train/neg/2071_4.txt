I had two reasons to watch this swing when it was broadcast on Danish television yesterday. First of all, I wanted to see Gina Lollobrigida - and here I was not disappointed. She looked great. Secondly, reading about the film, I got the impression that it contains an absurd humor, similar to the one found in the films of Philippe de Broc. For this reason, however, I was disappointed. The jokes were predictable (except for a few witty remarks about the war) and completely one-dimensional figures. The action scenes were also made in a strange, mechanical and boring way, without a sense of drama. I watched until the end, but I got bored very quickly and sat there waiting for scenes with Lollobrigida.
