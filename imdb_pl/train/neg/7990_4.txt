"Anita and Me" is a drama about growing up in a multiethnic Britain, or rather "Bend it Like Beckham", or more precisely "East is East", which it shares with the seventies. The tone is definitely chirical (despite the harsh accents of the Black Country), but the film lacks the "Vigor of the East is a vigor, and the result seems rather thin and banal. Moreover, the presentation of the central relationship of the film between an Asian and her white friend is not deep enough to justify the way the film is constructed around him. I was also tired of movies in which the writer is a hero, it is obviously something that real writers experienced, but rather it is not a fresh element of fictional history. "East to East" was funny and spicy; "Anita and Me" seems obvious and boring in comparison.
