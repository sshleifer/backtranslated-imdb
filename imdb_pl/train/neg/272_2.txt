When I was younger, I really enjoyed watching bad television. We were all guilty of this or that time, but my pretext for watching things like "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century" and "Silver Spoons" is: I was young and naive; unaware of what makes the show really pay off. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I now appreciate good things. The SG-1 stargate is not good. Twelve years old I would love every piece, every line of slim dialogue, every bit of unnecessary technique. The letter is beyond bland; so bland and boring that it makes one miss Star Trek: Voyager. If your performance makes me miss the worst performance at Trek, you're in trouble. <br /> <br /> Stargate is a great wine pleasure, anchored by two solid performances by James Spader and Kurt Russell, full of fascinating Egyptian architecture and culture, great musical score and great science fiction ideas. With the exception of a bit of original music, nothing that made the movie uninspiring, does not appear in this program. Even Richard Dean Anderson, who made MacGyver watched and Legend interesting, looks like most episodes are sleeping. <br /> <br /> The budget had to be very low, because the sets sometimes look like somebody's cellars. Pictures are not much better, like vanilla and boring like scenarios. It amazes me that shows with a much larger style (eg Farscape) and substance (such as the reactivated Battlestar Galactica) have smaller, less rabid fanbazy than this mush. It just does not deserve it.
