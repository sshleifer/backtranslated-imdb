First of all, if you're checking out Revolt of the Zombies as a very early Night of the Living Dead (1968), forget about it. It's about a "zombie" in a more psychological sense, where the term only means someone who does not control his will, but instead has to follow the will of another. "Zombies" here, as little as in the film, are to a large extent metaphors of serving the state or power in general, just like during the war. Calling this horror story is quite difficult. <br /> <br /> The movie takes place during the First World War. The quota of "French Cambodia" has heard strange stories about zombies - rumored that Angkor Wat was built using zombies - and there are tales of zombie armies that easily defeat enemies. Armand Louque (Dean Jagger) returns a priest who allegedly knows the zombie secret, but does not want to speak. So Louque and the international military contingent go to Angkor Wat for an archaeological expedition, the purpose of which is to uncover the secrets of zombies and destroy information before the zombies have a chance to "erase the white race." <br /> <br /> One of the weird ones is that Revolt of the Zombies looks like maybe the writer / director Victor Halperin decided to change the game plan during the screening. The film begins as if it was studying a zombie / military metaphor, and maybe even included adventure elements, but after about 15 minutes it changes gears and becomes the story of a love triangle. <br /> <br /> Halperin does not stick with the subtext about the will and power (and Nietzsche's "will to power"). The film is interesting at this level, but the script and editing are very uncertain. This is another older film in which I would not be surprised if there was a lack of material, especially as some scenes fade or cut out when the character utters a dialogue. <br /> <br /> Among the imaginary romance story, Halperin tries to refer to the zombie thread, but little zombie material makes sense. Louque reveals the secret of the zombie, but it does not mean much to the viewer. The mechanics of the zombie material are unclear and confusing? Halperin even resorts to imposing naked pictures of Bela Lugosi from his 1932 movie, White Zombie, but he never explains what he has to do with it. There are large gaps in the story, including a love story. Promising, interesting characters from the early drums disappear for a long time. One potential villain is removed unceremoniously before he does much. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of old, boring B movies, Revolt of the Zombies may be worth watching at least once - acting is not that bad, and if you have a good imagination, you can put an interesting story in your mind to fill all gaps. But this is the second time I watched this movie, the first of them was about five years ago and I could barely remember it - so it's not exactly memorable.
