They should name this film: "A brother with an adapted mouse, which is somewhat inspired by someone's vague memory of Stuart Little, who just brushed the book, but mainly remembered the cover." a better review. <br /> <br /> But seriously people, do the children a favor and let them read the book. They can learn something instead of having a mind numbed by what we all know as a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> Stuart's book is not much about a mouse, but a person who is very small and similar to a mouse. He was born to parents, he was not adopted. The book tells about his life and the eventual departure from home and about the journey he sets off. There is a cat named Snowball who thinks he is eating and wants to eat it, but Snowball can not speak. <br /> <br /> In the film, it'll screw everything up. I think that the only thing they have kept from the book is the boat race and the name.
