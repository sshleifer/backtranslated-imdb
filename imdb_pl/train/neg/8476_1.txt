this movie was a terrible excuse for ... a movie. first of all, casting could have been better; Katelyn the main character did not resemble her mother's television. <br /> <br /> also the plot was pathedic. it was very banal and predictable. the ending was very disappointing and bad. (but that's all I will say about it). <br /> <br /> however the nail in the bag was the scene in which Katelyn (Jordan Hinson) was about to cry, but the girl could not cry on command! there were no tears running down her face, only a few unbelievable sobs. she is not a dynamic actress at all. she gave the same false little laugh, identical to the one from the mountain duff on Maguire lizzie (sp?). this is when the movie went from not so good, just bad. it really looked like it was playing. <br /> <br /> in short: this movie was really bad! it was a kind of mix of every film-based film from the 90s, which everyone has had - only worse! <br /> <br /> I give him "F" because it was so hard to sit down b / t / w, I cared when I saw it). <br /> <br /> however, you may like it if you have 9 or less. ;)
