Normally, when I am going to raid on local Hollywood video, I'm heading towards B-Horror movies. For me, the basic principles behind the film B-Horror is its camp value, Heavy Gore, a lot of unnecessary nudity and special effects that anyone can combine with a packet of corn syrup and latex. I rented Cradle of Fear only because I was a fan of the band since they released their first demo in 1995. The film began with an interesting note, and then when I saw Dani Filth, stumping an incredibly obvious latex mask AND WORSHIPED. When I saw a lesbian sex scene because of the lesbian sex scene, I DREAM EVEN HARDER. I spent almost the whole movie laughing, and when I was not laughing, I shook my head, thinking about how a multi-million dollar rock star would like to make a movie that seemed to be a few hundred dollars budget. It seems to me that the whole movie attracts "Hardcore Goth kids, who think that death, destruction, sex, blood and satan are the greatest things invented from Lava Lamps. It really was. For me, this movie seemed 80.5% about the things that happened in this movie, it only happened because of being a satanist. This movie had a lot of potential and could really be a really good movie, but in the end this "movie" is just an expanded cradle of dirty film.
