Looking through this movie, I can only review my experience as a weekend warrior who completed basic training in July, August and September 1971 at this garden place on earth in Fort Polk, Louisiana. Take part in the High Ground did not remind me of basic training. <br /> <br /> But you have to remember that it was South Korea, which ended in impasse, but it was a conventional war as we knew it. It was not Vietnam, a guerrilla war in the jungle where we were constantly pouring holes into an endless pit. The project at the time was undesirable, but considered still necessary for the defense of the country. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark is a Korean veteran who has now been assigned a state party to train soldiers to go abroad. The film is about one of his training cycles and about platoon people he needs to train. This is a typical type that can be found in almost every war movie from the previous decade. <br /> <br /> One thing I would like to praise is that the MGM considered our army to be integrated with the presence of William Hazard as a black recruit in a platoon. It was in keeping with the spirit of the times that were changing. <br /> <br /> But I will say that a recruit like Russ Tamblyn would have been cured of his smart mouth from the first day. Richard Widmark would not risk dying or becoming a eunuch to give Jerome confidence in the weapon. And in no way would he worry so much about the desertion of Robert Arthur. He simply let the parliamentarians deal with him. <br /> <br /> Of course, shooting near Fort Bliss and El Paso in Texas gave Take the High Ground a good authenticity. But see it as a recruitment film for the army, and you can certainly understand why the government was so eager to cooperate in those days. <br /> <br /> I remember how the drill sergeants had their little conflicts that you could pick up, you did not worry about getting something in your case that was 95% of the time. But there is no way that Karl Malden would dump Widmark in the open space during training before a few witnesses among the recruits. They would both realize that it would undermine the authority, something that the military simply does not allow. <br /> <br /> I would like to be able to say something better about Take The High Ground because I certainly like his talented cast. talented director Richard Brooks, even the stupid topic of Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington, freshly after their Oscar the year before for High Noon. The film received an Oscar nomination for the best screenplay and story of Millard Kaufman. It must have been for Kaufman's vivid imagination.
