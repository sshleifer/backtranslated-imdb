It seems that the US is running British police, which runs armed to the teeth and do you know that CID officers turn into uniforms when they stop working and go down to the pub! This must be one of the most unrealistic films with the worst representation of the "real" British police that has ever been imposed on unsuspecting recipients. I see that Mr. Snipes might have needed money to pay the tax bill, but what the hell a good actor Charles Dance did is a secret. B "movie of the 50s. One and a half hours of suicide and time will never come back. <br /> <br /> Avoid it like a real plague.
