Yes, I rate this movie as one terrible star. However, from now on it will be my rotation of Christmas movies. It really is so bad that it's good. This is another production by K. Gordon Murray (read: he buys a really cheap / bad Mexican movie, spends no money on dubbing him to English and issues it in childhood in the mid-sixties). I'm sure that some "mood boosters" will make it an even better experience. I do not intend to rework what other reviewers have said, the Christmas movie with Merlin, the devil, the mechanical reindeer, and some of the most pathetic children actors I have never seen. I am going to run it through the holidays back to "A Christmas Carol" by Kelsey Grammar. A real holiday in hell. Now, if I just find "To All A Goodnight (aka Slayride)" on DVD, I will have a triple function that can not be beat. You must see this movie. It moves so slowly that I can not resist, not to touch the fast scroll button - especially in the case of two dance rhythms! It resembles stinking bleu cheeses, so you must live a stink to enjoy this experience. Feliz Navidad amigos!
