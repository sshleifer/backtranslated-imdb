First, I liked this movie. It seemed like a nice comedy with stupid moments. Costume designer Albert Wolsky did everything in his power !!! Just like the great scenery decorator Robert R. Benton - this man really had a very good taste !!! But the writers disappointed me very much. The best ending will be the stage on the ladder, but instead decided that the father and his daughter should be together. I do not like the ending. The father becomes the boyfriend of his own daughter, and his ex-wife knows about it and everything is fine. It would be OK if screenwriters, for example, said that now there is a different soul in the body, but they did not do it, they only deprived him of the memories. The actors were good, they were really funny. Cybill Shepherd was charming, Robert Downey Jr. he was very funny on the dance stage :))) ... But some moments spoil even the impression of a good game. For example, Corinne Jeffries, played by Cybill Shepherd after her husband's death, waited for him for 23 years (a very long time!), She was faithful to him, she did not love anyone but him, and when she met him she was just making love to him, on the stage with his friend Philip Train (Ryan O'Neal), she easily betrayed the man she missed for so many years !!! It would be a good movie, if not the end, and a bit of human psychology.
