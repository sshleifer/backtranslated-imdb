I saw this movie when it first appeared in 1978, when I was a second year high school student. I took a date to see it. I did not have to "talk" because the movie was so bad! Career Joan Rivers has never been as difficult as she deserved after this terrible, unpalatable shit. In fact, this is not a pretty harsh term: this movie is ANTI-FUNNY! You leave feeling that any laughter that could have happened was beaten up before it could happen. It is not worth watching for curiosity or for any reason that is "yes-bad-it-good". Even the gang at MST3K could not do it! The fact that Billy Crystal's career survived this early suicide attempt is a miracle.
