I thought that before I start with this movie, it could be a good movie, but when I started with it, I thought it was really awful. They said the film was made in Afghanistan, but I think 95% of the film was shot in India. You can see Indian cars. You can see larsa drinking bisleri (Indian brand of water), Hindu written on the road, you can also see temples in Afghanistan * hahah * his really fun and many other things, which proves that he was not shot in Afghanistan. I think you should not waste time watching this movie. Pure waste of time. I recommend doing something different instead of watching this movie or maybe the heart is a better idea, but do not look at the waste of time
