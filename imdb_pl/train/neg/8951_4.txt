I am a big fan of this book, and Orwell is certainly my favorite writer since studying Animal Farm on GCSE. I bought a DVD out of pure curiosity, Burton is an actor I really value, so when I heard him playing the part of O'Brien, I was swept. <br /> <br /> I watched the trailer on DVD First, some fears began to appear, mainly in relation to the terribly horrible "theme song", hearing mechanics shouting "1984!". over and over to the electronic rhythm is as bad as it seems. <br /> <br /> The whole is pretty good, Burton and Hurt play their roles and tension well, which exists in the Ministry of Truth towards the end you can feel, especially in the shocking 101 scene. However, it is also a place where the film is disappointed. The film spends too much time concentrating on the romance between Winston and Julia, which is honestly not what Orwell wrote about. He wrote about the shattering future, about how Ingsoc builds human beliefs, and then breaks them down in the name of being created to love Big Brother. The film omits what is essentially the most important part of the book, Winstons agreeing with his position in life and the world, and his re-education through O'Brien. <br /> <br /> IMDb's comment at the moment states that the movie is sticking to a completely incorrect book. Julia is not present when Winston visits O'Brien, does not get involved in the Goldstien Brotherhood and does not confess his crimes. There is no obvious mention of the initial cases in which Winston finds an article with the Unperson, but there is a mention at the end, if you have not read the book, it is completely misleading. <br /> <br /> A horrible scenario that great acting can not save. It seems that Michael Radford completely overlooked the point that Orwell tried to create, and the electronic soundtrack is really awful.
