It is a pity that a really competent director, such as Andre de Toth, who specialized in slippery, changing alliances, did not get the idea first. He could help bring out real potential, especially with the interesting character played by William Bishop. As you can see in the film, it is rather a mess (according to reviewer Chipe). The main problems are the direction, cheap budget and bad scenario. Strength lies in a perfect cast and an interesting overall concept - characters pulled in different directions by contradictory forces. You needed someone with a vision sufficient to gather positive elements by working the script into a coherent whole, instead of the vast, clumsy mess it is (try to find out what the motivations and interrelationships are if you can). A larger budget could also match contrasting shots in locations and studios, as well as get locations outside the overexposing suburbs of Los Angeles. The real shame is in the loss of the perfect cast - Hayden, Taylor (before closing teeth), Dehner, Reeves, as well as James Millican and William Bishop shortly before their untimely death. Few films illustrate the importance of the author's vision more than this little-known West who could be something more in the right hands.
