Kirsten Dunst is terribly overrated as an actress. You can always say that it simply "works". I like Izzard, however. The plot is terribly boring. The viewer has no real connections with the characters, never knowing who to really sympathize with or even care for. Slow, boring movie, with a few laughs, but not so much fun. The plot is neither engaging nor uncertain. You can see that each queue of the plot is a mile away. What is the movie supposed to be like? Comedy? Drama? Who cares? Not really the movie.
