Theoretically, films should be a form of entertainment. This does not include documentary films and other experimental filming forms; Most films, especially genre films, must not only tell their story or message, but also have to entertain their audience in some way. All this to say that in my opinion a bad movie is not a film with low production values ​​or a low budget, a bad movie is one that is boring. <br /> <br /> "Hellborn" or "Asylum of the Damned", as you know in the United States, is a bad movie simply because it is simply not engaging, and irreversibly boring and tiring. Although it has a very good premise, it is simply poorly developed, and mediocre action does not improve the situation. On the other hand, the movie probably could have been a great or even classic B movie, but here it is just a bad attempt to make movies. <br /> <br /> Director Philip J. Jones tells the story of James Bishop (Matt Stasi), a young resident of psychiatry, who just got his dream job at the psychiatric hospital St. Andrew; but the old asylum seems to hide the secret. After the mysterious death of some patients and constant gossip about satanic practices, James decides to find out what's going on; only to discover the disbelief of his boss, Dr. McCort (Bruce Payne), who believes that Bishop is as crazy as his patients. <br /> <br /> Although the premise is quite interesting, making the film goes a long way to be desired. Trying to create a supernatural psychological thriller, Jones chooses an easy way out and creates a movie filled with every stereotype of the genre. Of course, there are many great films that are also filled with clichés; but in "Hellborn" each of them is wasted and turns into cheap fear to keep everything moving, resulting in a boring and predictable plot. <br /> <br /> Acting is mediocre, with one big exception: Bruce Payne gives a top-notch performance that makes the movie look so bad. Matt Stasi is very weak, because the main character and the rest of the cast do unforgettable performances. <br /> <br /> In spite of all these defects, write about "Hellborn"; it has a visual appearance that is very good for the budget and very similar to the modern holodisk production of Hollywod's horrors. Makeup and prosthetics are also done very well, and the designs of the main antagonist are quite good. Unfortunately, the other special effects are terrible and outdated, which is a huge contrast with makeup and prosthetics. <br /> <br /> "Hellborn" is a movie with a few good things that outweigh its serious drawbacks. terrible results. Fans of horror or b-hardcore may be interested in its assumption, but it is a boring and exhausting experience. 3/10
