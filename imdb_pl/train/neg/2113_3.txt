The virgins die at the altar, and their corpses die. No one knows why and who, but an investigative reporter (Luana Walters) notices that every bride wears a strange orchid and goes to talk with her creator, Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi). Now Dr. Lorenz is a mad scientist with strange habits, including sleeping in coffins and injecting his older wife (Elizabeth Russell) with a fluid young bride to keep her young. <br /> <br /> The corpse dies an interesting premise and short duration of action, which should not be boring. Unfortunately, although it starts quite well, it begins to drag before the halfway point and becomes quite boring with its clich√©s and predictable plot. <br /> <br /> There are a few good things about it - Bela Lugosi is adorable and evil and behaves splendidly; Elizabeth Russell is also a beautiful, polite, restrained and very terrifying countess; and I'm always a fan of Angelo Rossitto. Luana Walters is also convincing as a reporter here. <br /> <br /> It maintains a bit of a gothic atmosphere, and the sets are decent. <br /> <br /> But overall, I was not able to keep my interest in the whole picture and I have to assess it badly.
