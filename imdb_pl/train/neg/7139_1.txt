Redline is a fake Fast & Furious, without any advantages. It does not have to have a complicated plot with many twists and turns, but it needs SOMETHING! It is the equivalent of a porn movie in which the plot and dialogue consist of 60 seconds at the beginning and the same at the end. It's just that it's worse because you will not get the money. Stunningly boring, impossible racing sequences and terrible waste of expensive, beautiful cars that almost get negative points for appearing in this film. Sure, it's hot, but who is so desperate to have a woman on the screen? I feel that the director sat there with a hat full of dialogues and fragments of the story, and each time they switched scenes, he shook the ball 8. No serious person who does not know about it will watch this movie and will not enjoy the racing scenes.
