This movie was terrible and offended the viewer. Stupid script, bad casting, never-ending boredom. <br /> <br /> In line with the usual Hollywood tradition, the US government is shown as always angry. A communist nitwitch sympathetic in Hollywood, most of whom are as stupid as a rock crate, he loves to take a lonely note from Eugene McCarthy and imagine that he is the leader of a huge movement. The truth is that at that time he was considered a marginal figure who used legitimate concern for Soviet communists to achieve political profit. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and the United States has brought all these evil Nazis. Like Werner VonBraun, without which we would not have a space program. He actually loved being an American and became a great asset to the country. <br /> <br /> And yet the irony is that fools in Hollywood, uneducated people who live in fantasy, still believe that the government should lead ALL and give us everything we want. And yet it is the same government that they constantly portray as the perfect evil in such films.
