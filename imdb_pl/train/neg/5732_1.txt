I am for a "bad" horror, but it was just a pile of dogs! If someone can call this film cool or decent, it is beyond me. If you like thrown editing to cover special effects, bad acting and bad script, go to him! There was no tension, and the gore factor was funny because it was so false. I will take a Hostel or Wolf Creek for this pile every day. My partner gave up after about 20 minutes, he knows the stinker when he sees him. On the other hand, I was silly sitting in the whole movie just to wait and see if it improved. There is no happiness! I did not feel his second Torched movie, and I doubt if I'm going to be worried now.
