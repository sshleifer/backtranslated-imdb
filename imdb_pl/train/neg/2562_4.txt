Let me start by saying that this movie has one funny point at the beginning of the exchange between the narrator and George: Narrator: Huh? Wait a minute! Who the hell are you? George: I'm new George. Studio too cheap to pay Brendan Fraser. Narrator: How did you get the part? George: I think the new George is lucky. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's the only fun part in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It was still fun ... But on the other hand, it's easy to play ... <br /> <br /> I would not say it's the worst movie I've ever seen (this title goes to horribly un-entertaining catastrophic film ...), This movie is # 7 on my bottom list 15 <br /> <br /> If you are a small child who is easily entertained, you'll love this movie. If you're a movie watcher who wants a good, fun movie, you'll end up shooting yourself half way through this movie.
