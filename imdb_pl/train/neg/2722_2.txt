For the great thinkers among us, "Intruder" is a wildly inconsistent film from France, which gives so-called "artistic films". The story is a kind of bitter old coot, Louis Trebor (Michel Subor), who is looking for a heart transplant in Tahiti, but otherwise I have no idea who someone from the movie was or why they did what they did. There is no coherent plot that could boast, but the film loses us at the beginning, although I am completely ready to admit that there can be EVERYONE who actually gets some deep news from this film. <br /> <br /> This tangled drama about a snail's pace lasts two hours and five minutes - although I seriously doubt if anyone with any life will still be at the final points.
