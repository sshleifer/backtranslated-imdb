The original was a good movie. I bought it on tape and watched it several times. And although I know that the sequels are not usually as good as the original, I certainly did not expect such a bomb. The romance was flat, the view gagged, the humor was simply not. It may not have been the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's close.
