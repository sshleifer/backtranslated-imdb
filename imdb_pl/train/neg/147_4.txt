"Valentine" is another horror film that can be added to the film list of stems and slashes ("Halloween", "Friday the 13th", "Scream" and "I Know What You Did Last Summer"). It is certainly not as good as the films I mentioned, but it is better than most of the films that appeared after the first movie "Friday 13". One of these films was the Canadian movie My Bloody Valentine from 1981, which I hated. "Valentine" is a better movie than this one, but it does not say much. The plot: a nervous young boy is teased and mocked by several classmates at the beginning of the movie. Then the movie moves many years later, when all the colleagues are already adults, and then they are chosen one by one. It is assumed that the killer is a young boy who has now grown up, seeking revenge. But is he? Or maybe it could be someone else? "Valentine" has an attractive cast that includes Denise Richards, David Boreanaz, Marley Shelton, Jessica Capshaw and Katherine Heigl. They do what they can, thanks to their material, but the vague scenario does not really make them any justice. However, there are terrifying moments in it. <br /> <br /> ** (out of four)
