In 1988, Paperhouse was hailed as "the horror of a thinking man". Wow, you can say, register me. This is a mess. It consists of a former young actress who has a range from 1 to 2. G. Headley with a bad British accent and a story without shivers, emotions and spills. <br /> <br /> It's not even an interesting psycho-babble. We will just laugh at his cheap effects and miss Leprechaun 5. <br /> <br /> The story concerns a girl with a glandular fever that escapes in her dreams. What you get is not a good horror, a house of art, or even a decent addition after school. I found myself after a two-hour point saying ... where my two hours went. <br /> <br /> The direction is not very inspired and I regret that it can not be even pretentious ... something interesting ... it seems that the producers were on the list. <br /> <br /> Even in the dream world things are boring. <br /> <br /> Short not on it.
