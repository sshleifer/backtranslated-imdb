What a powerful start to the movie, when Julia Roberts is hit in the face by her insane and anal husband played by Patrick Bergin, and I felt ready to experience a powerful movie on the same level as The Burning Bed by Farrah Fawcett. Well, because the summary says that I was a mis-lead. This movie was not like the movie "The Burning Bed," which had power, and Farrah played the part of the woman you really felt and felt her pain and need to survive. Sleeping with the Enemy sailed away after the first act of cheap emotions, and Roberts went on her death to escape her husband and live in Iowa. Her husband initially believes he is dead, but he begins to suspect that he is still alive and sets out for her. The rest of the movie is basically a cat and a mouse game in which Julia gets a home in this small town in Iowa and changes her identity ... there is of course no mention of how she got the money, but at the moment I'm in the movie I did not care. He meets a guy (Mr. Nice wimpy) and falls in love with him, and her husband finally catches up with her, but not before he reorganizes the soup cans and straightens the kitchen. I assume that I will provide the public with cheap emotions. But I did not care if she was a wife because the movie, as I said, tricked the audience. If he stayed on the course, I could feel her and her situation. Of course my husband is killed, and everything is for little Mrs. Roberts. If only the real world was close ... See the Burning Bed and understand what a movie about domestic violence should look like.
