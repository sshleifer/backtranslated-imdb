This film does not even deserve one. It was a total waste of time. It was a waste of film and money. It was not offensive, but everything was provocative and disgusting. My spoiler is one that everyone should read. It is full of nakedness and a disgusting language. But not only that there is no plot line, the actors are terrible, the accents are terrible, the actors have little time, and I was even SATISFIED to watch this movie! <br /> <br /> The only reason I rented it was Brian van Holt (who by the way received only fifteen parts). I think it could have been a mistake in the positions of directors and editors, but they repeated the same segments two or three times, adding only a new sentence. <br /> <br /> A film similar to this is Eraser Head, probably the most disturbing movie. There is no storyline and it is not fun. Although he does not try to be funny. DO NOT WATCH ANY FILM.
