I agree with the previous commentary, the beginning of the movie is quite good, and you are wandering around what is to come ....... It's nothing. All open lines remain open; the two characters that initially seemed to matter, are completely omitted in the picture, except for 1 or 2 very short scenes. I wander, if Ilya would not do it better, just to leave them completely ... As for one other character, nothing happens to her. He simply visits some terrible place and suddenly the film is no longer about her, but about a few geriatric witches who spend days making dolls from bread, drinking homemade vodka and apparently flashing each other. Some may say that the film deals well with showing the breakdown of society, like IFFR judges, but for me it's just bad taste, bad camera work, bad script and terrifyingly bad direction. That's why I can not be as generous as my predecessor when it comes to rating: 1!
