I admit that I have quite disturbing feelings about ghost movies, and though sometimes I like this genre when it comes to horror, but when it comes to comedies, they really have to be crazy to be funny. "Over Her Dead Body" seems to treat the afterlife a bit too seriously, and in my opinion it fails to do so in almost every aspect that I can think of. The story is of course unbelievable and I could not convince me neither in the comic book nor in the sentimental record. The choice of the main actresses was awful. While Paul Rudd is at least handsome and looks like a nice guy, the taste of the dam in his form seems to require major improvements, because Eva Longoria seems too old for him (sorry), and Lake Bell seems too unattractive (again sorry). Romantic story without enough reason for romance results from failure from the beginning. Jason Biggs and Lindsey Sloane were in fact better, but they only had secondary roles. The rest is uninteresting and boring, with flat cinematographies and cheap gags borrowed from unsuccessful TV comedies. Nothing really worth seeing, nothing to remember.
