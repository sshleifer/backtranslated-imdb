The only reason I decided to give this shot was the presence of Oscar winner Ernest Borgnine. I can only say that it was the biggest loss of a good actor ever made. As far as I know, Borgnine was the ONLY actor. The other performances were so uniformly terrible, I'm surprised that the studio will actually pay "performers" for the performance. Combine this level of talent with the acting department with a story so crushing and bland that I thought that my eyes would bleed until the loans were rolling and you had an excellent cinematic disaster. Of course, the movie was made for children's viewers, and its merit was better than most of the original Disney Channel programs and similar child-focused networks. But honestly, it does not say much.
