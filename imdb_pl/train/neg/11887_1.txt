The world could end. Unfortunately, this movie has survived as another evidence that Canada is unable to create films that go beyond the limits. Maybe because all our really good people (Norman Jewison, Martin Short and others) go to Hollywood.) In fact, this too-bad movie has not been cast in this extremely pretentious and banal film. He could give him some credibility. The Canadian government should realize - and this movie is a great example - that flipping money into the channel does not result in good cinema. If people reaching these public funds had to compete, they would be forced to invent something valuable. Like them, they caused another sneering embarrassment.
