Users who rated this movie so high just did not see enough good movies to compare it. Have everyone been brainwashed? I rarely felt disappointed with the movie, and some of them must be associated with the absurd noise surrounding the movie. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, BU is just a pursuit movie. We pick him up at the end of one chase and go straight to the other. And another. And another. And another. Do you see the pattern appearing? There is virtually no time to "waste" the plot, character development or boring old reality. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the other two Bourne movies, you are very lost. If you have - we wish you got lost - somewhere far away from the cinema. <br /> <br /> The dispassionate style of Paul Greengrass worked exceptionally well on United 93, which was an overload of desperate sentiment, but on Bourne and his endless unhappiness they simply remove the viewer from his involvement in the character. He is running. He is jumping. Hits. He is blown up. Clean high buildings. Yada yada yada. Above all - he survives. He is experiencing a plastic Working Man who only makes the absurd acrobatics he pulls out more loose and free of any tension. So he leaves the building? So what? He will survive. Yawn. <br /> <br /> There is such a girl thrown into the mix, because the interest in Bourne's love died in the previous incarnation, but she is just a decoration. I saw more depth of character and lively dialogue in Captain Scarlet's episodes. <br /> <br /> Bourne's own journey after the literal discovery of herself is boring and shapeless and tells us nothing that we did not know from the first movie. He was turned into a killing machine. Great thing. He discovers his true identity. So what? There is no emotional resonance when it arises. <br /> <br /> The end of the "turn" is telegram and weak. Oh, honey, the more I think about this film, the more I hate it! I've already reduced my score to 4 while writing this comment! I'd better finish now before the slide is continued. <br /> <br /> I love a good action movie and I love a good thriller. The Bourne Ultimatum is not. It is a loud, tedious series of brilliant editions, funny sound effects and cartoon violence. <br /> <br /> The idea that "shows" the way to Bond's franchise is a complete shit. Casino Royale blows them out of the water.
