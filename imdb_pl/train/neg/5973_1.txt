This movie is another great example of what Jerry Bruckheimer, since about 1997, seems to be the best - it hyperfilms the film a year before its release and does not go through a high quality movie. I'm not a film critic, but this movie was as predictable as it appeared. Every attempt to joke, every attempt to emotion and a pathetic attempt at a love story was exactly what I predicted in my mind. Do yourself a favor and save money on it.
