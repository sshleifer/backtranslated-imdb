Holy, strange God all-pervading, powerful. This movie was so bad, I thought I was on drugs. In a bad way ... The action of the character is the poorest thing I have seen in a long time. This movie was more akin to Lord of the G-Strings, IMHO (it's a real movie). Most of the movie looked like a terrible green screen. My favorite part was that they are in a carriage and you can say that there is no horse. They run away from alien monsters and approach the same speed as fast jogging. Then he switches to a distant shot with an absurd CG horse. And generally CG seems to be incomparable with Beyond the Mind's Eye from 1992. I mean, really. It was like a terrible episode of Hercules, only without Kevin Sorbo, who would save the day. Worst. Movie. Always.
