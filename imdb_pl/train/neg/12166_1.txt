Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen - yes, she is related to Bruce), the killer from the first movie, again follows her old tricks. He is one of the advisers at Camp Rolling Hills. As long as the girls in the camp are nice and stay away from sex, drugs and curses are all right. But a few steps in the line and Angela kills them - breaking bad jokes all the time. <br /> <br /> The original "Sleepaway Camp" was a cruel and nasty splattering movie, but it had some good points. It is also cruel and nasty, but there are no good points. The plot has been made for death and it adds nothing new to the formula. There are a lot of blood murders here (people are burned alive, heads are cut off, throats are cut), but all blood is so false that it actually becomes comic. It's also the smallest number of campers I have ever seen, and virtually everyone is far too old for their roles (especially Higgins). As expected, there is free woman nudity (assured by incredibly unjustified Valerie Hartman) and obligatory team of a good girl / good boy (Renne Estevez and Tony Higgins). With the exception of Springsteen and Higgins, acting is poor - even according to the film standards of the slass. In this film there is also a cruel advantage, in which one character drowns in the outhouse! Boring and sick with a silly story, senseless nudity and evil gore. Skip it.
