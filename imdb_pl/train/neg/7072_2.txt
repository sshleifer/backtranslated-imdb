My title sums up this shit, which I should have taken into account when I saw it was Fred Olen Ray's movie - but I thought, "HE, IT CAN BE BETTER THAN HIS RUBBISH." It must be the worst movie ever shot in children. Acting was terrible, humor did not exist, the director was the worst I've ever seen and the special effects did not seem out of place in the Disney movie from the 50s. <br /> <br /> WHAT HAPPENED? DEE-WALLACE STONE! Who ever had such a promising career in the 80s. The movie veteran and former children's actor Russ Tamblyn was a terrible bad guy, and the budget was so low that he was unbelievable even as a movie for kids. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the 1999 sequel nor do I have to do it <br /> <br /> If you want a good movie for kids Watch "HONEY AND SHRUNK / BLEW UP THE KIDS / KID" OR ANY DISNEY MOVIE < br /> <br /> MY ASSESSMENT AS 19 YOU: - 2/10 <br /> <br /> RATING AS CHILDREN MOVIE: - 3/10 THE BEST!
