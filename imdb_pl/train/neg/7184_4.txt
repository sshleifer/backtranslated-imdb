It was not a really good movie. There were many unlikely and predictable things that happened during the movie ... but I think most reviewers skip the point, why this movie should be watched by a wide audience. THIS FILM WAS PRODUCED BY MAGIC JOHNSON! Is not that enough to inspire us all to watch this movie? The film made by the former NBA star does not come every day, you know. Beautifully stupid kids in a big house cut by psycho wielding an ax. Each film sailed out so that we would moan. Teen sex. All this was produced by MAGIC JOHNSON! I can not say enough about this movie! Using drugs for teenagers! College hijinx! All this was produced by MAGIC JOHNSON! Yippeeee!
