This movie is really awful. After watching the ad, I thought it might have its charm ... but it did not. Girls can not act and can not sing. The soundtrack for this movie is full of their songs and it's not a pretty sight, a horrible story, an incredible plot, one of the worst Disney films FAR !. Ally is not a bad actress in the movie Phil of the Future, so I do not know what happened at Cow Belles. And her sister, AJ, seems to just go to her sisters' "fame", and she has no talent at all. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, the girls finally learn the morality of the banality, but it is too late to save the film about the wreckage of the train. <br /> <br /> Awful
