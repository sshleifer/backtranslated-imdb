Hopelessly inept and boring movie in which characters stand in rooms or on a rocket ship and talk endlessly. One would think that things will start to increase during the exploration of Mars, but these scenes are filmed by a heavy red / orange filter that makes everything very cloudy. The Martian landscape / vegetation consists mainly of drawings, and the monsters are completely unconvincing. There are echoes of "Bride Of The Monster" when the heroine cautiously turns an octopus like a tentacle of a meat-eating plant before it begins to cast weakly, except that the Ed Wood movie is a hundred times more entertaining. It's better to wear earplugs while watching, otherwise the result of "sci-fi" music, repeated endlessly, will drive you crazy. If you can not sleep one night, insert it into the VCR and insomnia will be cured immediately.
