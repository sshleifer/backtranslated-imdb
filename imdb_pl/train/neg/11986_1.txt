What horrible writing and acting. Lack of personality. What, you can not make a good movie with one character? Hmm, it was done in Castaway with his own dialogue. <br /> <br /> So this kid is going on a trip to his father. The kid, Jason, takes the plane and the pilot has a heart attack and dies in the middle of the flight. The kid crashes into the lake and survives. Then he runs, surviving in the desert, until he is saved. <br /> <br /> During this time, he fights the bear twice. He fights with him in the lake for the first time. The second time he makes a spear from the branches and wanders with a bear. Two shots of artificial blood spurting from the bear's breast reminded me of Monty Python's "Holy Grail". <br /> <br /> Also the kid decides to dig a porcupine with predictable results. Gag.
