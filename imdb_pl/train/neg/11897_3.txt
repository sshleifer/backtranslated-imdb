Continuation of William Lustig's "Maniac" proves that without the spectacular effects of Tom Savini and the convincing representation of Spinella, "Maniac" would never become an iconic hit. "Vigilante" is poorly directed, with a simple script that says everything for you and is predictable at every step, as well as mediocre performances of all actors. Judging by the sense of "deja vu" that the movie gave me, Lustig watched "Death Wish" a few times before he did! (* 1/2)
