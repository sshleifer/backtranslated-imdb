I saw this movie and the other one. Trinity is my name and I think this one is worse than the first one. I have no idea why they even made another movie, it was stupid and senseless to say I have them all. I sat there many times and still forces me to turn it off for 5 minutes in the movie. I like Terence Hill movies and I like Bud Spencer, but this movie just brought me to the wall. If he had a different plot or at least a story and more comedy, it could be fun and worth the $ 5 I spent on buying all the movies. But you are making mistakes, so I would say that you will save money and do not say goodbye to this film or any of those who do not trust it.
