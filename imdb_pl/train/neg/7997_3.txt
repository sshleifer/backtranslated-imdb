Even in the case of a tired film model, in which the nature-man cycle prevailed, which predominated in the seventies, the ants do not even have enough effectiveness (though fun for reasons that they did not intend). It's sooooo ridiculous. Apparently, the ants that are bulldozed near the inn have been driving poisonous waste for decades and have now adapted to the emission of poisonous bites - hundreds of these bites are deadly. Watching actors who are not well-known for clumsily falling among small black spots is painfully funny in not very good but very bad way. So many scenes just look ridiculous: the boy tries to fall into the trash during the attack, Suzanne Sommers screams in horror while sleeping in bed, Robert Foxworth and Lynda George breathe pieces of wallpaper, Bernie Casey pretends the range and the list goes on and on. The threat shown ranges from ants crawling from the runoff to black lines of ants on the walls. The cast of the film is not bad on paper, but none of these actors believe in the material. Throughout this terror, poor Myrna Loy must sit in a wheelchair. I hope that she has found good use of money, because it is obvious that this was the only reason why a woman of her lineage would be in this nonsense. Although it is a pretty bad movie, you can watch it - once for me, and has many of those bad qualities from the seventies - novice actors embarrassing themselves, feeling on TV and scary creatures smelling vengeance on a man. This time, a man has to push his hand into the pile of ants that will be touched. Really pretty terrible.
