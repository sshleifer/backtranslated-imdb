I was following this movie because it is a remake of the 70s children's series "Escape into the night", which, although sometimes chaotic and stiff, was definitely strange, fascinating and disturbing. Acting at the "Paperhouse" is wooden, unintentionally joking. Overdubs did not add tension, only strengthened that I was sitting watching the loser. Casting irritated the gloomy dialogue, which resulted in lack of warmth, chemistry or conviction. Like most weak movies, there are a few good supporting acts that these people should console, comfort and ensure that they are not held accountable. Of all the possible endings, the most unexpected was chosen ... lamer than I could have imagined. <br /> <br /> "Escape into Night" deserves the right remake, written by someone with life experience and a subtle mind directed.
