This movie reminded me of these lame "erotic thrillers" in which I sat late and watched Cinemax when I was 13 years old. I would mark this movement with a soft core because there is no simulated impact and grinding. However, there are plenty of nudity - the opening scene is in a strip club, we see Kester Kane Hodder (or at least stunt), then an inexplicable 10-minute lesbian dance scene in the middle of the movie and a nude female werewolf who looks like they have Munster for the costume. 13-year-old boys rejoice. <br /> <br /> In addition, werewolf transformation scenes have the worst CGI that I've seen for years. The photos look like FMV from the Resident Evil video game in terms of quality. The wolf is too bad to explain, and despite the poor quality of the suit, it is shown too many times. <br /> <br /> The plot and acting do not make sense. There is a strange story about werewolves and hybrid werewolves - the latter is the latter, but from what I can say, hybrids do the same as all werewolves - they look like humans, turn into wolves and kill people. Darkwolf tries to find a partner, but strangely can not find a partner, but he can smell everyone he touches. Once again, these skills prove to be less useful because Darkwolf will end up killing some people whose goal he has never touched, never met or even seen as well as I can. The partner does not know that he is a werewolf and he is struggling with transformation or something like that. <br /> <br /> You'd think it would be difficult to mess up a simple movie about monsters that's bad, but oh well. You want a high quality werewolf from the lowest shelf, go to rent. Soldiers-dogs want a lot of T & A.
