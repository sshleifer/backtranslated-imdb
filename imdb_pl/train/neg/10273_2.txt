When it comes to horror movies, I am more than willing to suspend disbelief, ignore the sub-par of the value of production and overlook holes in the interest of good fear. These movies simply do not have anything good to offer. You can not even admire it as a camp. Bad dialogue, bad acting, wrong direction, killings were predictable and badly staged, music was irritating, camera work was miserable, even the costumes were bad. I felt very bad for the actors who apparently tried, but who were dealing with a terrible, imagined dialogue and obvious lack of guidance. I also doubt that they will have any attempt. Watching is embarrassing, and boring than reaching the imaginary end of a "surprise" requires enormous strength. It's quite easy one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I usually do not write reviews, but this one was so bad that I felt compelled to warn others. This movie is a complete waste of time. If you need to watch this movie, do not miss the "Making of" -featurette. It seems that the screenwriter / director has the impression that making a killer woman was a brave, bold move. (Seeing this.) He and the cast spend half an hour deconstructing this movie, as if it were a new "citizen of Kane." It's like listening to a group of third grade students, taking you backstage to their festive procession. They really think they created something from a substance. It's sad, really ?? The only reason I gave this movie "2" is because I think "1" should be reserved for real atrocities like "Manos: Hands of Fate" and "Space Mutiny". So "American Nightmare" is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I have to say it's somewhere down the middle of fifty.
