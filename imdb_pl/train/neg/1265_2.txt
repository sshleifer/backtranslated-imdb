For the first time, I did not want to watch this movie because the trailer seemed like a joint and overly-anticipated movie ... but as recently I had the pleasure of discovering the surprising "Mensonges et Trahisons et plus si affinité", which was beautifully directed and written by Laurent Tirard (screenwriter "Prête-moi ta main"), I changed my mind and decided to give it a try, thinking that "Prête-moi ta main" would be just as good as "mensonges ..." And that's absolutely not, the script is not bad, but it's not like that well-oriented like "Mensonges ..." and the actors are not so generous (especially Charlotte, boring as usual) as Edouard Baer or Clovis Cornillac I, to be honest, I still do not understand how such nonsense can be so successful, even with a casting ... Anyway, history could be an excuse to create so many interesting threads, but it's not as good as "Tirard Mensonges ..." st written by him, easy, not surprising and lazy work.
