Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober) is a student of Satan / serial killer who has the "First Power": even after detecting Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) and shooting in a gas chamber, he is able to move his spirit body to the body and continue to murder according to will. With the help of the attractive psyche Tess Seaton (Tracy Griffith, half sister Melanie G.), she tries to stop Channing. <br /> <br /> This concept probably had some possibilities, but I think that ultimately "The First Power" suffers from routine scripts and making movies. It's nothing we have not seen before, sometimes better. There is nothing in this movie that would distinguish it from other supernatural horror thrillers. What's more, it is not too exciting and it is certainly not terrifying. Phillips is difficult to sell as hard as nails, cynical cop stereotype, and Griffith does not seem too difficult; the best member of the cast is probably clearly Kober, trying to be as frightening as possible. <br /> <br /> The climax is rather stupid and the ending is very weak. <br /> <br /> Not even acceptable for an average video of this kind, which is why: <br /> <br /> 4/10
