I rarely comment on films, but I have read other comments and I can not believe that there are people who applaud these celluloid trash. I know that there are some people who have their own program, but let it be a merit; he acted badly, he shot badly, and the story was felt when the director caught up. I do not intend to focus on the sexual aspect of the movie in which young children participate because the filmmakers apparently knew what the audience wanted and what they wanted. I can only say that it is a terrible movie, the content is poor and offensive, the production is amateur and I am glad that they could not make such a movie legally today
