OK - helicopter pictures are fantastic, and the director has made good use of some of the most important monuments of Barcelona. Otherwise ... the value of production was blown up in the first few minutes, and the rest of the movie was like the movie of the week. Ellen Pompeo was cute and fun to watch, Abel Folk had the deepest depth and was very effective, and William Baldwin was ... well, William Baldwin. He must use his martial arts training well and be a figure for running and jumping. The rest of the cast was at best wooden, but mainly paper. So - if you have nostalgia for Spain - it's a picture postcard with an action and a healthy dose of El Greco. If not, skip this.
