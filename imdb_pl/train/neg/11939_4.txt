I'll tell you something about this movie. I saw it twice. I was a child for the first time, and the movie was quite funny for me. I really liked it. I thought it was fun and interesting, and the main character was pretty cool. <br /> <br /> I saw it a few days ago. That was awful. Really. I do not know why I thought it was fun, but now ... I did not laugh at all. There was not even anything funny. It was just stupid. The story was poor. Acting was nothing special. There are great actors in this movie, but nonetheless acting is mediocre at best. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that this movie is racist. Really. Do not get me wrong, I usually do not complain about racism in movies. However, I have seen people complaining about the lack of black men in movies such as "Shaolin Temple" or the fact that the only black man in "The Street Fighter" is one of the bad guys or ... point. People see racism everywhere. I wonder how they would react to a movie such as "Meteora Man". Why? I'll tell you why. There are no Asians in this movie. Among the good there are no white people. In fact, there is only one white guy in the whole movie and is the leader of bad guys. All good people are African American. Do not get me wrong, I do not care if a good guy is black or white, yellow or pink or green ... What I care about is the fact that we barely see the white person in this movie. It's the only movie I've ever seen. It simply is not realistic. If there is only one black man in the Japanese film, as in the case of "Street Fighter", there is no problem - in Japan most people are Asians. But if there is only one white man in the American film, there is a problem - in the US, most people are white. It's like filming a Japanese movie with a completely white cast and only one Asian as a bad guy. Only not real. <br /> <br /> That's it. I give the film a 4/10 pace. It would be 1/10 if I did not play with him as a child.
