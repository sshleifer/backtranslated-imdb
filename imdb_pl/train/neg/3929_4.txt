If all that Watchowski has to offer in relation to the Matrix story, I really have to question the claims of all fans who believe that movies are to register at a deeper level. The second renaissance, though visually stunning and beautiful, is narrated historically and absurdly. How many times have we heard the story of people who rely too much on technology, people who are too eager for war, people basically destroy themselves? There is nothing new here. And I have another question. Considering the plot of the second Renaissance, does not it make machines good ?! Machines have been oppressed for generations by their cruel human guardians. They fight, they win freedom and seek to establish a peaceful, harmonious co-existence with people who reject them in favor of the ubiquitous war, which the smarter machines win naturally. If this is history, then we should not cheer on Neo, we should cheer on the machines! People were cruel and troublesome while the machines were bold and considered compassionate. Because I do not believe that Watchowski intends to favor machines over people, I must believe that the Second Renaissance was simply a mistaken attempt to create a story.
