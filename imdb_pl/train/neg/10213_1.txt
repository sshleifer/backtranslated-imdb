It seemed that many people liked this film, so I feel a bit wrong giving it a bad opinion. But after 96 minutes I feel that I have to do it. Where the hell is the story of this movie ?! I had to miss it, I waited for the story to unfold and nothing would happen. Sure, the ending was "a bit shocking" but it did not quite contribute to it. I forgot who is who for half the time, so they did not develop the character. Acting was so-so, most of the time it was reliable, but most of the time I was able to see through it. So ... without betraying anything, I must say that if you do not like the actors in the movie, there is no real reason to watch this movie. I could be wrong, but I just did not understand why there was so little or too much movie. I can not decide which one would be, so I'm talking for myself. I do not even know if renting is a good idea, cost and everything ... <br /> <br /> Plot: 0/10 Characters: 1/10 Acting: 2/10 Overall: 3/10 I feel that it really is high, I stay with my vote at the top.
