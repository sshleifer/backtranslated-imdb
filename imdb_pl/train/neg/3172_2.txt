This movie is cheesy, unoriginal trash. Sometimes I like romantic comedies. Watching a good one is like eating ice cream for dinner. It is not something you intend to do all the time, but the experience is so pleasant that you can ignore how foolish you are. This movie made me think about how stupid I was to stay seated the whole time. Everything about it screamed cheap. It seems that at certain points they have overexposed a film that is so washed out. It also offers bad CGI and lame sets. <br /> <br /> Writing was clumsy. I know that you can usually expect problems with the plot in a screw comedy, but usually you do not care about it because you laugh. This movie is so indecent that you are actually sitting there and wondering about an incredible series of coincidences and absolutely incredible behavior. Events have been placed in the film to move characters from one scene to another or provide an exposure. Sure, that's how all the videos work, but you should not notice that this is happening. Inelegant. This is the term that I should use. <br /> <br /> There was hardly anyone in the film who would be very nice. I did not care who ended up with whom, as long as everyone stayed away from me, and I did not have to listen to them to talk about it. Why would the only really cool character in the movie, Paul Rudd's character, want to have anything to do with the completely bizarre, condescending, controlling maniac Eva Longoria played? In addition, almost all involved characters consistently chose the funniest solution in every situation. A simple man pretends to be gay for five years to spend time (and take a bath) with the woman he is attracted to? The best moment in which they could feel was the attachment to the happy ending of the same schmoe, in which he meets the equally annoying lie Rudd, the kleptomaniac's sister? Lake Bell and Eva Longoria are very attractive, attractive women. Maybe they will find something better to appear on the road.
