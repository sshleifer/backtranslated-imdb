Anyone who said it was better than Hostel says completely nonsense, believe me that I'm not a fan of the hostel, but it's just ridiculous. It's just another shot on the camera, straight to the DVD, without wasting time on ideas, I can not believe how many of these movies are, and I still do not see decent. In the 80s, movies, movies and horror movies were created without a budget, but a great story and lots of new ideas, and above all the heart and soul of the director who had something to say. Now they seem to be pumped out, trying to get people to browse in Blockbuster to borrow a copy until people stop doing it, and I think these movies will appear. This movie has so few ideas that it's just amazing, as it ever was, the acting is also terrible, the location is totally unconvincing, and the soundtrack is so irritating that it does not believe. This waste of time has absolutely nothing to do unless you're going to compile a list of the worst movies of all time. My best / worst part of the movie is a situation in which a female character points a gun to someone and threatens to shoot them if they do not turn back. You can see that he does not even cover the trigger with his finger, only holding the handle. An absolute joke.
