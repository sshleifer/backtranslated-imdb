If I have to give the film a score on a linear scale, I have to give it a low score of 3/10. <br /> <br /> But it was fun and there are some good things to say about the movie. <br /> <br /> A candidate for psychiatrist James Bishop is assigned to the St. Andrews for his resident and is driven away and eager to "change the world". <br /> <br /> From the beginning, the film knows that the hospital is hiding the wrong truth, but James thinks he can change something and does not recognize this evil. <br /> <br /> The story builds up quite well, you know all the time that what the patients say about the bad resident is true and you wonder when and how James will discover it. Also, when the break comes, James is in some way pursued by evil and you feel some tension until the "fight" is over. <br /> <br /> Add an innocent beautiful girl who will come in the worst possible time and other standard elements of horror, and you will get a picture. <br /> <br /> Gathering characters is actually quite good, you get to know the majority of people who will be killed, and some of them will "get to know". <br /> <br /> The movie marks an unpleasant scene, it is also quite good. There are secrets that are revealed - in an acceptable way. <br /> <br /> The main character, James, is very credible - the story of a willing student who starts working is good in this setting. <br /> <br /> What kills this movie is: * Stupid special effects - a modern version of 'Plan 9 from space' - bad type (evil monster looks like a red scarecrow) * Some bad behavior (or probably very little when filming) - Heroes sometimes behave badly and sometimes good. * The sound is sometimes very cheap. <br /> <br /> I always thought that "I could make a movie using a home video camera".
