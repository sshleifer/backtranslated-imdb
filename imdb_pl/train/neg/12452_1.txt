This movie is so bad that I can not even describe it. What is wrong with the writers, producers and director in the burning cave? How the hell did they get the funds for this abomination? The plot is funny, acting at best bad, history ... What story? The first fight in this movie is OK, but then it repeats until you want to turn it off. <br /> <br /> I think I'm the biggest loser that I will not turn this stupid movie off after the first minute. <br /> <br /> *** SPOLER ALERT *** <br /> <br /> I only saw this movie because Scott Adkins was in it ... and it's in it ... for 30 seconds. .. <br /> <br /> I give it 1 in 10, because it is the lowest level IMDb that has to offer. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor: instead, see the Uwe Bolla movie ... twice ... it's more worthy of your time.
