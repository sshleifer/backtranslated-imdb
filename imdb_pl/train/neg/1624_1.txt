I saw this movie a few years ago. I could not sleep and there was nothing. So I looked. What really sets me does not make sense and that is why it is disturbing. Richard is tied to a chicken wire, and Jarvis begins with Richard's girlfriend when she is unconscious. Then Jarvis's buddy, Troubador, plays some stupid song on his guitar. The next morning, he shows Richard's girlfriend the conversation with Jarvis and Trouby, and then he returns to Richard and looks at him while he is still tied up. Then they play some happy music and the movie is finished. I mean what happened? Did they brake? And what did she say to those two guys (Trouby and Jarvis)? It is mysterious and poor. I can not stand movies that are disturbing and do not make sense. It was the worst movie I've seen since the 90s in the Lord of the Flies version.
