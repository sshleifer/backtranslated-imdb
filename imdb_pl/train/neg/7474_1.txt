This program did not do it for me, although I am a fan of this genre. The main factor that disappointed me was that there was not one scene that would not be dominated by the main character. It made it a bit two-dimensional and I gave up before the program ended. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that I would leave my critic there because I am not a film critic, but IMDb guidelines say you need to put 10 lines of comment. It reminded me of Hudson Hawka in the way the main character is in every scene, and I hope that the authors of this program could be more involved in contact with viewers. I do not doubt the talent of any cast and crew, just after watching things like "wire", I started to expect great things from the cop's drama.
