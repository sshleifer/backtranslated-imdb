Hearing about how funny this movie is, I finally rent it in a <br /> <br /> video store and maybe for 75 minutes I laughed 3 times. This film <br /> <br />, a set of skits that make fun of television, is an unrestrained mess. <br /> <br /> Dowcipy upadajÄ…, humor deals with <br /> <br /> issues from the 70s, which simply are not important anymore, and <br /> <br /> jokes go too long (almost like new SNL jumps <br /> <br /> for the last few years). Yes, Chevy Chase is in it, but maybe all <br /> <br /> about 1 or 2 minutes. I liked the fact that it was very <br /> <br /> lewd and full of nakedness, but could not it be fun? Do you own and rent a Kentucky Fried Movie yourself? <br /> <br />
