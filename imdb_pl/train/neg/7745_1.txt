Where to start? special effects should be called special defects. When the director shouted "acting," I think he also showed the actors to perform the worst performance they could come up with. Maybe he was annoyed with the producers and wanted to make sure that they would not get back a cent of the investment, and the work would be a case study, like not making a movie. Or maybe he hated art school and wanted to become an accountant, but his family did not let him. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is sure that whoever employs him in the future is because he is in love with him (so his objectivity jumped through the window) or because he changed his name and removed all previous previous references.
