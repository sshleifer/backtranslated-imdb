What this film does is a combination of action and horror with comedy and drama in a unique way that irritates more emotions from the audience than a typical horror movie. Unfortunately, with the chaotic story telling, frustrating story holes and contradictory scenes, this movie caused frustration above all and is not "the biggest movie about monsters". <br /> <br /> Let's start with the good things: comedy, acting and special effects. From the very beginning, this movie starts quickly and brazenly. The opening scene - the origin of the monster - is camp and fast, paying tribute to the classic "environmental" disasters that spawned so many other monsters. The pace is fast, which was a welcome break in the long and often pointless dramatic opening scene from other monsters and allows the movie to jump into action. Within 10 minutes you will receive "why", "where" and "how" the beast and you are ready to act. In this video you can see. <br /> <br /> After another short and well-made sequence, the characters appear: a lazy son and his prematurely born little girl, a nice grandfather and a talented sister (aunt) and, of course, a monster. Characters are introduced in context to each other, and their conflicts are immediately visible, allowing viewers to feel them when the monster appears suddenly to wreak havoc around the river where they live and work. <br /> <br /> The monster is great: alien, and also familiar - a bit like a dog and a fish dug by a squid. The effects of creation are unmatched and, although it looks strange, it is reliable and you can not "see its strings" at any moment. Even the monster's movement was terribly familiar, like a growing and excited rottweiler on linoleum, the monster barrels through the crowd, sliding across surfaces, crushing and eating those on its way. When the path of the monster crosses the family and the tragedy makes it really a painful moment, you can feel the need for revenge, but from that moment the appeal of the film begins to fall apart. <br /> <br /> After the beginning of dynamite, the film quickly loses focus and continuity. The story lines are introduced and then abandoned, the characters change their position for no apparent reason, and the comedy interweaves into dramatic scenes misleading intentions, while the obstacles appear and disappear on the surface seemingly random. <br /> <br /> When it comes to comedy, let me say this: I'm willing to accept the fact that a lot of humor is probably cultural. I do not know Korean humor, so maybe things have been lost in translation. However, as he studied in Asian studies and as someone who has lived in Japan for 5 years (still here), I would like to think that I understand Asian humor better than the average white guy. Saying that there were many parts of the movie that I understood were meant to be funny, but they were not for me. <br /> <br /> *********** SPOILER ************* For example: after the initial attack in which a young daughter was killed, the family is in Burial ; everyone regrets. A new character has been introduced - a brother - and the tension increases even more when it becomes obvious that both brothers are in conflict with each other. They both start to grieve over the loss and compete with each other for who is more sad. This competition is essentially funny: two brothers who do not like each other so much that they even compete at the funeral - show the spiny nature of family love common in Asian comedy. This subtle slap-stick comedy is joking about family and ritualized mourning to be fun, but it seemed really out of place in the context of a lost girl. ************** END SPOILER ************** <br /> <br /> Then come the holes in the storyline. there are so many points in this film that are never explained, or worse, they are explained and disturbed only to finally prove powerless and pointless. Finding an obstacle is not a hindrance, it can be a good thing for a character, but you can expect some comments to this nature. Instead, the audience is restrained by moments of counteracting the culmination when the problems no longer "exist" and no one gives any indication that it has ever been a problem. So I'm asking: why educate at all? <br /> <br /> It was common throughout the film because problems gave birth to new problems and suddenly the world of film is full of opposing forces that have never been solved. Of course, introducing new and larger problems is a proven story that tells the story, but if the introduction of a new arc leads to a forced shortening of the second arc, one would expect the new arch to get a full explanation. Not in this movie. Instead, it was as if you were getting a few stories, each of which explained only 20% of the way, and eventually the parts never coincided to complete the whole. <br /> <br /> Again, I am willing to accept many of them can be "cultural". Maybe in the Korean tradition of telling stories to put a comedy in tragedy. It may be normal that stories go all the way like a child who stains off the lines on each page, but never ends. It may be fine to present a problem to develop the plot, but then remove this problem at random without any visible solution or catharsis. Or maybe these are all the features of sloppy work and an incorrect story growing in a film that seems to have a much better reputation than it deserves.
