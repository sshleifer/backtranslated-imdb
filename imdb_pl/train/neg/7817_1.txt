at the beginning I was happy to know about the new Superman movie, but it will be great, but it was not. <br /> <br /> is a bad copy of Richard Donner's work, Lex is again a villain doing nothing more, not even Kevin's spice. <br /> <br /> bad plan is very much the same as in the first Donner movie. <br /> <br /> the script is predictable and simple (all things found by Luthor in a museum or an old lady). <br /> <br /> the story is bad, it must be Kevin Smith's script and it can be better. <br /> <br /> I just hope to continue without Brian Singer and the new director of talents to do something new, not a copy. <br /> <br /> everyone reads later
