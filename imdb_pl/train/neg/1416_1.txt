Strange ... I like the whole film crew and movies with dark humor; but I did not like it! It's awful, horrible and certainly not fun. Pity can not do the whole story, disgust too. And it was really boring. Long empty moments fill the film; he could be removed. Certainly it should be in a different shorter format. Maybe I expected too much from the crew - like saving a movie lol -. It is also filled with abused stereotypes of characters and situations ... I do not understand why people liked it ... "Poetry", "hope"; nope 'I have not seen anything like that! ^^ In total, it is empty and harsh, pathetic and hopeless. Oh, damn this ........
