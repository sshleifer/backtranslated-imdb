This movie looked good at first, but it never lived up to its expectations. The director is talented, has good camera angles and artistic ideas (typical for Asian directors), but he does not know how to create or tell a good story that could connect to him. The story was fragmentary and seemed to run in different directions throughout the film, never finding a solid, expansive and interesting angle. Essentially, the movie never matches the explanations in press releases. However, acting was very good. All the actors gave good performances, and Jude Law was outstanding as always. It is a pity that he chose such a weak film.
