I went to pre-selection of this movie and was shocked at how bad it was. It was a combination of every stereotype of horror / thriller, trying to comment on many things, including pedophilia, worship of Satan, secret cops, affairs, religion ... and it was a mess. the acting was pretty washing; Jesus' kid and dude were okay, but outside of them ... Anyway. I admire the effort (though it failed a bit) in an attempt to show Christians in a different way ... although they did, the way in which they presented the Gospel was a bit spare and childish. But on the other hand, it may be because he was talking to a small child ... no. I actually decided that all this is wrong. music ... oh my God ... terrible ... it's too dramatic. Fine. I felt bad for the people who made this film at the premiere; It looked like a bad student project. I will stop talking about it now and say what is the most important thing, go and see this movie if you want to waste an hour and fifty minutes of your life. Here you are.
