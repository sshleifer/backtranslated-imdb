There are many things wrong in this movie. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, the first twenty minutes of the movie could be compressed in just five or maybe ten. The whole film is (fortunately) short, but it could be made up, devoting a bit more attention to Mean Lion (how did you miss the reference to "The Wiz" on this one?) And working on his story and a little closer to the main story. In short, the script had the germ of a good idea, but it needed a lot of changes. <br /> <br /> Second, he could do it without primitive humor. The original also had some elements that he could do without, but at least it was not much of a thought - here the flatulence and urination abound. <br /> <br /> Third, the performance is a bit too conscious. The original series was as good as the first movie, but here is just a way, much too much. Brendan Fraser's jokes were a bit exaggerated (and why not mention the "new Urszula"?). Other gags with Narrator, especially some interactions at the end, also go beyond reason. <br /> <br /> Fourthly, a little more attention could be devoted to the work of CGI. At first it was difficult to say that Shemp was not a real elephant (except of course the behavior), but here CGI stands out like a sore thumb. Ideally, special effects should simply tell the story whether they are good or bad, or at least be successful in this number, so it is a relatively small problem, but it still exists. <br /> <br /> All this said, Christopher Showerman's performance as George is decent enough. He lacks the charm of Brendan Fraser, but Christopher really fails in this particular comparison - he even managed to give George a bit of personal depth, which should be a serious foul in the film inspired by Jay Ward, but he was not there. Julie Benz as the new Ursula surprised me as even better than Leslie Mann in the original. <br /> <br /> Most of the other performances were quite standard, not distinguishing in my opinion as good or bad.
