Pet Sematary, although a nice horror movie from the 80's, with a nice director and atmosphere, is a copy of the Italian ZEDER movie by Pupi Avati. It is clear that Stephen King copied almost all of the director's ideas (the film Zeder was written before the king wrote the book) <br /> <br /> Cat, land, everything has been copied, it's a plagiary case, but being Stephen Kind, a famous American writer, it's perfectly normal to deal with it, of course, because of the huge difference between this kind of Italian films without any budget (and in part, the same shit ...) but the original idea, I repeat, is the Italian director Avati <br /> <br /> Let the world find out
