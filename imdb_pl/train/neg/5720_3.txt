Some gorehound friends have recommended "Live Feed" for me and basically I can not complain because the movie certainly provides abundant pigs and buckets full of insanity, but of course this is not a very good movie. Ryan Nicholson, in addition to the obvious use of the latest trend in the cinema of horror, the so-called Torture Porn, tries to outdo any other film in this sub-genre (and includes models to follow "Hostel" and "Saw") with his sick and twisted makeup effects and the carefully depraved shots of the naked co-religionists tried, suffering and pleading for their lives. There is no real story to describe. Five completely brainless twenty-something friends go on a trip to Asia. One of them has Asian roots, but otherwise I do not know why they decided to travel instead of Cancun. They are not clearly interested in the culture of the continents, and even cause a feverish scene when they witness a local slaughter dog on the market. The quintet then submerges into the nightlife and one of them accidentally offends the criminal's clan leader. Simply apologies are clearly not enough, because the gangster follows them to the adult theater and gradually subjects them to all cruel tortures. One girl has pierced her breast and the other poor maid even has a poisonous snake thrust into her throat; yikes. "Live Feed" is surprisingly boring in spite of all bloodshed, and amateur production values ​​are hard to miss, even if you're used to watching an independent cinema with fans. The thick guy presented on the cover, the oriental S & M cat, is indeed pretty cool, and also the most talented of the whole group, because he keeps his mouth closed all the time. I would not recommend this pile of dirt exactly, but hey, if you like loud and hideous metal music, bland recordings of torture and depressed losers, go straight and see!
