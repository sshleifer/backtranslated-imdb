It's kind of a genre, which means you like musicals from the '50s or not. If you do, you'll love it. Personally, I prefer musicals from the 30's and 40's with dance talents of Astaire and Rogers, Eleanor Powell, Bill Robinson, Ruby Keeler, James Cagney, Shirley Temple and so on, but songs from the 1950s, slower Dance and soap numbers melodramas of the decade discourage me all. <br /> <br /> This movie is the starting point. The first song was fine, but the next three did nothing for me. Until then, the story did not have too much appeal. The presence of Deborah Kerr is another minus. I do not think I saw the movie in which she played, which I liked, including the one in which a good-natured English teacher with two shoes, who presents, spends half the movie, threatening to leave Siam. (And what she had!). <br /> <br /> However, separating from sympathy and dislike, it can not be denied that Rogers' and Hammerstein's production is very attractive to many people, especially those who liked The Sound Of Music ten years later. There are similarities in R & H musicals. So, if you like Julie Andrews, you'll like it too. <br /> <br /> This is a generous production with, yes, a big "L." It's a kind of big musicals that you've rarely seen after this generation. You also get dubbed singers, in contrast to today's, in which the actress is not able to really sing, so Marnie Nixon comes to the rescue of Kerr, as she did with Natalie Wood in "West Side Story" and Audrey Hepburn in "My Fair Lady. "<br /> <br /> Yul Brynner is" King Mongkut "and is a stereotypical traditionalist, nice filmmakers always portray negatively. It is not "progressive" like leftists, but the education teacher (Kerr, as "Anna Leonowens") straightens him. Secular advocates always put teachers above people trying to cure cancer! However, Yul is good in this role, and even employs some comedy with his character more barking than bitten. He is rightly the big star of this film. Brynner had magnetism. Even in "The Magnificent Seven", Yul was the only cowboy who hypnotized the audience. <br /> <br /> In summary, this is a great movie for this day and millions of people liked it. I will leave it.
