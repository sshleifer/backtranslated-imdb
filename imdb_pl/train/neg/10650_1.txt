This film is without a doubt the worst horror I have ever seen. And that says a lot, considering I've seen stinking people like Demon of Paradise, Lovers' Lane and Bloody Murder (which is close to a second). However, I love bad horror movies, and as you can say from my username, this one really sticks out. Sometimes there is nothing more fun than a poorly made slasher. As for the film, the opening scene in which the woman gets fried in the tanning booth does not seem to have any impact on the film, especially since the film does not say that the event took place two years before the rest of the movie. Acting does not exist, and most of the camera shots concern the areas of women who are shrinking wrapped in spandex. The policeman was the most stony, monotonous actor I've ever seen. However, the best / worst part of this movie must be a crime weapon. A giant safety pin ?! What were they thinking? Who is the killer? Unhappy employee "Huggies"? I would have to give this film a total of zero, but I wish I watched it
