The dance was probably ONLY the watchful thing in this movie - and even that was disappointing compared to other movies. My gawd! <br /> <br /> For me, this is the worst kind of film - one that assumes that it is a work of art, because it has all the advantages of film-art. Yes, it is beautifully photographed, but ultimately lacks the depth and tension of the dance around which the film is supposedly surrounding. Tango is a tease, it's hot, it has a drama, it's bold - exactly what this movie is not.
