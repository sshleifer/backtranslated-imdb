This film is the modest effort of Spike Lee. He is capable of something much larger than this movie. Take a bus, while seemingly anti-racist, it does nothing but criticize whites and degrade the black status quo. The plot of this film tells the story of a group of black men who travel by bus to Louis Farrakhan's march. The bus has every kind of person imaginable: gays, Muslims, gangbangers and uncle Tom (but he is thrown off the bus). There was only one white person on the bus. He was accused of being a racist when he got on the bus to go. Despite being a Jew and the fact that he explained that he is a racist and leaves the bus. This should not be seen as a triumph but a sad disappointment. You may think that I am a racist for writing this, but I mean well. Better luck next time Spike.
