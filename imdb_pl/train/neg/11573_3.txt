I came here for a review before I decided which television movie to set up before, and those I thought would make this movie unmissable. How I feel deceived! <br /> <br /> First of all, pay attention to the fact that it is a movie during the day for a housewife. The performances are wooden, each sentence is an attempt at the "moving" way that there are always housewives and soap operas, and is based on this predictable and trodden assumption that men (especially soldiers) are basically brutal and indecent. The whole film is about the "drama" seen in the moments in which male characters threaten the development of the second dimension. <br /> <br /> If it sounds tolerable (or even pleasant) to you, be careful. Lindy Hamilton's German accent, though quite good, distracts - just like her face for some reason. Other performances are undoubtedly a permanent source of embarrassment for the perpetrators, with painfully thin and obvious characteristics on the agenda. There are a few surprises, but watch out for the endless supply of food and drinks "Monty Pythonesque", which miraculously appear on the backpacks of hungry soldiers! <br /> <br /> I did not expect the action, but I was counting on beautiful or textural or emotionally charged. What I got was a particularly bad story about the "Christmas mood" in which an intelligent audience would be huddled with it all. <br /> <br /> Observe this in the following circumstances: 1: There is nothing else. 2: You are a fan of a predictable "housewife takes over men and wins" television films. 3: The only way to appreciate true history is that Hollywood turns it into a feature film. 4: You have absorbed enough of emotions that your emotions easily move unsophisticated stories.
