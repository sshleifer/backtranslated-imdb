The mystery is solved very early and the film becomes a simple romance. I almost stopped watching him after 5 minutes, 10 minutes and the first break. My husband, who is a fan of Hallmark & ​​Lifetime, surrendered at the first break. <br /> <br /> Forest River is a company city - the main activity is Aikens Ornaments, which performs all kinds of Christmas decorations. The company's patriarch has recently died, so the future of companies can be questioned. Soon we meet Noelle, who prefers to be on Wall Street than Main Street, and the mysterious Justin who meets Noelle after the big snowman who is pumping, collides with Justins' car. When we meet with Alison Aikens, exercising due diligence for the Board, we have our history configuration. <br /> <br /> If you did not manage to get all the story lines through the first ad, you did not see enough of this kind of holiday movie. Maybe it's good.
