Unfortunately, realism is boring. This movie, I thought it would never end, would be better if all characters were bombed in the first five minutes. Where is Blade when you need him? DEAD CREATURES is as gloomy as COMBAT SHOCK, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM and as nightmarish as BOISE MOI, but it's not as funny as the previously mentioned gloomy films. While unreasonable cannibalism may make Jeffery Dalmers's would-be hearts race slightly faster, it was not as interesting as RAVENOUS. I really think it's as interesting as late infomercials and as exciting as a trip to the dentist. If you have strong masochistic features, you may be able to endure it, for no other reason. I was really surprised that this one was not created by people from Brain Damage, because it was the quality of Dead Creatures.
