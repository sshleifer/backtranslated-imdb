I first rented and watched this movie on DVD without reading any reviews on this subject. So after 15 minutes of watching, I noticed that something was wrong with this movie; This is horrible! I mean, it looked terrible and serious in the trailers! <br /> <br /> I think that Eli Roth (Mr. Director) thought that if all the characters in this movie were stupid, the movie would be funny ... (So stupid, it's funny ...? WRONG!) Should watch and learn from better horror comedies such as "Fright Night", "The Lost Boys" and "The Return of the Living Dead"! This is ridiculous! <br /> <br /> "Cabin Fever" is the reason why I registered at www.IMDb.com, so I can free myself from dissatisfaction about this. <br /> <br /> I decided to watch the film a second time> AAARGH! <and make notes for my partial "review" to show how stupid this movie is. "Resident Evil" (horror) or "Dude, Where's My Car?" (Comedy) I can watch over and over again and still enjoy! But it ...! <br /> <br /> How bad can a screenplay and director be? That `s bad. Here are terrible scenes in chronological order: <br /> <br /> In the early stages we see Henry, who does not realize that his dog lies on the ground with a tongue hanging from his mouth and a dead look. Dead! <br /> <br /> The film does not explain anything about long-haired blonde hair who likes to bite people. <br /> <br /> And my answer to Marcy's unanswered question ("What's wrong with forests?") is "nothing". The scenario has this bearded guy who warns them against the forest just for "tension." <br /> <br /> Then the "smartest" of the 5-pack, Bert, almost gives us an example of how to start a forest fire. He now meets the infected Henry, who pleads for help and from that moment the film wants to break the record using the word "F". Bert begins to get angry because Henry looks terribly sick. Bert: "Do not make me shoot you!" (Forget to add: "... with my BB gun!") <br /> <br /> Bert returns to the cabin, but what about this? He meets Marcy and Jeff who have had sex, but now he suddenly decides to go for a walk! Marcy wisely took out the unguarded fireplace that Bert had begun earlier (A moment of brightness for a change?) Bert does not mention a word about Henry, because a fool thinks he killed him with his BB gun. <br /> <br /> Later, when the Five Estupidos are sitting around the fire, another freak appears with his dog. (Maybe this is what the forest warnings are about, it's filled with weirdos ... and their dogs !?) They let him sit with them just because he has a big bag filled with cannabis. (Their brains are completely drugged! No wonder why everyone is so DUMB!) This is the last time we will see this forgetful figure ... alive! <br /> <br /> Henry appears in his cabin (ATTENTION: He was lying a few yards away from his cabin !!!) He looked worse, almost like a zombie, covered in goo! He says he needs a doctor. But the young Einsteins refuse to help the poor sucker. He gets to the unlocked truck, which obviously has his key in the ignition. Henry almost seems clever enough to push the hell away, but instead starts vomiting blood on the dashboard, seats and windows. Fantastic Five comes out running, armed with: BB rifle, knife, baseball bat (* huh? Have you ever tried to play baseball in the middle of the woods ???), poker and (insecticide?) In a spray can, ready to fight with a single, unarmed and a terribly sick man. (a smart script!) Bert manages to kill the car with one shot of his BB pistol, which is only possible in the mind of the director Eli Roth. "What else do I have to do?" Bert shouts in his defense. Jeff and Paul are trying to knock Henry down with a stick and poker, but they miss the windows of the car. Henry goes to stupid girls who say, "He's coming to us!" (Thank you for the information, stupid, I see it! But I do not think he would hurt you!) Marcy sprays his eyes, making Henry scream! And our "hero" Paul touches Henry's arm with a burning ball of fire, which they recklessly left in the flames when they were INSIDE THE CABINET! (Where does all this wisdom disappear from? I think that cannabis began to harvest! :-) Henry turns into a Human Torch and escapes, screaming. <br /> <br /> The next day Bert and Jeff head for the mechanic. And Marcy decides to "go for help" alone, to the woods, when Paul stays with Karen ... Does not that sound ridiculous? Marcy could stay with Karen and Paul, because Jeff and Bert were "going to help"! <br /> <br /> I now skip my comments, as suddenly we see Marcy in a kayak paddling over a huge and winding river! How did she get a canoe? Does she even know where she is going ?! In any case, he goes to the bank of the river and finds a very large and seemingly deserted cabin and, like in most horrors, walks to the cabin, saying: "Hello? Is somebody there?". Bert suddenly appears from behind the furniture and scares her (and me at the beginning). And then comes Jeff. How did they get here? Have they crossed the river? Do you see how thoughtless the script is!? <br /> <br /> Deputy Winston meets Paul in the cabin. Somehow he does not notice the blood on the truck. This is about 35 minutes of watching and I decided to stop being tortured and took out the DVD. (Before I go out with my own eyes! ... It's fun!) <br /> <br /> If you liked this movie, do yourself a favor and watch "Fright Night", "The Lost Boys", or "Return of the Living Dead ". Then you will see that they are MORE fun than this ... thing. Even "Toxic Avenger part 2", which is also a bad movie, is MUCH more fun than "Cabin Fever".
