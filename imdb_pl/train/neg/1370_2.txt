**** WARNING: here will be spoilers **** Why do I waste my hastily fleeing years watching this junk? This film is an impressive collection of stereotypes, poor writing, poorer direction, and then we have not yet come to acting. <br /> <br /> And of course you can predict the whole story from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Hero the expert fights stupid, corrupt and incompetent supporters. One avalanche moves, burying all the heroes, who somehow manage to get out alive, despite going through various dangers. A damaged partner who caused the whole matter is fried together with the money from the payouts. A second avalanche, heroically turned away by an experimental experiment of a renegade expert. In the end, bad supporters turn out to have a heart. A worried teenager falls into the arms of her crunchy stepmother after she was saved by her. Etc., Etc. Etc. Etc., so on. <br /> <br /> In fact, there is no reason to warn you about spoilers. You could probably develop the entire story if I gave you the basic ingredients. At least for most of the time I was not too wide, predicting what would happen next. <br /> <br /> And then we did not discuss actual errors. <br /> <br /> I agree with the previous commentator that even if there are usually SOME functions to exchange even a bad movie. it would be difficult for you to find something in it. I suppose I gave him 2 out of 10 for a few nice shots of the scenery, but that's all. <br /> <br /> It's been some time since the movie flinched me, but this one certainly does.
