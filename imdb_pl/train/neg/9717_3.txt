A pretty obvious number thriller, in which the only possible turn turns out to be hiding anything. I mainly watched Isabelle Huppert in English. It was not great, but it was a strange role. I would not be surprised if half of her contribution was left on the floor of the cutting room along with some last-minute scenarios. <br /> <br /> Acting is the least attractive in this film. Steve Guttenburg seems to be trying to strengthen his role with the charm that everyone told him. There is a sensational stupid sequence that suggests that his sexual performance will be able to help treat PTSD. This is an uninteresting performance. Elizabeth McGovern is rather a draw with real charm and character, but it's a small consolation. 3/10
