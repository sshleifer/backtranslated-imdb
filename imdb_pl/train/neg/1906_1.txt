They played it on July 4 in the Twilight Zone marathon and this is the worst episode in the Twilight Zone I've ever seen. It is completely synchronized with the rest of the series in its tone. Although the Twilight Zone is quite an uneven series and many episodes end up being whisperingly predictable, this one was totally out of place. Compare this with legendary episodes such as "A Stop at Willoughby" or "Midnight Sun", and you realize that there is no comparison. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton did what he could, with such a horrible material and to be honest, it surprises me that someone from his historical comedy posture would stoop to the level of this episode. Although it seemed to give him some effort, he MUST need money ... there is no other explanation.
