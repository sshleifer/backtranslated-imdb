Possible spoilers. <br /> <br /> Although there were a lot of good actors - especially Chloe Sevigny and Radha Mitchell in the middle of comedy - it simply was not a captivating movie. Tracks between the comedy part and part of the tragedy were uncomfortable or sometimes unobvious. This viewer was initially confused by the fact that the supporting cast differs in the two halves; I thought about how things were included in the opening scene, that the people around Melinda would be the same people, reacting simply differently (more reason "He said, she said"). However, we have two completely different stories and two completely different women that Radha Mitchell plays. <br /> <br /> Two playwrights on the opening scene - comedians and tragedies - supposedly accept the same assumption and from there, but these two stories are only weakly connected. They do little to support the topic of the discussion, namely that almost everything can be treated as a comedy or tragedy. Nice cast, but a disappointing movie.
