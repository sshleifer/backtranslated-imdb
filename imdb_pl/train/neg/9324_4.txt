OK, I'm the owner of this DVD, I have it new in amazon ... I mean, I think his bad and pretty cool movie and melissa, this slut / hooker they're getting is as hot as hell ..., the acting sucks and the whole polt just sucks the clown is some big guy in the mask and he's disgusting, but all right, I would not recommend him if you want to hire a good movie after a hard day's work, but if you have nothing else to do and obsess about these stupid movies like me, look at it someday, and I do not know how a craft DVD has SICK in its DVD collection, sick is not good enough to be the owner of a decent film company OK, that's all
