About 15 minutes, my wife already wanted to leave. Not so much because of the material, but its lack. They decided to fill in empty spaces where funny things should be just as linguistic and completely vulgar as possible. When this ends (very rarely), we will sit down and watch (not laughing, be careful) and wait for the next attention or offensive remarks. After about 35 minutes we got up and left. Everything we read said how great it was. The trailer looked good, and Roger Ebert called it "intelligent" and said it was not a primitive sex comedy. Did he go to the right movie? With Be Cool, it's the only other movie I've ever gone ... and I do not regret. I'm tired of trying to see a comedy in America.
