My friend gave me this movie. My friend is now in the hospital when a team of doctors tries to surgically remove a DVD from his ***. <br /> <br /> I was excited about the perspectives of another film by Michael Chabon. After all, his novels brought me a lot of entertainment, and the previous adaptations of the screenplays were great, but boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, the people who did the casting had to sleep. I imagine the castings looked something like this. "Tell me, do you like fish?" "Yes, I really like fish." "Wonderful, you're rented. <br /> <br /> Then there is the script. I read Chabon who, I hope, became blind before he saw this piece of donga and has absolutely nothing to do with his novel. I'm not sure why it annoyed me, but it may have something to do with the fact that listening to a 90-year-old drunk duck with impaired speech with the right cranial lobe dysfunction would be a feast in comparison the one-liner children of the second-degree massacre spat out. <br /> <br /> This is the actual line from the movie; "If you tell me something you have never told anyone before, this moment becomes special!" Unique? Is that it? Is it really? Of course, no board. Please, give me Imodium. I will have the entire **** belt. <br /> <br /> The director is ... good. I do not have anything. Maybe Rawson Marshall Thurber just learned that his grandmother had exploded or something. Keep on directing comedy. No command to target ads. <br /> <br /> This movie is so horrible that I hit my head against the wall so hard that I came back to the Stone Age. I give it 2 stars because I do not want to be the guy who watched a 1-star movie.
