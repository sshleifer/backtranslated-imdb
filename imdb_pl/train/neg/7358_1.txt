This Lifetime-style movie carries a middle-aged divorce victim who eventually fights a new genre of comic-like absurdity. <br /> <br /> Here is a 40-day stay at the home of a former wife of a successful lawyer's hero (daughter in college) begins a new life after divorce, helped his college friend in opening a new clothing store as a kind of extension agreements. She even made a friendship with her attractive, slightly younger, landscape architect / gardener (who is black). But then the horror of middle-aged female horrors, EVERY 20 women who took on as a tenant, allowed for a room that began to "take over" her life. <br /> <br /> What really does this new threat to a younger woman is to gently flirt with the gardener and offer him a glass of wine, which * panting * really belonged to the divorcee! He runs up utility bills without turning off the thermostat! wrong in the fridge! And her pieces (African) hang in the living room !! And so on. Maybe she also killed the cat. Yes, ok, the extent to which he does these things is bad enough, but it's more than ridiculous, especially as it changes into a campaign. The reality of the character is that every small part would lead this mad woman mad. (So ​​why did she rent a room - and horror of horror, a much younger woman?) <br /> <br /> Apparently this increasingly arrogant (younger) younger woman has the mania for taking control. And our courageous something must learn to fight this evil (and of course the erotically hot look) 20. But there is this problem. Every time something begins to get into trouble, he uses his POWER - and just flirting or having sex with some guy and running away from the consequences. (Well, there's actually something like 20 good things in it.) It's not * generally * used that way.) <br /> <br /> The message is moved by the device, something that leads the divorcee to formalize renting a room, involves a written lease. Of course, 40 does not know anything about these things, and something has helped. The lease actually gives the younger woman equal rights to the whole house during the rental period, with the tools thrown at a fixed price. Although the eviction proceedings will end soon, 20 something will soon receive a temporary ban on the older woman, presumably because she threatened to be twenty. You know, the judge is nice to all the unfortunate sexy sweet young things. Finally, the "heroic" fight for the DOM begins. Woopie !! <br /> <br /> The only realistic or perceptive thing about this movie is how terribly simple TRO (or security orders) are for women to get anything more than her groundless saying - although they are generally just that easy against men. Sometimes they are just as unjustified and motivated to take control of the house as it is here. Indeed, girls who have moved in with their boys can often evict them from their own homes or flats based on no evidence, but only groundless claims for threats, and sometimes even not hearing his side. Even in the case of a hearing, it is routinely impossible to refute claims for threats (in order to prove negativity), when the burden of proof rests with the accused and not with the prosecution. (This is one of the few areas of American law where this is true - and this is a signal of indignation of the abuse of feminism and the failure of any organized group in the fight against the steam roller). Of course, this is not the topic of any Film for a lifetime in this life. <br /> <br /> The absurd basic premise of this movie is based on the explanation that something is psychotic and does not take its medicine. Even if it does not make sense. She is not after the success of her ex-husband's lawyer, although she helps him (in the fury of her ex-wife) in her task. She is after the HOME (technically, to divorce him during the lease period). This second younger woman after ALL SUCH BEFORE a divorce, after affairs with other 20 people STOLE husband !! (The ex-husband seems to be unattached and basically caring after he was cast - it does not matter, he still got lost !!!) <br /> <br /> The hero is good enough looking for his age. But her view, attitude and focus are so small, devoid of imagination and completely devoid of imagination and life force, that you can not take care of her. Well, I think that the basic Lifetime fans group, judging by the average score, gave a small number of rescuers. (I just watched it because it was so bad and cartoonish that it had a camp appeal. I could not resist seeing how far they would take it.) <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** (if that's the case possible thanks to this movie). <br /> <br /> Well, here's the tip. The film ends with 20 people being released from prison, promising to "listen" to her 20-member co-worker, and sometimes a lover, and "do everything she says" and "let him take care of her" (he means to take medicine) ) - and then cheat him and go back to HOME. There, he climbs the stairs with a knife, demonically persecuting his nemesis 40, who bathes by candlelight, feeling that the younger woman is out of her life. There is a fight - and 40 mom wins something - by gluing something with a hypodermic injection needle, full of the antipsychotic drug she found. Then he starts to stroke her, mother, and both women have a bond, female solidarity !!! How sweet.
