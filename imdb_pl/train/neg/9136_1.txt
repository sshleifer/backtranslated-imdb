When the movie started, I was shocked to see that it was shot with a cheap video camera! In fact, the camera trembles and looks worse than the average home movie. Even direct DVD movies should have better production values! Heck, a large percentage of home videos uploaded to YouTube have better production values! Too often, the film seems to be created by sticking the camera on a tripod and turning it on - without a person with the camera! In some scenes in which they could operate, there is no close-up and nothing similar to working with a camera, and in others there are too many or badly framed close-ups. Yecch! <br /> <br /> The film is about two gays who want to get married. As if it had been created almost a decade ago, their only option was a marriage in Vermont - times have definitely changed. However, the recent acceptance of homosexual marriages can in no way be attributed to this film - if at all, it supports homosexual marriages, instead of helping, because the film stinks and does not really try to seriously address this problem. According to the film, religious people are one-dimensional idiots who carry the Bible EVERYWHERE and shoot people as well as wives who have homosexual husbands who have bottleneck when they learn that their spouses are living a lie. I am sure that it gives both parties a fair chance! <br /> <br /> The main thing - nothing about the film shows any professionalism, and even hesitate to call it a movie. It's more like a home movie and does not even deserve to be placed on IMDb or even on the Bottom 100 IMDb list of the worst rated movies of all time. Acting is awful, writing is awful, the direction is (if it is) horrible, working with the camera is awful and the plot is terrible. This is a home movie !! I can not say anything positive about it, except that it makes Ed Wood films look like other Oscar candidates, and I'm sure Mr Wood's spirit is smiling every time someone watches this mess! <br /> <br /> I do not care if you're gay or straight - this movie is not worth your time and I do not know how he managed to create a DVD with this movie. I assume that one of the actors smokes them on their home computer in their free time! Seriously, this gives a new meaning to the word "bad"! <br /> <br /> By the way, if one lady in the film WAS a real lawyer, would reading skills not be an important prerequisite ?! I'm just saying. <br /> <br /> Finally, when a gay marriage is such a serious and important topic, can not we have a movie BETTER than THAT that solves this problem ?! This, unfortunately, only laughs.
