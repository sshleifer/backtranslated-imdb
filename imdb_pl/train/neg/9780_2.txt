Good God, whoever did this must be buried alive. I'm sorry, but another reviewer could not see this movie, have to watch something else or have never seen a movie before ... 9 out of 10 stars? He says, is it as good as Ben Hur or Gone With the Wind? Involuntarily ridiculous, massively unbelievable characters, absurd situations, they look like they were shot at Griffith Park (which works quite well - MASH was filmed at Griffith Park), a nasty script, almost anything that could be wrong with a movie in one package. It should be required that all potential film makers be an example of how a movie can be terribly bad. It reminds me of something that a USC student can do for a film class. <br /> <br /> Give it a pass, unless you're doing drugs and you're in a camp.
