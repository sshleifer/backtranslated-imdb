I do not think any Van Damme movie ever defeated Universal Soldier, but you never know. This movie was good, but not as good as the first one. VD returns Luc and must fight again. Try 2 b fun here, but it can be worth a laugh. VD has a child this time with Ally W., it's good that he showed them a picture 2. Goldberg was cool, he makes his famous move - he forgot what his name is, because I do not watch wrestling. VD and Goldberg had some good fights. It was the ending like the first, but not so good. VD performs his best move in his career, as always - HELICOPTER KICK. Nevertheless, the final ending should be longer. In any case, it is worth seeing, but it will never reach originality.
