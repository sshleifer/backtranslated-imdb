my friend bought it (very cheap) and decided to give it to me as a birthday present. I thought that I never watch it because I knew it was a joke and the cover of the DVD looked pathetic, but then my friends and I really got bored and watched. from the beginning to the end! I know quite a good achievement, but it's really a masterpiece. It's hard to describe. You should see this, it is a real lesson about what people are capable of when they believe they are creative and wise and they really are not. "Acting" is sous-terrain (you can see that "leading lady" laughs sometimes, it is definitely the worst). "History" is supposed to be stupid to sum it up and really everything in this film is useless. please pay special attention to the "sheriff". the guy is an adult and therefore there is no excuse to get involved. he is also very angry. whatever it was, it had some funny moments. check it out, haha
