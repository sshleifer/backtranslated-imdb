.... it may seem far-reaching ... but it really was a real life story ... a man who had an affair with a woman who found out where he and his new wife were and killed her wife, making it look like like a rape on murder ....... <br /> <br /> in her illusion she told everyone that a man asked her to marry him ... so she quit her job in Wisconsin ... and moved to Minnesota .......... <br /> <br /> I recently heard that she was in a psychiatric facility, Security Prison .... <br /> <br /> she still wore an "engagement ring". that she bought for herself ... and told everyone that he bought her for her. <br /> <br /> The events took place in a small town in Wisconsin ,,,,,, and the murder took place in Minnesota ...... <br /> <br /> There was even a story in the magazine "People" ... Spring 1988, I want to say on page 39. I remember it when I was in college at that time and my friend met a person in a security hospital ....
