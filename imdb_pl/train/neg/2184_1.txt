This film is a loose collection of incomprehensible analogies and ill-conceived plot devices. <br /> <br /> Movie history: The director of this movie was a pervert who traveled around the city filming random women. When his wife discovered the film strip, he was forced to quickly invent the story. He claimed to create the movie "A brain that will not die." Eventually, his wife demanded that he show her the so-called film. That night, he quickly made some extra scenes with a friend and was born "The Brain, he will not die." <br /> <br /> I hate this movie! Description of the story: The fianc√© of the main character is killed in a terrible car accident (which ignored clearly marked road signs). He grabs her head from the wreck and enlivens her. After the resuscitation of the head goes and raises a bunch of whores. This is what happens with the rest of the movie. At the end he fights and is killed by a monster who lives in the closet. The monster appears without any explanation. However, the monster saves a whore and I assume that they live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Additional remarks: The final screen claims that the film is called "The head that will not die". <Br /> <br /> I hate this movie!
