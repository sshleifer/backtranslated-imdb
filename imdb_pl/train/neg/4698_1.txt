I'm serious about what group would be singing about a crazy car? So what if ten, It's too immature for a little child to sing about "being my women." The name is also quite trivial, naked brothers? just because they take off their pants? HOW CREATIVE. I do not understand why they need a TV program, i.e. most artists do not need a TV series about themselves, especially the band of naked brothers. Heck, how many of them are in the capricious group. And seriously what about this movie? Jeez Nick used the light of my adolescent years, but seriously Team of naked brothers? So many parents would not let their children watch this, especially with the name of the band Naked Brother, his stupid, non-creative program that should not be broadcast on television.
