OK, I admit that I watched this movie at the Mystery Science Theater 3000 (which I am a huge fan), but I'm not one of those people who automatically give the MST3K movie a 1/10 rating. Although I hate many movies that they play, and some of them are among the worst movies I've ever seen, I could enjoy some of MST3K movies. Having said that, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. (No wonder the authors of MST3K commented that this was one of the worst, do not believe me? Check their website.) For me this movie is a good example of what NOT to do in filming. Dialogue is very bad, acting is worse, the photos are pathetic, the direction (though perhaps the best in this movie) is bad. <br /> <br /> Tempo is the worst part of the movie. Several times in this film the viewer had to wait a few minutes to make something happen. While the minutes may not sound very long, it can be a movie, especially in this one. I'm sure it was meant to create a mood, but I was very bored. It really was like ten minutes. <br /> <br /> If "suspending disbelief" means "almost falling asleep during the movie", then it has a lot. But SCREAMING SKULL is just so horrible that I could not even get interested in what was happening in the movie, so the "suspension of disbelief" did not really exist. br /> One of the worst and probably the most boring movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 1/10
