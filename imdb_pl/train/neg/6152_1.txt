When many people say it's the "worst movie I've ever seen", they tend to talk about virtually any movie they do not like. However, with almost 700 movies I remember, seeing this is one of the two I left, feeling offended and angry personally. By the way, this is my first review of movies and I registered with IMDb to admire the evil of this film. I went to see it in cinemas (me and my two buddies there were 3 out of 5 people), and after 15 years I do not remember much detail, but my attitude after leaving the theater is still crystal clear. <br /> <br /> --- Alert spoilera --- <br /> <br /> Wounds, where to start. A fat loser left on the altar, goes on a ski weekend, meets a blond bomb that interests him, takes him home to meet his family, everyone is cannibals, and he is the main dish, a pitiful attempt to escape dramatically, kick them all in a hurry and he escapes with his brother's girlfriend, they live happily ever after. Puke. First of all, the gags are so bad that I understood that they tried to be FUNNY, and that was COMEDY. The special effects that they are look like they were 15 years ago. The big dramatic ending was so hokey and it worked poorly, that watching was almost unbearable (it disperses a whole family of cannibals with rake lying on the lawn, which stands in the style of Tom and Jerry when they enter). I'm sure there are many, many more, but I have no intention of watching it again for refreshment.
