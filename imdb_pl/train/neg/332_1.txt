Let me start by saying that I could not go through it. I picked him up on a rainy day with WalMart like the rest of the reviewers on this site. I have come to the conclusion that I will not regret my purchase in any way. Was I wrong or what? Seriously now, who approved this project? They must be forced to watch this movie over and over until the end of eternity. It's the only right punishment I can come up with to get rid of something so bad. Pictures remind me of the films I used to make for classical projects on a large old VHS camera. Acting is not much better. I think the only difference is that there are some nice scenes. Yay, who cares ... Shecky Moskowitz is good, and the comedian on the ships is an even bigger loser. That's as much as I understood. <br /> <br /> Generally this is the worst movie I've ever seen. I have it on a DVD and I gave it to many colleagues to watch. Everyone comes back and laughs and says, "Wow, I did not think I would ever say that I turned off Adam Sandler's movie 15 minutes in ...." <br /> <br /> My answer is: "Teraz jeste≈õ" <br / > <br />
