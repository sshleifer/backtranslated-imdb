Do not make any bones out of it. There are many mistakes in this video. It is stereotypical, not too funny, predictable and illogical. Let's start from the beginning: signs. He is a boring, unfortunate guy - giving Stiller another boring guy in his boring, unfortunate belt - supposedly wild, but actually quite normal, loving interest - which Aniston plays well, but really did not need to do it - fat, nice friend, and then a set of stereotypes: an annoying daredevil Australian, a confident Spaniard, etc. Plot: the beginning is a bit unusual, but later it changes to the standard style of any movie, with every turn of the story as predictable as your average joke. The biggest problem was that Stiller's "development" really seemed to come from nothing - like your average school game, the writers knew where he started and where he ended, but did not put enough inventory to actually say the middle piece. Finally, the alleged "jokes" were nothing short of highly diluted versions of standard humor; there was a regulatory chunder scene, sweaty fat men, etc. <br /> <br /> In summary, the simple fact about this movie is that learning the meaning of the word "shart" was the only good thing. Hamburg really made a dog dinner here, and the sugar coating of Stiller and Aniston could lure viewers, but the taste left at the end was equally rancid. <br /> <br /> Final comment: this movie may have been horrible, but Aniston still chose a better movie between the seasons between friends and the repulsive "Marci X" Kudrowa.
