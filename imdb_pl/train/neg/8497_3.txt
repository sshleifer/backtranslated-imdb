My title should be enough. <br /> <br /> It surprises me that a culture so rich in literary perfection (Dumas, Flaubert, Balzac, Maupassant) could cause such a noise as the "nouvelle vague" movie movement. Until the twentieth century France had a great tradition of artistic clarity and wise philosophy. But the moment you give them the camera, they start to behave like WOOOHOOO LOOK HOW, IN WHICH I CAN BE SAFE! THREAD? THEME? PSHAW! LET'S FILM PARK AMUSEMENT RIDE GOING ROUND & ROUND! At least it is not as bad as Godarda (who has an unhealthy fascination with the backs of human heads. Oh-la-la, quel artiste.). No, Truffaut has some visual clarity. But the same security camera looks at a fast pace. These two things are indistinguishable. <br /> <br /> Haha, just as it is for everyone who deludes the suckers from the film school: I bet you live now from your neck. But do not go without reading the last sentence of my review. <br /> <br /> In any case, if you like French literature, you hate it. People who like this movie probably have never read any books other than Jack Kerouac's quarrels, or maybe the Hitchhiker Guide to the Galaxy. Or maybe they read the lyrics of The Doors and think it's deeply moving. Whatever lifts your boat. It is ironic that this film contains several (weak) allusions to Balzac, one of the best and most significant writers who ever lived. Nice try, Truffles. But you are not near the playing field. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like a syringe infected with aids. <br /> <br /> If you are the person who likes to think, then stick to Jean Cocteau (ORPHEE), Robert Bresson (PICKPOCKET) and Japanese masters Kurosawa (IKURU), Kobayashi (KAIDAN) and Teshigahara (SUNA NO ONNA). <br /> <br /> If you're an idiot, have fun with Truffaut, Godard and Andy Worhol. And for God's sake, push this vein back into the neck. You look like a cabbage.
