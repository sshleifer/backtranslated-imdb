I see that several people involved in this disaster wrote reviews to share their story, and I thought that what they wrote was helpful in understanding this. The fact that they came up with excuses - rewriting, budget constraints, production formats, etc. - simply emphasizes how bad the film is. And my criticism of panning is not personally directed, but simply a warning that it does not cut. <br /> <br /> It's possible to watch, but barely. In each corner there are role-playing holes, the dialogue borders on the absurd, and the ending is telegraphy within a mile. The modestly interesting feature of a hologram interacting with an exploratory crew is drowned in a stupid dialogue, like someone who makes a meal amidst what is supposed to be a tense and deadly encounter with an unknown enemy. Would you force us to take some Hamburger Helper Sally, would an automatic carpet sweeper be killed between us? Apparently, this elite team equipped with the latest gizmos and miraculous red plastic tube armor does not have access to the MRE. After entering the last rooms, they treat the place more like a four-star motel than a deadly meeting zone. <br /> <br /> The rationale for meeting a terrifying Tower is that you can not kill him one at a time. Just one more scene ago, the hero who made the matter leave the king to do exactly that. What? Vivian Woo was attractive and gives the best actress in the film. But that does not say much.
