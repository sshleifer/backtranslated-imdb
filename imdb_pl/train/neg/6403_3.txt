.... in terms of the level of humor on which this comedy works. Hardly reaching the length of the movie "Can I Do It ...." Till I Need Glasses is a collection of (mostly) dirty jokes. Many of them are so short that you can not believe it when you realize that THIS was supposed to be a grim line (example: Santa's gag); others are so long that you can not believe it when you realize that they needed so much time to set up this punchline (example: student gag). And almost all are directed without artistry. Do not get me wrong: about 1 in 10 jokes is really funny (iron / phone is probably my favorite). There is also a great nudity full-scale, which proves that the woman's body, especially in its natural form, is the best thing on this planet (there is also a comical male nudity). I agree with others that the deliberately stupid title song is really damn catchy! But none of these reasons is enough for this movie to be more than a * of 4.
