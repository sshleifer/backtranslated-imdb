How ever was it? Generally I love sci F / Bigfoot movies, etc. but I still expect them to be written without so much cheese. The effects were sad, the lines were sadder. Avoid at all costs. I ended up borrowing it because it was in a bad case (I was looking for a Sasquatch movie with Lance Henrikson in it - I have not seen it yet). The idea of ​​the film is actually good. There was a lot of potential to create a great little movie here. I just do not understand how something ends like this. Talk to interested students in film / art / English in any high school, and you will find people who can write a better script.
