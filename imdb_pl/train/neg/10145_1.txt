Steven Seagal seems sleepwalking through a scary movie filmed almost completely up close to conceal the total lack of budget and resources. To take into account the technical faults - silver F / A-18 and F-14 from the air attack carrier, and the miraculously masked F-16 to the actual impact - would give the film more credibility than it deserves. Suffice it to say that the most interesting thing in the movie are credit titles that disappear and then disappear in a lightning that is probably available to all Final Cut Pro users. By putting all his creativity into his own credit, Michael Keusch is in the same category as Marcel Mandu.
