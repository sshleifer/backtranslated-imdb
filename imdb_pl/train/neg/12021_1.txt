It may be a bit difficult for me, but unfortunately so far in his directing career it's true. Just look at what he has done so far. They almost did not exceed 3 stars. <br /> <br /> Why did I watch this movie? 2 reasons. Star Lucy Lawless and Heroes Greg Grunberg. Lucy was outstanding in this film, her performance carries the whole movie. I hope that he will get a "hit" and break into a larger league of actors, he clearly has the skills. Greg was not so impressive, a typical TV style. <br /> <br /> The movie is strangely classified as horror. The only "horrors" are short flashbacks that last for a maximum of 2-5 seconds with a small amount of blood. Personally, I would call it more "drama / thriller". <br /> <br /> But no matter how interesting this story is, bad directing, editing and acting (from Lucy) destroy it. You do not have a real relationship with actors, which is very important in a story like this. You just sit and do not feel anything. It's like watching a bad TV soap ... I really think TV soap would be more interesting. <br /> <br /> My advice: stay away from this movie ... or better, but stay away from everything Hurst is involved.
