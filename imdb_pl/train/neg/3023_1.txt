I rarely see a movie so horrible, annoying and irritating. No doubt this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The plot, which is not smudged and pointless over the flashy assembly, is ridiculous. Why Domino became such a bad ass? Because her golden fish died when she was a child, and this "traumatic" event made her emotionally inhibited and she hated everyone. When dialogue is not trivial or trivial, it is full of funny lines, such as: "There are three kinds of people in this world: rich ... poor ... and everyone else." At some point, the bounty hunters have some guy behind the back of the bus who has a tattooed number on his shoulder. Because of the misleading connection with the mobile phone, instead of rolling up the sleeve and just reading the number, they blow the arm off the shotgun. At another moment, the bounty hunters take a bomb for a meeting organized with the mafia and threaten to dismantle it, unless the mafia releases them! Apparently not going to the meeting would be too easy. <br /> <br /> Keira Knightley is unconvincing and terrifyingly bad. Mickey Rourke can save the credibility of this mess. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed some of Tony Scott's previous films, True Romanticism, but the only thing I could think about suffering because of it was that it was made by a complete idiot.
