This animated film with Inspector Gadget is pretty bad. the story is very poor and there is little action. most heroes have nothing to do. The film is funny at best, but it does not really go where it is pointless. You can watch it, but it is nowhere near the caliber of an animated television series from the 80's. This is not a movie that has repeated watching, at least in my mind. it's good. The characters in the TV series are not worth cheering for. In the show, you wanted Inspector Gadget to save the day, but who cares? anyway, it's just my opinion. for me Inspector The last case of the gadget is a disappointing 3/10
