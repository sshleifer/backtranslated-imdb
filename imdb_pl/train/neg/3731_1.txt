I grew up in a "very Christian" home from birth. I was saved before I saw this movie and the rest of the series and was forced to watch him in the youth group in my church. This movie was very disturbing. I saw it when I was about 12 years old and literally had nightmares about it for years. Once I lay awake in bed and listened to the sounds of my mother's steps upstairs. If I had not heard her steps, I would sneak up to make sure she was not delighted. I have always prayed so hard for salvation every night because I was afraid that Jesus would forget me. It is definitely not something that I will show to my children until they are much older, if at all. It took me many years to shake the fear that the movie gave me.
