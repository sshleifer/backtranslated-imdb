This movie is so bad it just escapes reality. Filming is at best a material for elementary school, acting is pathetic, and the director should be forever removed from film production in any form. It's so bad that you can not even watch it as something comedy like Showgirls. The only thing that hit the DVD was the cover. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can write to those of you who had no unhappiness, be witnesses of it, please, do yourself a deserved favor in advance and do not waste time or money on this piece of rubbish. If you want to see a movie about comedy aspects, there are many more worthy ones in this world than this basket.
