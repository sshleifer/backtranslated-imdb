The Russian film "4" tracks the fate of three (not four) strangers who meet one night at a local bar. One is a musician, the other a frozen meat seller and the other a girlfriend. <br /> <br /> The "4" I have accumulated is intended to show the grim and hopelessness of life in post-Soviet Russia (characters are to invent stories to make their lives seem more interesting than they really are), but the film is so incoherent and boring that I seriously doubt that many people will be able to sit all the way. It seems that the film appears to suggest that the dark Russian government is prone to suspicious activities behind the scenes - operating with secret cloning devices, selling frozen meat from decades ago, etc. - but the film is so formless and incomprehensible that I doubt anyone he could find out what someone is really doing here. <br /> <br /> Despite the decent acting and a few precisely shot scenes, "4" is a two-hour endurance contest that should be avoided at all costs.
