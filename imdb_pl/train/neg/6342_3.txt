I found this in the video store because of Tarantino's recommendation ("If you do not like it, go f & ^% yourself!") On the box ... it seemed to me that it was ringing. something somewhat more similar to "Death Proof" ... little real violence in this one story, story, character or dialogue. <br /> <br /> Look at the poster. It's all there. Acrobatics and rock. He goes back and forth. A week in the life of a band from Los Angeles who is doing a shitty magic show at a level that you could see in one of the smaller casinos on the Strip and a new stunt Aussie in a city that finds its feet ... They work, meet girls, party. End of the story. <br /> <br /> The band apparently needed all these things because they are sincerely secondary and they play a style that was dated in 1978. It must be said that the stunts in the film really spin - that Aussie really is someone, and the film seems to be largely motivated by love and respect for "art". I hanged him there to see what he would do crazy. I'd like him to find a better vehicle.
