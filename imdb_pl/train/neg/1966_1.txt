I was cheated to see this movie after reading a positive review from a different page and the man was I p.o'd !!! at least 15 minutes it took me to pick him up from the shelf b / c I did not want anyone to see me. then another 10 minutes to build the courage to take it to the counter and actually use it for rent. I thought that all my stress would pay off before I get home and watch the film b / c, which I read that the movie was a pleasant surprise; what a joke! if you manage to go through the first hour of the movie, you're lucky! b / c only then the movie changes into a horror movie. Do not bother about it, it's better that you watch the "fall of thinness"
