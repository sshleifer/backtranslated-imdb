The fact that this movie has reached a rental in Norway is strange. This movie is simply awful. This picture quality is one bit better than a mobile phone, and the plot is very bad. The main character is just annoying, and the rest just sucks. Anyone associated with this movie should be ashamed. The fact that the people who created this movie called it extraordinary. And distributors; did they even see it !? This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. To call it, comedy is an insult to humanity. I urge you not to support this movie by buying or renting it.
