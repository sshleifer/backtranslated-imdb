Getting lost in space frozen for 15 years is unlikely. Falling into a star ... unbelievable. Falling into it the day the supernova goes and explodes ... unreasonably. Rescue by ship just then ... priceless. <br /> <br /> No, this is not Zaphoda Beeblebrox's Golden Heart to the rescue. It is also not an award for parents of the year. After condemning her daughter to a two-year retreat on an abandoned spacecraft, her mother encourages her to get drunk and leave alone with the strange man they've taken. This promises their bravery in melee, which is the bulk of the film's action. The most important elements of a fight are, for example, a psycho-conversation close to one woman face to face, while blindly pointing a gun behind him to another, about six inches from him, which strenuously calms the fire. <br /> <br /> In the end, the family of three leave the ship the size of the metropolis, which they intended to use to observe the supernova, until the last moment, because it is too slow to escape from the blast wave, instead of using a fighter ship that refueled within one minute with 1,600 pounds of gas fuel from a 0.7 kiloton projectile. You must love these hard science fiction statistics! <br /> <br /> As long as Hollywood treats writing as an irrelevant frill, they will continue to make movies that are not fit for launch at 3:00 on the Sci fi channel.
