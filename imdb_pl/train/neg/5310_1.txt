I do not know what the other review was talking about. This is definitely not a bimbo movie, in fact I do not think there is one decent girl in it. No, it's just cheesy, badly done, frayed science fiction by Ed Wood. And it's bad. I can not even tell you how bad it is. I saw it late at night on the cable and I was shocked. The fact that this film has ever been released is an offense to us all. The actors were either producer's friends or mentally retarded, special effects are a joke, and the pace is extremely slow. However, for me music is the top. The monkey could write a better theme with a toy xylophone. Do not rent it, but if you ever see it on the cable, watch it. You will be surprised how bad the movie can be.
