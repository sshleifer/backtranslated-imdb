We do not have it on TV in England, but I've gone through the Internet on YouTube. It's stupid, immature and boring! This is from the creator of "Earthworm Jim" Douglas TenNapel, I never got into this cartoon, but I must admit it better than this. The cartoonist has done nothing for years. For Doug TenNapel it is a return traverse and a short time! The story is about three cats that will inherit the home and a lot of money from their dead master. They're quarrelsome and they do not agree on what they want to spend money on. "BORING"! Animation is terrible. The main characters are cats, right? But they do not look like cats! Just weird, horrible looking creatures with big mouths, pointed teeth and bulging eyes! Human and other animal characters are also drawn really ugly! The theme is awful and annoying! Also, the stories are poor and most likely copied from older programs. I was surprised when this show received 7.5 / 10 votes from other IMDb viewers. Television is not really what it once was! But now most of them are stupid, cheap and boring. Some of you on the site may not agree with me well Sorry, but it's a total waste of money and a complete waste of time and rejoice that Great Britain does not tolerate this shit if you have a digital one), but I do not, so it's not my problem! Lost! 2/10 (and it is very happy because I got the worst other shows!).
