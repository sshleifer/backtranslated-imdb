I read 'Lorna Doone' for the first time about 20 years ago and I loved it! It is a classic historical affair from the 17th century, when the western country was a few-day journey from London, and law and order were much more difficult to enforce. Unfortunately, this version of the book has several freedoms in this story and in my opinion it was incredibly disappointing. Actor and production values ​​are fine, but the way history was told was horrible. Why are TV adaptations doing this? Why would they think that thousands of book fans would like them to change history? One of the great mysteries of life !!! The BBC created the perfect version that was broadcasted on Christmas in the early 90s, which I'm still trying to track down a copy of! Take my advice, read the book and do not worry about this poor version!
