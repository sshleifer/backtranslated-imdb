It's a bad season for Bollywood with all the big releases with a huge buzz around, proving that they're a bust at the box office. London Dreams is no exception. Consider this ... It's about chasing dreams and how far you go to achieve it. It sounds impressive, right? But unfortunately, the movie is not. <br /> <br /> Arjun (Ajay Devgan) is an aspiring musician who wants to be great once. His dream is to perform at Wembley Stadium in front of the cheering 90,000 spectators who call his name. Two brothers joined him, Zoheb & Wasim (debutants of Aditya Roy and Ranvijay) and thrilling Priya (Asin). Together they create "Dream Dreams", a dream team. After impressing the head of the music label, they become nocturnal sensations. Arjun is secretly in love with Priya, whom he does not want to reveal until he reaches his goal. Arjun then brings his childhood friend Manjit Khosla, known as Mannu (Salman Khan), a carefree, flirtatious guy who has no ambition in life to join their team. Mannu is a trained musician and a real talent, for whom later Arjun becomes jealous of Mann's highest skills and his romance with Priya. Arjun with the help of Zoheba plans to dump Mannu. What happens next creates the rest of the movies. <br /> <br /> Turning to the technical aspects, we only feel the shadow of Vipula Amritlal Sha, whom we admired in Namaste London. I felt like I was just visualizing the script. To cut him, a glorified operator. Screenplay: Suresh Nair is dumb, even if he has his moments. The scenario, defined predictably, was stiff to you. The camera work was amazing in capturing the beauty of London. This is the only entertainment part when watching songs. <br /> <br /> Few songs are hummble, while others are noisy charges. Ajay was the one who stole the show with his negative character. Salman is monotonous and teasing you. Asin is unforgettable, and I do not know if he'll do it in Bollywood. Aditya Roy makes an impression while Ranvijay is fine. Brinda as a bitch is what we've seen in countless movies. Ompuri is in the process. I do not want to write about the flaws, because it will be a Herculean task. <br /> <br /> In the end, let it be simple and simple, London Dreams is a soulless movie that can be better seen on DVD.
