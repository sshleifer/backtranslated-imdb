I saw the movie and got fucked because the movie was stupid and boring. I thought that Ram Gopal Varma would justify his work, but unfortunately he did not make it and the whole movie was broken, and they spoiled "sholay". the cast and crew were angry. the whole theater was sleeping while watching the movie, some were running away inside. Acting amithab bachan is bad, I thought that this movie will be the biggest hit of the year, but this movie will be the biggest flop of the year. no one has done justice to their work, including Ajay devagan. this film does not deserve any audience. I bet that this movie will be flop. <br /> <br /> "FINALLY THIS FILM SUCKS"
