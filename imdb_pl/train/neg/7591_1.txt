This movie is based on the novel by John Fante. Can anyone tell me why? I see absolutely no reason why this beautiful book should be adapted in this way. If you want to make a romantic melodramatic Hollywood production with Colin Farelle and Selma Hayek, how could you make contact with Ask The Dust (a novel)? "And if you wanted to do this story in the film, why would you like to enter a romantic melodramatic Hollywood production with Colin Farelle and Selma Hayek? I do not understand. <br /> <br /> The adaptation of the story is poorly made, and if you read the book and liked it, I'm pretty sure you will not like what Towne did with it. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, it may turn out that the cast is strange, the acting is bad, and the photos are somewhat exaggerated. But you're hoping for the best. I really had a lot of hope during this movie. Actually, I wanted it to be good. But it's even worse and it's so simple: do you read Fantes's novel or not, it's not a good movie. Another romantic melodramatic Hollywood production combined with bad acting, lack of structure and - of course - a lot of shots of Colin Farells' naked butt. <br /> <br /> I could complain much more about this movie, but why waste my time. I saw it. Fine. I had to see it because I like this book so much and I was curious. And I am very disappointed. <br /> <br /> 1/10 is the sweet Colin mustache at the end of the movie. So sweet ... If he wore it all the time, I gave him 2/10.
