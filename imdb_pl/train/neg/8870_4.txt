Stefan is X-Con, who five years ago married Marie. Their marriage was stable until Stefan caught up with them and offered him a courier job. Stefan's task is to deliver heroin from Germany to Sweden, which should be easy. <br /> <br /> In Germany, Stefan meets Elli, a girl from Bosnia who was sold to the owner of the stripclub. Stefan does not like what he sees, and decides to help Ella from her misery. Due to the fact that Ella's father escaped to Sweden during the war, Elli goes to Sweden with Stefan. To make up for the past, Stefan promises Ella to help her find her father, no matter what happens. In the end, in Sweden, the whole situation seems to be more complicated than Stefan ever thought ... <br /> <br /> This movie does not fit into the usual class of Swedish films due to the fact that it has been Americanized a lot. Regina Lund and Cecilia Bergqvist make everything average, but the effects make the movie a bit too big. See it and for yourself. <br /> <br />
