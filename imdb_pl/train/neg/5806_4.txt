Nowhere near the original. This is a fairly accurate copy that adds nothing new to history. But the direction is very poor. Basinger is weak - without good management. Baldwin is just the second league compared to McQueen. I watched it out of curiosity, being a huge fan of Peckinp's masterpiece and I got what I thought. Almost film B with the second actor and director. I was not even disappointed, I just do not know what they were trying to do. This remake does not try to play the original material, it is not a tribute and really lacks some really good actor from the era. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of a bad copy of a photocopy of great photography. br /> <br /> It's a complete waste of time. Save 2 hours or view the original (again :)))
