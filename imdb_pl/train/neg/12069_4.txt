Carl Monson, a Z-class horror filmmaker, was one of the most prolific directors in low-budget chaos. His films are full of inept blood, funny acting, boring motifs and pathetic dialogue. A mysterious black clothed figure brutally murders guests staying in a family residence. Unfortunately, this movie is almost bloodless. Actually, you can not see murders except shadows and a few splashes of blood. The pace is lethargic, and the plot is rather uninteresting. knowledgeable, but lack of gore and mutilation disappointed me. Generous 4 out of 10. Just be careful: do not confuse Monson's film with equally weak Andy Milligan's "Legacy of Blood".
