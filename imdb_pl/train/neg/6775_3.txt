I was happy to find this video in the local video library - Cary Grant in a comedy in the service, director Stanley Donen, who has not liked it so far. It's a movie where I'm thinking about two things - when everyone involved (including some famous names) realized they had a turkey on their hands, and what's the worst of it? I still wonder about the first one, but my voice on the latter refers to the meandering plot, ahead of the verbal, sometimes pretentious scenario, uncertain tone, lack of coherent and well-developed characteristics and lack of relations between the characters. You have to add very uneven actions to criticism, but it is understandable that the actors have struggled with these things and, moreover, they seem to be underrated. Quite often, they can not pull their lines fast enough. Cary Grant tries to present her typical charming and happy personality, but sometimes she seems restless and staccato in her delivery. I must admit, however, that I felt relieved when the initial suggestions of his character were combined with Susan Mansfield's unspeakably vulgar departure with the appearance of Suzy Parker. What do you like in the movie? - for me, mainly the beauty of Parker, who works with the restraint and dignity of Grace Kelly. In general, the film is nice to look at. Naval heroes are very clever in uniforms - but you must really think about the dreaded black Fu Manchu tunics that they have in their luxurious hotel suite. Even Grant can not look smart. Returning to the credit site, Ray Walston performs a commendable work with his character and for me there was interest in hearing the heroes from before Hogan. Werner Klemperer speaks without an accepted German accent!
