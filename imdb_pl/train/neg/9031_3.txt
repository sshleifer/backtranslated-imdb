Payback is a play in this drama, and the plot of revenge is canceled by an absurd plot that prepares a scene for fireworks that will come later. Why would a man engage in the trophy of the ruthless mafia boss's wife in the mansion's residence with suspected supporters around? Why would an unhappy wife encourage the attention of a completely alien man and expect him to take her with him, and leave her husband and boredom to live happily ever after with her new love? Certainly the protagonist, here Kevin Costner, had to expect a reaction from the deer's husband, which gives the film an excuse to commit himself to senseless blood and violence. Anthony Quinn, the great actor he was, certainly deserved more, and Madeleine Stowe is a tragic figure who suffers a lot when he hits the charming prince. Stowe is fine, but her Spanish accent does not work. Smaller player scenes are good, especially Miguel Ferrer and John Leguizamo, and Sally Kirkland are interesting as a fading rock star.
