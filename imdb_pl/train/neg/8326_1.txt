This is the most absurd and funny thriller I've ever seen. Oh .... where to start .... <br /> <br /> Plot (which is not enough): Clayton Beresford Jr. (Hayden Christensen), a young billionaire, desperately needs a transplant with a bad heart. Clay was secretly involved in his mother's PA, Samantha, played by Jessica Alba. At night, when the two of them got married secretly, it happens that a donor of the heart was found with the same rare blood group. Go and calculate the chances of it! Being on the operating table, Clay learns that anesthesia does not work, and he can feel everything and hear everything. <br /> <br /> Luckily, Clay seems to be able to filter out the ache of the sharp scalpel, open his chest, focusing on Samantha's memories, which, as we were told, do by an annoying voice that never ends. <br /> <br /> If you have not yet burst into laughter, it will definitely start when you see surgical scenes. <br /> <br /> How could a young billionaire agree to a heart transplant by one surgeon, one nurse, an attending physician and a drunken anesthesiologist? There were more people in the room when my wisdom tooth was drawn. Not to mention medical behavior that is too preposterous to be taken seriously ... the operating room is not even sterile ... people are practically able to just walk in and out of the room without even washing. During the operation, the viewer may hear Clay's thoughts, none of which are too fascinating. Ah ... but that's it ... the doctors are trying to kill him to take the money. Believing that he is unconscious, the villains speak freely. Ooops! What will happen? <br /> <br /> Well ... at least there is no interference from other people in the hospital, while an incompetent doctor who has four lawsuits against him performs a major heart surgery. It seems that even the overprotective Clay's mother is unable to check his status. The only interested update is Samantha ... but no ... can be sweet Sam ... Quickly find out through some window Scooby Doo ... <br /> <br /> In the end it would not matter if Clay went through awareness of anesthesia, because the end would be the same in both cases. <br /> <br /> If you can ignore the feeling that the director / writer is trying to ridicule patients who have fallen victim to anesthetic awareness, maybe there is some stupid fun ... <br /> <br /> Enjoy ...
