I was willing to follow the original "Kruel Goals." It was in line with the story and remained true to the characters of one of my favorite stories. However, this movie was, in my opinion, a bland remake with essentially the same story and no clear character choices. I did not care what happened to any of them. The strongest part of the original story (Les Liasons, not CI) are the characters and their interactions, not the events themselves. I was not sure until I read IMDB that this movie was supposed to be a prequel, especially since the title contains the number "2". I was expecting a continuation, but then I decided it must be a companion piece. First of all, I must say that this film, at least for me, sounded like a soft version of Les Liasons. I was not impressed.
