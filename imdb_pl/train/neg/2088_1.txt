What a terrible performance. Science Fiction fans seem to be watching everything regardless of quality. I am shocked that something special, like Firefly, lasts for one season, while garbage, such as the remake of Battlestar Galactica, generates spin off. This spin-off is pathetic in every aspect of the program. Acting is underage and little inspired. The heroes are cardboard cliches of everything that has ever been in a bad Sci-Fi series. History is bad. Dialogue is worse than the soap opera in prime time. The direction is tacky and the sets are terrible. Caprica is a waste of film, a waste of time and a loss of effort. This is one spin-off that should never be made.
