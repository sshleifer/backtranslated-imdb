This movie was so amateur that it was hard to believe what I saw. It's shot on VIDEO! DO NOT film! I have not seen such things since the early 70's, when late at night the networks showed the movie of the week "cinema of horror" filmed in ...... video. It looks like a bad soap opera and that's a compliment. Some actors do it best. Michael Des Barres agrees with what he has to do, that is, act as a sex addict, getting out of control. I can not say it's nice to watch. <br /> <br /> Nastassja Kinski as a therapist sits on a chair practically throughout the film, with very little variation of camera angles. I can not blame her for being blocked by someone else, but she is totally unbelievable in her role. Her girl's voice works against her. And I consider myself a fan of Nastassja Kinski. It is certainly timeless and exotic, but beyond that is beyond its reach. <br /> <br /> Aleksandra Paul is pitifully overworked. Each line he delivers has three exclamation marks. Someone had to make her scream at any price. Why would Michael Des Barres want to have sex with such a raging vicious? <br /> <br /> Finally Rosanna Arquette as a sweet, sultry wife comes out of this and probably the most credible of this group. But that does not say much. <br /> <br /> It must be the worst movie I've seen in years.
