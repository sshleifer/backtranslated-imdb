Nothing positive to say. Meandering nonsense, panting and wheezing with "news". New Russian films (post-Soviet) can be very good (Cuckoo comes to mind), but many of them have a bouquet of cardboard and asbestos aftertaste (a good example would be Nochnoi Dozor). This is a kind of "surveillance" void. The action would be terrible if not for saving the grace of a completely unattractive direction and incompetent editing, which sometimes is so horrible that it distracts attention from the powerlessness of the actors. A special reward for the cameraman for making sure that every shot is shaky (could anyone realize that Blair Witch has 15 seconds of undeserved fame?) And takes an attitude towards inadequate teens who give up CounterStrike and masturbation. The female leads and too often tries to look seductive, the male antihero needs a diction trainer (although genetics is not bad: rather expressive eyes). One (middle) finger for this irrelevant stack of non-art. Anyone who reviews this positively, may be a (distant) cousin of "auteurs".
