2005 gave us a very decent "gore porn" flick Hostel, and 2006 gave us Live Feed; not so decent rip-off Hostel. Live Feed follows the same pattern as Eli Roth's earlier film, except that stupid children are in Asia and not in Central Europe. The plot focuses on these stupid children, and one of them annoys one of the residents, so they have trouble. The locals decide to lock them in the theater and kill them. Despite the fact that before I saw this movie I heard about something less favorable, I still hoped it could be at least half decent, because director Ryan Nicholson had made a very decent 45-minute rape and revenge of "Torched" but this movie simply falls because that most of them are either funny or boring. The film apparently tries to return to the good old days of the Grindhouse cinema (which the Hostel has done successfully), but it does not really go out. Surprisingly, given Nicholson's previous work in special effects - even gore does not make an impressive impression ... although it is much better than acting! I can not say anything more about this film ... it's bad and not in a good way. Avoid this!
