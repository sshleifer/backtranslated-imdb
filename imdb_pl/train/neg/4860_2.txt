A terrible, awful TV program! Why Comedy Central decided to repeat the old episodes of this program is beyond me. It really sucks! Of course, I'm talking about the seasons after the first two. The first two seasons were gold, and if I only talked about these times of the year, this program would gain eight out of ten stars. None of the comedians appearing after the first two seasons, who were not part of the original cast, is good. They were and are terrible. Comedy is not fun at all. AT ALL!!! <br /> <br /> The original cast was full of very talented comedians, such as Artie Lange, Phil LaMarr and Mary Schorr (or what's called), all of whom should have better offers after leaving MAD TV. This program is very overrated and less worthy of your surfing the channels than Saturday Night Live, another horrible program. Go out on a Saturday night and have fun, leaving MAD TV to wither and die as he deserves.
