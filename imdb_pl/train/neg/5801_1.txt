Ivan (Valeri Nikolayev) is a bitter, cynical journalist who studies unexplained. He travels to this small town, where he says that the witch (Ita Ever) terrorizes the community. <br /> <br /> His car stops, and he hides in a small building and meets a beautiful, mysterious girl. Suddenly he turns into a demon, and he kills her, and the city wonders who murdered this woman ... who, I think, was a witch, but I'm not sure. Ivan is being chased by her spirit, or something like that, and he must have faith or something to defeat him. <br /> <br /> I really hate Christian movies. They are usually filled with lame actors, stupid plot and minimal effects. Not to mention that this is not just a Christian film ... but also a foreign movie. The actor for Ivan made the film more comical than terrorizing because it is so tall and grumpy. You will not miss a lot of shortcomings in this movie.
