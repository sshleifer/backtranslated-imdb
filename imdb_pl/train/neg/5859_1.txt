Turkish cinema has a big problem. Directors are not interested in world cinema. They are local and popular, but they want to be international. It brings kitschy results of such a movie. <br /> <br /> The movie has jokes translated into Spanish from Turkish and have no meaning for non-Turkish recipients. Even for the Turkish audience after 10 years. <br /> <br /> Players, even Ferhan SENSOY have worse behavior than average. They act like marionettes. <br /> <br /> The film was shot in Cuba, but it does not say anything about Cuba. So Kuba is considered a banana republic. <br /> <br /> Losing money, a waste of time.
