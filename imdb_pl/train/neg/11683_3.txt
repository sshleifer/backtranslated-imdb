Three plot lines and insufficient connection, "Inside Man" was a very bouncy and incomplete attempt to be artistic and realistic. Although the movie had its moments, he began to look like a quick thriller, which quickly went down to slow crawling, quickly jumped between peaks and holes, and barely rose in the last 20 minutes. I will be grateful to Denzel Washington, who played his role very well with a full understanding of his human side, and not just a typical "super detective" with all the answers. Clive Owen also did quite well with his dual part as "bad genius" and "criminal brain" (both of these things are not the same in retrospect). Generally, however, each person has individually created a great subsection. However, when the parts finally joined and everything counted, there was no sudden "ah-ha!" Or summation of everything. It all ended with a very small amount of energy with which it began, with many holes, tons of questions and, as I said before, there is no place near the normal level of Spike Lee. I must completely disagree with the so-called "professional critics" ... this is not the movie in which they play.
