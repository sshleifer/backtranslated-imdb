It was a decent movie, I really liked it. But the ending is so violent !! There is absolutely no closure and it leaves a lot of loose ends. What happens after the concert? What's happening to her boyfriend? Is she combining with Grant? Is she coming in the next semester? And what about Angela? Of course, Holly's performance will hit Angela in a few pins, but nothing shows how she reacts. There are so many things in the air that are very unsatisfying. I do not know if he's trying to leave room for a sequel or something, but it's a horrible ending and I think it really makes the movie a joke. I was very disappointed.
