Spoiler: A bunch of passive aggressive people having a family connection. The script says they say and do things that people would never do, at least someone with a bit of decency. The hero falls for the woman he sees as his soul mate in the bookshop on the day of the convention, unaware that he will appear as his brother's girlfriend at the congress. She tries to appeal to her brother's claim, but she, knowing that our hero is clearly infatuated with her, irritates him mercilessly, wearing sexy clothes and acting like a stripper, rubbing his brother in an insidious excuse that shows him how to stretch. At some point, she actually gets distracted and goes into the shower with him. He tries to cover his eyes. His heart breaks. He thinks it's funny until he suddenly decides he does not want a brother and leaves the meeting. <br /> <br /> The film really is dragging. The audience coughed and fiddled in the long run. The magazine is unintelligent and unbelievable. We almost left, but we thought with certainty that something would happen, and everything would end, but not much. All cute reviews had to be written by paid shillas to imitate poor suckers like me to see such nonsense. Comparing it to Little Miss Sunshine ??? Jesus. Shame on them, writers, actors, producers and theaters that they let anything go bad on the screen!
