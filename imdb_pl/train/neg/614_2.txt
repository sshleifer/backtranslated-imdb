I'm watching it now on the Sci-Fi channel. It's horrible, I can not stop watching him! I am a cameraman and this movie makes me sad. I feel bad with someone related to this movie. Part of the camera's work is good. Most are very doubtful. There are several decent actors in this film. It is a pity that the director's relatives surround them. Only in this way could they be qualified for the film! The music was a little better than acting. If you look at it, I hope there was no other option! Sequel (this is the sequel) is coming now .... I think I will skip this! jason
