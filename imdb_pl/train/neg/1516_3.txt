Although THE FLOCK has quite a good acting from veteran Richard Gere, and some good shots that can refer to the days of SILENCE, the movie stretches to a turning point and destroys before a plot that really does not lead anywhere. br /> <br /> The film is about Erroll Babbage (Gere), who works for the security department and is preparing to retire. His office is being dropped by his deputy, Allison Lowry (Claire Danes, STARDUST), who quickly discovers that Babbage is obsessed with his work. And this job is not too funny. Monitors hundreds of sex offenders who are conditionally released in his jurisdiction. Allison goes with Erroll for many calls to check her "herd" of criminals and finds out that she desperately needs a retirement. But Erroll is good at his job, even if his methods are not. He mocks sexual predators and even has physical conflicts with them. Erroll justifies his actions, starting from the past of these deviants. It is this "good justification" that challenges viewers at a certain level, allowing us to see how brutal Erroll is, and yet how much he does not touch (being too close to his work). <br /> <br /> When a teenage girl is missing in the "area" of Errol, she immediately jumps to the conclusion that she has been kidnapped by one of his flocks. But how could he know? Is Erroll so good at his job? Allison challenges him and Erroll pushes him away. Their battles become as violent as Errolla's need to find this missing girl. <br /> <br /> Although the configuration of this story was okay, it did not have any umpf! I will be grateful to Richard Gere, who plays Erroll very well. Fighting with retirement. I was worried about everyone who is close to his flock. Disgusted by those for whom he is responsible. Disgusted with himself for having to do some things that he does. Enough change in the presentation of the character for Gere. But there is nothing else outside of it. Some sets are fine (dark and dangerous), but there are so many other problems that they are funny. <br /> <br /> I will be the first to admit that suspending disbelief is a requirement when watching movies. But this suspension has limitations. The biggest impulse against these restrictions is the destruction of extremely important crime scenes. Someone so meticulous as Erroll knew that moving the body would be a great no-no. Or trampling the crime scene. Or moving evidence. It went on and hurt the film endlessly. <br /> <br /> Another damaging part of this movie is that we never enter Clair Danes, Allison. At the end of the movie, she almost fell down and we'll never know what her intentions might be: will she stay or will she leave? Will it end up like Erroll if it stays? This is not a scary movie, because it touches on an uncomfortable moral basis, but the whole story had to be sharpened.
