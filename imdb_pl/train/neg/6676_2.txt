Perhaps I was not the biggest fan of Blair Witch, but I appreciated the effort, so I could not wait for Altered, especially after reading the superlatives in various IMDb comments. "Unique", "smart", "Future cult classics" and so on ... you have to wonder where people are inventing such things to describe such a bad effort. <br /> <br /> Because unfortunately, Altered is a poor, weak movie that does not get involved in any way. Stupidity is not funny. Horror and gore are not terrifying. And any "thinking" aspect that some of the poor colleagues saw in this film was caused by serious illusions, because there is certainly nothing deep or wise about this mess. <br /> <br /> OK, so we know that nothing stands out. Is it at least bearable? Is the experience valuable in any way? Unfortunately not. For starters, act very poorly. It's not hard to say that most B movies nowadays have better performance. Story? Boring and messy. Dialogues? Many amateurs actually do better. <br /> <br /> This is really the direction in which the puzzles. I did not expect significant improvements to the Blair Witch, but at least a small step forward. Instead, our director seems to be getting worse over time, completely unaware of previous experiences. <br /> <br /> If there is a serious defect in Altered, this is the main set. Much of the story takes place in one place, where the main characters are limited, but Sánchez has not managed to give the place any personality. Considering that the forest plays the main role in Blair Witch and is as much a character (antagonist if you prefer), like three students, one would think that the director will realize that the same thing is needed here. But no ... this place has no personality thanks to sloppiness and lack of attention to detail. <br /> <br /> There is nothing that can be saved. "Blair Witch" fans are better after Daniel Myrick. Although his achievements are far from being gold, he has a better structure than Sánchez, and some lessons from Blair Witch are used (unfortunately in weak stories, but still).
