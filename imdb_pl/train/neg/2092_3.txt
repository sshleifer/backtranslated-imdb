Essentially, "Caprica" ​​is a history of the Cylon origin. The premise of the performance is interesting. However, writers follow so many plot lines and drown them in too many POV characters that get stuck in the story's story. A conspiracy sneaking at the speed of the glacier disperses the tension it could have. There is little or no happening in every episode. <br /> <br /> Daniel Graystone (Eric Stolz) is a military contractor working on a robot soldier using a stolen chip. Unfortunately, his only working prototype is powered by the AI ​​version of his late daughter Zoe, who died in a suicide attack caused by Soldiers of the One (STO), an underground group of monotheistic extremists. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Joseph Adam (father of Adam Adam) "Battlestar Galactica" fights to keep the family together while searching for the version of AI his daughter (who also died during the bombing) in the Machiavellian virtual version of Capric (which is very similar 1930s Chicago). <br /> <br /> In addition to nasty writing, Caprica suffers from a similar problem as many history of origin. We already know how it ends (ie Cylons develop their own civilization and rebel against humanity).
