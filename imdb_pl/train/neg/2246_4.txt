I have never seen the original version of 1954 from Judy Garland, so there is no possibility of comparison. A few years passed, but this story was neither thrilling nor romantic. The film tells the story of two lovers whose musical careers are heading in opposite directions. John Norman Howard is a weary, disappointed rock star who begins to romance with a fresh, talented new song, Esther Hoffman. Her dramatic success only serves to emphasize his fall. <br /> <br /> The main actors, Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand, are adequate in their roles, but neither their chemistry nor plot has left any significant traces. The film is noteworthy for me in only one aspect, the beautiful version of Streisand, the Oscar-winning song Evergreen. He has a really powerful and wonderful voice.
