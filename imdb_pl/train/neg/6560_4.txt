"Shadrach" was not my favorite kind of film. I found it too sentimental and the acting was below normal. Harvey Keitel and Andie MacDowell were good, but the other actors were not credible at all. I also did not believe Paul's parents would leave and leave him with the Dabney family, especially when they lived in the housekeeper's house. Their social classes were too far apart to be considered reliable. It seemed that Dabney's lifestyle was too exaggerated. At the beginning of the movie there was a scene where Andie MacDowell leaves the car after having sex with someone. Who it was? Her son? What stage was to show us? Why was the scene even included? It had nothing to do with the rest of the movie and it was never made anymore. It seemed unpaid and did not fit the story. There were too many inconsistencies in the film for me. The story about Shadrach was nice, but I was not convinced that Dabneys would be as nice and generous as they were presented.
