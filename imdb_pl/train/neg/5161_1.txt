My life is to save animals. I work as a volunteer in a cat rescue organization. I'm a vegetarian because I could not kill an animal even to maintain my life. I can not even kill a spider, I put it outside. The scene in which children throw stones at the bird until death, will sooner take part in the attempt to be accepted by other children, I felt sick and persecuted me from that time. It just convinces me that people are pathetic in their need for acceptance. The ending - foster parents, fostered - they do not buy back cruelty to animals. Why would anyone want their child to watch this movie?
