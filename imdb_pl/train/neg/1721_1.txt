Crater Lake hit a meteorite (hence our title), waking up a plesiosaur who goes to a snack on a population (in California, this capricious capital of the world.) <br /> <br /> There are bad movies, and then there is "The Crater Lake Monster" who somehow managed to escape from MST3K. Thanks to grating, decent stop-motion beast and many other things, this is a scary song that uses low-budget 1970s / monster movie dreck. <br /> <br /> While the film is guilty of many crimes, the biggest movie is Arnie and Mitch, two unbearable rednecks that serve as our comic relief. They shake, they fight for "banjo music", they look at women and behave like pathetic excuses of humanity. Characters are so bad that they should count as a crime against humanity.
