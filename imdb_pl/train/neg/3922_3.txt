Predictable parody, you just could not impress around the world for eight minutes. The only thing that made it worth it was the NO COLOR line at the end of the loans. It's a shame that something more fun has not been put on DVD, like the pleasant Romero profile of Jonathan Ross in The Incredible Strange Film Show.
