I give this film 3 because it's worse than the cult movies that deserve the right 2. Does not make sense to you? Well, it does not have to. This is another vampire movie with a stupid plot, no, let me reformulate, an incredibly idiotic story in which cosmic cowboys (along with cowboy hats) fight the cosmic race of vampires with a moron. from this? The only good thing about this movie was Natassia Malthe with her stunning Norwegian beauty. God, I wish Michael Ironside and the DeLuise brothers would stop taking stupid roles in stupid movies! I mean, at least SeaQuest was nice! I know Mr. Ironside from many movies, he played 164 films on this day !! It's true that he rarely played the main role, but still!
