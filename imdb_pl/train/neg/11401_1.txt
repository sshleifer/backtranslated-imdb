The script was VERY weak without enough arcs of characters to be able to take care of heroes or what will happen to them. The script is too talkative and insufficient to call it a slow pace. The story comes to the point where you just want everyone to shut up and die as soon as possible so that you do not have to listen to them, talk about that very quiet, stiff dialogue. From a technical point of view, the music mix is ​​of a high standard and makes it difficult to understand what is being said most often. On the other hand, you can call it a blessing. In general, the same story could be better told in a short film with a duration of less than 30 minutes. The obvious "face to face" tribute to Sam Raimi and "Evil Dead" would have been good if they were more subtle, but here they seem a more bald rip-off. Come on, this type of budget is 35 mm and THIS is the best, what can you do? Still, the photos, lighting designs and shots were really well made.
