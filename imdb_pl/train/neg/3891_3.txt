I think that my favorite part of this film, which is an example of senseless, stupid and hopelessness of behavior, appears in the climax of the film. THE DOCTOR OF TED NELSON and his unmarried friend The Sheriff finally settled down on the landing pad on some stairs in an electric power plant. Remember that Nelson was looking for MM for almost the whole movie, and MM killed and ate a few people at the moment (including his boss), and Nelson is very aware that MM is violently crazy and a hungry man's body and blood. <br /> <br /> So the sheriff has his weapon on MM, which is, and I give Rick Baker's film and prop, the most disgusting and frightening object in human form we've ever seen. And I am asking a very important question to DOCTOR TED NELSON: "WHAT WE DO NOW?!?!?" <br /> <br /> The camera goes to DOCTOR TED NELSON and it is obvious that Ted has no idea what to do next. Apparently, Ted was so busy with the problem of Finding a drowning man that he had never thought of taking restraining equipment, a lasso, a straitjacket, a net or a tranquilizer, or perhaps New Age Vangelis tapes to soothe a wild animal. <br /> <br /> So the sheriff panics and shoots, Melting Man goes crazy and gay is born. <br /> <br /> Maybe this explains why NASA is screwing into the space shuttle program in the moon for the last 30 years, instead of going back to the Moon or Mars, as everyone knows that OUGHT is to be done. I do not know. <br /> <br /> Either way, it's a kind of bad, lazy writing and direction that cuts every aspect of the movie. It's hard to say how good the actors are, because the movie has complete contempt for its heroes. <br /> <br /> Two other extremely painful sequences also increase the stupidity of the procedure: there is a scene with the fattest old couple in the world trying to steal lemons from the grove to be torn by a melting man. This scene is nadir in the cinema of the '70s. I can guarantee that you've never seen a more senseless and irritating configuration with strange looking people in your entire life. Melting Man's attack on a woman who lives in a house where she is holding a horse that runs against walls, opposes any attempts to convert it (BTW, I think that the famous film director Jonathon Demme is supposed to walk on this scene as a Redneck husband who enters first thing to check at home and never go out again The only thing that prevents an actress from literally chewing the scenery is that, as I said, their horse is obviously peeing at her and we are forced to watch her hysterics for at least two minutes longer than any director SANE would stop the shot. <br /> <br /> Burr DeBenning should beat the IMM director and photographer shit I remember him from the old Columbo episode, where he looked MUCH better than he is here - no one knows about the leading man, but he is solid and discreet, but no one can be as unattractive in real life as his director tells him to look. <br /> <br /> In everyone else goes a little better, except for an old couple (and they close, I know they played for laughter, but I do not laugh!), but not much. <br /> <br /> It definitely belongs to the category "So bad that you can not look" cinema disasters. Still, I would watch it again before I looked at many other abortions from the 70's and 80's (I think of "Track of The Moonbeast" and "It Lives By Night"), and the MST relationship is great fun so if you have a chance, look at the MST version.
