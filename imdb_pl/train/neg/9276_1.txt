It's really a miserable movie. Admittedly, the original (no) Holy Trinity was governed by the law of diminishing returns, and the third "Final Conflict" turned into an absurd sub-story in the middle of the movie, apparently only to provide the necessary unnecessarily complex deaths that were now able to the raison d'Ãªtre of the "Omen" series. But then, to impose this scaled TV movie (beware of the buyers of the Omen set on DVD - do not be fooled by the panoramic proportions of transfer, it was a small screen thing) in the back of a series of generally good demonic coolers was inexcusable, especially supported by exec .producer and producer of the first three films Mace Neufeld and Harvey Bernhard. I would give away the plot if it were any, except for the usual scenes of death (hopelessly toned down for television sensitivity) and some of the worst acts I've ever seen. Everyone involved in this project, to people from gastronomy, should be ashamed that this parody has arrived on the screen, let alone disguised as Omen. If my opinion convinces one person to avoid this mess, I will feel better.
