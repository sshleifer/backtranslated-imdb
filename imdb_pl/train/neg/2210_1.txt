It was a really funny movie. <br /> <br /> Every 1 movie tried to be serious, which made this movie so funny. I mean the shark's head on the human body. Can it be more fun. Well done Sci-Fi keeps upcoming comedy movies. I never thought that movies could be delayed. If they continue, they'll have to change the name of the sci-fi channel to the sci fi comedy channel or something like that. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for the next 4 hit with sci fi. /> I will be ready with a bowl of popcorn and a box of beer or a bottle of alcohol and I will be ready to laugh again !!!
