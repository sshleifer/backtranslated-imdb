It's a scary movie, and no scene has a bit of real emotion. The characters are unchangeable, clearly drawn, predictable, and the plot is obvious and typically Hollywood fulfillment of wishes. <br /> <br /> William Holden (so sad that he saw him in this role) was 55 years old when the movie was made, but he plays someone in the early 40's and it looks like he's 60 years old. Kay Lenz was 20 years old and wrote the script to see that it is irresistibly attractive. I think the dog they found along the way was more sexy and had more life than their erotic combination. <br /> <br /> Holden's character - the same age as Clint Eastwood, when he directed this film (incidentally) - puts it with obvious elements from the 1960s against hippie cold: a studio, a hi-fi swing , dinners in Yamashiro. But the movie is ridiculously un-cool, the clattering noise of an old misty desperate regret that the free spirits they saw in the West and Laurel Canyon will not find them and their big honkin cars sexy. <br /> <br /> Ugh. Youth culture has never been so desperate. And I shudder, thinking that Bill Holden was so desperate for the youth that he took this embarrassing part.
