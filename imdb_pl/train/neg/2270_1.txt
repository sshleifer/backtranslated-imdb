The only thing that kept me from vomiting after watching this movie was the fact that they're just actors, not a freak that usually appears in a TV show. This is also the main reason why fans of the series will not like the movie, but not the only reason. This movie has more or less the same entertainment value as obtaining a root canal. It's getting closer to the dark depths of filming, and then it's worse. I will not waste your time describing this film in more detail; Suffice it to say that I am sorry for the poor people from cameras who had to suffer by watching this c ** p the first time.
