Disappointing movie. The actors' performance is poor. The sets are ok, they could be better. History is also poor. The battle sequences are terrible. The sounds and quality of the film are kitschy. The history of the Kazakh nation was very poorly known. This film should include more Kazakh actors in leading roles. And it should also be in Kazakh. Kuno Bekker and Jay Hernandez are of Latino origin. I do not understand this. For when the Spaniards play in the Turkish-Mongol people. This film is a shame of the Kazakh cinema. Rustam Ibragimbekov disappointed me. He is one of the best filmmakers in the world. Czekh, the director is justified because he is not a nomadic origin, he can not know the true spirit and history of nomads.
