I am a big fan of Nicolas Cage and I never thought he would work on such a movie. I could not believe other opinions and I thought that watching this should not be bad ... but believe me, it is. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the old movie. but why would they want to make such a movie. The basic idea of ​​a good horror movie is that it should have an exceptionally intelligent script or it should be extremely graphic. This movie does not fit into any of these movies and just stays stupid. I just watched the movie with the hope that at some point it would become interesting, but it never is. <br /> <br /> So this movie is not a big hit for both Horror fans and Cage fans. Probably it will appear on television.
