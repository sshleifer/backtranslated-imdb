I realized that Lil Kim was firing some cannons, and her arms or arms did not move, I went through the weaves, I made colorful contacts. <br /> <br /> That's what killed me: In a scene where four roses sat at the table, arguing. Lisa-Raye and Monica Calhoun get up, and then Lil Kim gets up to break off all warfare, saying: "Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Hold up. I am a fan of the Western genre and I have never heard anyone speak slang in any of Clint Eastwood's films. <br /> <br /> If someone thinks that this movie deserves a rating above 1, tell me another movie is worse than Gang of Roses. <br /> <br /> I'll be done.
