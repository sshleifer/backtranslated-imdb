I must admit that I'm stuck on it, thinking that something must happen, apart from the dead body in the first scenes ... and at her disposal. I was wrong. It was a Betty movie verse that hit the beach in the first part of Mordant Morgen. I really do not care what these young ladies from Scotland do these days, who you fuck, what medicines they take. Visually, the walk around Cabo de Gata in Andalusia was pleasant and certainly the most important for me. Nadir was a shop for her dead boy. When the movie came to an end, I had two thoughts ... 1. That's all that is? 2. Now I see why her boyfriend killed herself. Rename. "Bare Bitch Boredom, or what I did during my trip to Spain." I'm such a nerd that I'm pulling out these things.
