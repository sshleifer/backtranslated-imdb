Can I give this negative rating? No? Let me say that this is the most horrible movie I've ever watched. It was painful. Boringus Maximus. The graph (?) Is well hidden in several levels of the nebula. I rented this movie with a friend and after about thirty minutes of hope that it would be better, we decided to "speed up a bit" to see if everything would be better. It never improves. This movie about some guy who was kidnapped by these two girls sounds interesting, but in reality it's just boring. Nothing even interesting will ever happen. If you ever get the chance to see it, do yourself a favor, instead try "PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE".
