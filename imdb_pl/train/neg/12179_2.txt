It is not worth even to watch this cheesy spoiler that destroys everything about "Annie". Heroes seem almost cheap by a badly written story and have low quality for production. It was very clear for the TV, but if I found it on my TV, I would reject it straight. The children in the movie do a good job, but the adult acting is unbelievable, so the movie really does not attract you. In this film, there were no musical / dance numbers that made the original brilliant and really reflected Annie's light all love. Johnson, because Annie is sometimes annoying and overreacting ... you can not see that she is really Annie. The differences in the appearance of the characters irritated me throughout the duration of the film. Sad that this continuation was a total flop.
