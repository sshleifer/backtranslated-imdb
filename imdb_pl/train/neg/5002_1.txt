How did such a horrible script manage to attract this cast? Funny, predictable and completely unbelievable, it's well-preserved and sophisticated, but the material is so bad that it can still be included in the worst thrillers I've seen for years. Unbelievably bad, not in a fun way. Avoid at all costs, even if you're a fan of someone in the cast.
