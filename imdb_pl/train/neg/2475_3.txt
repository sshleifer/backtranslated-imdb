I was disappointed. the film was somewhat predictable and could not match the noise in the whole field. Having said that, the characters were well developed, the myth of the elevator was used in a unique place, and the house was quite terrible, but I missed it. I have been waiting for this great AHHHHH or BOO! But he never came. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film was plagued by poor filming of weak special effects. This shows a lot of bad things and does not use the viewer's atmosphere and imagination to create horror and tension. Try videos like session 9 or dice if you're looking for a low-budget, but well-conceived horror movie.
