This film is a good example of how, through media manipulation, you can sell a movie that is nothing but a very uncomfortable television sitcom. In Puerto Rico, the daily newspaper with the widest circulation constantly writes about the wonders of this film, almost silencing everyone else. Incidentally, the second-largest newspaper belongs to the same owners. Weekly CLARIDAD is the only newspaper on the island that has analyzed the form and content of the film and pointed out all its disadvantages, stereotypes and bad writing. <br /> <br /> Just because the movie creates part of the audience laughing out of easy and obvious jokes, and because you can recognize actors and landscapes, it does not make the film acceptable.
