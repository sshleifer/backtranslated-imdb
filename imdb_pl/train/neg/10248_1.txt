the end of the world looks like a good movie on the cover, but beware that it is bad. being a big fan of the mega-star actor Christopher lee, I was cheated. like tentacles (77) a good cast does not mean it will be a good movie. The beginning looks promising, and then turns into boredom, many parts of the movie are too dark to see what's going on. the rest of the cast is shown in short, Lew ayres, dean Jagger and MacDonald Carey as a bodyguard. I would expect better from Charles, who made good films such as re-animater and dolls. he said his stars would be Jose Ferrer, John Carridine, and dean Jagger.well Dean Jagger is there, but the other two have never succeeded (if they succeed), if you make a movie about the end of the world, use a bigger budget and a better plot. Jagger then made two good films, an alligator (80) and a death game (79) sue Lyon (Lolita) is also in the movie without her lollipop. If you are a glutton for punishment, look at the end of the world, which I dare to say during the whole movie.1 at 10.
