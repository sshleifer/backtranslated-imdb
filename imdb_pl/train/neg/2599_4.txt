I have a DVD that's very cheap and I'm totally Drew, and it's probably the only constellation in which this movie could interest anyone. <br /> <br /> Drew's early movie, it looks great, and she gets quite a lot of really cute scenes, such as a shower scene, a sexy dance scene, lots of sexy outfits, etc. She never shows the friendly charm known from her latest films. <br /> <br /> the film itself is quite average or average, and looks much better than a movie for the cinema. There is no real horror or tension, and dialogues are often tacky. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part is probably the end, because I honestly do not understand it. But maybe there is nothing to understand. But at least you will not reach the end you would expect and also much sooner than you expected. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think this movie is exclusively for Drewbies.
