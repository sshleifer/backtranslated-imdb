It will be short. Let me first say that I am an agnostic and I am not completely crazy about xtians, especially Xtian fanatics. However, this document had a tone similar to a teenager who was angry at his mother, Xtian, for not allowing him to play video games. I just could not take it seriously. Remembering how CharlesManson thought he was the Christ to illustrate that xtianites can give birth to evil? I do not know if it was simply cheap and childish - it made the opposition look ignorant. What's more, the narrator seemed simply snobbish and pretentious. The delivery was complete. I can not take this document seriously. He may appeal to an angry teenager peeing at his mother, Xtian, for not allowing him to play video games.
