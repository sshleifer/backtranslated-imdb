Return to Cabin by the Lake in no way withstands the original. Because only one main character (Stanley) returns to the sequal, the movie is not even worth 2 hours of your time. I am a big fan of the first movie, the plot and acting were really good, but this is one movie that I will never see again. Essentially, it corresponds to the sequences for Urban Legends and Blair Witch, but with much worse performance. Personally, I've seen better working in soap operas, it's so pathetic that you just have to laugh. In any case, I do not recommend this movie to anyone, watching it just distracts from the first one.
