This movie was amazing. This is not terrible. I often meet with a group of friends and go to a movie store to find awful movies to see their comedic value. My friend suggested this, but when we watched it, people started to go out. I really wanted to end this, to be able to say that I have, but I could not. It's so bad. Horrible gags for running, lame actor. The main characters are the annoying dinosaur clutches and Whoopi Goldberg. I'd rather watch Costener's Postman twelve times in a row than see a fraction of the movie again. I think they are trying to cope with some of the problems of dinosaur discrimination, but part of the movie that really stands out is the dinosaur, who constantly turns things over with his tail, then laughed. It hurts. Watch if you are an aspiring masochist, otherwise leave it alone.
