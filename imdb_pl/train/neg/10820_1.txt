What was Franco Zeffirelli thinking? Was Hollywood responsible for this parody, or is it comforting to think that someone who did not speak English as the first language completely missed the heart of the Charlotte Bronte classics? I do not think I can correct the comment I've read below, so I paraphrase it: "Jane Eyre is a great great book, the screenwriter should read it one day". It is true that the two films leading in this film were unfortunately wrong. But it's a shame on the actors, because the screenwriter skips all the best scenes. The dialog that lets you understand Jane and Rochester has a meeting of minds and a common sense of fun ... removed from the script. The marriage proposal, the fairy ... disappeared. These allusions, half-joking, half honestly felt, for Jane as a fairy spirit from ancient England, come to save Rochester in his despair ... eliminated. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that Zeffirelli felt the need to completely rewrite the end of the novel and Jane's interaction with the Rivers family. But it is unforgivable that he surgically removed love from one of the best love stories ever written. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and find a mini-series from 1983 (?) with Timothy Dalton.
