A few months ago I took part in a debate with another IMDb poster (Hey, Kmadden) about this film. The poster insisted that if I gave 'Flushed Away' a chance, I would like it. Based partly on this argument, I agreed to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> "Flushed Away" has good intentions (at least in part of Aardman), but he lacks the strength to connect it all. His best asset is the captain of the rat / boat, Rita (played by Kate Winselt), who, IMO, should be the main character of the film instead of Roddy (Hugh Jackman). Rita is cool, hard and interesting, while Roddy spends most of her time on the screen. <br /> <br /> One of the things that bothered me the most in the FA is the repetition of jokes that are not funny at the beginning. When Roddy gets squatted, the movie ensures that there will be five more times. "My name is Shocky," says one of Rita's brothers, who then strikes Roddy at least three times. My tolerance for cheap gags that are associated with pain is always low. <br /> <br /> I will not waste my time catching Katzenberg's klezomaniac for Pixar (one similar movie is a coincidence, five are rip-offs). but let me say that I am disappointed with Aardman. They can do (and do) much better. Try it next time, guys.
