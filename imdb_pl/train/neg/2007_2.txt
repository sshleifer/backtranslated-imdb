The cast is OK. The script is sometimes awkward and it takes some time to find out what the meaning of the movie is. I waited impatiently to make the dishes. Bit Shehan is a shoddy statement about the war. I do not think we should notice it ... we did. This house, you did nothing but kill forty-five minutes. Part of the shower ... what? What was it about? Literally, I have a client, "Ok, you can use our shower." Yawn. The angles are trying hard. There was a forest there, his reason suddenly disappeared, through which you can see, and then it is deep, and the animals die. After all, it's a frightening movie with boring proportions.
