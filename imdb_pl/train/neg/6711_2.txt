1993 was a year. It was long before Phillip Seymour Thomas won the Oscar. Who knew that I would be extraordinary with him in the film? I was a paid addition to "My Boyfriend's Back," which was filmed in a suburb of Austin called Georgetown, TX. The original title was "Johnny Zombie" (thank God the producers changed their mind!) I was on the stage. I ran to watch the movie the day it was released in cinemas. It's more comedy than horror. But ... for good laughter, you can check it out. Nothing that is even close to "Dawn of the Dead" or even "Shaun of the Dead", but the cheese factor is good enough. Hello
