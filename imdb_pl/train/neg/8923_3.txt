Like Orson Welles thirty years earlier, Mike Sarne received "the largest set of trains in the world" he could play with, but unfortunately he lacked the ability to do more than watch his train become a train wreck that is still being talked about with shock and a strange kind of delight. Despite postmodernist interpretations that somehow suggest that it is a homosexual or even feminist treatise, the fact is that it was a serious disaster in 1970 and it still remains one. thus, he is a strictly guarded secret after royalty. Only Michael Cimino approached the political and artistic Armageddon, which is the "Heavenly Gate". Both films looked like ego journeys to their directors, but at least Cimino made one of the great movies from the 1970s, before squandering the studio's generosity, while Mr. Sarne had only Joanna's "fey" in the cupboard. What's more, "Heaven's Gate" can boast of unforgettable and well-planted sets, in which, tragically, the "Myry Breckinridge cabinet" was empty. Simply put, this is by far the worst example of biting a hand that feeds on Hollywood history.
