I would like this film to be zero or even lower because it deserves it. Honestly, I never leave the movie, but it was so horrible that I could not stand the next minute of the movie. Please, please, for the good of humanity, skip this movie. If you want a hot lesbian movie that you can really delve into, that's not it. <br /> <br /> It has an unattractive, unattractive lead, an uncertain structure, a funny dialog box and it is absolutely unconvincing in every way possible. At an absolutely basic level, he does not entertain. Everything in "Mango Kiss" is so scenic that it's WORSE than any student movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> If that was not enough, the whole movie is based on a constant (and I mean CONSTANT) voice over the narrative. A script writer could have written a novel as well, because they insisted on telling everything instead of showing it. We should just assume that Lou and Sassafras are the best friends and have a special connection, even if there is no character development to illustrate. This movie still introduces new heroes after the first five minutes, not in a natural way, but in the form of frozen characters with the name written on the screen. There is no introduction, no character development. We do not really recognize any of them. <br /> <br /> This is the most amateur movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I am a gay who watched this movie from my roommate (another gay woman) and we both found the movie a depressing representation of queer cinema. I'm starting to think that lesbian and gay movies are very similar to Christian rock - it does not matter how horrible it is, people will continue to fly to it and defend it, no matter how poor the quality is. Do not rent it !! Instead, let's encourage the production of GAY and lesbian films QUALITY, renting "But I'm a Cheerleader" or "Fire" or "Heavenly Creatures", instead of swallowing the thoughtless guts that target the gay community (eg Queer as Folk).
