Another of my hollows in the bargain basket, this movie gave me exactly what I expected - a load of nightmarish horror with screaming ladies. <br /> <br /> It all started so well - I liked the small intro of the "film chronicle" about the fact that the young couple is exposed to a nuclear explosion and was completely absorbed until the first person exploded ... < br /> <br /> From that moment the movie became completely stupid, and sometimes it became almost embarrassing to watch. When the heroine was affected by the same condition as the main character (the possibility of igniting his own farts without the help of a match), it seemed that someone threw the idea at the last moment ("that" it will be fine! ", You can almost hear their saying ...) the almost psychic connection between the protagonist and the nuclear power plant, no ... <br /> <br /> The movie was so cheap tat - if you pay more than Â£ 1.50 for it, it has been done.
