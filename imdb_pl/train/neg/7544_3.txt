First, this movie was not so bad. It was funny ... at least for me probably all the wrong reasons. I've never seen the original, so I can not compare the two. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me of this strange movie Christopher Reeve Village of the Damned. Two films have different themes, but this horrible disgusting feeling and unwanted comedy exist in both. <br /> <br /> A wicker man has to be a secret / thriller / male, please, do not be angry with a woman's film. I do not know the whole pagan thing and the dedication was a bit off. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage, his great evil self goes to an isolated island called Summerisle, when he receives a calligraphy letter from his missing fiancée who claims that her daughter was taken and hidden by other islanders. <br /> <br /> Cage is a police officer and, being a tired policeman, goes to an uncharted island, leaving no information about his whereabouts to anyone who is in the real world. Stupid. <br /> <br /> Things are getting weirder when the big Amish women who populate the island growl at him and lie about the whereabouts of the missing girl. His fiancée does not help, he seems elusive and tired all the time. Cage stays on the island when she finds out that the missing girl is his daughter, and he is a happy man who has been deceived to come to this island as a sacrificial victim during the festival of harvesting sick islands. <br /> <br /> In this movie, men do not do that well. A sick, twisted show of feminism? <br /> <br /> I found this movie sometimes funny, especially when a cage hits a few women and runs in a bear suit. I think there were too many holes in this movie. I believe that the whole concept of angry women closes on the island, not caring that men are funny, but the way in which it was presented in this film was simply strange. While most women have suffered wounds and anger, this is clearly the form of sexism. I would reject the film in disgust if the roles were reversed. This movie is something that can be viewed only once or twice. It is NOT a thriller that should be considered strange.
