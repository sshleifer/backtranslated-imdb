Another trash made for a piece of TV! It's an insult to a war movie (I use the word movie in the simplest form possible!). I thought that Telly Savalas's career hit down when he made a call on a visit to Birmingham, which is shown regularly on Tarranta on television regularly, but then I forgot he was involved in it! I tried to push it into my unconscious memory, but cable TV brought memories from me! <br /> <br /> I like this piece (laughs sarcastically!) in a movie that claims to be a Liverpool scene in the 1940s, but is a glaring shot from Zagreb Cathedral in the late eighties. Also the steam train trained by Commando clearly shows the JZ logo (Jugoslavia Zeleznice, or Yugoslavian state railways) on the side of the locomotive, even though the producers tried to darken it. Why not just film in the UK, if that's the case for the most part? <br /> <br /> Cheap garbage and celluloid waste!
