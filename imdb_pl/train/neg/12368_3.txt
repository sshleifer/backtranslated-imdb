"Well, Chuck Jones is dead, lets dirt his characters, adding cheap explosions, American anime knock off style and give them superpowers." "But sir? Are not we all ready for several performances in works that are already like this? Do not be denied on their original creator's dreams. " "Yes! and these shows make us have a lot of cash and we need more! ". "But will not every man, woman and child grow up who grew up with fewer characters?" "you're right! set it in the future, make them descendants of the original characters and change all names a bit ... but not too much, we still have to be able to succeed the classics. " <br /> <br /> Well, that's the only reason I can think why it exists. If you look at the horrible desecration of our beloved Looney Toons, it will look like OK.

All characters are dressed like a batman, they drive in a ship fighting with super villains, they have superpowers, the only difference is that they talk like Looney's melodies and have similar names and character traits. <br /> <br /> These kinds of things fall into the category "it's so funny that it's good."

You know, they say, piracy is like stealing a car; this show is like plunder. They might as well have been able to dig up all people associated with the original cartoon, push them to the exhibition, change into pirate costumes and recharge their money. If this program did not use characters (which in no way resembled Looney Toons) that already made the studies millions, then that would be good. But no! For shame the Warner brothers, for shame. <br /> <br /> If I saw this as a 30-second gag on Simpson or Family Guy, I would love to. Because I can not believe it ever came about. I bet 80% of people who work on this program hate it. But whatever it matters, in 10 years this program will be forgotten, and the originals will live forever, or at least until the end of the world. <br /> <br /> "In 2008, Snoopy and the peanut gang returned and now they have terrifying lasers and can become invisible! Can Charley Brown defeat the evil alien master, Zapara?
