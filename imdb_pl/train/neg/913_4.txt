OK, let's see. What was fun in the first movie? I know people with funny accents, people falling into the water, stupid boat accidents and funny comments between the two bands. In this movie, they turned the accent to the max, nothing good. A lot of people fall into the water for uncertain reasons, not good. Boatcrash, check. Funny comments between both teams, they tried, but they failed. Also in this movie may be the personalities that they are tracking. This film should be about what is happening on the water, not on land. I am sorry to say that between the funny parts it is too far away and the sponsors of the film are maximally exploited. Not good. In total, I give him four out of ten because he has some fun parts.
