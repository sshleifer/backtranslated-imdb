I really have to watch a good movie soon, because it seems that every other entry is something I despise. However my story says, I am not allowed to lie. Bobby Deerfield and everything sucks big green banana skins. I never thought that I would see a movie as stupid as this. Al Pacino does not play in this film: he poses. There are many, many scenes of his character, who is a racing driver, staring at the camera. It is completely horrible. Marthe Keller is equally angry. These two people should have an affair and there is simply no chemistry. Sydney Pollack directed this movie? There is no trace of genius behind Tootsie. Is this the same man I cheered at in Eyes Wide Shut? It's hard to me to believe it. Save yourself a terrible movie. Run, do not go, Bobby Deerfield.
