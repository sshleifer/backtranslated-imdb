I am a big fan of Troma, but I can not understand why they bought the rights to this film. It's so boring. I felt like I was watching for 3 hours. Somewhere in the summary of the plot, he says, "but what Satan does not know is stuck with annoying tourists." Well, it did not seem to bother him in the movie, just me. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is the actor who plays Satan, I like bad movies, but it was just boring.
