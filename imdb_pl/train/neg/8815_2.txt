Yes, I will tell you only about it, so do not read if you want surprises. I got this with the title Christmas Evil. There was also another horror movie DVD called Silent Night, Bloody Night. While Silent Night, Bloody Night (not to be confused with Silent Night, Deadly Night), had great potential and was close to being good, this one was not so good. It started quite interesting, watching the villain (if you can call him that), watching children from the neighborhood and writing in books about who is naughty and nice, but after some time you are looking for some action and this movie fails. You need character development, but it exaggerates and you still do not know why the hell guy is jumping out. For about an hour, he kills three of four people while the whole crowd looks in horror, and the guys he kills are not even his targets, they just laugh at him. This is one of many unsuccessful attempts to kill a naughty killer. Then he tries to kill the other guy and tries to break into his house, squeezing into the fireplace. Immediately he is stuck and barely escapes. Then he goes through the basement and then tries to kill the guy, suppressing him in his bedroom. He can not kill a guy like that, so he grabs the star from the tree and cuts the boys' throat. What the hell was the tree in the bedroom at all? Oh yes, the killer stopped at the party before this killing and he also had fun. The point is, except that people from the city chase him with torches and an unresolved part with his brother and that he wants to play. What was it about? He was talking about something that was never really explained. How it ends, what do you ask for, if I have spoilers, I'll tell you. He runs off the road in his van and goes on, let's say he was bad!
