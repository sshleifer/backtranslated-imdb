Usually I do not have the motivation to write reviews. But this movie was so terribly painful that I feel I have to. I cringed into a frighteningly predictable conspiracy, a lame actress and laughing at moments that were supposed to be tense. Indeed, most of the audience seemed quite bored and talkative even in the "most tense" moment of the movie. Molly Ringwald stood out as the only performance of any value in tortured production. Even the "turn" at the end was not. I heard that he said that the film is not taken seriously; but I could find little evidence for it in the film. <br /> <br /> The cut should be left on the floor of the cutting room. Do yourself a favor and spend time and money on something else!
