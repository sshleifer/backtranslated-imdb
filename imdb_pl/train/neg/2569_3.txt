Peter Sellers (one of my favorite actors) is a bit funny in this turkey from the 1970s, but the scenario is so bad and offensive that even Goldie Hawn's youth (just after winning the Oscar) can not start pulling it out of the mud. As a skirt celebrity at the age of 40, Sellers mostly embarrass themselves to n. Degree. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10. Best performance =? Nicky Henson plays in a young type of learning. <br /> <br /> I hope Hawn and Sellers have been well rewarded, because I see no other reason for such tripe in 1970 (very good year for movies - CATCH-22, MASH, MAN, JOE, WUSA, FIVE EASY PIECES and many more). You can not win them all!
