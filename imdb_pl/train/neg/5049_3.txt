A group of us watched this movie, it was really disgusted. We wanted to forgive the fact that our favorite Jo character was not present (it's not that screenwriters / producers could do anything about it). Writing was poor, the scenario was below normal. What REALLY annoyed us: 1. When both boys realized that they were meeting Natalie, they did not just go away to withstand this stupid (and ultimately degrading) competition - but only because they were macho rival guys, not because I really wanted Natalie. 2. Despite the lack of choice between two guys before the meeting, Natalie suddenly decides that she really loves one of the guys and is ready to marry him? (and there were no announcements that he was a really better guy, as if the writers were tossing a coin and then told her to spit it at some convenient point in the movie). 3. Blair says she does not want children, and then suddenly when her husband says she wants to have children, she honestly agrees with him.
