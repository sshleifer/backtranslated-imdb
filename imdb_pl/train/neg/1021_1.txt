The movie began with a strong side, LL Cool J (Deed) as a secret policeman with partner Sgt. Lazerov (Dylan McDermott from Practice, probably a loser as a bad guy?) Committing robbery and murder. Deed refuses to kill a drug dealer who sets up a conflict between a dirty policeman and a conscience. Other big names (Freeman, Spacey et al.) Are well manned and the movie shows a promise. <br /> <br /> The movie begins to be short when Justin Timberlake (Pollack) is introduced. Considering the possibility of making a good movie that people will watch many times, or one that teenage girls will go and see once because of Timberlake, I would choose the first one. Even talented actors have to work hard on their craft; Timberlake is NOT talented and no amount of hard work can save him. I would think that it will show up better considering the fact that he has been talented for years. Everything he did in this movie was unconvincing. <br /> <br /> Only because the singer sells millions of records and sells stadiums does not automatically mean that they can successfully work in feature films. Even the most ardent N'Sync fans will not be able to ignore the obvious lack of acting talent. <br /> <br /> Excluding several storylines, such as the sudden Pollack sniper and the deadly handling of storage machines. This film was so promising. Exactly disappointing.
