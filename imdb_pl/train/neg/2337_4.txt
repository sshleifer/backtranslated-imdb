I do not know what's the buzz around ... It's a really bad movie ... it did not help me, the only scene of descent is where everyone meets at the party, and a nice song plays, uplifting and nice cinematic shots that make you move ... it was the best part of the movie ... Otherwise, this movie lacks everything to draw the viewer into history. There is no history, there is nothing to think about, as some say, there is no consistency between different stories ... it was rather an attempt to re-make Anderson's Magnolia, which was brilliant, but fails blatantly ... Okay, it's light and easy to watch but it's also movies. Maybe you'll write a story first before you make a movie ... 4/10 One of the worst Belgian movies I've seen
