Do not waste time on this thrill. In the performance, the characters have no value of redemption, and viewing their interactions is a simple torture. "Gothic" was at least entertainment, it was nonsense. If you like watching pretentious and spoiled poets trying to outwit each other, it may be your avenue. Lord Byron is portrayed as a complete moron, and why others decide to spend more than five minutes with him is really stunning. Mary Shelly seems to be the only character with any backbone, but even she leaves the whole of the gehenna with no respect. What a waste of time. See Gothic instead. I also remember that I saw another great movie based on the same topic, but I did not catch the title. I hoped it was it, but I had no luck. Do not recommend.
