The word "1" in the title has a more sinister meaning for viewers of this film than for victims of crimes. At least they do not have to stick to watching this endless movie that reaches its own demise. <br /> <br /> 1. should refer to: 1. sketch of the script; The first shots used in each performance in the last movie; 1st edition in post-production; etc, etc. <br /> <br /> The movie is not cast too bad, just everything in the film is worse than the third, from the silly script, to wooden performances. And suffering through this paved movie, for a 2-hour sign you want to lose from misery. After 160 minutes it is easy to see that it should be edited in less than 2 hours. <br /> <br /> Going to details about the lame screenplay and acting serves small purposes. Even in the equally horrible, Lake Placid, at least the performances of Bill Pullman and Bridget Fonda made from an extremely poor scenario, were sufficiently polished to make you laugh out of the movie. In the first place, Die, ends the mourning only for the time lost in waiting for what will happen after the stage opening the preparation of a suicidal female lead. <br /> <br /> The editing is so bad that it is never introduced to one of the main characters that I think about (never mentioned) is a district prosecutor. It just appears in one scene in the middle of a conversation. Of course, the scene in which she was introduced to the viewer was dropped on the editor's floor. And no one realized that a figure appearing out of nowhere is an amazing movie trick. <br /> <br /> In a word, do not waste time on this one. My wife and it's a pity we did not do it. But at least we created our own diversion, commenting on various places in the film, as in the Mystery Science Theater. "Meanwhile in Cleveland ..." !!!!
