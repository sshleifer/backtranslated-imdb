This film deserves credit for its original approach. It combines the elements of theater, film and epic stories. Unfortunately, it falls to all levels. The greatest weakness of films is the reluctance to get involved in something; it has camp, moralistic and epic elements, never committing to any of them. As for the story itself, Chretien de Troyes revolves around the grave in this horrible adaptation that turns a delightful, unbearably innocent Percival into the most naughty and naughty churla. <br /> <br /> They will probably see two kinds of people, Frankophiles or Arthuriophiles. Speaking as one of the last, I found this movie an incredible and incredibly shabby, disrespectful treatment of beautiful history.
