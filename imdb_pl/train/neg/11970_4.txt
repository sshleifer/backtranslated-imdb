... that Lt chose this one. First of all, the movie was not scary, only Hollywood. The worst case scenario, in which I need what happened or not, has no film: if Willis' mission was to save the doctor, but she was adamant that her "men" would get out of the missionary, put her on the first helicopter and marched these refugees to the border without her. He would not compromise his refugee package. It does not work that way. But, as I pointed out, this is Hollywood, we must have a drama. That's why we make movies because the reality is not so complicated. However, I thought that Willis and a good doctor have good chemistry. Still, there are well-made battle scenes in the film. This is not a waste of time, "Tears of the Sun" is worth the fee for renting a DVD. Check it out on a rainy day and you will be satisfied.
