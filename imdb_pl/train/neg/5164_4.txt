The basic plot of this film is not bad. The lady does it big and returns to her alma mater to worship her. But despite the good work of Robert Young and Eve Arden, the movie is a mess. I blame either Joan Crawford or the director, or both, because her performance is simply horrible. Instead of being a real person, he makes a great incarnation of the deer caught in the headlights. In other words, he stares into space and has the expression "golly I am SOOOO stunned". After a few minutes, it really annoyed me. Now, it is certainly not Crawford's only movie that I do not like for her performance, because she did more than just part of her actions - in films like JOHNNY GUITAR or many of her later films, such as BERSERK! I advise you to try another Crawford movie - it certainly was better.
