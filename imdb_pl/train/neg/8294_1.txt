Maybe something poetic in seeing the suffering of dentists. They suffer, they do, in this grim, really scary movie, but they cause the audience to suffer from non-dental diversity as well. If you ever wanted to see a movie full of screaming kids, kids, sick children, many long, meaningful looks, a deadly serious wife and an alarmed husband: that's all for you. Boring, long, stands out as one of those examples that scream: why? Is there salvation grace? This is. There is a short scene from Nabucco, with quite good singing. Save your money, and if it's on TV or cable, save time. You can always read a book or make an omelet.
