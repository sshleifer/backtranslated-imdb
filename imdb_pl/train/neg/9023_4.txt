I watched anime, but I'm not an avid fan; and I do not read manga. I say this because many reviewers who are lyrical about this movie seem to have this background. I saw "St John's" and although it is not a masterpiece of any part of the imagination, it made me take up "Shinobi", especially since everyone likes it. <br /> <br /> Well, I watched it this afternoon and struggled very hard to watch. Yes, it's very beautiful - scenes in slow motion of water, autumn leaves in trees, even CGI's flickering eyes - majestic. I liked the hawk, costumes and even some fighting scenes, but overall it was boring like dirt. <br /> <br /> It seemed that someone took "Romeo and Juliet" - the translation even mentions that the star has crossed out the lovers - and threw in a few "X-Men" for good. The two heroes shared the powers of Wolverine - the bear-dressed guy had claws and the gray-haired guy healed himself. Then you have a girl who has a kiss with poison - it's Poison Ivy (from Batman). Why do they give these women such stupid powers? The poisonous girl shows that her leg then kisses you to death. Man, it's a great power for you. And the other girl can create mistakes with this yellow dust that rubs against her hands. The second woman, one of the beloved stars, has the power of hypnotic glance. Wow. <br /> <br /> In a sense, I came to the end of the movie, quickly scrolling through it and saw some more tragedies than I expected. Some people compare it to "House of Flying Daggers" and "Hero". Do not make this mistake. They may have similar endings, but the similarities end there. "Shinobi" is the work of an amateur - the other films are created by an experienced filmmaker. <br /> <br /> I'd say avoid this movie unless you're between 12 and 18 years old.
