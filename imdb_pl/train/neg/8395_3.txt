- The film crew is shooting a horror movie in an old, allegedly damned house in which seven people have been killed over the years. One of the crews finds an old spell book and it looks like it will be perfect for some ritual scenes in their movie. It is understood that the spells in the book are better written than the script they use. But when the book is read, the outside cemetery suddenly comes to life. Now the cast and crew are facing a real danger. <br /> <br /> - IMDb gives 90 minutes. Nothing happens for the first 60 minutes. Too much time is devoted to film in the movie. Should we be scared of the horror they are shooting? We already know that their movie is not "real". These horrors just do not work. <br /> <br /> - There are not many things that you can admire at The House of Seven Corpses. Acting is terrible. Most of these "actors" would have trouble playing the elementary school. The result is terrible. It's very similar to a TV series from the 70s and does not provide an atmosphere. Speaking of the atmosphere, apart from a few moments at the end of the movie, there is nothing to talk about. The logic of characters does not exist. Even in the movie you expect characters to behave in a certain way. Here, I do not think I remember one scene in which the character did not choose the most illogical road available to them. And finally, there are the first 60 minutes of the film that I have already mentioned. Can you say BORING? <br /> <br /> - I did not rate The House of Seven Corpses because of the cases where the movie (probably by accident) actually works. My two favorites are the beginning and the end. The opening title sequence represents the death of the seven previous owners and may be the main attraction of the film. And ending scenes on massive stairs, when zombies threaten the film crew, are somewhat effective (what a ringing). Generally, however, these moments are not enough to make a good movie out of it.
