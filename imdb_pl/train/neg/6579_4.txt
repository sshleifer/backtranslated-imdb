"New Best Friend" is another entry in the subcategory "steal life for another woman"; the best ones are "Single White Female" and "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle"; the worse ones can be caught almost every afternoon on the Lifetime channel. For some reason, this type of identity theft concerns only women. <br /> <br /> There are only two basic ways to play this type of story. You can make a woman angry at the beginning and let the audience observe consciously when he hatches and implements his bad plan. Or you use inappropriate targeting to make her look like a good person, because a seemingly unplanned series of events breaks her favors until it turns out that she is angry at the climate scene. Unfortunately, the creators of "New Best Friend" could not decide how they want to play, and things fail and burn early. For the first time, we meet Alicia (Mia Kirshner), trying to get a scholarship at the university's financial aid office. We know now that he is a bad person and suspects all her later actions. But the director and editor have apparently forgotten that this revelation was made and they spent the next 50 minutes putting a mistake to convince us that Alicia is a good person. This introduces the only element of tension, not about whether it is bad, but about when the director and editor are wiser and stop wasting our time with transparent misdirecting. <br /> <br /> The "new best friend" suffers more than most of the curse of the movie about teenagers from the cast too old to depict undergraduate students. There are really only two large parts: Hadley (Meredith Monroe) and Alicia (Kirshner). These were respectively 31 and 26 at the time of production. It almost works for 26-year-old Kirshner, when he plays the mouse version of Alice, but becomes glaring when he is turned into a shiny version of Alice. Monroe cast is just a joke, as if he wanted Nicholette Sheridan to try as a classmate on "Lizzie McGwire". It looks much closer to the midlife crisis than semester work. <br /> <br /> Producers had to owe a lot of favors because the age issue extends to most supporting characters. Taye Diggs, who plays the city sheriff, is younger than most students. <br /> <br /> The basic configuration is Hadley and two other rich girls (played by Dominque Swain-age 21 and Rachel True-age 35) are roommates in college. They share (as a student residence) a residence that is prettier and better furnished than a residence in the Real World - New Orleans (more plausible than in the case of a mommy playing football). Alicia moves into the mansion and begins to take over Hadley's life. At least in this way, Swain finally gets a roommate from his own generation, so they can have a lesbian scene. Supporting Swain's performance is the only advantage of "New Best Friend", and her love scene with Kirshner is fantastic, so cool and artistic that it does not fit into any of the other segments, maybe it was commissioned to a good director and cinematographer. <br /> <br /> Unintentional funny story is presented in a series of grim memories of crazy sex and uninterrupted events, each of which was preceded by a sleeping Alicia in the hospital bed. About half the time, Kirshner's screen spends lying dead with a snorkel in his mouth. Not a good career to move Mia. <br /> <br /> What more, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
