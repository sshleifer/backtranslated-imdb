Holiday history is a holiday classic and my favorite movie. So, of course, I was overjoyed when this movie appeared in 1994. I was rebellious and cheated. Anticipation, which rang in the Christmas tale, is strangely absent in this mess. The Red Ryder BB Gun is better than the Chinese top. And it is not very funny. Charles Grodin is good, but Buck Stops There. Bottom line: 1 star. Do not worry.
