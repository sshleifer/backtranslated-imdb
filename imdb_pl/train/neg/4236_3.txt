Well, if you like pop / punk, punk, ska and a bit of modern psycho billy, watching live shows is the only thing worth watching. This film has tons and tons of bands, along with the president of Troma, Lloyd Kaufman in the semi-important role and a multitude of silly death scenes. Sounds like it could be good, right? Well, death is still coming and many times to many different teams of the Warp Tour and fans at the party. Some of the deaths start with stylish ones, but then they are recycled over and over to such an extent that they are completely reproducible. Almost all die because of smashing the head or pulling the intestines out of the stomach. The blood looks as if it came from Andreas Schnaas "Zombie 90: Extreme Pestilence"; it's "diluted-blood", but now the movie is really decent and provides humor - something that this movie is terribly lacking. Sure, the film is the work of Doug Sakmann from Troma, has great low-cost potential and tries ... but it is too difficult. Everything is overly funny in this movie and it just lowers it. Everything is trying to be too comical and unwise, using deliberate malice, abuse of senseless deaths and doing the same ... still and ever. It's basically "Mulva: Zombie Ass-Kicker", "President of the Board" or any movie you've done with your friends: it's fun for those who created it and that's it. <br /> <br /> Great potential, great idea, great use of effects - but this is the same ... over and over again: the band plays, the band dies, the fans die. Everyone dies, blood is sprayed everywhere, the process repeats itself. <br /> <br /> The question is about these types of movies - basically it's a "bad slap-stick" - are they trying too hard or not at all?
