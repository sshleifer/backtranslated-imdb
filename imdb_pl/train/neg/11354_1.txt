I, too, experiencing hundreds of children's films in the past, I think this is one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 1) Nowadays I can not explain that my children Russia is not "bad guys". In addition, that mockery of Russian names such as "Poopchev" are inappropriate. <br /> <br /> 2) The birthday scene of the grandfather's fly contained a quasi-sexist joke, in which he suggested that men drink beer and women talk on the phone. Two other flies also unnecessarily use the word "shit" twice. <br /> <br /> 3) The whole film largely raises stereotypes and propaganda from the 1950s, which, as I thought, as a nation, were proud to have risen above. br /> <br /> All in all it's just primitive, badly animated, even more badly written and not worth losing time to watch.
