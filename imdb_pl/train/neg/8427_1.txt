Let me start with how much I love TV series. Despite the tragic nature of a middle-aged man who apparently was unable to pursue his dreams because of his overbearing, manipulative father, observing him in practice was incredibly light and fun. In my opinion, this is without a doubt one of the largest British TV series of all time. The TV series has my rating of 10 out of 10 without a reservation. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this movie is a real tragedy in every sense of the word. Almost no TV program essence has been successfully transferred to the movie. This film has a very grim, depressing tone that has almost brought me to tears on several occasions. Seeing how Harold gets beaten up in a pub (not in a comic way) is not my idea for comedy, but it's certainly one of the reasons why fans of the show will not like this movie. The film was painfully uncomfortable, except for the scene in which Albert bathes in the sink and is seen by his neighbor. <br /> <br /> The romance between Harold and Zita is completely devoid of sound and makes me wonder if the producers of this movie ever worried about watching the show. In the television series, Harold always followed the respectable girls, not the stripteaseers. <br /> <br /> Albert's reactions to comments made against him by Harold's girls were absolutely invaluable in the television series. In the film, Albert practically says nothing when such an opportunity increases. <br /> <br /> Most of the spin-off movies of British comedy series seem to be quite boring, with the notable exception of the ON THE BUSES films (which in some estimates were actually better than the TV series itself!). But STEPTOE and SON must be at the very bottom of the stack, even below GEORGEA and MILDRED. <br /> <br /> My advice - skip this one and see the second spin-off, STEPTOE AND SON RIDE AGAIN instead. It has a much lighter tone, is more faithful to the TV series and is very funny.
