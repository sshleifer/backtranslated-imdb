Do not waste time. This film transforms the worst Dracula by Bram Stoker (Van Helsing), Vampire Lestat Anne Rice (rock music and stupid biblical references) and Blade (high-tech toys). I really like vampiric movies and novels, and there are a lot of them. But not the smelly one. Even the soundtrack does not help, mainly because some say that the movie is about funny, scary classical music, not about a "metal asshole." I heard metal only a few times; they were mainly tortured violins. Avoid him like garlic and crucifixes.
