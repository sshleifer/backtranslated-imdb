Spike lee must be one of the most-rated directors I've ever seen. He is the critic's favorite because he supposedly makes films with a "message" or is so artistically oriented that he makes critics who are wet from Hollywood movies, eat their stuff just because they are different. <br /> <br /> Summer Of Sam does not even do it well. Oliver Stone is the photo and assembly style, as is the narrative. The plot is very similar to "Do Right Right". The portrait of "Guidos" or a set of PC-Italian Americans (of which I am one of them) comes from Raw Eddie Murphy. Only the impression of Eddie Murphy that the macho of Italy fights a much higher African American is much, much more credible than the cartoonish, broad Italian caricatures shown here (the figure of John Leguizamo is a possible exception). <br /> <br /> Is there anyone who saw this movie that could not figure out how it would end? As soon as Richie entered the movie, I saw a fist on his face and foot in my stomach, I saw him already accused of being a killer. This character had the greatest integrity in the whole movie, so obviously Lee will show what happens to the people who stand out in the crowd (what a white bearded clique!) <br /> <br /> Please, please give Spike Lee a lifetime pass for all basketball matches that he wants. Maybe he will be too entertained to take away the film camera for a long time and we will not have to be subjected to his important nonsense, and I will not have to see critics (some of them whose respect) ohhhh ahhhh to the emperor without clothing.
