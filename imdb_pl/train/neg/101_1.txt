Amateur, no budget videos can be surprisingly good ... but this is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Ah, another cruelty of Brad Sykes. Acting is hideous, except for Emma Smith, who promises. The direction of the camera requires a major modification. There are also no tricks "hold the camera and run"; it just does not work. Special effects are unimaginable, there is a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you want to tear your ear, do not let us see the real ear of the actor under the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (just like Mr. Sykes's other projects), and music is the crossroads of a cheap porn motel and really bad metal driven by a guitar (see commentary on the scenery). no real plot or character development? Apparently the screenwriter did not do it. <br /> <br /> Whoever finances this guy ... stop it. I have seen some of his other "home movies" (which I will not connect) and are equally bad. Usually the "director" will develop and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. One thing is being an amateur filmmaker, but everyone can be a hack. <br /> <br /> It's definitely not even a popcorn movie ... of course, chewing popcorn beans would be less painful than this effort. /> <br /> Reward: The worst military pump in the film in history.
