This version is quite bland, I'm afraid. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books and is from childhood, but the weary style of William Hurt's acting is totally inappropriate for Edward Rochester's bold passion, and poor Charlotte Gainsbrough looks like a bored, irritated teen who's hurting his teeth! I can not believe that they have eliminated Edward's great marriage scene from the end of the book, one of the most moving moments in literature. I appreciate that they finally used such a young, simple woman to play Jane, a character who is supposed to be the world's 18th, but if you want to see a version that is closer to the personalities and passions of the novel, see The version from the 70s with George C. Scott and Susannah York. York was too old, tall and pretty to play Jane, but no one touched Rochester in the way that Scott did.
