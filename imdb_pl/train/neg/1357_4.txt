* may contain something like a spoiler? * Just the memory of Crispin Glover is enough to send the maniac's pants in a handful. His groundbreaking performance in Back to the Future as George McFly sealed him forever in American conscience. He has recently been trying to return to the subconscious with Bartlebym and Willard. <br /> <br /> This time, however, Crispin made a 76-minute, cheap dada movie. Sometimes it reminded me of genius, while in general it almost offended me, but not because of its content. Content? What is this? is a movie in which, in the middle of the movie, all actors have Down's syndrome, which makes them feel weird. The other half of the movie is Crispin Glover, Adam Parfrey and a guy with cerebral palsy. All this influenced what John Waters tried to do with Desperate Living, and at the same time feel more successful and unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> Half with actors from Down's syndrome also has many snails killed. It's about a guy who has snails and ends up killing one. He is also tormented by a group of other people and a grasshopper. He falls in love with two girls, one of whom has sex at the cemetery. He also falls with a friend who teases him. <br /> <br /> In a strange, semi-interior set, Crispin Glover is the director of this program. He's sort of a guy's mind control, and a cerebral guy with paralysis is something of a sexuality. Well, at least he masturbates in clear scenes. There is another "shocking" humorous idea, like the Nazi Swaztikas crossed with Shirley Temple, and the minstrels in the black face say it is Michael Jackson. <br /> <br /> In the outside world, the tormentor still has to do with his love of killing snails and beating by other people. They beat him with stones and so on. Then they beat the minstrel after putting it to the test. <br /> <br /> Returning to the interior, Crispin Glover is still the ruler of his set and tries to control everyone, but unfortunately pitifully. <br /> <br /> What's this? it has less sense than Dr. Caligari and has more than a stolen style. The claustrophobic mental space is very similar to the way the sets without the wall of Dr. Caligari felt claustrophobic. They also had a dialogue that was absolute nonsense. And all this was full of absurd images for humor. <br /> <br /> The problem is that about 20 minutes of the movie ... maybe a little more ... What is it? there will be no photos. For the next 56 minutes, we take part in the same sets of images, introducing only new images in the form of an absurd puppet show. The film seems to be little more than a movie that tries to push the envelope offensive and taboo. He tries to mock and confuse the audience. But the problem is that he has enough different photos for a 40-minute movie. <br /> <br /> Even worse, cinematography, set design and everything else was very cheap and almost unplanned. It seemed that "OK, in this way we can do it and get out of the way". It was not interesting and it was quite ... boring. On the other hand, Dr. Caligari had amazing photos and framing. The difference between them is amazing. <br /> <br /> rating: C
