Okay, if you have a few hours to lose, or if you really hate your life, I'd say I'm watching this movie. If anything is good for a few laughs. Not only do you have obese, topless natives, but also special effects so bad that they are probably banned in most states. Seriuosly, rating "PG" is also quite humorous when you see Native Porn Extravaganza. I would not give this movie to my late nephew. This can not even be demonstrated to Iraqi prisoners without violating the Geneva Convention. The plot is sketchy, banal, stupid and stupid. Acting is horrible, and the ending is so painful that I watch as I started pouring salt into the eye to tear myself away from the idiocy that fills the TV screen.
