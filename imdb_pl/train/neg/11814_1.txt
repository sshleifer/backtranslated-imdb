I remembered once that I saw silly Nintendo Power comics that had the same graphics as the series ... and then came the word that this series was coming near me! I was not aesthetic, but interesting ... I was curious how bad this series will be. All my friends said that this concert had no real meanings and was too stupid for people like me to enjoy it (I'm really gay), so I decided to watch the program with low expectations. <br /> <br /> WHAT EXTREMELY EXPERIENCE !!!!!!!!!!! First of all, I hate new characters. Tiff and Tuff are so stupid and I hate how many fanboys drool over Tiff, it's sad. I also hate how they made Chef Kalasaki (or any indefinite title) a good guy who owned a restaurant. Bad traffic, 4Kids TV! Escargoon is nothing but a lost adviser to King Dedede (who sucks in this series) and I hate the face of this one company that supplies Dedede with these terrible weapons to destroy Kirby. So stupid, I hate this show. <br /> <br /> Then I started to hate Kirby even more, because it was obvious that Nintendo just hurt to make Kirby popular. Kirby will never beat Mario in the fight for cold, and Kirby will always be nothing but a tiny cream gay. NUF SAID !!!
