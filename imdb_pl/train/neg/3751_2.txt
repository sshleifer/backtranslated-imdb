I'm a big fan of David Lynch. This film, however, was quite a disappointing experience. In addition to ambient background music? what really determines the mood of the movie? he lacks almost all the features that I associated with Lynch's work. Visualizations are boring, to put it lightly, and dialogue is unclear and monotonous to arouse any interest. <br /> <br /> It gives the impression that film students are awkwardly trying to make a film with the dogma of an experienced director. I saw many amateur films with a much better camera, scenery, sound and script. This film lacks almost all artistic features. I feel as if I was watching one of Davids' home movies, produced during a weekend trip with friends.
