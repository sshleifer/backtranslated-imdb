A long time ago, some bad people made a movie about a guy who was shot in space, apparently Saturn, but actually only to some footage of the solar flares, and then gets a nosebleed, and before you know it, he goes to the hospital bandaged on his head, and then comes an overweight nurse with a badly fitted uniform and is eaten by a guy who probably melts everywhere, but never loses weight, then NASA or at least one guy from NASA, gets upset and calls on another guy, to hunt him down, but the guy they sent to hunt a drowning man must first go home and eat soup, and his oddly shaped wife has forgotten crackers, so he can not have crackers, then he has to go out and look for a drowning man with a meter Geiger, and it really does not work, so it really just follows the trail of half-eaten corpses, and then it's something in the sheriff and two ugly old people in a lemon grove, women with a meat cleaver, some sort of industrial plant with trigger guards, and since I can not tell you how the movies end, I can only say that Jonathan Demme is out there with some guy with a stupid name, Burr DeBenning, and if there's any justice in the world, everyone involved in this movie has died a hideous, violent death and could not make more movies, and the world lived HAPPY EVER - END!
