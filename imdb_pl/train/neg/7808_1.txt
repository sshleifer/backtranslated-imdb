I'm a huge fan of Michael Madsen, so I do not have to add that I bought this movie, not even renting it or anything ... This movie was so horrible, I did not even take it back to the store, I would not want to surrender to this human poison, I just threw it in the trash, no matter the money, it was worth paying to throw it away. Acting was not so bad, it was not good or nothing. History was terrible, and ending was something I despise. He was a broken man, an alcoholic. his life was a pile of garbage. I thought that his horse, peanuts, a horrible device to show his childish innocence, the dog would be much better. I also hate religion, so this ending has undoubtedly made me angry. Jesus heals everyone ... I hate that I know people like those who are great Christians and Catholics, and time will show that God does not heal everyone or anything. It was a horrible movie, if you have the opportunity to see it, pass it or even better to buy it, rent it, put it in the trash and leave the coffee grounds on it in the morning
