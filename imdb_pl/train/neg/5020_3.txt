This is the most confused entry on IMDb, which I have not encountered yet. All previous reviewers behave as if it was a movie. This is not a movie. It is rather a description that is an addition to the DVD of the movie "The One". There are no 90 minutes anywhere nearby that are listed here as. In fact, it's only 13 minutes, how cool Jet Li can do martial arts. and his reflections on the film. So this IMDb entry is a little fubar. Do not listen to any of the other reviews because they are all wrong. You can trust me because I never feed you, dear reader, BS. <br /> <br /> and this is the truth. I think you can say that I am the "only" reviewer who matters.
