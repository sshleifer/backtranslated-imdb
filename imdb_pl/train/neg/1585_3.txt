::: SPOILER ALERT ::: <br /> <br /> Soooo, Arnie is a really good guy, but after an incident with a few fights in the helicopter and some disobedience of orders, he is sent to prison (or rather, a labor camp). He escapes, but after a while he is caught again. This time it ends in a bizarre reality show in which to run for a while with a bunch of hard guys with different motives and eventually die. But we all know Arnie and we all know that he is more difficult than even the toughest tough guys. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this movie, being a fan of Arnie and everything. However, "The Running Man" contains too many flaws that really annoy me. E.g. Reconstruction of Arnie's fight inside the helicopter, where the shocked audience shows a short summary of the incident, along with 5-10 different camera angles. This means that the military helicopter in which Arnie flew was equipped with almost 10 cameras filming crew members, one of which is the eye of one of the Arnie crew members beats. <br /> <br /> There are other disadvantages, and the plot, which theoretically seems to be very interesting and innovative, works for some time, and then creates a pool of stupidity and unrealism in which it drowns. <br /> <br /> Acting really can not be said to be better than the pair, with Arnie in the lead role, performing the average performance of Arnie. The rest of the cast can handle without being particularly good or bad. <br /> <br /> The special effects are fine, without being impressive. <br /> <br /> EVALUATION: 3/10
