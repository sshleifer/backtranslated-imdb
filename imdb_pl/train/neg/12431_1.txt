I would like to say that curiosity has given me everything. If only I saw the trailer, I would be able to tell the whole story of the film; I could save myself the most aimless hours and forty minutes in my entire life and about twenty dollars. This movie was a disaster that could happen and is a shame for Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The film shows a lively lack of knowledge about reality. For example, the child's pilot car drives around the neighborhood and even enters this house. It's even covered with clothes. Is it not rational to think that the pilot can no longer send a signal in such circumstances? Hollywood of course did not believe that. Common logic and every electronics concept dictates the opposite; I doubt if the race car could even reach the street, let alone the house across the street. Another unrealistic feature is the lack of intelligence that criminals have. Why are criminals rocket scientists in all these films until they meet an eight-year-old? The kid is supposed to be the most intelligent person in the movie instead of professional terrorists? Please, there is more reality in the Matrix. The leader puts down his real gun and "accidentally" lifts the plastic pistol; apparently he could not distinguish. Even with the glove put on it should be possible. Just because they look the same does not mean anything; there are other senses than sight. Traps are also unrealistic; if any of them actually worked, the criminals would be dead. But Hollywood is going to "laugh" with us for "funny" trap results. I did not laugh; I sighed and rolled my eyes. <br /> <br /> But I recommend this movie to anyone who thinks that he has seen a really bad movie; the movie they saw will look like Citizen Kane compared to that. Otherwise, skip this one because of your pride. Home Alone 3 also raises a question. We all know Alex D. Linz from the movie stars, but did he write it too?
