SciFi has recently been very unlucky when creating high quality movies (such as Minotaur or Dog Soldiers). Grendel is supposed to be based on Beowulf's great epic, but he's so far away (and offers so little in comparison) that TV commercials could just as well be titled "some Christopher Lambert shit movie". I did not expect it to be as accurate as full-fledged Hollywood production, but I was expecting that "artistic integrity" will not interfere with real history (even if it changed a little, to tell two hours nicely) in designated time intervals). <br /> <br /> Did the director and producers have some idea of ​​what they are doing (was there any research?). Of course not, as you could learn from the massive horned helmets that Beowulf and his crew wear (except for the boy dye). One of the main problems I had was the appearance of Grendel himself: if Beowulf is to contend with him, should he not have sixteen feet of growth and weigh 2 tons? Grendel's death segment was also not in every respect ?? in my opinion, the one in the epic was actually better than the invented trash from the script; for example: Grendel should get his hand out of the nest by Beowulf? he does not cut himself on the forearm after he was set on fire by an exploding arrow from a crossbow that looks like it weighs 300 pounds! And Grendel's mother just connected her with the dragon at the end of the epic, where she eventually dies when she succumbs to his wounds? And honestly, what the hell was this cefala? <br /> <br /> If you want to see this movie because it's connected to the epic ?? .no, it really is not like that (except for character names). The only way I could recommend this movie was if you liked Druidzi (directed by Jacques Dorfmann)? although I do not recommend watching too.
