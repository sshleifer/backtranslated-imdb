PLEASE READ ME TO READ MY FULL REVIEW. I DO NOT COMPLY WITH A FILM - ONLY AVAILABLE DVD VERSIONS. <br /> <br /> *** <br /> <br /> I really wanted to give this film up to two stars. I mean, how can it be only 1 in 10!?! and an extremely loyal, stage adaptation of the novel would be difficult, but it is worth living for seven hours - if that's what you've seen. <br /> <br /> The problem is that you can not see the movie - anywhere, as far as I know. <br /> <br /> I am trying to watch the RusCiCo DVD version - widely regarded as the best available version, because it is in a box and brings back scenes cut from other DVD releases. <br /> <br /> But this is one of the worst film prints I've ever seen on DVD. The picture is muddy and incoherent, often stroboscopic. It is almost unbearable if you turn up your brightness, color and image level to the maximum .... but the problem is not over. <br /> <br /> The sound is also incoherent, loud in part, practically inaudible in others. <br /> <br /> And when it comes to languages, this is a HUGE problem for English speakers - the dubbing option has a few good actors and some really awful, which performance screens and film fragments are simply not dubbed, jumping in from back to Russian and even French at random. <br /> <br /> The option of subtitles is not much better. Subtitles do not appear under the image, but just above it - covering some of the beauty (or what's left of it) in the scenery. What's more, the subtitles are often a poor translation (it's a pity that the script has taken the trouble to get closer to Tolstoy's real words), and the subtitles just seem to be falling apart. <br /> <br /> So, even if you maximize the color, brightness and image settings, and increase the volume, and choose subtitles with * and * English subtitles, you'll still have a movie that is annoying to watch and listen. <br /> <br /> Can he beat it? It could be possible, but about seven hours - who can stay that long? <br /> <br /> Maybe someday someone will come and bring it back - or maybe then I will see a masterpiece - but for now I just can not give more than one star ago, which I could only look at while watching the first 12%.
