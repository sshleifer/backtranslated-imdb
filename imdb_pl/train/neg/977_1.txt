"Fever Pitch" is not a bad movie; it's a scary movie. <br /> <br /> Is it possible that the audiences and critics of American cinema are so anesthetized and lobotomized by excrement that Hollywood awakens that they praise the heavens even an average movie with barely laughter? That's the only reason I can imagine why this terrible romantic comedy (and I use it loosely because it's not fun in this movie) makes good reviews. <br /> <br /> I was stunned in this movie that screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel would even think for a moment that their script was fun. <br /> <br /> The brilliant Nick Hornby usually translates well into a movie. He adapted "Fever Pitch" for a British film with Colin Firth and Ruth Gemmell in 1997; Peter Hedges found Hornby's voice for "About a Boy" (2002) and when "High Fidelity" was Americanized for the movie in 2000, the writers of D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, John Cusack and Scott Rosenberg did not go wrong because they kept the essence of Hornby's humor and humor. They made one of the best movies of the year. <br /> <br /> So why is the American version of "Fever Pitch" so difficult? The British version was not a masterpiece, but it was adorable, funny, unexpected and gave us two characters that we could like, respect and understand. <br /> <br /> But Ganz and Mandel removed everything funny at Hornby's work. In Americanizing, the stories massacred her, removing everything that was good and unique in Hornby's work and replacing it with a traditional drivel. <br /> <br /> They transformed a funny story into a formal romantic comedy, never once turned from a miserable formula. Lindsey (Drew Barrymore) has three girls, each of whom has a separate function. One is overweight, the other is cynical and ambitious, and the third is romantic. Do you want to guess how many male friends Ben has (Jimmy Fallon)? <br /> <br /> What made High Fidelity so much fun was not just a good man and lady, but also involved supporting characters. In this "Fever Pitch" six supporting friends do or does not say anything particularly entertaining. They are so insignificant that they are not even decorative. The only reason they are in the movie is that the formula requires it. Poor Ione Skye becomes one of Lindsey's pals in the ungrateful role. Adorable Skye had to regret that Lloyd Dobler would not fall and take her. Think about it, Cusack would make perfect Ben. Of course, Cusack is too smart to get attached to such a arduous scenario. <br /> <br /> There is not one lonely moment in this movie that seems original or unforced. Each subsequent plot is predictable, every lame telegram. Ganz and Mandel are working for laughter. The first 45 minutes are so terribly slow that you are wondering if these guests have understood that they are writing a comedy. You can mark the story in this movie by the watch. It's almost as if Ganz and Mandel wrote it with some form of writing guru on the screen glued to the wall. When they reached a specific page, they looked at the formula and said, "OK, guru says it has to happen now." And, presto! <br /> <br /> Directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly do not help the movie. They have no idea how to introduce their story and characters (they convey V.O. narrative not to the hero, but to another guy who is sitting behind Ben in Fenway Park). We need to watch Barrymore and Fallon stumble over their unpleasant initial encounters with an unearthly writing. <br /> <br /> Barrymore makes sweet and charming better than most. He's as good as Goldie Hawn in his heyday. But even her charm can not save this extremely horrible movie. He's trying to get some energy and humor out of this story. About 30 minutes after the film Lindsey tells Ben: "You're funny." The only explanation for her attention is that it was in the scenario. For Fallon, Ben never says anything funny. Fallon is neither witty nor amusing; when he makes a comedy, he stops. <br /> <br /> Fallon has never been good at "Saturday Night Live". He was probably the least funny person in this concert. Do you remember that bad sketch about a radio DJ who made all the voices? The only reason the "Weekend Update" worked from time to time was that Fallon's cohort, Tina Fey, knows something about comedy. <br /> <br /> Actors who think they are funny and behave so rarely, if at all, actually fun. That's true about Fallon. He thinks he is hysterically funny when he barely raises giggles. His stuttering, uncertain himself, did not work on the small screen; on the big screen it is lighter. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Fallon his role in this photo also requires some dramatic moments. If you thought his comedy was bad, wait until you get a lot of your dramatic stuff. Especially two scenes - the first in the park, the second in front of Ben's school - are painful. Scenes require an actor with bizarre dramatic abilities, but Fallon has neither the knowledge nor the ability to run them. His range of emotions does not even run on a scale from A to B. <br /> <br /> Ben has no personality or depth. He often appears as a fool. And not so nice. It annoys the mind, which Lindsey finds attractive to him. Compare Fallon's performance with Firth in the British version, and you'll understand how terribly flat, unfunctional and forced Ben Fallon is and how wrong he was in this role. Watching Fallon in "Fever Pitch" makes the dramatic depth and comic nuance of Ashton Kutcher! <br /> <br /> Like "High Fidelity", the Americanized "Fever Pitch" could work great. He just needed better writers, more competent directors and a definitely stronger, funnier and smarter leader. Do yourself a great favor: avoid this rotten movie; instead, borrow the British version from 1997 and read Hornby's book.
