"Porky's Poor Fish" by Bob Clampett is a cartoon with scary puns and one or two nice moments. Placed in the Porky's fish store, "Porky's Poor Fish" occupies an uncomfortable space between the standard black "n" white Porky and one of Melord Merrie's popular at that time. Usually from many early Porky's cartoons, Porky is far from the star, appearing only in a fairly stiff, opening musical number and climax of the film. For the rest of the time, the star is a skinny cat who sees a fish shop as an opportunity for a free meal, but gets more than he expected. Unfortunately, the audience gets a lot less than they expected. As was the case with a series of books coming to life, the reflector throws itself on shock signs that could work equally well in an un-animated medium. Laughter is rare, and although the cartoon is saved by the energetic direction of Clampett, you can not even recommend "Porky's Poor Fish" to any of Porky's early cartoon characters.
