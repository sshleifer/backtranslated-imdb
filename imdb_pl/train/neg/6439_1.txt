Honestly, it's easily in the top five of the worst movies I've ever seen. In part, because they are treated so seriously, in contrast to ordinary, light laughter, these films want you to be emotionally involved, feel with the heroes and take care of the alleged conspiracy. None of these events even approach the event. <br /> <br /> **** MILD SPOILERS ****** <br /> <br /> There are three main reasons why this movie is so terrible: 1.) Inconsistent and completely nonsensical plot. 2.) Annoying "MTV" camera. 3.) Moronic figures and role-playing holes. <br /> <br /> Let me expand. <br /> <br /> 1.) Apparently, when these films were made, they could not decide whether to make a film about church plotting, stigmata or possession. Guess what? They connected them! Aetyczek is possessed by a dead person who makes her stigmata to reveal a church conspiracy. As an ordinary person is able to transcend death and possess another human being through his rosary, he is never explained or even talked about. Now, instead of just saying what she wants to say, she gives her the Stigmata. WHY? Why do not you spit it out? Instead, we treat scenes that scream in sharp voices, sculpt the mysterious messages on cars and write messages on the walls. Apparently this priest was also a brutal guy, because a possessed young lady also perceives one of the characters, talking in that crumpled, rough, "possessed" voice that we've all heard countless times. It also begins to be connected to my second charge, because when a young lady gets stigmata, she also opposes the laws of gravity, hovering in the air and throwing everything and everyone around us as if they were in an earthquake? Why is this happening? Who knows!?! My guess is that the director thought it was "cool." <br /> <br /> 2.) This movie contains dozens of pictures, of course in slow motion, birds appearing out of nowhere and departing, and the most annoying is the dripping of water. The flat of this woman is still dripping with water! CONSTANTLY! Logically, this place would probably break up with many holes. To sum up this complaint, at the end and for no reason, the camera cuts water drops in slow motion in reverse order !! WHY!?! I have no idea! It does not matter to anything and once again I bet it's because the director thought it looked "cool." <br /> <br /> 3.) One of the main characters says that he became a priest to explain the holes in science. It does not make sense to me. I think it is enough to go to church, but no, he must go through the whole rigamarole to become a priest. I just do not buy it. Secondly, there are many role-playing holes, some of which I will discuss below. For starters, when he first gets stigmata, the scene ends when he lies unconscious, bleeds. Then he is in the hospital. Who called the ambulance? Another one is at the end, when the aforementioned figure of a "scientific priest" talks to a ghost who has a girlfriend. He says, "Take me as your messenger!" Not a quote from the word, but you have an idea. His answer? "You have no faith, only doubts!" ​​Because of this, he has an aetheist! Aeteist has no faith, much less than any scientific priest! And then there is the fact that the subject of the conspiracy of this film, this lost gospel (according to Saint Thomas) is available in local bookstores. The heroes are ready to kill to suppress this document, but you can go to the bookstore and buy. This may be the case in alternative history, where it is not widely known, but the film never tries to tell us, or even suggest that it is an alternative event to discover this document. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie is terrific in a spectacular way. This is my high priestess who I feel the need to insult every possible opportunity. I hate this. Final rating: F
