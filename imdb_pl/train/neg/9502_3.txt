This movie was bizarre, totally inexplicable and hysterical when seen with friends while drinking in a large empty house. I really love opening things with Lisa wandering around in a beautiful city. I want to be a beautiful stranger lost in some exotic European place, maybe not in a low budget. I definitely end up where there are strangely non-sexual erotic scenes that have been cut (and so in my DVD copy). Do not try to understand it, just go and watch out for strange pieces ... that are everything. Do not watch this if you want to make a plot or characteristic or whatever makes sense. Pretty beautiful, though you can just give it up and decide to watch a real horror movie, like Dead Alive.
