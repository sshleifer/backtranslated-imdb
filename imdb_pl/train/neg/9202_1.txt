I am the owner of this movie. Not by choice. I was really bored and the box intrigued me. So I threw it in the old VCR and spent the next one and a half hours of my life shouting "Why God why?". The story was not so bad, as a player I could appreciate its fragments. I think if you're in romantic scenes with a very geekowatym cheese, you'll like this movie. "I always thought of myself as a Vulcan that you know, like Dr.Spock ... unable to love." There are few good things to say about this film. But if you have a really bad movie, this one is for you !!! The real story is much more interesting;) <br /> <br /> If I had to summarize this movie in one word, it would be: <br /> <br /> LAME
