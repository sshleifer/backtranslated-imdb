What a disappointment, especially in light of the shared budget, available technical resources and accumulated talents. It is not a basic principle for science fiction / drama to create an audience willing to suspend disbelief. POA 2001 creates a credible beginning, pulling us in, but later Burton forgets that his viewers have working brains. Helena Bonham Carter's highest libertarian chimpanzee, the worthlessness of the coup, the ease of their escape, the extraordinary riding skills (astronaut and a group of human primitives suddenly crossing the full tilt), massive immediate human rebellion is too incredible. Mark Wahlberg never plans any sense of real fear, danger or appearance in this upside-down world. Compare with the original, in which the nudity of Chuck Heston metaphorically captured his total helplessness and astonishment at the turn of events. The uniformed Wahlberg retains its modesty, but also the apparent sense of management and control in the nature of a crazy situation and we never really think about its good. Unlike Heston, it seems that he is never at risk. Tim Burton should have used part of f / x budget for some competent scenarios. In fact, after this worse fiasco, I wonder why the Hollywood producers have ever bother to satisfy the strikes of writers and directors. Let them go. Trained monkeys could do as well as in Planet of the Apes 2001. I bet repetition of this effort will be non-existent. It could have been a new series and a great new step in the imagination. She lost another opportunity.
