Quite a standard thing from the movie B. Seriously, anyone who watches "Dragon Fighter" with Dean Cain and a group of people making their first movie should know better than expect true quality, or even moderate intelligence. B movies exist for popular formulas. If you give them even an analysis of chips, you'll end up ruining the movie for yourself (and maybe write an important, defamatory review on IMDb). <br /> <br /> I liked the female leader Kristine Byers. She was charismatic, and I thought she was particularly attractive. It was an unforgettable look of the film B. Unfortunately, I can not see where she made the films. I'll look at her again.
