The premise of this movie was revealed in the DVD box. A textile worker develops a wonderful fabric that does not degrade. But the movie can not do it. Instead, it takes 45 minutes, bypassing the preamble, before making a great discovery. Since viewers do not get much benefit from watching a weird kid, it's a weird choice: the film has failed to engage any topic. After the discovery of the material, the film quickly sets out that both industry and collaborators want the invention to be blocked, leaving the film with only two weak moves; coming up with chemicals and running away from the oppressors. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why anyone would describe it as a comedy. The tone is not funny or comical. This is a more serious social criticism of the day: capitalism distorts supply chains and production. Which, in turn, makes it impossible to reach innovation and improve the world. Yes, it's probably true, but without some fun with attitude towards this movie, the movie is just a serious argument. You will need an extremely broad definition of comedy to find something like this here. <br /> <br /> It's more like the British Meet John Doe (Meet Nigel Doe?).
