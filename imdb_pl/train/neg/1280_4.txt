When I saw the name of this movie, I always thought it was a musical. Like "Harvey Girls." This is not. It is a pudding that has overcooked, hit the ceiling in the kitchen and was broken and paved. No music, not period works, but completely unbelievable. <br /> <br /> It starts with the patriarch James Woods, telling the eldest of his three daughters, a small child who grows up to the role of Barbara Stanwyck, that he must keep his name and home. <br /> <br /> So we think it will be a historical intergenerational story. And this is for a short time. Then he becomes a story of Stanwycek's merciless battle with lawyer George Brent. Why is she so dead against him? Why else? When we learn in the strange sequence of retrospection told by Stanwyck, she once thought that she could inherit some money (of course for the sisters and for myself) through marriage. She hit someone she thought was a village rocker who was actually a budding Brent lawyer. <br /> <br /> That no one would think about the child they had, a young man aged eight in the main story, is ... you know ... They had a hurried marriage and were conceived in a very short time. <br /> <br /> One of her sisters fell in love with a painter named Gig Young, who plays Gig Gigant. The other sister is trying to take him. Etc., Etc. <br /> <br /> This is a terrifying, unrestrained mess - well-preserved, but without a bit of logic and credibility.
