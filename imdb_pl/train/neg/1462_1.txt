This may be the worst movie I've ever seen. Despite what Mikshelt claims, this film is not even close to historical accuracy. It starts badly, and then everything from the hill. We have Hitler's father cursing his own bad luck with the "fact" that he married his niece! In fact, they were second cousins. Hitler's mother, Klara, called her father, Alois, "uncle," because Alois was adopted and brought up by Klara's grandfather and brought up as his son when he was his nephew. Alois was much older than Klara, so as a child she got into the habit of calling Alois, "uncle." <br /> <br /> A scene in trenches in which Hitler is ridiculed by other soldiers and decides to take him off his dog is simply a disgrace and insult to the intelligence of all viewers. We see Hitler chasing a dog through a pit when he catches up with a poor man who casts him for disobedience. In the distance, we see and hear how his fellow soldiers are still mocking and stubbing a cowardly little man, but then the shell lands directly on his persecutors, and every last one, as we were told, is killed directly. So, if Hitler was the only person who survived the scene, was this tale of brutality and cowardice told? Did Hitler himself "boast" about this? - I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Then Hitler persecutes and intimidates the poor, stressed and weary Jewish officer who gave him the Iron Cross! I can only assume that this Jewish officer was a pawnshop before the fight for the Homeland, and he thoughtfully brought some medals from his shop because I am sure the Iron Crosses were not given away, as the comical farce shows. <br /> <br /> All grotesque stereotypes are here, not only the calming and hypnotic effect of Wagner's music on a small man. If only the producers kept Ian Kershaw on the side. Then they would discover that the "happy widow" by Franz Lehar is more likely to carry the FÃ¼hrer's boat than any "Flying Dutchman" from Richard Wagner's cannon! <br /> <br /> Hitler could have been responsible for the death of 60 million people, but how can he be forgiven for his terrifying taste in music? <br /> <br /> I could continue, but I would be in it for hours. <br /> <br /> Give him a miss.
