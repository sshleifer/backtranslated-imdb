I think this movie is based on some real story ... It's about two young girls who molest an adult man for 48 hours; I do not see where the terror comes in ... There are some "strange" and "surreal" sequences in the movie. And two girls (Sandra Locke and ... ah ... well) play the role of two psycho-maniacs ... they do quite a good job (although some of them are just a bit of an advantage). The film is not good and it is not terrible, it is simply really outdated! I mean, this thing is dripping from the 70s ... It's not so bad if you like that kind of thing ... you know ... that's what?
