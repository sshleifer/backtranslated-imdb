I grew up with Scooby doo all my life, my daddy grew up with a scooby doo. We just watched the first episode of the parody, which is called Shaggy, and Scooby got a clue. What a planet is Warner Bros, letting it blow away the air. Characters could be better drawn by my younger sister. The story could be better written by my 3 year old twins (who are also Scooby Doo fans). Scooby and Shaggy simply are not !!!!! if anyone except Casey Kasem makes Shaggy's voice, it just will not work !!!! trust me. <br /> <br /> This program was disgraceful. What's new Scooby Doo is much better. Why change the winning format. Put down this piece of rubbish and return to the real Scooby
