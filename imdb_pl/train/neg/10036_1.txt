I do not understand what the directors think when they make a movie ... I had a trauma after seeing Welcome (2007) and I thought they would not do it again. But after many amazing promotions, Tashan finally ended up with a heart attack. <br /> <br /> So amazing 3 songs in the promotion - Dil Haara, Chhaliya and Tashan Mein ..... and what did you get in the movie? Zero history, predictable plot, lots of acrobatics by Akshay Kumar and nothing interesting except watching Kareena after her serious weight loss ... !!! <br /> <br /> Musically another serious catastrophe ... in the music album, they spent some time on pathetic little dialogues with these four jokers and did not think about giving background to the scenes when Akshay Kumar doing acrobatics ... ! this song is so nice, quite comparable to Tashan Mein and was not taken in the music album !!! :-( If you plan to watch this movie, I would say, watch it to listen to this song in the background that sounds like ... "Bachchan Bachchan Pandey ..." <br /> <br /> Generally very disappointed with the way Bhaiyyaji tried to try to speak bad English! <br /> <br /> Go away, man, I have to vomit!
