I am here again at your local mall (of course, because that's where the high school students spend their time !!!!!) to show how terrible really is "BENDY POO: PROM COURIER" !!!!! To prove how bad this DCOM joke is ... <br /> <br /> ... we'll take these four sumo wrestlers and put them in this photo booth. How ... cozy !!!!! <br /> <br /> Hai! Huuuuuuuarrrrghhhhhh !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Uh !!!!! <br /> <br /> How awful is it ????? It's so bad, the Disney Channel is paying off its money once again, with these exciting but defining 10-second promotions, keeping viewers wondering "WHEN IS IT WORKING ?????" And then, suddenly, when it happens happens, first, not only got a higher TV rating than usual, but it was only visible once !!!!! Oh no!!!!! Once everyone !!!!! Plus, this movie is about high school and other things, and believe me, I will not go on with what's there ..... <br /> <br /> Say bh ... smile !!!! ! (SNAP!) <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs. 0/10
