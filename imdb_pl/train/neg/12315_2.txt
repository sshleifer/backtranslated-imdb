OK, I'm not an American, but in my humble Scottish opinion Steve Martin is not, he has never been, and he will never be a funny man, as long as our backs are facing south. Phil Silvers as Sergeant Bilko was a funny man, no doubt thanks to the skilled writers and directors and all the other talented team protagonists of the series, who contributed perfectly to one of the funniest and uncompromising reality comedies ever produced by America. How anyone could have the audacity to even try to repeat the character of Phil Silvers is beyond me. To reconcile matters, the exercise was repeated in Martin's distasteful attempt to become the inspector of Peter Seller's Clouseau, another failed attempt, in my opinion, to revive a clearly unpalatable career. Some of your authors claim that "Steve Martin puts his own mark on the character", which I would say "balderdash", his portraits will be long forgotten, when those from Silvers and Sellars will be valued for future generations
