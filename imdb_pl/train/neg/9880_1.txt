I saw the film back in the first cinema release, in a just empty theater. Believe it or not, but after decades of watching movies, it still remains in my mind as the worst movie of all time; or at least the worst that I would allow. <br /> <br /> Acting is far below the standard set by any random group of drunk high school students, broken off the street and forced to study 5 minutes or less. <br /> <br /> After the first shock of disbelief, we laughed a moment, because every scene hit new falls. But even this dubious pleasure disappeared and it just had to be really sad.
