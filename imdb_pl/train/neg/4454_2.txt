First, some background; I am English and I lived in London all my life. I've been to many games in The Den and most other London clubs. I know the type of person who gets into hooliganism and I know how they behave and how they say. I have to say it's a bad, bad movie. I can say that Green Street is one of the most unrealistic movies I've ever seen. I spent most of the movie with embarrassment. I felt that I should write a mini review because I felt I needed to point out a few things. <br /> <br /> a) People just do not talk in London in real life; film makers have taken too much care of the whole slang and made it sound stupid. Unfortunately, there are types of hooligans, but the ones you see on Green Street are more parodies. b) The actor who plays Pete Dunham (Charlie Hunnam), unfortunately sounded as "English" or "Cockney" as Osama Bin Laden. He's from Newcastle in the north and I'm just amazed that the other actors were able to keep in touch with him - how to take him seriously. Why did not they just get someone from East London to play in that role? I could make a "bang" myself. c) Mr. Frodo. I mean, how can I expect that I will take Elijah Wood seriously by kicking people twice as big and really nasty hooligans. He would be dead. Simple. To be honest (as a British) it was hard to watch this movie. I am sure that this film will bomb here in Great Britain. In states it can be a little better, because Americans just do not know (or do not care) about how inaccurate it is. <br /> <br /> Please, my American and foreign friends, do not believe a word about this nonsense. Yes, these companies exist, but everything is very underground and quiet, and on a much smaller scale. The film only gets 2 from me because they actually filmed some of them in London. They usually try to film these things in Cardiff (Wales) or something like that and expect that we will not all notice.
