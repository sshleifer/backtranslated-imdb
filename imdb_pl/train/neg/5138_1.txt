I watched SCARECROWS because of the buzzing around him. Well, I can not imagine anyone would like this movie because it's just bad, bad, bad. <br /> <br /> It's obvious that whoever did this movie does not know anything about the horror movie. The whole story is a failed marriage of two genres: the action film (rifles and criminals) and horror (living scarecrows). When criminals are killed one after the other by scary scarecrows, both species automatically cancel each other because, first of all, they are criminals and who criminals care about, and secondly because they are stupid criminals to run! After scarecrows, it does not work after them. Where is the horror? I wanted the criminals to die a terrible, painful death. <br /> <br /> But the story is so badly constructed that it is a marriage of species that could be original, if it works well, NEVER gels. There's just a bunch of super-dense criminals and lots of scarecrows that are "alive" no matter what the filmmakers thought. Even worse is that cinematography is terrible (as in television) and, what's worse, all the packages of dialogue are told in CB, and we still hear an inaudible dialogue about disconnected images, as if we were watching some kind of radio broadcast. This part was really BAD. The director should be shot on the spot for inventing such a stupid idea! I can not tell you how annoying it was. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned before, criminals in SCARECROWS are incredibly stupid. For example, when someone suddenly appears, eviscerated and filled with money and straw (yes, straw) in his huge open wound, others ask: "What is the medicine?". after they shot bullets in him, unable to kill him (he was "zombiefiedowany" by scarecrows, do not ask ...). Get a crazy clue, a moron. I've never seen such stupid people in the movie. And then there is a girl. I regretted that one of the scarecrows did not kill her quickly because it hurt her butt. When she discovers that her father was nailed to the "cross" scarecrow, in reality he blames the criminals for a shameful scene (bad acting), though criminals could not do that. How stupid she was! But scarecrows are the biggest weakness of this very poor movement. They are not scary. Nothing is explained about them. It's just a story device in this film filled with movie. <br /> <br /> Mr. Wesley, filming the scarecrow face for 30 seconds continuously, does not evoke anything but boredom. And this scene with a talking head in the fridge. Thanks for the laugh. <br /> <br /> All in all, it must have been one of the worst movies I've seen lately (and I've seen a lot of movies these days!) Between equally pathetic SILO KILLER or SCARECROWS, I'd rather watch SILO KILLER again. Yes, SCARECROWS is so bad.
