Loony Tunes dared (at least) twice in the future. The first time was with a brilliantly fun "Duck Dodgers". Was the last time with this? my husband effort. "Loonatics Unleashed" is not worthless and can be considered a good product if it were not for not matching the quality of Warner Brothers. WB cartoons are known for their cheeky humor, at least as attractive for adults as for children. On the other hand, these episodes of walking superheroes can not fail to convince adults to pass them on. <br /> <br /> The assumption of the series is 6 ordinary people (2 rabbits, Tasmanian devil, duck roadrunner and coyote) live on the "urban planet" Acmetropolis and acquire super powers when the meteor hits the planet in 2772. . Cute, but stupid. <br /> <br /> In every episode of super sextet ?? amid the slightly funny but basically banal banter? fight with various super villains. For the most part, these are the types that appear in every average of the superhero adventure series, and even some of the better ones. Like many average series of superheroes, this game takes the villains too seriously in context. And of course these guys are the only heroes who laugh? plain bad laugh, of course. Why are villains in the predictable adventures of superheroes always? ALWAYS ?? laugh ominously at every opportunity? Animated material of this kind seems to leave laughter only in the province of villains and (sometimes) their followers and / or henchthings. <br /> <br /> In fact, the creators of this series missed the best bets from leaving. Hero's superpowers are sometimes based on their previous normal abilities, but sometimes not. The problem is that we do not see enough Wob laziness. Lexi and Ace have quite ordinary biologically produced energy weapons and have virtually no personality traits that could be described as "similar to worms". We have stupid and drekish "Teen Titans" here, including his "modern" animated "look", but with animals. Feh. <br /> <br /> The second wrong step of the program's makers is (or are) villains. As mentioned earlier, they are not too clever and they make the evil-laughter a bit excessively. Surprisingly, the writers have completely abandoned the obvious technique of creating villains from the WB characters and heroes. Adding to the fun could be, say, Jupiter Sam? as well as The Fudd, still hunting for the wabbits? the same as Tech E. Coyote turned into a truly neurotic villain? and so on. Ah, sadness because of missed opportunities. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, all this production has gone through too much overtime (ie the second season). Nevertheless, we can be happy that there is something new for the 14-person crowd. The rest of us can count on the third season of Duck Dodgers.
