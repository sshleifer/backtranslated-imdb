Recently I watched this movie on DVD and I have to say that I was not impressed. I know it's a taboo to knock on independent movies, but this one was devoid of entertainment. <br /> <br /> The premise was interesting, but its implementation was unsuccessful. I found myself in the mind, "fine, they are just getting into it, the story will soon be up." Before I knew it, the movie ended and history never appeared. I can not say that I consider acting to be equally impressive. It was very bad. The trilogy of "No Star Wars" is wrong, but it is still bad. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what the run time was, I take two hours (because it is a safe estimate). In any case, when the film was finished, I felt as if I deserved some kind of recognition of the will power that I had on not stopping the film and leaving it halfway. <br /> <br /> Again, I was not impressed, and finally bored with cleverness. I'm not one of those guys who demand fast action and explosions in the movie, so do not start with me because that's the reason you do not like it.
