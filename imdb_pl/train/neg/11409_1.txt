It really started the trend of the 80's disgusting violence impersonating horror. I was the target audience of this hideous piece of rubbish and I was disgusted at the time like now. <br /> <br /> Oh, where we'll start. Let's see, configuration: You can bring people back to life if they die a violent death. So this ridiculously weak premise is a pretext to murder people in a terrible way, because, well, it is necessary to bring them back to life! It could work if you were playing in the laughter of la Re-Animator or something like that. But no, it's easy to play. There is a whole terrified family in the wagon that is being hunted down, one of the few scenes in which their deaths are excluded from the screen. However, almost everything else is on the screen. In fact, there is a scene in which a young girl walking is beaten and killed by zombie townspeople who film her and smile with several cameras. Then comes the close-up of her face, as filmmakers love - and time-consuming - reveal in her time-lapse photography her beaten face carved into a skull and rebuilt to make her look "normal" again. He did it, of course, humming Jack Albertson as a poker player for all this. He likes to ride ambulances / caravans playing old melodies of Tommy Dorcey, I think it should be sweet. <br /> <br /> After all, of course, even the sheriff is undead, and the doctor offers to kindly repair his rotting hands. It is not clear why the Sheriff is not with the other inhabitants of the city killing children with joy and cut off their faces, sticking needles in the eyes of the victims, etc. <br /> <br /> I wonder, I really wonder what people see a show like this to give him any rating at all. It's not scary, the twists are ridiculous, and generally it's a bit sick. It is not even well done to "see it for courage" or to enjoy a level where you can watch a bad movie by HG Lewis. It's just horrible garbage, made for people who get off on this kind of meaningless blood and are made by people who are shouting for payment. <br /> <br /> Sad that Albertson was even involved.
