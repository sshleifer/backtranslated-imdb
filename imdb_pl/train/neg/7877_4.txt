The creators of this film have created a future in which abortion and birth control are not only illegal in every state, but women are prosecuted for murder and sent for long prison sentences. In other words, this movie is the worst nightmare of any liberal! the political program is so heavy here, and the style of the film is so insignificant that it simply loses the pair quite quickly. Regardless of which side of the fence you are on, I recommend skipping it.
