First of all, big named actors must need money ... Surgical scenes were funny ... and they certainly need to know that people who have little medical knowledge find this totally absurd ...... Anesthetists do not leave the room while heart transplants ... nor do surgery in a tiny room without instruments, lung equipment and sterile techniques ... just a joke ... he could not concentrate on the story because of all the stupid surgical scenes ... no blood, no staff and then the heroine comes and takes control ... this is not a movie for adult-minded people ... Also the budget had to be limited ... the street scenes were fine, but who was the technical advisor ... It looks like he was directing total idiot .. Save your money and wait until it comes out on a DVD and do not rent it.
