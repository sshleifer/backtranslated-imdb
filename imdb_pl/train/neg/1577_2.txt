This classic tale of the smoldering passion of 1997. She achieved the well-deserved legendary status of one of the greatest sags of lost and hopeless love. The ubiquitous, continuous and progressive magnetism between Judge Reinhold and his name will surely make the hearts of many viewers flutter about the memories of their first sympathy. A brilliant screenplay heralds this embryonic love affair in front of a delighted audience, seated terribly when abstract, almost expressionistic cinema deeply focuses on the "underneath" desires that flow away and flow between clients. You can reduce sexual tension with matt iron in the tire. <br /> <br /> A small drop of sweat at the end of the nose captures the bright sun and leaves no doubt about its meaning. Scenes like this abound and are still watching. As with "Jane Eyre" and "Rebecca" (to which this masterpiece is so often compared), close-up of the faces of the actors, when they experience a slow dawn of great love that is not, they will haunt you forever. <br /> <br /> The classic soundtrack for the RC, with the creative and unique use of a solo synthesizer, highlights the emotions that drip like a leaky crankcase. <br /> <br /> If I had any criticism at all, mentioning what I consider a minor flaw (and I dared to risk the anger of millions of fans who love this classic so much), I would say that the "Runaway Car" trademark - is his feeling of tension - is briefly interrupted by the motorway scene, which now seems to be a bit exaggerated (and probably even unnecessary?) after the repeated reviews to the eternal, bitter-sweet story of the Broken Love. <br /> <br /> I dare to include what I perceived as the slightest flaws of this critically acclaimed triumph of modern cinema? Citizen Kane had Rosebud. . . The Runaway Car should also have its own password. Perhaps the film could have opened with the extreme close-up of Judge Reinhold saying something like: "The car is an extension of its owner!" And the rest of the story could then be devoted to analyzing each syllable, subtlety and nuances of this expression. If this feature line was finished, this movie could have won the Titanic in Golden Globes this year, I am convinced. <br /> <br /> I regret this? That I did not read the novel first.
