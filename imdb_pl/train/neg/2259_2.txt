Throughout my life I can not understand why they would like to make a movie about the Jerry Springer Show. It's so incredibly tacky. In a sense, unfortunately, it's a pleasure. We all have to admit that we have seen at least one episode. It's part of our pop culture. I last saw it in the USA. That's very bad. I admit this. Jerry is doing a terrible job in what I think he meant. Or something like that. Jamie Pressley is in it. She's basically having fun. She just needed her lover, Kid Rock. Then it would be perfect. So I recommend skipping the Ringmaster. Just watch the Jerry Springer Show. It is more pleasant than this. <br /> <br /> 2/10
