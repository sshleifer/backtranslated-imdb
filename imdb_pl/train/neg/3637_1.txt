I am amazed by the positive reviews of this extremely uninspiring movie. <br /> <br /> I often omit reviews that complain about slow pace and apparent "lack of action", because many of the best international films do not live according to the West Hollywood Hollywood film story. <br /> <br /> I am very happy with the artistry and lack of stereotypes in the arena of a foreign film. I am glad that many foreign films do not combine things into a neat, tasty, small bow. <br /> <br /> Having said that, this particular movie did not offer any salvific value for the time when I wasted it. Without significant character development, without engaging storyline, without the possibility of emotional involvement in any of the characters on the screen. <br /> <br /> Summary: A bunch of immature, emotionally restless, pre-war colonists, ill-abduct their slaves, and a little girl is hurt by her only friend when the "boy at home" finally has enough and worries about her abuse. <br /> <br /> Although the above paragraph is poignant and dramatic, this movie bores you while playing the script. I was so unrivaled that it took three sessions to finish it, and I would not even do it if it were not for positive grades. <br /> <br /> Unless you have academic interest during the period, I strongly suggest to avoid this.
