I'm Anthony Park, Glenn Park is my father. First of all, I want to say that the story of this film and the creation of the Amber Alert system are good. However, the film itself was poorly made, and the acting was terrible. The main problem I had with this movie is the other half with Nichole Timmons and father Glennem Park. Events related to this part of the story were not completely correct. My father suffered from mental disorders and raised Nichole without any intention of hurting her. He loved her like a daughter and was impressed that he saves her from some injury or neglect which he thought was from her mother who had given her little attention for over 3 years when my father took care of her and collected her conscientiously mother could worry about that. The film depicted my father in such a way that he intended to hurt her in some form or form. The funny thing is that Nichole spent many nights in my father sometimes while Sharon worked or did everything she did. The reason my father was initially considered aggressive was because he had items that could be considered a weapon on his truck. My father was a gardener. Objects that they considered to be weapons were landscape tools that he kept in his truck all the time. My recommendation is to take this film with a pinch of salt, a good story based on real events, but the details of the film (at least Nicholim Timmons - part of Glenn Park) are largely inaccurate and depict the director's failure to discover the truth in the story's story. The funny thing is that if the director interrogated any of Sharon's friends who knew the situation, they would say exactly what I posted here.
