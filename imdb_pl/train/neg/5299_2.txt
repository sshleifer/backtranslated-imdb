I really like movies deleted, but this one is really awful. Acting is bad, the script is bad, and the atmosphere does not exist. The plot is as follows: a deformed gardener Charlie Puckett kills people in a small American town. That's right - this is a storyline. Very original, eh! "The Night Brings Charlie" is not even bloody enough - if the film is not scary, at least they should bleed it. Avoid this cheap piece of trash at all costs. If you want to see a good Slasher movie, check out "Madman", "The Burning", "The Prowler", "Just Before Dawn" or "Humongous" - just do not waste your precious time on this worthless piece of rubbish.
