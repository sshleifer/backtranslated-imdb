Operation of the apparatus - Why does the camera work in this film such a jump? It is annoying and distracting. Editing - The photo flash was too short. Many other scenes were too short. It just flashes. Sound - background music was too loud and covered voices. You no longer have to scroll and play to catch what has been said. Does nobody check these things and let them do it again. Decrease the volume of background music in the future. Is adjusting the relative sound levels the task of the editor, Julia Wong? The plot had too many loose ends. The basic story had potential. I think the film required more work. Was it hasty? Maybe they ran out of money. Like many movies, it started great, but it just ended at the end. I really do not understand it, you know you have a story board before it goes into production, so why all the loose ends are not taken care of in the shot series. <br /> <br /> I apologize for being so critical.
