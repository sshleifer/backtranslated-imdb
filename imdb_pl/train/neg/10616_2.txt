Horrible. Just terribly. The script is made up, acting painful, and history just stretches. No doubt this is Sally Potter and not much more. It would not be so bad, but she is the director, writer and movie star, just like gloryification itself. I did not care about the developing romance between the main characters, and the ending did not happen too early. It has two advantages. First of all, many photos are really beautiful, especially in Paris, and it looks rather good in black and white. Secondly, regardless of whether you're a tango fan or not, music is basically perfect (except when Sally starts singing). Watch this video at your own risk or if you need unintentional laughter. I'm sure he is talking to someone. Statistically, he must.
