Let me start by saying that I really liked Betty Grable, especially from the Down Argentine Way, but by the time she reached this disaster, she also "circled" and to be honest the entire movie was embarrassed. The story of Douglas Fairbanks JNr (who had to be quite desperate) was bad, the colors were good, and the film was too long. He had several old standbacks, such as Harry Davenport and Reginald Gardiner, to try to arouse interest, but without success. The music score was pathetic and I have to say that no melody was memorable in any way ... as I was a Miss Grable fan, I always wanted never to see it!
