In 1987, John Hughes wrote and directed "Planes, Trains and Automobiles", which was a comic and poignant comedy? The best thing I've ever done. Ten years later, he reduced himself to re-editing the plot of "Home Alone" in the second part, which is not related to other films, but is equally boring and sadistic. Four cheaters? That's true, four! And one of them is a girl! Congratulations, Hughes, for bringing this revolutionary change to the series! ?? they are electrocuted with metal chairs, muscled with barbells and blinded with paint, ha ha ha haaaaaaaa ha, while the new child is even less charming than Culkin. One would think that the departure of almost all of the key players in the first two films would prevent Hughes from fossilizing the same old procedures, but the only surprise is that even he did not appear in "Home Alone 4".
