I would not be so quick to look at all good reviews and say that this could be a good program. This program is only good if you do not know what "talent" is. I will not even say how offensive it is (I know it can be offensive to many people), because it's not what bothers me about the show. What disturbs me is the fact that people watch it and think it's funny ... stupid and I'm really scared that one day they will be led by people who watch this garbage ... <br /> <br /> Basically, the plot is simple ... it's about offensive, self-centered, spoiled women (Sarah Silvermen) going through everyday life ... <br /> <br /> That's it ... Like it has not been done a million times .. In in fact, almost every joke has been made or is racist ... <br /> <br /> Sara also likes to sing .. I like her voice ... this is it ... no lyrics ... The lyrics are horrible ... which she likes to sing about many things ... <br /> <br /> If you like watching hot women, give up everyone and do it, they feel like shit, and at the same time they fart and say nonsense about every race, and this show is for you ...
