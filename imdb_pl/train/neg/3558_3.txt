Based on the dark bestseller Ray Russell, John (WATCHER IN THE WOODS) bust directed at Hough has little to do with it. <br /> <br /> Although he is not short of bloody violence, he lacks narrative sensitivity and "character". <br /> <br /> The "Incubus" in the title is a demon with a mammoth penis that releases red sperm to the vagina during sexual intercourse - or, more accurately, rape. <br /> <br /> John Cassavetes, enlightening himself from his successful career as a director, is convincing as a doctor who questions the circumstances of bizarre attacks on young women. <br /> <br /> Do not take into account the terrifying possibilities of the victims of demonic offspring. is the audience's tolerance for slow-moving garbage. <br /> <br /> The reluctance of the script to explore the dramatic repercussions of a fertile premise is an example of the main problems with this inept exercise of Big-Schlong-On-The-Loose.
