When I first put Happy Birthday on me, I checked the clock to see how long the movie is. I was amazed by the length. Both animated films and horror films have a common ground: the attention span of the selected audience and should be about 90 minutes. Something more, and you will lose the majority of recipients. <br /> <br /> It was 110 minutes, or 20 minutes after the premiere, that was a huge problem for me. I would like to say that half of this movie could have been edited, but I would be too generous to say that. Go ahead, watch it and tell how many scenes you could edit, even without being a filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the long visit, the film was below mediocrity. All the time he tried to be the great mystery that kills all other friends from the "elite 10". For the most part, not only do they do it, but they zoom in on the face and almost say, "That's the guy! No! It's this gal! " You will spend more time with the misleading camera than watching a movie. And do not start acting. <br /> <br /> Okay, it started me. At the beginning I had to laugh, trying to remember if Melissa Sue Anderson played a character who blinded Little House on the Prairie (later, the research showed that my suspicions are correct), because she really looked blind during the whole movie. Strange, as an acclaimed actress, she should be the best in the group, but it turned out to be the worst. The rest of the staff, apart from Ann (Bregman), was also damned angry, but she took the cake. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a group of ten friends and one immediately gets killed outside. Almost no one thinks twice about the disappearance of this "dear" friend, so they continue their happy way. Slowly, and sooner, there are revelations about Virginia (Anderson), the main character, the past and her psychologist, which is a bit more personal (I CONNECTED 24/7, apparently) than most shrinks. There are more and more deaths all the time. <br /> <br /> What is funny, like the first "disappearance", the more "best buds" disappear, and the less it rests. Of course, they give you a few seconds to say: "Wow, (this person) just will not run away" etc. But then they come back to their sexual ways. Speaking of which, it is probably caused by terrible writing, or maybe I was losing interest in the 30th minute, but it was really difficult to keep up with the one who likes the group because everyone seems to be sexual partners next or someone will be scared at MAX by another and best friend in the next scene. SEE: The scary guy who kept the mouse / rat in his pocket? literally ?? and he was the most obvious suspect. I give the film too much credit (and time), but how it became part of the "elite 10" that I will never know. <br /> <br /> But digression, there is a mystery here. Why these goals for children? Why does Virginia think she killed someone if it has never been proven ("to the end") that any of them have actually been killed? And why would a trailer and poster be murderers for "The six most bizarre murders you'll ever see"? Hell, even in 1981. Most of them were shown in one of the first two Friday films of the thirteenth? by chance, Friday 13 part 2 was released 2 weeks to Happy Birthday to Me. Perhaps they talk about it when they filmed it a month earlier, but they were late for the party. <br /> <br /> When "secrets" come out, trust me, you'll have to rewind 3 -4x to get ridiculous and inconsistent themes, and even then put the subtitles to get all the words of the victim's murderer / killer. Even if you get it for the first time, it's an incredibly scandalous and funny ending. It is almost worth seeing the whole movie, but as a drinking game. <br /> <br /> This birthday meeting should be avoided. This is a horrible and illogical first draft script? Please, know that this requires multiple modifications before the role of the camera, contains both action under the influence and extreme over the acting and is 100% unrealistic, as people react in extraordinary circumstances. <br /> <br /> Additional note: When I was a kid or say 10-11 years, I loved horror movies. (Strange, I'm still doing it.) It's definitely a pleasure, but it's harder and harder to watch it as the years go by.) We got our first VCR and recorded as many horror movies from the network (or EDITED VERSIONS) TV. All I remember from Happy Birthday to Me is getting the last 10 minutes on the tape that scared me? and of course he betrayed the great secret of who the killer was. Although I've seen other clips from this movie, I think it's the first full-length review I've had. Fortunately, this awful movie did not hurt me as a child. I am older now and I can take this trash. But never again. <br /> <br /> Lateral Note 2: Having said that the crazy song "Happy Birthday to Me" played in the final tracks (and as a result throughout the text) still scares me. I think this movie (or the last few minutes) influenced my childhood. Shame on you, Melissa Sue Anderson!
