Gloomy and senseless piece of fluff (bloody fluff, but fluff). Poorly written, with inane and wooden dialogue. You do not care if the heroes (or even the actors themselves) live or die. A little grace or charm, a small action, a small point on the whole. Perhaps part of the set and surroundings will be interesting - these gaps between the boards of all buildings can be in keeping with the way of life. A framework meeting is unnecessary and distracting, and the very nature of Hoppalong Cassidy is boring and inept.
