Perhaps I have seen too many detective stories, or maybe I am not taking the right drugs. <br /> <br /> It was the most stereotypical, devoid of plot, absurd plot, just a stupid movie that I have seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> Regarding the direction, it seems that it took less time to show it than in the case of a comparison. <br /> <br /> In fact, it looks like it would be done straight to the video before it's finished. <br /> <br /> This is a bad fight "M" in the classic film by Fritz Lang with Peter Lorre. It would be better to rent it instead.
