I will be short ... This movie is a shame for everyone except the operator. The fact that it is a critique of the sex tourism industry seems to be important until we are "treated" by the persistent dance scene. The plot is absurd, except that the most ardent fan of the terrifying BAD will not do anything about it. And for love of God, stop saying that this movie is a tale of lost innocence and even of feminine empowerment, because it is not clearly (childish, clumsy lesbians, what the hell?). it was by far the worst film at the Edinburgh festival (which I saw anyway), someone even fell in the middle of the movie probably because he could not do it anymore. it may seem like a critical edge, but I can not really find the redemptive qualities of this movie, except maybe if you consider it a pure comedy. In short, this film is best viewed on a class A cocktail.
