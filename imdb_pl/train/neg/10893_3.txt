This is one of those movies that should have been better than it turned out. I'm afraid to think about what the blockbuster release had to look like, because the directing cut on DVD was boring in epic proportions. Of course, you do not expect it to be "Godfather", but the acting class or two may be useful. <br /> <br /> Besides, there were many cute guys in this movie, but they were pitifully under-used. I like to watch a group of hotties squirming in their BVD the same as the next guy, but even I have the right to expect a little more. However, it was not a total loss; at least we looked at the (covered) rubbish of Drew Fuller and a really annoying hairstyle. And there is Huntley Ritter looking even nicer than in "Bring It On" (and playing as well). There is always a silver lining, children. You just have to look really hard. You must use the pause button from time to time.
