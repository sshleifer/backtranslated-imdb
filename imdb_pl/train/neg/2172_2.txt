Bottom of the barrel, unimaginable and virtually unobservable remake THE ROAD WARRIOR. This film follows exactly the story of the Filipino film STRYKER and is definitely worse! Bad acting, dialogue, effects, dubbing, stimulation, action sequences ... The list goes on. Italy has done literally dozens of Road Warrior starts in the early 1980s, some good, some bad. It's definitely the worst, no competition. The mood of the film was not only completely gloomy and unhappy, but the experience of sitting in it is boring and half. At the beginning of the movie there was one (one) good chase sequence and a cool shot of a man with a exploding hand grenade. But EVERYTHING is stinking about this film! For real fun after nuke, instead trace a copy of ENDGAME, AFTER NEW YORK, or ESCAPE from THE BRONX. They are much more pleasant than this garbage.
