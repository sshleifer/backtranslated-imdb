I will fast and sweet. Five girls on the way home from a football match decide on a "short cut" that leads them down a deserted forest road. Of course, nothing good happens to them and they reach their destination safely. <br /> <br /> It's ok, they are not. Soon they are chased by a mad cane, which has serious mental problems, and thus, 90 minutes of pure boredom. <br /> <br /> I hope that I will never see any of these actors in any film again. Their screams, screeching voices made my head ache, and the script was so badly written that it contained many repetitive phrases and senseless hysterical screams. All in all one of the worst cheap horror movies I've ever seen ... and I've seen a lot.
