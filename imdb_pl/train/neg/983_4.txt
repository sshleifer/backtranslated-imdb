When Marlene Dietrich was in 1938. Called a box-office poison, one of the handful of actresses named by handicraft papers, these were films such as the Garden of Allah. How a film can be so breathtaking to be so unbelievably boring is beyond me. Also like Marlene, if she tried to expand her range and not play sexpot, she got stuck with such an old-fashioned story, she is beyond me. <br /> <br /> The Garden Of Allah, one of the first films in modern technology, is a novel set by Robert Hitchens at the turn of the last century, who then collaborated on the adaptation of the play with Mary Anderson, which had 241 performances in 1911-12 . Then he got two silent screen adaptations. The story of a monk who escapes from a monastery in French Tunisia to see what he has overlooked in the world. He falls for a similarly protected woman who was unmarried and spent her first years caring for a sick parent. He travels in the desert now and they both meet on the train. <br /> <br /> The woman is Marlene, of course, and the escaping monk is Charles Boyer. I am not sure what was in the mind of David O. Selznicka while filming this story. Someone like Ingrid Bergman could make it tasty for the audience. But you can bet that the movie from 1936, When they threw their money on the ticket they expected from Marlene as a modern Salome, not a saint with that title. The audience still remembered Rudolph Valentino and you can bet that they were expecting something like a desert romance and seduction. <br /> <br /> Regarding the monks, one must remember that they are self-sufficient in their monasteries and that particular one bottles the special wine that Boyer is made of. The monastery will have to rethink its economy if Boyer goes away. The monks are a sincerely devout group, but from the head of Charles Waldron down they have the right to be a bit concerned about some self-interest. <br /> <br /> In any case, many religious phrases have been said here by a pair of leads that are really unsuitable for parts. Especially Marlene Dietrich. I would watch this movie with a view to the unique desert colors and forget about the story.
