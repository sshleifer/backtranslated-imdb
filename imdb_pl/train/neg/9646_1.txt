Lack of content in this movie amazed me the most. At first, I think people were going to compare it to Rock On! but I'm really surprised that it was the worst than Rock On! The story so horrible cast Ajay Devgan Jamming with Salman Khan and Asin you have to make fun of me. Music was Okay Khanabadosh was the movie path, the rest was bad! Vipul Shah has not learned King's comedy from Singh. Now Asin .. where she comes from because of an apology for Asin's fans, but she's very stupid in this movie seriously malfunctioning, she did not look good in makeup overdose! My last verdict will look at Aladin with your family instead of wasting time.
