I've always said that some of the arts simply can not be translated into a film, and this is the best example. <br /> <br /> As an art, it is a very funny charade satire Catholic church, with a razor and a central figure that is so shockingly unrealistic, we must uproot it even when it starts murdering its parishioners (one of whom made a fatal mistake, admitting that he has not sinned since his last confession, he feels he is sending him straight to heaven). <br /> <br /> This is just one example of how far art goes beyond reality, and in the world of the theater in which you believe it works. However, this heightened reality rarely works on film, and certainly it is not here. <br /> <br /> Headmaster Marshall Brickman has collected a great cast who does a great job, but presenting this absurdly realistic fashion comedy becomes a tragedy and you stay with an empty feeling in your stomach. <br /> <br /> Instead of looking for stage production, you will not be disappointed.
