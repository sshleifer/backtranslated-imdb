If it were not for "Oh So Gourgous" by Natassia Malthe, this movie B would not be worth one sector of my storage space, Tivo! In what low rent the warehouse at the back of the plot was filmed in the alleged space port? "People of continuity!" This is the basic principle in real movie making! At night, the alleged space port and day (night and day at the space station?) Magazine! People, please! The only thing that I praise this movie for is the dressing room. for continuing to keep Natassia in these tight costumes! Even the women who saw the bomb had to appreciate the outfits that she apparently spent on getting into each day of filming! The science-fiction channel would be better shown in SpaceBalls! At least there would be some real humor in watching something so unbelievable. <br /> <br /> P.S. Michael Ironside, please release your agent as soon as possible! You are much better than the actor, and even associated with this level of film making.
