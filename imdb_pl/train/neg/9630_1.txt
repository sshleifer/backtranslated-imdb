I realize that some of Ben Stiller's films are outside or will be this year, but perhaps he should insist on quality, not quantity. <br /> <br /> I was stunned by what the filmmakers considered a comedy in Along Came Polly. "<br /> <br /> Reuben Stiller is snappy, without grace and is one of the worst performances of the year. Stick Stiller becomes tiring. No doubt he has comic talent, but he has to either find another schtick, or take a break, find some material that's really funny. Because his films change from painfully devoid of humor to terribly bad. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no chemistry between Stiller and Jennifer Aniston, which is a shame because she is a good, intelligent actress with a promising career. As long as she creates more movies like "The Good Girl" (which she is great) and less like "Along Came Polly", she will have a career that she will be proud of. <br /> <br /> Aniston desperately tries to beat the material he's working with, but it's a difficult task for every actress. Except for a few moments with Alec Baldwin, the head of Reuben Stan and Philip Seymour Hoffman, the best friend of Reuben Sandy, there is nothing funny about this horrible movie. Other supporting characters, including Debra Messing as Lisa and Hank Azaria as Claude, are annoying. Azaria's accent is not only stupid but also ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The premise of "Along Came Polly" was certainly promising. Unfortunately, he needed a writer who could turn him into a good comedy instead of that bad, boring, boring excuse for comedy.
