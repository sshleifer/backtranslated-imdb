This was given to the fans because the match "winner takes everything" took place between two separate "companies" (World Wrestling Federation and "Alliance": the combination of former WCW and ECW superstars was a team match, wrestlers limited to throwing opponents from each side of the ring on the second one, every wrestler comes to the conclusion that in order to weaken the opponents and intensify the match, he needs to intervene.He hits, makes a special move and tags at the partner.The plot has been previously tarnished by Vince's trick that the Allance member will be a fradulent and will join This was obvious, with the statement that WWF will be Overall: a very innovative plot, but poor implementation, which is not a shortage of wrestlers, because the match format is tag-team, the other matches are simply rebellious: <br / > <br /> Edge versus T est: a powerful "big boot" in the test, but it did not reveal it about true talents of both stars <br /> <br /> Al Snow Versus Christian: a good match, but superlative compared to pay-per-view <br /> <br /> Taji versus William Regal: the worst match of the night <br / > <br /> Immunity Battle Royal: It was an amazingly cool match to watch, but because the main stars of both companies took part in the main event, only the wrestler who characterizes Heat and is probably a WCW heavyweight rebound (ie Hurricane who is simply employed as an artist). Hardy Boyz Versus Dudley Boyz: The best match of the night: Jeff Hardy made the "Swanton Bomb" from the top of the cage and through the wooden table and Matt was stuck in the cage, which seemed extremely painful. <br /> <br /> Since Stone Cold was a WWF champion, Rob Van Dam was a hardcore champion, and Kurt Angle was a "mole" in the alliance, all the main stars in the main event of the Alliance faction got a job after the match except for Booker T., who recently attacked the wrestler on "Raw" and will inevitably receive a job. Shane McMahon will return somehow to television, and everyone wants to see the fall and fall of the "Alliance" to see how Stone Cold stops working. WWF did much better. A match in which all tiltes were brought to one faction would be better, and what ever happened to Casket and Iron Man matches?
