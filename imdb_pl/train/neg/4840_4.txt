The entire movie should last 45 minutes - maximum. Although it is an interesting concept / theme, it really has not evolved as a story. After introducing the original idea of ​​the courageous (stupid?) Bomb removal expert (cowboy?), And this happens very early, the rest is repetitive. Characters were not examined, and the aspects of location and policy were ignored. There is a nice insight into the terrifying difficulties faced by soldiers in such an alien environment and the difficulty in distinguishing a friend from an enemy. But the way the unit operated in a stretched faith! Individual performances were good and special effects were sufficient, but insufficient to overcome the basic lack of content.
