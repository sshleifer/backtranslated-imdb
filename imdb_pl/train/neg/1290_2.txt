This film lasted two and a quarter hours. Somebody, please tell me what it was about? <br /> <br /> I mean, I understand the historical surroundings. It's about a ragged group of Confederate cowboys (terrorists?) On the Missouri-Kansas border, vengeance on all northern supporters and abolitionists during the American Civil War. But beyond the unjustified violence, the film did not make much sense. Maybe it was a political statement? This war is nothing but unjustified violence? If that was the case, it was done quite well, but I do not think that's what it was about. I think the producers really thought they were making a valuable movie here, but as far as I'm concerned, there was no plot left. It looked like I was watching a revitalized, paperback novel, and the characters look like what you see on the covers of such novels. <br /> <br /> This movie should be burned together with some of the gang's cities set on fire!
