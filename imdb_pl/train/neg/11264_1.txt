I have not decided yet whether it will replace Anaconda with "The worst film I've ever seen." <br /> <br /> Even if you ignore suspicious accents, low production values ​​and frightening camera work, this movie has absolutely nothing for it. I went to see it only when I read the book and wanted to see how they would make a complicated story in a 2-hour movie. <br /> <br /> The simple answer is - they did not do it. Characters appear with little or no explanation of who they are and then do not play any valuable role in the narrative. Even the main characters work for a reason, so before the movie reaches its climax, you do not care what happens to any of them. <br /> <br /> I can accept that books sometimes need to be rewritten to fit movies and it may be unfair to judge the movie based on the book from which it was adapted. But after my friends and I left the cinema, I had to spend most of my travels at home explaining what was going to happen. <br /> <br /> They even change the true meaning of the title of the book "Rancid Aluminum" by pushing it into another meaningless voice to let the film have a nice title. <br /> <br /> A real mess of the movie from beginning to end.
