He did not care about the movie, the book was better. Does anyone know where it was filmed? *** This was my first visit to your site ... I just found the answer to my question. so now I look like a mannequin, but I think I will continue to send my comments. and yes, British Columbia is adorable *** Or why did they take it from the South Carolina Coastal settings? I just read where I need to write at least ten lines. Here is my other main problem with the movie. Kim Bassinger was too boring and it was not what I imagined from a book. I know, the book was a book and a movie; good not so good. I found a character in the book much more empathetic. The book also evoked the rustic, almost primitive paintings of the monastery. While the "castle" in the film was much more impressive visually, it distorted the impression of the story and seemed contradictory to the characters.
