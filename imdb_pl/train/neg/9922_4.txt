Growing up, Joe Strummer was my hero, but even I was cooled by this movie. For better and worse, The Future is unspoken is not a simple document in the style of "Behind the Music". It is rather a film about biographical art, full of interviews, recordings, home movies and mostly pointless sketches of animations from "Animal Farm". The film is consistent, but extended by about half an hour. <br /> <br /> The format of the focus, although touching, is actually quite irritating. First of all, without titles, it is difficult even to know who is half of those interviewees. Second, who must really hear people like Bono, Johnny Depp and John Cusack who are teasing a man? They were not essential to Strummer's life, and their opinions do not add to his story. <br /> <br /> This picture is best when Strummer, through recorded interviews and conversations, touches aspects of his life, which most people do not know about: the suicide of his older brother, reconciliation with the death of parents, joy of fatherhood. For me, they were the most moving, because they showed Joe Strummer not as a punk icon that we all knew and loved, but as an ordinary human being who had to deal with the joys and sorrows of life with which we all have to face. <br /> <br /> There were better, simpler documentaries about Strummer and The Clash. (West Road, VH1 Legends, and Kurt Leer's documentary MTV from the early 90s are reminiscent) Joe Strummer: The future is unspoken only for the guards.
