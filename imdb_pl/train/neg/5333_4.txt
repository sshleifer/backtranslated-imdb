Irritating slapstick mess, a comedy. Elvis Presley plays an Indian equestrian champion who leaves the rodeo to stay in a home in the Arizona desert, where government suits have just invested in a family herd of cattle (which urgently needs a stud). Director Peter Tewksbury urgently needs some narrative skills, although what he lacks in assessment, he makes up for in sloppy comedy editions (his social commentary is not precisely specified, but Tewksbury has satirical turns to his eccentricity and there are some funny scenes). Despite the colorful phrases aided by Katy Jurado and Joan Blondell, general shakiness is getting out of control, and there is too much noisiness and noisy to keep up a lot of interest. When it comes to Elvis, he's loose and frisky - and while it's nice to see how good it is on the screen, you have to wonder if he just gave up at the moment. This mess in the image has a clear effect on hell and although the spirits are high, the returns are mostly low. * 1/2 of ****
