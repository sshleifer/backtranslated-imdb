"Document" and we use this term loosely, sums up that Muslims are trying to brutally take over the world. Then he states that every Muslim who does not admit it, either does not know his own faith or lies in the face! Also, every person interviewed in the film found a market for their absurd view of reality, selling slap to conservatives who want to let others think for them. What the West must know is nothing but propaganda aimed at mental dwarfs. If you're looking for a real documentary about Islam and the current state of the Middle East, I'd be looking elsewhere. Try something that provides multiple points of view from qualified sources.
