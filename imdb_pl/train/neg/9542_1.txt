I do not know what else I can say about this horrible movie that has not been said yet. Honestly, I just have to be angry. I should have known better when I saw the title of this movie, that it would be a horrible piece of nonsense, but I loved war games, so I indulged in my whims. I will regret this decision for the rest of my life. From the very beginning, when government officials explained that their supercomputer could determine who a terrorist was, just how good they were playing a video game, I knew I was on a ride around the country that wrote so well, he forgot. The list of very, very, very bad plot lines, dialogues and activities is so long that if I tried to publish them, I would suspend IMDb. For those people who said they saw the worst movies than this one, please tell me. I am really curious to see something that could cover this steaming pile of horse dung.
