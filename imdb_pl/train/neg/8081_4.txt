One of the requirements of science fiction, at least before it starts to be satire, is that it is somewhat credible. I think an anti-material bomb would do far more harm than what it was intended for. But I will leave it to the physicists who could see the solar crisis. <br /> <br /> This is the crisis the earth is facing, because solar flares are completely out of control. They are approaching the Earth so much that they become unusually hot, as if the whole Earth was the Valley of Death. The answer is an anti-matter bomb that the space ship will have to take to the sun and explode it there. This will reverse the flares, say in the direction in which it is said that Mercury is not in direct line with Earth. <br /> <br /> Who will deliver it, but Captain Tim Matheson and his crew. I mean, if he can focus on business, not on a runaway son, Corina Nemec. Taking care of the personal side of family problems, Admiral Charlton Heston, Matheson's father and grandfather Nemec. <br /> <br /> There is also a villain here, Peter Boyle, who is the CEO of a multinational corporation that is trying to control the global supply of food for survivors. The idea that he may not survive does not enter his thinking. He does everything in his power to sabotage Matheson's mission. <br /> <br /> The solar crisis seems to be a bad mix of 2001, Space Odyssey and Journey to the bottom of the sea. Boyle seems to have come from Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor in Superman, apparently the only one in the cast who realizes that he is a turkey and reacts accordingly. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is steadfast, true blue and boring. Maybe outside the desert rat Jack Palance, who finds Nemec and cares for him. <br /> <br /> The key is that the movie has been directed by the famous Hollywood floppy film provider, Allen Smithee. The film gets four stars for the engaged cast and was in time for the Thanksgiving sculpture.
