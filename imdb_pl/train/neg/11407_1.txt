This movie is a great example of a great book ruined by a movie. Jacob Have I Loved is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. There is no plot, threads disappear, and the montage is terrible. In addition, the music is straight from the synthesizer and sounds unbelievably awful. Bridget Fonda's acting is decent, but the acting of everyone is completely amateur. I suggest this movie to someone who learns to be a producer, as a study, how not to produce a movie, because it is full of bad scenes, bad passes and acting, which should be re-recorded! Read the book and do not waste time on this movie.
