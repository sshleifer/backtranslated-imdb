What documentary about the musician does not contain a single song by the artist himself ?! In contrast to "Ray" or countless other films about music artists, half the fun in the theater (or on the couch) is based on experiencing the same wonderful songs. Here all the songs are covers imposed by uninteresting characters, and these versions did not capture the slow, jazz style of Cohen. More often, the covers are badly sung folk versions. Yuck. <br /> <br /> Interviews are to the same or greater extent with other musicians and characters than with Cohen himself. It is rare that in the film Cohen read his own work (he never sang) - like letters, poems etc. The film did not really contain too much information about the artist's life history or about its development over the years. A huge disappointment for the great fan Cohen.
