Who is Bettie Page? I certainly did not find out when watching this movie. From what I collected from other sources, Mrs. Page was very desirable in the post-World War II period as the queen of "naughty" images and this is what this film presents. However, I never met Bettie, a woman. Her childhood in Tennessee was a combination of evangelical Christian upbringing and dirty home life that can only be mentioned. The film shines over her personal life and reaches the goal of the movie, "naughty" photos. Characters are introduced and dropped within a few frames, but in her pointed bras is Bettie's frame, Bettie's waist and stockings, Bettie in captivity ... etc. The film shifts from black to white every time Mrs. Page visits Miami Beach . Then we return to her shades of gray in New York. Gretchen Mol presents Bettie as one of the darkest young women you have ever met. When Bettie confides in a friend she left while being a high school student, receiving A- instead of A, you can only assume that there were only two students in the Senior class. The most interesting part of this movie is how the odd "naughty" photos of Mrs Page appear in 2007. The real sad thing is that seeing a woman bent like a pig on a spit will not even hit My Space or You Tube. I'm not sure if this movie was written poorly or if some crazy editor cut it to shreds. I recommend it only as a source for people studying the history of strange underwear.
