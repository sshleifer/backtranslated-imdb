About a year ago I stupidly read the DVD cover of this movie at Best Buy and said to myself: "Seems funny, and besides, Michael Clarke Duncan, how can I lose! I paid $ 15.99 plus tax for him. I took him to my friends' house and we were both horrified at how badly it was written and we acted. There are wooden performances. All promised "funny" and "outstanding" performances have never appeared. After 90 minutes, I hanged my head in shame, knowing I would never get 90 minutes or $ 15.99. I literally cried almost because if it was something that could be considered a "comedy", I did not want to believe in movies anymore. My friend and I kept telling our friend about the horror of the movie so much that he had to see it only to understand how bad it was. During the Christmas season this year I watched him with him because he did not want to see him alone. This was my next horrible mistake, because when I was looking, I was just angry. I started shouting at the movie and I'm not the one who talks with the movie. Everyone I know even saw the movie that agreed with the worst they've ever seen. My sense of humor is sick and twisted and often offends my friends, but could not even save this movie. The fact that this movie is not on the list of the lowest 100 in IMDb is astounding. The fact that his rating (at the time of writing this text) is 3.6 is a crime against humanity.
