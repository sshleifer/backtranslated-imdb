This is probably one of the worst movies I want to be a low budget to include the dinosaur species. The movie is so predictable that you can leave, cook your dinner, pick up the phone or whatever, and when you come back you will know exactly what happened. The special effects are so weak that one would think that Lego blocks were used, and the "super fast" dinosaurs were so tame that they make the dog look like a super predator. Acting is saturated. They try so hard, but there are not too many characters to get into the character and the scientist ... Yes, we know exactly what will happen to the blonde in glasses. Stereotypic was created for such films. If you want to watch this movie, I suggest that you are not in such a serious mood as it was in the cast and crew. And if you really are in dinosaurs and you know everything about them in the world, do not watch it, you can break the screen - the facts are so distant.
