Pretty good movie, but not a real story. <br /> <br /> Rubin "Hurricane" Carter was a liar notorious, a murderer and he was never found guilty. The state of New Jersey just did not go for the third time, because it's been 20 years. Carter got an offer in 1976: "Run a lie test and free yourself." He did not take it. This movie should never have been made, but money is saying. Many unjustly spend their lives in prison and undoubtedly more blacks than whites. Why choose a fake story? <br /> <br /> Jens
