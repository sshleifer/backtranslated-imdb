Before I start ... let me say that I believe in God completely. I believe in heaven and hell. Kay, who is out of the way now, I just want to say that what are the morons doing in the world who call themselves "hosts"? Last time, when I checked the host, he does not discriminate against me, he does not let the hatred filled with jackets on television, and he does not try to push his beliefs on every unfortunate soul who ventures into the channel. ALI from those crazy, idiotic, conservative, biblical rumbling, lover Fred Phelps Pat Robertson does every day. I am for free speech, but since when does it include a guy who says that if you dare to live your ideal lifestyle, you will be sent to hell right away? This is just a perfect example of why religion is the cause of many problems. One day in the classroom we had a substitute teacher, so we decided to watch some TV, because the teacher did not give us any work. And we (against the will of many of us) watched the 700 Club, and of course this moron Pat looked at the Bible and raved about the Bible, and he told Simon the model "God says that homosexuality is a sin" and I actually heard the child go "Hmm I think he's right. " WTF ??? Seriously, if the host tries to force people to think that the sexual orientation of another person is a huge sin, they must seriously take this host, gluing the tape and throwing the liner in the middle of the Arctic.
