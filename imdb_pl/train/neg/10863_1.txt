LAGE RAHO MUNNABHAI is a really disappointing movie. I saw the first part of MUNNABHAI and it was really good, but it really makes me feel disappointed ........................... ... ......... <br /> <br /> This movie really is wasting time and money. I went with my friend for this movie on the first day of his premiere, and they both got bored in the cinema .......................... ....... ..................... <br /> <br /> The role of CIRCUIT was very small and useless in this film. I think that SANJAY-DUTT has limited the role of ARSHAD VARSHI ........................ <br /> <br /> The character of the film is also not well defined as previous. this movie shows the result OVER-CONFIDENCE ......... <br /> <br /> MAHATMA's ideas are also not defined and confusing ..... ............. <br /> <br /> REALLY A VERY HUGE BANKING
