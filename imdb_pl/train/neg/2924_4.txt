There was something here with a woman leading this perfect life, which she always wanted after the worst possible life, starting with a child prostitute and ending with Eric Roberts. But its origin prevents her from trusting Dean Cain, and that ultimately destroys him. It sounds strange, but I like the position of Dean Cain at the end and the choice he made. He can not hurt her because she loves her, and she is the mother of his child (I think the time frame explains that he is his child, not his brother), but at the same time can not forgive her for everything she did, sleeping with her brother (which shows the love and commitment he felt was in a sense) and then being part of his death. In better hands it would be a better movie, but for something that I caught on the cable late at night, it's not bad.
