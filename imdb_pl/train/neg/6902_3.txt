Despite the enthusiastic reviews that this film collected in New Zealand, all the noise around the production is unfortunately undeserved. In addition to the plot based solely on cliches, the film is disappointed by weak acting, accents and a general lack of tension. <br /> <br /> Despite the general appearance of a large budget (for NZ), the feeling is definitely a small-town Kiwi ... <br /> <br /> Did not anyone see the Brothers ?? (http://imdb.com/title/tt0250274/) Those who will have similarities right away ... I've heard comments that scenes like boys playing basketball etc. have been filmed to play in stereotypical "boys talking about crap ", but it turns out that he's forced ... <br /> <br /> I believe that Oscar Keightley sees himself as deeply ironic, but again his delivery always seems just vague. <br /> <br /> Those who have any doubts that the culture of the Samoans living in NZ was deep, let's hope, permanently unaffected by American speech, culture, and everything in between will certainly have their mind at the end of this movie. /> <br /> Robbie magasiva it always looks good on the screen, but it's disappointed with the script ... <br /> <br /> It always comforts me the wrong way when the "comedy" has scenes that are set in such an obvious way you have the feeling that you have a good moan on b an anal line - see how you want to be a white boy ... <br /> <br /> I know someone who found this funny movie - but this person has tadpole brains and would fight to spell her name if he offered a million dollars ... . <br /> <br /> It sums up the mentality of this movement, OK, but not great, funny, but not funny ..... Wake up to NZ - this is not a 5 star film in spite of all the luminous (average class white wine ?? :-)) reviews .... <br /> <br /> My advice? if you look at it, get drunk first !!!
