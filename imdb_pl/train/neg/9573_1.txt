Not quite from the wall in a good way, but just completely stupid. "Killer Tongue" is an uneasy mix of science fiction, horror and alleged comedy. What it means is a thoughtless and totally incoherent movie. There are very few dialogues, mainly due to the fact that the script, if it was, is a complete "joint scum". I would not call it a strange, more simply "total nonsense". This movie will definitely fail and you have been warned. There is absolutely no reason to waste time, and if so, the spicy smell will be like rotten fish .......................... ................................... MERK
