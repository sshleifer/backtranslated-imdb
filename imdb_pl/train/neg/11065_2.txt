This movie had so much potential. Anyone who has been following Jeffrey's story knows that there are so many details in this movie that it's ridiculous. Too much time and effort was devoted to the film about Dahmer's homosexual tendencies and his consumption of alcohol. Where was the character's development? The beginnings of every villain are always interesting, and Dahmer was no exception. Where in the film is he talking about his youth when he started to kill and mutilate small animals? Instead, we give a stunning range of flashbacks that try to explain the origin of the killer, but we can not cope with the main point of Dahmer's development. The reason why the country was so intrigued by this story was also the details - how he stored the bodies in his apartment and the length and resources he took to achieve it; his cannibalism and his desire for the body, etc. I could continue, but to sum up, too many delayed points in the film, focused on his sexuality and insufficient blood - good things you can expect when the title of the movie is "Dahmer".
