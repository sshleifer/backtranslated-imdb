I watched Grendel that night and I am forced to prepare an announcement about public service. <br /> <br /> Grendel is another version of Beowulf, a thousand-year-old epic Anglo-Saxon poem. The SciFi channel has a growing catalog of harmless and uninteresting films, and the announcements heralded an inauthentic low-budget mini-epos, but this refused to change channels. It was stunning, overwhelming, bad. I looked with fascination and horror at the train wreck, from which you could not take your eyes off. I reached for the notebook and managed to capture some of what I saw. The following may include spoilers or simply save your mental health. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> - To end this, Beowulf's warriors wore horned helmets. An extraordinary problem compared to what happened later. It also seems that the helmets were in the basket and handed to every actor wandering past. The fit, appearance and function were obviously irrelevant. <br /> <br /> - Marina Sirtis has apparently been blackmailed to make a movie by Ringling Brothers, Barnum and Bailey circus. She managed to avoid the red rubber nose, but the clowns have already done the rest of the makeup. <br /> <br /> - Ben Cross pretended that he was not embarrassed as a king. His character, Hrothgar, had to become the King of the Danes a few minutes before the opening of the film, and she had no chance of changing the crown to suit him yet. <br /> <br /> - To make it easier for the actors to return to their daily tasks, there were no tables, no hair styles at all. The variety of hair included strands, sideburns, buzzing and timbre and at least served to divert attention away from the dialog box. To prove that it is a multinational cast, everyone was encouraged to keep the chosen accent. <br /> <br /> - As usual with this type of film (at least from Mad Max), leather armor was a requirement. In this case it was strange, ill-fitting and completely new. <br /> <br /> - Female interest in love Ingrid, played by Alexis Peters, followed a long tradition of hotties, which should be watched with a completely turned off volume. <br /> <br /> - The unintentional focal point of the film was a repetitive, composite crossbow with exploding screws. He never had to be loaded, and even had a recoil after being fired. He managed to destroy the laws of physics, the integrity of the original legend, a historical fact and a conspiracy by itself. <br /> <br /> - Hrothgar's palace, Heorot, instead of being a Nordic room, was apparently designed and constructed by the craftsmen who sank with Atlantis. <br /> <br /> - Beowulf came to the Danish homeland in a two-mast stern ship that was originally part of the set, the other two were Santa Maria and Pinta. <br /> <br /> - Prince Unferth watched Beowulf's approach with a telescope. Before you get out of this amazing innovation, you must see the ship from his point of view. Judging by the corner, the prince was on some plane. <br /> <br /> - Funny fact 1: In Bulgaria, fire (like a fireplace) creates light without heat. This explains why you could see the actors' breathing both inside and outside. <br /> <br /> - Funny fact 2: Dark Age dance in Denmark looks like slow dances to which I went in the eighth grade. <br /> <br /> - Funny fact 3: You can also do a catapult with an explosive explosive with a sense of time. But do not expect something to hurt. By the way, Beowulf was apparently a World War II veteran, shouting "Coming!" to destroy any remaining suspensions of disbelief. <br /> <br /> - Grendel was so nervous and always tense, because as a completely CGI he could not leave any traces. Even in the snow. <br /> <br /> - Grendel's mother ("Hag") was in a bad mood because she was a single mother, and junior did not inherit her wings. I suppose the recessive gene. Incidentally, we can now guess that Grendel's pop is probably Swamp Thing. <br /> <br /> - Grendel and my mother chose accidental killing, fly away or draw their prey only after reading it carefully from the next few pages of the script. <br /> <br /> - A funny medical fact: the mythical beast is hit hard enough to be thrown fifty feet towards the stone, causing small scratches on the face that do not bleed too much. /> <br /> - Beowulf's legend sword used to send The Hague was as long as it was tall and contained enough steel to place the second deck on the Golden Gate Bridge. Fortunately, wavering eased all fears about his weight. <br /> <br /> - The best movie line: Prince Unferth has just been pierced by The Hague and spit a quart of blood around six feet. Princess Ingrid hugged him gently and said: "Everything will be fine, my prince." So much for this job at the triage clinic. <br /> <br /> Now I feel better.
