Let's face it - if you hired the sequel STDVD for the forgotten jewel of the 80's and you expected it to be better than the one mentioned above, you're an idiot. Wargames: The Dead Code joins the long list of unnecessary sequels that the DVD market has so easily filled. These types of videos do not need spoilers because you already know them. <br /> <br /> The "plot" of this "movie" looks like this: Nerd meets a girl; the girl likes nerd; the gull likes a girl; nerd is accidentally involved in the Top Secret Government computer; the gull and the girl are going to another country; nerd and girl are finally persecuted by government suits in another country; the gull and the girl meet some important old man who dies at the key point of the "movie"; the sucker and girlfriend are captured; the Secret Government's computer was gone; nerd is hired to defeat the Top Secret Government Computer; nerd beats the Top Secret Computer, using the same old secret computer from the first movie "Wargames"; nerd saves the day; the nerd is stacked. <br /> <br /> End. <br /> <br /> Acting, scenario, effects, score and photos are what you would expect - B-grade. Some familiar faces are here and if you're not a mega fan of Colm Feore, you should avoid it. It's true that the movie will not drive you crazy enough to eat your own toes, so if you like cheap STDVD sequels, you're at home. <br /> <br /> associated with some "masterpiece" that he could not even make a five-second scene in it. But you can blame him?
