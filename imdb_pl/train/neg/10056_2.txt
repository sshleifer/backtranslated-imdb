So ... we get additional Brando materials ... interesting, but not quite worthy Oscar. Susannah York was not surprised. A new scene in which Lois finds out that Clark is Superman is a bit unbelievable because he does not notice that there are empty spaces instead of real bullets from the gun. Real missiles would penetrate through his clothes and then bounce off the floor, but I will forget about it ... let's hear Donner poking fun at the Lester version, which had a more logical sense. The president says that Zod "destroys" the Washington monument when it was originally Mount Rushmore. Adjusting this scene made this line quite absurd. Superman's line of "press freedom" sounded stupid compared to "..Care to step out", which was released better and had a proper connection to Clark's earlier scene at the truck stop. Then the effect of "roll back the world in time" ends. It turned everything around the movie and made you wonder exactly where the rocket is going to Hackensack, N.J. he has ever gone because Zod and the company are no longer exempt.
