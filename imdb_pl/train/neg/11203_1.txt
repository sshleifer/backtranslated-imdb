The screenwriter tried to reproduce the Exorcist poorly. But throw in a love story that makes you sick instead of keeping you engaged. There is nothing important in this whole movie. but it blows, showing a group of people that no one cares about, very boring, I wanted to leave the theater when I saw it, but stupid cinema tickets were expensive, so I had to endure the grim torture that seemed to last forever. Nothing on the screen is related to what the characters talked about. <br /> <br /> They use computer graphics here, which instead of delight me (as I intended, I hate CGI), just destroyed the movie. Some say that this movie was terrible in cinemas because of how "provoking thought" and "slow-without action" because it is a smart movie. It is so intelligent or provocative when the story is basically about the pretty boy H eath Ledger as a priest who is interested in love and is opposed to his religion? It seems to be a boring concept. Oh, and there is some mumbo jumbo about the "sinner" (the movie was originally supposed to be titled "sin-eater"). Lame concept, but the film took too seriously the "sinner's" thing, making the film pathetic and illogical, as it was dark and intelligent. Yes, I know that in the Middle Ages there were really sinners, but this movie just makes it sound cheesy. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the film was done properly and I forget why I even bother to watch this movie. If you want to watch horror films that have depth, see the work of Rosemary's Baby, The Tenant, Naked Blood, Society, Cannibal Holocaust, Pin, Exorcist, Omen or any Romero movie "Dead Trilogy". Nonsense dialogue is not synonymous with an interview, but mainstream fans believe that (people of the same kind who think that a funny movie, such as Hulk, is a film masterpiece). If you want a poignant boring horror movie, watch the Order. This movie makes the church look like a roller coaster ride.
