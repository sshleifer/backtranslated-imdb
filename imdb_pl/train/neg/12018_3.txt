- A small hood in time brings out a local mafia boss with big money. Of course, the mafia boss wants to get his money back and does not care who he should kill to get it. Punk recruits his friend and old gangster to help him save his life. <br /> <br /> - If it sounds funny, it is. The whole idea that the wearer Izod, the dune punk buggy can stop one of the most powerful mobs in Rome, is simply stupid. His friend may be good with weapons, but he is against a group of trained killers. An old gangster is little more than comical relief and there is no real help when it comes to the face with the crowd. There is also a sub-thread about how the father of a friend was killed by a mafia boss years ago, but there is not much of it made and it does not help the film at all. <br /> <br /> - Mafia boss, Mister Scarface, Jack Palance. I suppose he got the name because he has something that looks like he shaves on his cheek. Palance is as ineffective as the rest of the cast, he does what he needs to get a payout. <br /> <br /> - I've seen quite a few Italian crimes / policemen lately, but Mister Scarface is not one of them. Instead, check out Syndicate Sadists or Revolver.
