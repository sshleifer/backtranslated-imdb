During the beach vacation the redheaded brothers Michael McGreevey and Billy Mum (as Arthur and Petey Loomis) find a seal. The boys will baptize their "Sammy" and spend the summer playing with the sandy sea lion. When the time comes to return home, the boys begin to feel separation anxiety. Young Mr. McGreevey decides he can not take Sammy back to Disneyland? er, "Gatesville" - but young Mr. Mumy is packing him anyway. At home, try to hide the "exit stamp" from adults and of course? get carried away! <br /> <br /> **** Sammy - The Way-out Seal, Fri 1 (28/10/62) Norman Tokar ~ Michael McGreevey, Bill Mummy, Robert Culp
