I give this film ONE, because it is really a terrible movie. The soundtrack of a DVD is so bad that it really hurts my ear. But the vision, no matter how chaotic, shows something really extraordinary in Italian society. I will not discuss in detail what was really shocking, but the various incidents are absolutely abnormal. As for the value of the bend, I give it one. Otherwise, video, photography, acting, adult actors / actresses are just below the standard, a practical jockey for people who love foreign films. Roberto, the main character, has a full spectrum of emotions but exaggerated to the point that they are unbelievable. However, children in the film are usually 3/4 years old and are authentic, and the film shows Italian life ..
