A bloody maniac with a cannibalistic inclination rapes a woman. He was shot by two policemen, and then he was raised from the grave because of some satanic ceremonial rite made by evil heresy. Hunting for women continues this zombie demon. The devoted child returns from the grave and wants the maniac to be dead again, but only with the help of the police it will come true ... <br /> <br /> Damn 65-minute mess ... Horny zombies, doll-staff, S & M, corrupt and twisted policemen, regret the heretics who seek refuge from Jesus Christ and the three text screens at the end of the movie, explaining to us what finally happened to the policeman who survived (yes, we should know!) ... Two decent shots can not save situation. I've seen the worst horrors, but this one was bad too. Recommended only for die-hard fans of the genre.
