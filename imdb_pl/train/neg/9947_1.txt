This movie was terrible. I swear that they did not even write a script that just flipped through the whole movie. Ice-T was annoying as hell. * Phht SPOILERS more like the reasons not to watch * Sit down and eat breakfast for 20 minutes. he could have disappeared long ago. The land was hard, it would be difficult to trace him without dogs. And when ICE-T is on this hill and uses this Spaz-15 Assault SHOTGUN, like his sniper rifle (and then he cuts down a tree with eight bullets? You need 1000 pieces of bullets to cut a tree in this size). and hand weapons are considered inaccurate at 100 meters. And they even saw the reflection. What reflected the light? I have not seen in this area. Also, when he was shot in the gut and continued, he was delayed if he bled to death. Plus The end, in which he stacks a rock or cigarette in a guy's barrel. It will not explode and will not kill it. The bullet continued to shoot, killing Ice T, but a mess in the barrel.
