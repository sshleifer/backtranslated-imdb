Someone called Howard Koch a schlockmeister, but he wrote the script for "Casablanca", right? Or not him. Maybe there's more than one Koch in Hollywood and I do not like Casablanca. Wait a second - yes, there is another Howard Koch that revolves around Hollwyood. He is the one who wrote Casablanca. Irrelevant. In the commentary I will add as much attention as "Howard W. Koch" put in this production, i.e. only a little bit. <br /> <br /> You know how it sounds? Somebody read Cliff's notes about Shakespeare's "King Lear" and decided that because there are no original thoughts on the Inbound Inspiration Express board to update and Hollywood with happy endings. <br /> <br /> There are differences. Lear decides to divide his vast possessions between the three sisters and before that he asks them how much they love him. Two sisters are throwing at his feet and a brown nose to get to his money. The third is a good girl and does not want to operate Lear. But in the play, Lear remains alive to regret his decision to give both of his storage and deprive an honest girl. He is crazy and naked during a storm on the moors, he puts flowers in his hair and hallucinations. Children can do this to you. (Let's take my child for example.) After all the effort, I squandered him for education, or show any interest in becoming a doctor or a lawyer? No.) Finally everyone in the play dies. <br /> <br /> Apparently in the movie, a good sister is grim and suicidal, but when she tries to break away, someone jumps in and saves her, so the ending is more or less happy. This is the difference between Hollywood and a real tragedy, unless you define Hollywood as a sufficient tragedy.
