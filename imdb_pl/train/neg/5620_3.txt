There is really no reason to investigate much further because of some very gross and misleading statements. <br /> <br /> An excellent example is the situation in which the filmmaker claims "Saul" or Paul from Tarusa (author of the Book of Hebrews). He assures that: he has no idea that Jesus is or was a man, this statement is either deliberately false, because he accuses others of introducing or does not know what the Bible says. <br /> <br /> we can first examine his misleading claim about the Hebrews 8.4; which shows the quotation: "If Jesus were on earth, he would not be a priest", hence here he sets up an ignorant and unlearned viewer to accept his false premise ... why? He does what most of the so-called Bible-believing people accuse of the same thing ... This is EXCEPTION from context. <br /> <br /> one of the Hebrews 8 is verse; 1. "Now what we have said is the sum: we have such a high priest who stands on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens." The above context is CLEAR, talking about Jesus who was on earth and HE HAD GONE up to Heaven after His supposed resurrection. <br /> <br /> This has nothing to do with how the director wants the viewer to extract his fragments from the contextual writing. Here he proposes the foundation that "Paul was not aware of HUMAN Jesus, but only one in" heaven "<br /> <br /> he follows? <br /> <br /> allows you to see if the filmmaker is honest; Hebrews 7; 14. "It is obvious that our Lord leapt out of Judah; from which tribe Moses did not say anything about the priesthood. <br /> <br /> heh, did not the filmmaker simply quote the author of the Hebrew Letter, trying to show the writer of this book that he has no knowledge of "human Jesus"? it is likely that, anyway, Pawe≈Ç did not write in Hebrew, but I will not talk about it here, but the filmmaker claims that Paul did it and that is the assumption of this point. <br /> <br /> It's not like this filmmaker does not make decent points in certain areas, but he engages in the same blind partiality of religion he fights for, and when he engages in this tactic, he loses credibility in my strong opinion as a religion he chooses, and the film is no longer a document, but a personal opinion and partiality of the filmmaker, nothing more, nothing less.
