"Fred Claus" somehow avoids becoming this year's "Santa Claus", having at least some more fun moments than Tim Allen, but it does not mean that there is enough to go to the theater. <br /> <br /> As the holiday films are spinning, it is imaginary and sentimental. But actually it could be the smallest problem with "Fred Claus", boasting that David Dobkin ("Shanghai Knights"), at the helm, contains virtually unimportant really funny moments, because he clumsily strides the line between the coarse Vince Vaughna vehicle and a vague Christmas movie. In the end, it is not too much. And with the cast of Paul Giamatti, Kevin Spacey, Rachel Weisz and Kathy Bates, the more disappointing. <br /> <br /> Vaughn plays Fred, Nick's older and distant brother (Giamatti), who long ago left him and their parents (Bates and Trevor Peacock) after they had had enough to endure his younger siblings favoring their parents. Nick grows into Santa Claus (and as lektor tells us, time hangs on you and your family when you become a saint), while Fred becomes a Yogurt-controlled repo man in Chicago who has difficulty remembering his girlfriend Wanda's birthday ( Weisz). <br /> <br /> He has trouble with the law and had to call his younger brother (who looks amazing at least ten years older than him) to release him from prison. Nick agrees, but only if Fred agrees to help in the North Pole packaging business. Fred reluctantly agrees, but his cynicism collides with Santa Claus and the ever-cheerful character of the elves, even as a Spacey expert he checks the operations of the toy factory, only too happy that all operations in the Arctic will be terminated if something goes wrong . /> <br /> The film, as said, has its moments, but the padded length of the stretches stretches them thinly throughout the duration. In the meantime, there are stacks of Christmas film clich√©s that were better served, say, "Elf", and the attempts of sentimentality are as engaging as last year's fruitcake. <br /> <br /> Vaugn, as always, brings his rough charm to the table, but the castrated scenario of Dan Fogelman prevents him from REALLY doing his thing. Giamatti, under a bad, fat suit, brings his old character to his iconic character, but unfortunately he has to play the second violin Fred. Spacey brings his face, but his turn usually ends unreasonably. <br /> <br /> In the end, "Fred Claus" becomes a movie that can not be forgotten, which the people involved in this game deserve. Of course, there are worse ways to start the cinema season, but there are certainly much better ways.
