Elizabeth Ward Gracen, who will probably be remembered as one of Bill Clinton's "bimbo eruptions" (now have pills!) Is probably the weakest element of this program. It really continues the tired formula of the Highlander series. The immortal hero encounters another immortal with flashbacks about the last meeting, but there is some conflict, and finally there is a sword fight, where you have a cheap sequence of special effects. <br /> <br /> Then you have Nick Wolf. Essentially, your typical unshaven hero of the 90s, with the typical plot of "Sex Stress". (Seriously, why Hollywood thinks sexual tension is more interesting than sex.) It was a joint Canadian / French production, so half the series takes place in Vancouver imitating New York and the other half in Paris ... Just how did it Highlander.
