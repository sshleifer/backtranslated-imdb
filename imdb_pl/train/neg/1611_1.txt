I think it is a horribly produced and directed film. Benicio Del Toro should not be involved in the production of films, he should emphasize his acting and that's all. Steven Soderbergh underestimated the idea of ​​the revolution, its ideals and, most importantly, the life of Che Guevara and so on. The camera is awful, like someone with 2 days of experience working with her, the music is ... I do not know ... is there any music there ???? I will not recommend this piece to anyone .. I just wasted about 4 hours in front of the TV or anything else ... I can not understand how anyone can rate this movie over 3 stars. DISASTER .... DISASTER .... DISASTER .... DISASTER Do not watch please. Save yourself from this misery of the "movie"
