There is nothing new here. All standard romantic-comedic scenes, even for a taxi running to the airport, to stop a departing woman. The only thing that saves it is the acting of Alison Eastwood and some of the smaller characters (wink and miss Miss Gabrielle Anwar), which of course had some fun. <br /> <br /> Turn it off when the couple is in pleasure and you will not have to go through the inevitable pain of the plot.
