I really do not know what the movie is about. This is like an art school project. They never say why the world is dark, but there is always darkness, except for seconds a day. There are long, interrupting shots of insects of all kinds for no reason. What little dialogue in the film is just as absurd and senseless as the paintings. A black woman enters the apartment of the main character. Somehow it gets pregnant over night, and then it gets shot in the head. The main character deals with the body until it becomes a cocoon, after which a white naked woman emerges. I have never been so surprised by how bad and aimless a movie can be. Honestly, I'd like someone to look at it so they can tell me what they think. But I would not wish this level of hell to anyone.
