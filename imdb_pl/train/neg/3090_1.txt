I really do not have anything new to add, but I felt I had to comment on this sack. So here goes: <br /> <br /> Cruel. I am again looking at the DVD MST3K collection and watched Hobgoblins for the tenth time. He is really, very painful, but he was next on the list ... You can see that there is a small nucleus of the real movie buried under all nonsense, which are "Hobgoblins", but simply could not get out. Everything in this film has 4 steps. History, acting, effects, women, "action scenes", ... ahhhh forget. I can watch a piece of shit, such as "Bloody Blood Dr Z" (aka "Zaat"), still and almost without any bad effects (in fact I like it - btw, it will be in TCM later this month - October 2009), but "Hobgoblins" is the whole "nother ballgame". <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that about 12 hours have passed since the end of the movie, I had a good night's sleep, some coffee and some dry toast, my medicine, and yet the "dancing" dance music "New Wave" which Amy, Red Shorts and Laraine Newman had fun in the living room, it's RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD. This passion will last several days. <br /> <br /> Good luck, right?
