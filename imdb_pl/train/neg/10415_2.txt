2 stars out of 10 possible - and this is too generous. <br /> <br /> I thought of the cast of James Woods, Cathy Bates, Randy Quaid, Lou Gossett, Jr. and Henry Thomas - how can it be missing. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I can only wonder what drug Sam Shepard had on the weekend, he shot this piece of dribble. I have long suspected that Sam S. is something of a madness, this film, based on his art, confirms this. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of artsy b.s. that actors LOVE to sink their teeth because it gives them a chance for an infinite emote. However, for the viewer who sits through this senseless junk, there is absolutely nothing to love in this film. <br /> <br /> You did not see dysfunctional families until you saw this group. Pa is crazy, Ma is crazy, son is crazy, and daughter is, oh, crazy. They also have lips that say words that will make a sailor blush, especially a teenage daughter. <br /> <br /> In addition to the above, as if it was not enough, the plot - and it is so thin that you can read exactly - has a hole in the size of Alaska. <br /> <br /> He's plotting to sell his destroyed farm. As it turns out, this is Pa. Now, I'm not saying that I'm a real estate expert, but when I last checked, ownership jointly owned must have both owners' signatures to be sold. If only one of them owned the property, the other could not legally sell it, so it would be pointless for that person. Mr. Shepherd prefers to ignore this basic fact, so his plot does not work. <br /> <br /> It does not mean that something really worked. <br /> <br /> The only possible reason anyone could watch this movie is that they are absolutely desperate to see James Woods in full naked, and I can not imagine why anyone would like it.
