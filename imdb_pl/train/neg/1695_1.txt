OK, when I saw the announcement of this movie, I thought it looked really scary and I was very excited to see it like the group I was with. Now, living in America, especially during these elections, I see some very deceptive things, but I must say that these announcements were at the top of the list. I do not see how many people could be afraid of this movie. I really only noticed two real jump scenes and jumped on one. The whole movie was extremely predictable and maybe some of the jumping scenes were mixed up for me. When it comes to sound effects, so many people who are so afraid, I thought they were comical at best. Oh, and uhh catboy, where did it come from and why? The worst noise in the whole movie had to be a weird moan. How is it frightening anyone? I can easily make this noise. Do not get me wrong, I've always loved all those awful scary movies that just laugh, but I did not even think that this movie was just wrong.
