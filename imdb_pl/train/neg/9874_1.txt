A great book about a fox and his family who does what foxes do. it's farm theft and killing victims. until three farmers decide that they have enough of this fox and try to solve the problem in various ways. They are, of course, "burned out" at every step and while the three camp at the fox's hole, the family performs air raids on three farms. <br /> <br /> The movie version and I use the term movie very loosely, is a more ugly pastiche of American movies about the robbery, especially the movies of the Oceans. They even have George Clooney as fox Mr, to add to the insults and have managed to completely leave this story. So it's right for them. They will make a lot of money and destroy another classic book for children, Roald Dahl.
