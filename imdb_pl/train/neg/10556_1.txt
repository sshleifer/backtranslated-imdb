This is a good example of how NOT to make a movie. <br /> <br /> There is very little meaningful dialogue, no context for events and continuous cuts between seemingly unrelated scenes. The result is a confused, unconscious viewer; the story is absolutely impossible to realize, and ideas presented do not make sense without listening to the director's commentary. <br /> <br /> This film has a lot to do with human cruelty and tries to show how bad it is, with emphasis on the use of children. It contains footage of real, terrible acts of violence, including executions during the war. Although it works in the context of the movie, I feel that the ideas of the film could be presented without resorting to such extreme content. This film is NOT intended for weak stomached or easily offended and should in no case be shown to minors. <br /> <br /> The climax is anti-climatic compared to the content of the rest of the movie. If you do not listen to the commentary, when it happens, you'll probably miss it. <br /> <br /> The commentary of the director was one-off, "sit on your lap and let him speak without cutting". comment. Though not necessarily bad, the director often wanders and often spends minutes complaining about his university, filming conditions, what producers, bad film and a dozen other things. Continuous negative effects negatively affect what is an important tool to understand the film. <br /> <br /> The film was shot many years ago on 16mm and Super8 films for four years with exceptionally low budget. Because of this, the picture and sound quality is poor. This is not a bad movie alone, but it makes the bad movie worse.
