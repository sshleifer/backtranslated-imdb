I remember this program. I still remember this funny song "America's Funniest People". Honestly, it should be titled lame Americans or unpalatable or even disgusting People. Dave could not save this program, neither Bob Saget nor the host AFV hosts, who came later. The Jackalope segments were fun, and so Dave could make some good voice recordings that would be better than Bob's. But this show went to hell because of the bad, bad movies that people have sent. It also evolved as something like a series with bad guest stars, including Olson Twins. Plus AFV was in excellent condition before they started to drool as ugly children as winners. Did I mention that the films were disgusting and lame? But the theme song is still rocking!
