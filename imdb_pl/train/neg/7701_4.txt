The original program was much better. They should leave a good note. This movie killed the whole idea. It was boring, overly dramatic, and the funny parts were too far away to catch up. This movie really seemed too difficult to be serious, and it definitely was not what I wanted from that part. Not to mention that for a long time the same depressed the same. I'm sorry, Tyler Perry, but try again the next time. This movie is just boring and not so much fun. Excuse me. 4/10 stars this. <br /> <br /> Jay Addison
