Yes, it sums it all up. This movie was terrifying. Two minutes later I wanted to pick my eyes. It is praised as the "innovative comedy of LDS", but it is not even good for the members of this church! I do not think that any human being would be as repressed as watching a movie about this poor quality. <br /> <br /> First of all, you can say that absolutely no effort has come into this movie. It seems that the terribly colorless, gay, trivial thread has been joined by two crazy weasels saturated in some way with a gift of coherent (at least partly coherent) thought. Then there is acting, which is bleak from * everyone involved *. Even episodes do not bring anything to life. <br /> <br /> And let's not forget that our hero is a shallow jerk who we would like to believe that can change, but this path is full of embarrassingly evil dialogue, terrifyingly hideous "gags" and many Mormons are "joking", that anyone who is right, LDS or not, should consider it purely * stupid *! It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen!
