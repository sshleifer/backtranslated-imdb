It does not even deserve a review, except for warning to potential viewers. This is a rather vague story about ghosts about the actress haunting the studio during the shooting of the drama of the Second World War. There is no fear in it, no tension or surprises. One shocking moment that seems a little too stupid to be shocking. The visual style is very flat and boring, although from time to time there are some really cool editions. History never happens, and movies are just a total bust. 4/10.
