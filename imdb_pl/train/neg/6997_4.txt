I watched it with a growing sense of anxiety. Why did God, in the form of Ian Hunter, help these particular people try to escape from Devils Island? What was he doing there? I mean, I know God works in a mysterious way, but helping thieves, murderers and prostitutes redeem, forgive and change their hearts in such a forgotten place ... In any case, the film is not sympathetic. Regardless of what Gable of charm lacks in this portrait of a completely selfish man, Crawford is as engaging as ever, i.e. In general for me, and the whole look of the movie makes it appear that it was made 10 compared to movies of modern times, such as "Stagecoach" and "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town", it looks prehistoric.
