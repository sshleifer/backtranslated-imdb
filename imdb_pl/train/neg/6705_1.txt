This movie is just a shame. Orlando in Florida seems to be a more recognizable movie area (just like the Vancouver promotion). The brothers were filmed in Central Florida, and this short film is a bit of a defeat for this area (which made great progress in the independent film Walking Across Africa and the great HBO miniseries From Earth To The Moon). <br /> <br /> I will try to be as honest as possible. I think Orlando was the perfect place to shoot The Brothers. He had the potential to give a new turn to the Boy Band craze. After all, both N'Sync and Backstreet Boys come from this area. But the brothers can not cope because of a weak scenario. Both leading characters are flat and almost do not develop (part of this may be amateur actors, but some of them are certainly written in the script). <br /> <br /> The problem is also the choice of jokes. Many jokes are too repetitive (for the first time they are fun, but a bit boring). Some "concert" scenes are badly staged (and many of these scenes also do not seem to transfer history in any way). <br /> <br /> I had high hopes for this, but unfortunately its disappointing effort. I also hope that the best for the upcoming function based on this short one. But I think the best thing for the filmmaker John Figga is the transition to different genres (fast). Comedy is not his strong point. But it is undisputed that he is definitely one of the better known filmmakers in the area of ​​Orlando (it's only a shame that he is infamous at the moment, not famous). <br /> <br />
