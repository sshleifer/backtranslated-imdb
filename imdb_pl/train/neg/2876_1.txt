I challenge the motive of the creators of this fictitious description of the motives of the BTK assassin. Are they trying to depict animal rights activists as sick monsters? Who is responsible for this? Do not they think that the people associated with this monster are hurt enough? What a blatant lack of respect and sacrifice! It was like a personality experiment: What is more worrying about you, slaughterhouse or human murder? They used real names of some victims ... this movie was hideous, disrespectful and offensive! The creators of this film used this tragedy for their own purposes! People have to wake up and redraw the line!
