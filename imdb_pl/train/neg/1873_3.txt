You're kidding !!!! Consider the possibility that Parker Posey is really an actress, and not just an entry into the "club bizarre of the month" actors. Really, unless it is to be a cheeky satire on David Mamet - lapidary, misleading dialogues alternately in the speed of a machine gun or monotonous (thought Ben Stein) thoughtlessness - or a flat dry comedy; this movie must be in preparation for the Rotten Tomato Award --- or worse. <br /> <br /> As if the stiff and uncomfortable Posey was not enough, we have stiffer and even more uncomfortable Jeff Goldblum. There is more wood in this movie than the toothpick factory. <br /> <br /> Adding to this already bizarre casting, there are several other roles, all populated by forgotten actors who look or sound like escapees from Next Top Model America, Don Pardo, and even a kid who pronounces the word "It was" like "beans", which simply draws our attention to the fact that there is so little to like in this film, we analyze its accent to guess whether it is Canadian or not !! I think I was laughing heartily at places that are meant to be serious, and I took the sections seriously to be entertaining. Even the soundtrack sounds like the caricature of Alarik Jans' music for Mamet's "The House of Games". If the film is treated as a parody, the film is almost inaudible; if taken seriously, it's just a self-aware piece of dreka.
