No words can describe my total hatred for this terrifying release of the BTK assassin. Judging the film for ten compliments this truly catastrophic excuse for the film. There was not a single distinction from the beginning to the end. The whole thing was terribly complex; script, acting, plot, lighting, direction, ACTION, factual information, ACTION, just to name a few. A lot of scenes literally laugh-loud-funny, the horrible way in which the whole is combined. This review may seem like an unjust and vicious attack on a low-budget movie, but it is not. Just thinking about the movie I just saw makes my blood boil. As this film has ever received production rights, I will NEVER know. I am almost tempted to really recommend BTK, because it is really outstanding in terms of deplorability and disturbingly terrible. I can honestly say that in all my years of filming it is the WORST. MOVIE. ALWAYS. I wasted more than an hour of my life on these useless garbage and would gladly jump off the nearest building if I knew what I was for. ZERO with TEN.
