I rented this movie on DVD. I knew that the movie would not meet what he promised me on the back of the case, but when I saw Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) in it, I had to borrow it. It starts quite well, assuming that snuff movies are emitted by the cable. However, the main character has nothing about her, which makes her feel sorry for her, and the end of the movie really suspends you. There are too many unanswered questions. At the end there was a great scene that totally surprised me, but overall, it's a very subtle movie, but I think it was worth $ 3.99 for the rental.
