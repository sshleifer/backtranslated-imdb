I just saw it on TMC, it's fresh in my head. It's obvious that while marionettes are stars, they do not run the show. First of all, they are divided into 2 groups - Moe, as "Shorty" and Larry and Curly as a pair of tramps, so there are not many full team work. The love story that drives the plot is uninteresting, both ladies are the only ones that have any kind of acting ability, there is another group of musical puppets who are not happy unless their attempts to be funny are sad buffooners. The music is tiring, they drive cars on the ranch, and then rely on horses, the western dorkies are stupid, and the movie is terribly much without cameras on the camera. Incidentally, this is of course after Curley's first hit, and its lowered energy level is clear. Vernon Dent appears early in the non-accredited role. I loved everything that these guys had ever done, including everything that did not belong to Curley, but this little dog is bad.
