Or listening, that's it. Even the soundtrack is boring. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this is not the worst gay movie I've seen (which could apply to Billy), but it's very close to the bottom of the barrel. <br /> <br /> This thing goes on and on. It's not that the plot is meaningless - it could work in the hands of a good writer. . . it could definitely be much more entertaining. There is not one story point that can not be seen after ten miles. The dialog window is flat. The jokes are old. To add insults to injury, he is full of one-dimensional, stereotypical gays. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this movie convinced me that the situation or the relationship between these two tracks is possible, much less real. There was no chemistry, there was no dynamics, in fact there is no evidence that the dragons love each other. . . we were told they are in love. Difficult to imagine when they have nothing to do with each other and are not sexually compatible. They like the same book? Huh? <br /> <br /> Acting is not completely bad, but the stimulation is extremely slow. I mean, almost Jarmusch - slowly, but without the quality of Jarmusch. In fact, it would be a good barometer for you. If you like Jarmusch movies, avoid this.
