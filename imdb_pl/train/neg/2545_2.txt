There are laughter in this movie, that's for sure. Michael Keaton is a talent and he was once funny (before he decided he was a serious actor). However, what bothers me so much in this film is how almost all characters are unlikely. In addition to the main two tracks, everyone is a jerk. I mean, those losers in small towns are as crude as you can. Just look and think, man, these losers should be unemployed. What's more, the American worker is portrayed as a lazy and ungrateful slob. I wondered if this movie was created by Japanese nationalists. Oh yeah, in the end everyone is uniting, but I just did not like the trip.
