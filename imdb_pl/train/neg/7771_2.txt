This is one weird, hackneyed movie, you get the impression that the bond company had to go to the movie, I'm not surprised that there are no credits on it that would like to be associated with this film. Acting of all involved is extremely rigid, and the plot jumps around, all this makes little sense. As I said before, it looks like the bond company had to come in because it seems that there was a lot of footage that was not filmed, and all the music was a badly matched music library (probably cheap). Very, very strange. Maybe I will buy a DVD, if it can tell me, what the hell is going on and what happened to this movie.
