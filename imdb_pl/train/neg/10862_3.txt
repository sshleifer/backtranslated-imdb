I watched 8 or 9 Herzog movies and none of them influenced me. <br /> <br /> I watched several documentaries about him. He is obviously an intelligent man with great knowledge about films and a passion for creating them, but whether it makes him a good director. Definitely not! A complete anti-talent. Can make a good documentary because of the aforementioned features, but a movie with actors? never! <br /> <br /> He can not direct or write. His scenarios are full of badly thought-out situations, and many situations / dialogues in his films are so childishly and badly done that in no sense can they be hidden behind the word "art". No way. Not to mention the awkward direction, so amateur. To say that he wants to direct and write such nonsense is a lie. <br /> <br /> I like the scene where Scheitz is arrested and Storszek is hiding in the back of the shop. WHO IS CHILDREN? <br /> <br /> He is a crook; knows what artificial intellectuals and critics want. He knows what elements he must put in the script to get their attention and praise. It does not matter the rest of the script and the messy direction. <br /> <br /> Just look at Julio Medema. If Herzog can make a movie like Medem, I can check his old films again and try to find talent in them.
