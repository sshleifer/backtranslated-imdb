The movie about the killer is surprisingly boring. <br /> <br /> Nothing happens, and even when something happens, they do not generate any emotion or interest. <br /> <br /> Acting is good with two leads, Cassetti in particular provides a great performance, combining Succo's confidence and stupidity, but the rest of the cast also does what he needs. <br /> <br /> The problem is that there is a poor writing direction and the fact that as a true story is not interesting, Succo is not a unique character, it is not interesting or exciting. <br /> <br /> These kinds of movies usually try to generate tension or empathy or indignation, and it does not generate anything but a feeling of regret that you've wasted your time watching this.
