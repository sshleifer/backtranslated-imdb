As me and my other half are great fans of the horror trash, we could not resist the movie that contained both titles, which we were delighted! However, for the 2004 film with the cover of Freddy Vs, Jason is a disgrace! The worst movie I've ever seen, but it's worth laughing if you can sit down! <br /> <br /> Acting is terrible, the effects ... well, I could do better on my camera is so bad that they only care about making makeup on the faces of zombies and lowering the neck, hands, etc. Without plot, strange memories, that do not make sense and a terrible script! <br /> <br /> "You broke my tooth! "From one vampire" you broke my cigar "was the answer of a man who looked like Uncle Jessie from Dukes crossed with Miko≈Çaj!
