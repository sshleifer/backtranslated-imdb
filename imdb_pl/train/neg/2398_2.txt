As a fan of such films as "Fire Sale," "Where's Poppa," "Airplane," I saw it because it was mentioned in the context of real comedies and satires, such as above. Well, WRONG CONCLUSIONS! <br /> <br /> Not only is not it fun, but it's annoying because it's not bad in a schlocky, nice way, but in a really bad way. It's bad. The screenplay does not contain a single funny line that rather disturbs the audience with humor. <br /> <br /> The disadvantage of Adam Arkina is probably the most annoying thing in this movie. Still, the cruelty of nature does not prevent him from being satisfied with the film and it is difficult for him not to look at the camera. This amateur without charisma fits together with continuous errors of continuity and a bang of the whole story - if you can find him. <br /> <br /> Ed McMahon - I had to think about Jay Leno, another night talk, who always refuses to call himself an actor. I saw a few films of Leno and Laurence Olivier compared to McMahon. <br/> <br /> Kenneth Mars is good, though. In several given lines. I do not care about bad comedies, so I watched and looked for quasi-jokes every 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> The movie becomes in a sense a comedy as soon as Alan Arkin takes over - he literally does: from 75 minutes to a movie that's in every scene. But that's not enough, too late. <br /> <br /> When films try to cheat you, that their lack of professionalism is the reason you should like them because they have the right intentions, remind me of students, I did not prepare for the exam. In such cases, you must be accurate and the grade must be "F". (But please do not assume that I am a teacher, this is a profession of respect between a politician and a child molester). <br /> <br /> If you're really looking for a nice horror / scifi movie that's cool to watch and contain jokes, try Bruce Campbell's "Man with the Screaming Brain." Or watch Sunshine / Core if you prefer modern loud shallow SciFi Schlock. They are equally fun, though involuntarily.
