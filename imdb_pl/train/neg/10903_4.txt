Rob Schneider is a famous comedian, which is caused by movements, facials and performances of "no people". This time is The Animal. Marvin is a loser who tries to be a hero, and one day no one answers a phone call from a man who is attacked, so Marvin must take this case and save the man attacked. But on the way to the crime scene, he crashes in a car and gets really damaged. He does not remember what is happening, and on the next ordinary day his life is not the same when he learns that he has animal instincts. Of course, we have our bitch, which our main character tries to reach, but his attempts are useless. Collen Haskell plays it. There are no negative signs. The negative character is destiny if I could use this metaphor. Marvin should learn how to become a normal person. By the way - his animal instincts help him in some situations. Schneider's performance is so-so. The film is so unreal that it becomes stupid at times, but it is one of those films, called thoughtless play, as I wrote above. So look at it in the style of monkey Rob Schneider, but it is certainly not one of the best comedies in history, not one of the best films in which Schneider appears.
