Calling it at all would be an insult to everything else. Some explanations may describe it, but still too positively. Usually, this type of rubbish is ignored, but it was so stupid that you can only despair. However, it would be true that even Americans and commercial TV stations would give this piece s ** t. But as the Germans say: Gegen die Dummheit kaempfen die Goetter selbst Vergebens!
