KING KONG VS. GODZILLA (1963, I recall that he assessed BOMB) was my introduction to the work of the cult director Honda; this one is not necessarily better? I just learned to be more tolerant of such a low price! <br /> <br /> Here we will get two Kongs for the price of one: an ugly and stupid monkey and a variation of a robot that looks even worse! The monkey creature lives on the island of Mondo (!) ?? where he is shown fighting a few other monsters and befriends three people. Of course, she falls on a blond (and bland) heroine; in fact the more intriguing is femme fatale in cahoots with the wicked crazy genius of the movie? his name was Dr. Who and had an anemic appearance and cape usually associated with a vampire !! <br /> <br /> He kidnapped King Kong and hypnotized him to retrieve Element X, which is embedded in the icy wastes of the North Pole; apparently the giant monkey is more resistant to radiation than its mechanical counterpart (and to ensure its full cooperation, which even captures three "companions")! A female agent changes her heart, helps heroes (one of whom is usually an undefined American) and is killed by the Who. Kong eventually escapes and reaches Tokyo, where he has the final game with the robot. The doctor escapes from the next chaos in his submarine? who, at the request of the Congo Frogman, is destroyed in a short time by a giant monkey.
