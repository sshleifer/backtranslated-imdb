How big a German TV station can broadcast such a mess? It's amazing how the main actors avoid any actor's talent - Even the well-known Gottfried John is behaving very poorly - especially in the scene of double murder - as amateur .......! The screen plan is very, very extensive - perhaps to fill 2 parts of the movie. Be careful not to fall asleep while watching! Of course, the set is often a blue screen, eg scenes on a ship with an unreal sea in the background ...! In the German version, sound and dubbing are very weak - probably the reason: different languages ​​of actors - but: other international productions deal with it more professionally. Advice: DO NOT watch - it's a devilish waste of time!
