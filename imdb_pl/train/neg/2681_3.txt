A very good story about a film that, if done correctly, would be quite interesting, but where the hell is the end of this movie? <br /> <br /> In fact, what is the meaning of this? <br /> <br /> Scenes are moving so fast that you feel that you are not part of the movie emotionally, and the feeling of detachment from understanding the plot. <br /> <br /> Cast performances are questionable, if not credible. <br /> <br /> Have I missed the conclusion somewhere in the movie? I think we have to wait for the continuation. <br /> <br />
