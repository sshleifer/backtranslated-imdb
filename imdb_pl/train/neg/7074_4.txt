My God, this movie is terribly boring. I'm a big fan of Gina Gershon, when I rented this movie, I was expecting the drama of Gershon's romantic and great performance. Gershon is great as always, but she is not the right actress for this role, she is too good for Rade Serbedzija. The romance between the heroes of Gershon and Serbedzija is too unconvincing. I absolutely hated the character of Serbedziji (the organizer of the wonman), he is not charming in the film. How Dr. Lauren Graham (Gershon) is beyond my comprehension. Perhaps Sean Connery, Robert DeNiro or Harrison Ford would do a better job in this role, but they probably do not have such a European appearance. In any case, I was so bored of drinking a movie. If you're looking for a good Giny Gershon movie, check out Bound, her best movie so far. If you're looking for a romantic movie about a younger woman and an older man, try Harrison Ford or Sean Connery. Gina Gershon is so underestimated, and she deserves better chances than this, I wish her to make a better choice in the future.
