THE DECOY is one of those independent productions created by obvious novices, but it does not have all the usual flaws that drown most of these films. He has a specific story, he has the right acting, the photography is very good, the hero and the bad guy are powerful people, and the background music is not exaggerated. This is a new version of the DVD, so people will be looking for it, is it worth it? I do not know where all the dozens come from, because there is no way that this movie would be so good - even if you are the mother of a filmmaker. <br /> <br /> The last movie we watched in the theater was the nightmare of J K Rawlings, the beloved and excellent book Order of the Phoenix. Comparing DECOY with PHOENIX, beware that PHOENIX (as Warners wrote) had no history, certainly the director did not allow any game, the photo was horrible, and the wall sound was just a mess. I rated Phoenix as "1" because the scale does not fall below. THE DECOY is 4 times better - in every respect. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, give THE DECOY a chance. Remember that this is not "Decoy 3 - the Shootout" nor any such nonsense. This is original. If your expectations are not exaggerated by the stupid "10" results here, you can simply enjoy the movie on your own terms.
