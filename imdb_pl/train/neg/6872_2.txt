This series had pretty good stories but bad dialogue. The main character was particularly irritating. It is quite obvious why this concert was canceled, although, like most UPN programs, I never knew it even existed until it was in syndicated replays. <br /> <br /> Most of his plots seemed to be copied from other programs and movies, which led me to the conclusion that the producers did not have the original idea in their heads. <br /> <br /> I have not commented enough. You must have at least ten lines of text. The special effect was not bad at the show in 2001. <br /> <br /> The gnome was a nice character.
