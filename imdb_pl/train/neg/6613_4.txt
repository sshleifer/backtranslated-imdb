I am a big fan of Lord Ram Gopala Varma, but I could not believe that he did this movie. I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag does not approach the real Sholay. It does not leave a lasting impression on the viewer. Ram Gopal Varma does not create chemistry between characters. There is no camaraderie between Heero (Ajay Devgan) and Paradise (Prashant paradise). Almost no scenes with more than two people in the frame. The sequence outside the courtroom with the face of Amitabh Bachchan and Mohanlal is remarkable. Amitabh Bachchan should not have made this film. Ajay and Sushmita dreamed their best, but uselessly. Modulation of voice Rajpal Yadav - ineffective and rather pointless. Mohanlal gave full justice and proved that acting relies on mimicry and body language. The rest of the cast was below expectations. The comedy situation, which was adapted from the original Sholay, fell flat in this film. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma could have worked on the script, but because of the film's controversy, they failed and only for the sake of making him Aag. But there is no fire.
