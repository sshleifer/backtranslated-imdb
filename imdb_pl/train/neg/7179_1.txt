No matter how good his "message" is - this movie is a horribly transformed train - horrible action, bad camera work - I do not know why Carr agreed to try to stutter - it's bad. You watch DVD accessories, and the way the camera works, follows it - it simply soaks in - it loves to be the center of attention. He is a bad actor - he reminds me of another arrogant filmmaker - Eric Schaffer. How did Carr show this film in the city's Youth Centers and New Age churches - where damaged people seek reinforcement and attention, mumble about how the film touched them and maybe it was - but as the film itself is uncertain, predictable juicy.
