I really wanted to like this movie, but so much of it was stolen / borrowed from other jobs - some loans are painfully glaring. Review of The New York Times pointed out that their singing frog reminiscent of the one in the famous Warner Brothers cartoon ("Hello darling, hello my love", hi my ragtime gal ... "). But I challenge everyone to watch the animated film Roboty (2005) Fox / Blue Sky and not find absurd similarities in: the plot - a young inventor growing up, and one innovative corporation distributes all wonderful inventions. <br /> <br /> cityscape - Unusually similar camera angles captured very similar futuristic urban environments. <br /> <br /> ... robots ... - Robinson's household robot has a very similar robot design, and both films use something like a retro-futuristic look. <br /> <br /> All this seems to be in sharp contrast with the unpleasant Disney quote at the end, which suggests that the company is a constant innovator that never looks back (which also contradicts the entire catalog of films from the 90s, which were basically clones of each other, with a few minor fixes to the plot and ethnicity). <br /> <br /> The filmmakers seem unable to tell the story themselves, and instead constantly send objects and sounds flying in our direction, as though we do not have too much attention to anything smaller. <br /> <br /> The villain is really well designed and animated, and he has the pleasure to watch. Much of the rest of the movie seems to be connected. Some landscapes look like CGI from the mid-90s. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with the classic Mickey Mouse abbreviation. At the end of this cartoon, we remind ourselves that Disney has never been interested in innovations or a good story telling - it seems that simply getting something on the big screen is enough proof of their advantages.
