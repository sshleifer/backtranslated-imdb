I just do not get some great reasons for this episode - that Miranda is so unusual and that something so ugly is there that it will drive you crazy. Someone here has noticed that it may be the frequency of light waves or something, not ugliness. Miranda is just a moron. The episode is slow, inconsistent and too talkative. I do not quite understand why Colossus is an ambassador - why does not the Federation just leave damn Medusa? There is one part I like when Colossus speaks through Spock about the loneliness of human experience. In general, I love TOS and even in the worst case, I will always tune in. This episode, however - mmm, I would not buy it, except for the used copy below $ 3.
