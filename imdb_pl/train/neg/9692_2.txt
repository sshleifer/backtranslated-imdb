Bonjour Tristesse occupies a similar place as the "Wedding Member". that is, the possessive daughter tries to prevent the relationship between the beloved family member and the intruder. While critics love the "Wedding Member", I think that Julie Harris is a huge tramp and an adenoid, spoiled scenographer in everything she was in. is a travel journal. <br /> <br /> Film sequences are developing in this Preminger, but characters do not. For the first 30 minutes he is satisfied with the blurring of the father-daughter relationship between Seberg and Niven, enabling uncomfortable sexual readings. After entering the conflict, Seberg can not provide the required depth. Kerr takes a rank and turns the film into Endless Love. Seberg's loose narrative is like something from Strange Interlude - it's not good. I really want someone other than Niven to be in his role. He spends so much time normalizing the orthodox British behavior in all his films, he never approaches the character. <br /> <br /> In the most memorable sequence, the evening dance becomes free for everyone in the port. Bertolucci steals the whole scene for his empty "Conformist" exercise. Kerr is on board to fasten her hands and present another serious pain (like in the Black Narcissus, Night of Iguana, King and I, Heaven knows Allyson, Tea and Compassion, etc.). Really, Kerr was a terrible actress. I would like every movie with her to end in a fatal car accident, and even better, start with one. <br /> <br /> People do not like ambiguity, they should avoid it.
