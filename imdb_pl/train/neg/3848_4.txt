The film is almost funny when Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters join forces as mothers of condemned murderers. With a terrible fame after the trial, two women join and leave New York to California to open and create a dance studio and song for Shirley Temple girls. <br /> <br /> It's obvious from the outset that Reynolds made a mistake, taking Winters with him to California. Winters plays a deeply religious woman who seems more and more out of a rocker. <br /> <br /> Worse, women who live together receive dangerous phone calls. Reynolds, who puts on a blond wig, is soon adored by the wealthy father of one of her students, nicely played by Dennis Weaver. <br /> <br /> Agnes Moorehead, in one of her recent films, is briefly seen as Sister Alma, who Winters is a faithful listener. <br /> <br /> The film really belongs to Shelley Winters. It is heavy here and the heaviness seemed to make her even better. Winters has always done well in testing nerves. <br /> <br /> The ending is macabre and who can forget Winters on the piano, fighting this crazy look?
