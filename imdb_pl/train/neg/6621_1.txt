Something somewhere must have been terribly wrong at the moment the director perceived the story. The film, which was supposed to be a remake of one of the most-loved films in the cinema, is not able to provide every aspect of film making. The best artists also could not choose the tuning, which simply shows that the film itself was a serious mistake. <br /> <br /> The editing is poor. The direction is nonsense. Operation is out of this world (omg)! Characters that look frightening make people laugh at the stupidity of their dialogues and costumes. <br /> <br /> I would not watch the movie, even if someone paid me the ticket costs, and even gave me a free burger with it.
