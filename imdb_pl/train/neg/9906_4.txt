After reading the review, it became obvious that everyone had intellectualized the work. How boring. And what do you say about these good, good days and nothing like that. Of all the comments, no one expressed any emotion in this work or any other. <br /> <br /> I grew up just after the age of the couple and this cinematic jewel together with Dan'l Boone honored Saturday afternoons. It was an annual film that celebrated and filled armchairs with gabbing, whistling, farting, giggling, and monstrous creatures like me or me. At the time, it was a cinema filler. Almost as big as the Wizard of Oz. <br /> <br /> IMDb insists that every criticism contains something about the story. The problem was that it was rather a template. Here he goes. Randolph Scott (cowboy / hero) gathers friends and defeats these evil people. Bravo! <br /> <br /> All of us have discovered this story before we dipped our quarter to watch it. It was the story of every Scott, John Wayne, Roy Rogers movie ever made. If you take some time to go back and review each movie - just do not ask for a surprise. <br /> <br /> You have to remember the context of times. There was not a small TV. None for children. There was a school. It was great outside. There were toy guns. Without Cyber ​​time. And the age of the pair has just collapsed. But such films provided entertainment and filled the imagination of young passers-by. Even the girls got into it. <br /> <br /> This movie was entertainment. And he is just as thoughtless as everything he produces today. He originally had the purpose of being propaganda. But movies for children have quickly begun. <br /> <br /> Our fathers have experienced real things. And it was only ten years later that Sam Peckinpah finally spilled red patches of blood imitation in realistic and abundant quantities. Until his leadership died slowly, with great pain and pathetic. As long as the Peckinp war and the fight with weapons were not a bloodless thing. Thanks Sam. <br /> <br /> To see the movie had little or no blood, adults did not mind. I think they would not tolerate that. No guts spraying destroying the life of plants. So this movie had all the glory and no glory. Gung Ho was suitable for children. <br /> <br /> You will see that I have assigned four to this rating. Why should I do this? Well. It's a scary movie. No matter how I love it. I love this movie because it brought one of the happiest moments of my childhood. But this is not such a good movie in terms of quality. Essentially, Gung Ho has been moved to become a children's novel. <br /> <br /> Should people watch it. Of course. I'm not saying to stay away. Realistically though. The plot is simple. Characters shallow? they are schools. You can love a bad movie.
