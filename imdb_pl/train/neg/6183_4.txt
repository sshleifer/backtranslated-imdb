In 2005, George W. Bush began his second period as president of the United States; North Korea has announced the possession of nuclear weapons; Pope John Paul II died after a long illness; and Into the Blue appeared. The existence of this film is not as bad as other things that happened this year, but the movie itself was pathetic and perhaps the worst of that year. The United States has another president, there is another pope, a new Korean nuclear weapon ... and the movie Into the Blue 2: The Reef, which is better than the original ... but the same says: cutting is better than cutting the head. " This continuation is really a bad movie that really bores me and is not interested. The cast of Into the Blue 2: The Reef consists of television series actors who lack the reliability and dramatic weight, but are perfect to show their bodies. Chris Carmack (The OC), David Anders (Heroes and Alias), Laura Vandervoort (Smallville), Marsha Tomason (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) bring in empty and boring performances. I liked the previous movies of the director Stephen Herek (Critters and Bil. Especially in Ted's Excellent Adventure), but in this film he is not able to create even the minimum level of tension, emotion or entertainment. Characters from this movie are not only badly made, but they are also repulsive. the cinematography of this film is also poor and it seems that it was made by a technical team that creates promotional films for Hawaiian hotels. Into the Blue 2: The Reef is a terrible movie that is better than the original movie, but the same as nothing, as I said before. Avoid this bad movie at all costs.
