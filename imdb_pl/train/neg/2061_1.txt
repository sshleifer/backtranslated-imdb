The only movie I ever went to. It's amazing because I paid for myself and my date and I'm really cheap. But my brain was not able to withstand what had happened, especially because I could write more fun material while I was binding it and gagging it. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, this movie offends. What's worse, it's not funny. Then it was not fun and now it is not fun. What's worse, this movie marks the beginning of the end of a truly intelligent, sophisticated comedy. This youthful, really sophisticated script and ideas began in the era (which continues to this day), where cheap laughs and sexual insinuations dominate in the culture of comedy in the film. <br /> <br /> Sexual Olympics? What high school boy did not think about it? Beginning of the end.
