The ending of this film is so unreadable and dated that my whole class of movie aesthetics laughed like crazy. Now most of the rest of the movie was fine. He had some accidentally funny scenes, but he had some really good photos and edits. Yes Alderich is a great director who created, among others, FLight Of The Phoenix and Whatever Happened TO Baby Jane. The problem is not direction, action or anything technical. The film is simply destroyed in the third act. Why? Murders, twists, turns of action and characters revolve around NUCLEAR MATERIALS? What the hell was the writer burning when he invented it? The way it just goes out of nowhere, it could have been the largest Deus Ex Machina in history. For all complaints about Planet Burton monkeys, David Gale or Notorious Life I think THIS is the worst ending in history. What a job.
