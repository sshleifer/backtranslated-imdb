Craven, a cowardly movie. Director Boorman shows the burglars the rich houses of Cahill, but it turns out that the man is unfaithful to the nanny. A forensic investigator in the Cahill case is blown up in his car, but he is a rat face to face and does not look like a nice man, so it's okay. The Beits, the owner of Russborrough House, earned money using "dark" diamond digging, so it's good to rob them of priceless art and hide it in a bunker in the Wicklow Mountains. Garda kills his ferret and is involved in his murder. The moral equivalent is nauseous, Boorman is looking for a hit movie, but he has no courage to oppose the crime of a gang of generals who terrorized the area and unleash another wave of derision at Dublin. He even collaborated with the son of generals when he did. Disgusting. I am ashamed of him for his cowardice.
