I was very surprised how bad this movie was. Nice photos and beautiful landscapes can only take the movie up to now. I was hoping to repeat Hero, but it is much worse. <br /> <br /> This film is the reason why kung fu movies have gained a bad reputation. Lack of credible characters (even in the cartoon world of kung fu movies, these characters are funny), practically without plot and absurd twists. <br /> <br /> This movie is so boring and frustrating because it reminds you of trying to play with the child in the game you believe in. Every time you think your stupid battle makes sense, they make up another absurd phrase that does not make sense ("Ah ha, you think you have me with your superpowers and 10,000 plots, but I ate my vitamins intertwined with plutonium and teflon, so your radial guns are not working and I'm immune to your super powers ... just tap on the trade without infinity. PLUS one. ") Children can continue this madness because they do not really care if everyone listens because it's great playing. However, for VIEWER, and especially for adults, this long film is worse than the fight against bad gas. <br /> <br /> AHEAD SPOILERS Note to the makers of kung fu movies, (a) if you have a knife in your back it hurts, unless you're on PCP, in which case your kung fu is not strong, (b) if you repeatedly fall on the back, in which the knife is located, it will hurt more and hurt more, unless it is a false prop, (c) when you get stabbed in the heart, you will die, especially in ancient China, where there is no Kaiser Permanente around the corner, (d) kung fu fights do not last for hours, while 3 feet of snow fall, and (e) sometimes it is worth explaining your characters and their motivations. <br /> <br /> In any case, go and see Hero again, because at least she is understandable in her small world.
