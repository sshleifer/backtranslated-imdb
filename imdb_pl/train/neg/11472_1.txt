Everything in this movie was terrible. At the beginning this movie had quite a good cast and I think it is impossible to make such a great cast the biggest disaster in the genre of gangster movies. The soundtrack was similar to the very bad slap stick comedy. She had this music throughout the movie and it started to be quite annoying. <br /> <br /> PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT ATTEND AT THIS DISTRIBUTOR.
