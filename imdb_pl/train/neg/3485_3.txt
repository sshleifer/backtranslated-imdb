This movie was quite absurd. There were a few funny parts. He enters the basket of movies in my memory, where I think: "Hmm ... this movie had some funny parts, but in general, a pretty funny plot (or lack of it)." <br /> <br /> I thought it looks that Ben is trying too hard to be a funny guy. And I did not understand how he was a self-proclaimed multimillionaire and still such an idiot. In any case, I like Ben Affleck. He's doing some shit, but hey, I can forgive him. I mean, I liked Jersey Girl, I did not think Gigli was his fault, I like him in general. I think he's a bit like a kid for which I'm sorry because he just does not seem to be doing it well. <br /> <br /> My advice is: avoid this flip. It really did not develop into a functional storyline, and Catherine O'hara and Jimmy G. were not as well used as they could. They deserved something better. In general, this film is NOT in itself, it's not a Christmas story, it's NOT Christmas or any other classic. Always unforgettable.
