I liked the comment of the first reviewer much more than the movie when I saw him in the second theater in the early 80's. I was then impressed by the care for creating costumes modeled on Tenniel's drawings. But for me the cast was largely wasted, and their personalities suppressed by masks, while the direction which I consider extremely static and dark photography. The rating recorded at that time was nothing, which means "it is not worth to sit even once". <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I would also have a chance for a second look.
