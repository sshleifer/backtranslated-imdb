A neat assumption. Very unrealistic. What I learned from this movie is that driving madly out of control to go to a weekend cabin may not be the best idea. I loved how Bill comfortably jumps out of the car and rides off the hill without any damage! Unfortunately, the same can not be said about his gal. Oh, and the police never found a car or tracked the wreck owner. <br /> <br /> Many stretched scenes, including an ordinary stripper (they still have nightmares from this scene). Poor assistant and his meager, useless hand. I admit that I was intrigued by how the mysterious "thing" was behind the door, but when it appeared, I just laughed. HAHAHA!! The girl really seemed sadistic about the revival. Personally, I would really like a new body after such a terrible experience!
