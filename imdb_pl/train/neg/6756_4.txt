Devin Hamilton is probably better known as the new name in the legendary Full Moon entertainment. Unfortunately, his arrival in this independent studio took place at a time when the budget and production values ​​are the lowest for years. However, in his short career Hamilton became a creative director who manages to create innovative and original stories. Now this does not mean that his films are good, but at least they are different from the usual ones in the horror genre. <br /> <br /> In his debut "Bleed" Hamilton presents us with a creative turn of the subordinate genre. Maddy (Debbie Rochon) is a young woman who finally gets a job in her dreams. What's more, it looks like she also found a boy in Shaun (Danny Wolske), it looks like life finally smiles at Maddy after a lot of sad events. Until the party with Shaun's friends tell her that they have created a "club" in which members have to kill someone to enter. <br /> <br /> Of course, they are joking, but Maddy desperately wants to fit in, that she actually kills someone. After this event, someone starts killing the other members of the "club" one by one. Maddy needs to know what's going on, because everyone can be an assassin, including hers. <br /> <br /> Maddy is a very interesting character wonderfully played by the beautiful Debbie Rochon. This is a very interesting turn in this genre to make the main actress part of the suspects. The concept is so original and Rochon's performance is so good that it is a pity that Hamilton did not develop the whole story a little better. Sometimes the movie is quite slow and the overall feeling is one of the good ideas wasted on a bad movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is strange in the sense that all casts of women are very good, while the male cast is painfully bad. Danny Wolske is very wooden and his performance as a yuppie is quite stereotypical. Julie Strain, Brinke Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman appear in small stages and are great in their small roles. Besides, there are a lot of nudity (both male and female), and the cast is very pretty, so it's really a plus. <br /> <br /> A low budget damages the film in the effects section, as there are very few bloody scenes there and they are not really graphic (probably because they would look bad); nevertheless, considering the budget, the film looks good at least. <br /> <br /> Hamilton's latest effort, the sexploitational venture "Delta Delta Die!" is a better made and more entertaining movie. Though this one is not as bad as other better-known films, it still has a lot of disadvantages and can only be interesting to fans of Debbie Rochon or fans of independent movies without a budget. 4/10
