The proverb "Never judge a book by its cover" was invented as a warning for those who do not look under the surface. <br /> <br /> When I watched the work "King of the Ants", I immediately thought about HORROR! Secret images proudly displayed on the cover and back spoke about the dark vision, the summary promised the story of murder, betrayal and revenge. Instead, what I discovered under this surface was less interesting than what you can find under average rock. <br /> <br /> The "King of Ants" presents Chris L. McKenna as Sean Crawley, the average guy ready to make a name for himself in this world, even if it means murder. Only that Sean Crawley is someone you do not care about, I have never once felt sympathy or compassion for this character. In fact, it is unbelievable, but not as much as Daniel Baldwin (Ray Mathews), who in the uninteresting performance turns into the worst because of a completely funny dialogue, which he is forced to recite. Cast Kari Wuhrer as a pathetic widow who apparently has unconditional trust (especially in the homeless) and little to common sense, and George Wendt as Duke, which is basically a sober Norm from Wiwat, but SIGNIFICANCE! <br /> <br /> Now there are some interesting sequences of "hallucinations" in this film (source of covers), but this movie never delves into this world. He prefers to bombard you with unmotivated characters, bad dialogue and an unlikely event after an unlikely event. Oh the Horror!
