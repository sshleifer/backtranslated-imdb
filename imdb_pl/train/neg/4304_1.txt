It is an anti-Serbian propaganda film created for television. <br /> <br /> "Muslims are good; Orthodox Christian Serbs are BAD ". <br /> <br /> This is a message. <br /> <br /> Using "entertainment" to reach the propaganda message is nothing new. <br /> <br /> This movie describes it as thick. <br /> <br /> And apparently, many viewers and reviewers are doing it. <br /> <br /> I know better. <br /> <br /> The Serbs, under the command of General Draza Milhalovitch and his Chetniks, saved 500 shot down American airmen from the Germans during World War II. <br /> <br /> Churchill decided to betray Milhalovitch and put British support behind Communist Tito. Roosevelt followed in his footsteps and as a result, after the end of the war, Yugoslavia was handed over to communist Tito. <br /> <br /> And the US Milhalovitch ally has been smudged by the media since then. <br /> <br /> This film is part of the anti-Serbian propaganda campaign developed by George Soros and his International Crisis Group (ICG), culminating in the "war" in Kosovo, in which Serbia was bombed by NATO because of completely false ICG claims about "mass graves" in Kosovo filled with "victims" of nasty Serbs. The fact that there were no such mass graves, and the Albanians (Muslims) had no interest in being in Serbian Kosovo, are facts that most media do not print. <br /> <br /> I chose this movie for viewing, because the description of one sentence on the video cover looked interesting. <br /> <br /> Imagine my disgust when I discovered that I had been fooled into renting another branch of a propaganda machine aimed at Serbia. <br /> <br /> Instead of this propaganda someone should make a film about the reluctance of the Clinton administration to clear the Congress and the American nation of its complicity in supplying arms from Iran to the Muslim government in Sarajevo. <br /> <br /> I do not hold my breath waiting for such a movie.
