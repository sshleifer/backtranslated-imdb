This break with the hit of 1984. "Gremlins" is probably the biggest wreck of a film train ever made. Even in the case of the "B" class movie, all other cheap horror movies on the same platform completely outshine this movie in terms of plot, acting and goodness. <br /> <br /> It starts with an accidental old bodyguard and a younger punk bodyguard whose name does not matter. Why? Because a few minutes in the film enters the "forbidden" safe and is killed, living his fantasy of being a rock star in a cheap pub. <br /> <br /> It's just a starter on a scat filled main course. The main character, KEVIN, tries to prove that he is more than a pussy. Perhaps he is successful in the film, but he proves to the public that he is nothing but a bad actor. Kevin gets a job with an old security guard and is guided by a change in security in an abandoned studio. Yes, why bother yourself with the kit when you can just use the studio itself. Return to the movie. Kevin somehow opens a forbidden safe and releases Hobgoblins. Hobgoblins force people to experience the wildest fantasies and then kill them for some reason. Must they be returned before sunrise, or otherwise ... or what? Exactly. <br /> <br /> Other characters are the "macho" friend of Kevin, NICK, the "woman" Nick DAPHNE, whose character has nothing more than the attitude of a whore and the worthy costumes of a prostitute. She is a manipulative and "reserved" Kevin girl, AMY, whose deepest desire is probably a poorly portrayed look Cher with stockings with a pair of blue grandmothers upstairs. Do not ask me how it works. Probably the most entertaining character is KYLE. How are such groups of friends formed? Kyle is a perverted bastard who can not go an hour without self-stimulation. His hobby is to make sexual chat lines from other people's homes and most likely to smell underwear. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds when the characters search for Hobgoblins: creatures to the knees (aka Pacnys), which for some reason try to travel no farther than the boundaries of the local district. Each character finally survives his wildest fantasy, which never has anything to do with having millions of dollars ... or a movie with a big budget. <br /> <br /> WARNING RELEASE SPOILERS: A twist at the end of this movie will leave an observer wondering "What?". Hobgoblins return to the safe ... with their own free will. Perhaps they lost their patience waiting for the sunrise to wreak havoc, or maybe the writers got a writer's spasm and decided not to worry about ending. After returning to the safe, the old security guard reveals "What he learned in the army" and detonates explosives that destroy the safe, signaling the end of the evil Hobgoblins and the end of the ride by roller coaster; better suited for driving on escalators. <br /> <br /> The very disadvantage of this film is enough to pour someone out. If you plan to watch it, I recommend a few alcoholic beverages in advance to take the film seriously.
