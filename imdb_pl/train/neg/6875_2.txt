Something drawn into the erotic scenes, only to realize that it was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable pieces of the movie I have ever seen. It's a bit like a school movie project. What was Rosanna Arquette thinking? What about all those characters from this bizarre Midwest city? It is difficult to get involved. No lessons can be learned, no brilliant observations, just stiff and funny (but a lot of skin, if you're intrigued) video recorded nonsense ... What was the bisexual relationship, out of nowhere, after all heterosexual meetings. And what about this absurd dance in which everyone played their stereotypical roles? Pass this pass, like a million other miles of bad, wasted film, money that could be spent on starving children or AIDS in Africa .....
