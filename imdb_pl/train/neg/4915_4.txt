One of the previous reviewers wrote that there seems to be no basis for Love Story opinions; he loved or hated him. But it seems that there is an unusual distribution of opinions on a scale of 1 to 10. For me, this film rated 4. There are several beautiful scenes and places, and Ray Milland turns into a fantastic job as Oliver's father. But the film did not do a particularly interesting job when it comes to telling its story, and this story was not so special as to justify multiple viewing, at least not for me. I can be a little snob, but I try to avoid movies with Ryan O'Neal - I still have not seen Barry Lyndon - because most of them, but not all, are ruined by his presence. The only exception is What Up, Doc? In which its simple performance is a perfect highlight for Goofballista Barbra Streisand - and not by accident, he makes good photos in Love Story! McGraw and O'Neal have a tendency to replant rather than act. <br /> <br /> This movie is remarkable at the beginning of one great career: it was Tommy Lee Jones' first film.
