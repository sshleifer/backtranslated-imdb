I've seen this movie twice. I can not believe that Pintilie made such a fantasy movie. I am also a film / theater director and I know what I am talking about. This is no longer Romania, but I see that the events take place in the same period as the September 11 incident. No history, no story, nothing. No conclusion, no message, nothing deep, nothing hidden. Just empty images. <br /> <br /> Most Romanians do not know, this movie is intended for French viewers, not for us. They really believe that this is the reality in Romania. Also for teenagers. Pintilie should stop making movies. I really do not know if we can call it a movie, maybe a horror movie :) And we wonder why we have such a picture in Europe. It was a reality, but not anymore. A good friend from the embassy in Brithish said: "You have no idea how long Romanians were going with Ceausescu."
