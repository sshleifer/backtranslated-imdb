Hi folks, <br /> <br /> Well, this movie sucks. Think about "Love Actually" in reverse order. Nothing fits well, nothing is consistent, and certainly nothing makes you laugh. Love is rare in this film. <br /> <br /> This is a total flop. However, as indicated, there are three advantages of this distorted movie potential. <br /> <br /> A) With Jennifer Love Hewitt's celebrity bail, there will be hordes of guys who will put forward a grace to look at the tiny Hewitt with matching clothing. I'll tell you, guys ... there are some promising scenes ... but it's really weak candy. "Opportunities" are weakened here. Nevertheless, I watched the whole thing tempted by the next scene, which you know what ..... exciting! <br /> <br /> B) The ending is romantic and positive. This is opposite and "above the peak" is important ..... but for me it was still a positive point. <br /> <br /> C) Dougray Scott plays a nice, friendly guy ....... REFRESHING! THANK YOU! <br /> <br /> 2/5, not worth your $ 10. <br /> <br /> 2/3 of the way, I was convinced that Jennifer Love Hewitt becomes another softcore legend. Although I will take it back for now ..... it depends on her next movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, and her sister is stupid. Her husband is stupid ... and whatever she is, she is stupid. <br /> <br /> Next time. I can not wait for the next Love Actually from JLH!
