This movie could last 15 minutes, if not all the quarrels between the son and father. Very predictable. Both male "stars" need a good blow to the face! Would you like cheese to "whine" with it? Two giggles ... and a headache. I can understand why my mother left her hubby after 47 years ... I do not know how she survived so long! The first 5 minutes made me want to turn off the movie because I never paid $ 3.99 to watch it! The film did not swim well and was painfully long. I watched my watch hoping time flies faster ... No. The script had so many repetitions that the writer had to be able to fill the space. For positive reasons ... the scenery was pretty, the fall is my favorite season. The car, 40 Ford was also quite good. This film receives a grade D approaching F
