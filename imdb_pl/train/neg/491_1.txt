As others have noted, this film is criminally inaccurate in presenting the artist's life, and I was very annoyed and offended ... by transforming the rape into a tragic affair, by suggesting that her rapist was responsible for "awakening her talent", completely disregarding her work, the way she has transformed her into a sexual object, over and over again, you have an idea. It is also worrying that people who are not familiar with Gentileschi will see this movie and will leave with such impres- sion.
