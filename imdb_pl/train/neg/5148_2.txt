With this image is very bad, starting with a script that is both obvious and unnecessary. Courtney Cox is a comic book artist who escapes to a small desert town after being raped twice in a big city. Immediately he is attacked by a local who seems quite distasteful (Craig Sheffer), and who seems to try to imitate Mickey Rourke on the third level. D.B. Sweeny is a local cop who is said to protect and serve. Meanwhile, the script manipulates the audience when it comes to who is really a good guy? Logic flies out the window after the first ten minutes and never returns, and there are more unanswered questions than it should be. If you think "Blue Desert" can be saved by the magnificent Philip Baker Hall, you will be disappointed. Its part is insignificant, as is the whole movie. - MERK
