This movie became extremely stupid when things started to happen. I do not care about any of the characters; Susan Walters was so annoying, and the main actor (forget his name) also hurt me. I do not remember how it ended and so on, but the whole idea of ​​aliens who have human bodies and everything just seemed stupid in this movie, everything went wrong. My dad told me it was a stupid movie ... I should have listened to him.
