I have read all comments on this video. I am a great admirer of the Dalai Lama <br /> <br />. As such, I read the book on which this <br /> <br /> movie was based. The film is an ugly and degrading fiction of the truth. I do not criticize it for changing <br /> <br /> small details or events for dramatic purposes; <br /> <br /> is not a document. But the script CHANGES impact, reaction, <br /> <br /> realities and changes in EVERY main character. This changes the real relationship between Harraj and the young Dalai Lama very much. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> From absurd rivalry for Tibetan (which humiliates the culture of Tibet) to the gift of Harry, <br /> <br /> Harrara changes heart, everything in this film is false - with the exception of <br /> <br /> for an amazing photo. I understand that arrows <br /> <br /> Potali (palace) were smuggled from Tibet. However, <br /> <br /> changing the real story about the relationship between two people, <br /> <br /> one of them very important for this world, in order to build <br /> <br /> the movie star is sad
