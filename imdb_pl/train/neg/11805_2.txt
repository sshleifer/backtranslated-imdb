Look at the original with the same title from 1944! It's just for the TV movie it's just awful! Although it uses (almost as far as I know) almost the same dialog, it just does not work! Is it acting, poor directing? OK, so it's made for TV, but why watch a bad copy when you can get a great original? Especially that you will be spoiled for the story and you will not like the original as if you were watching it! <br /> <br /> There are a few things that differ from the original (it is shorter at once), but all are for worse! Actors playing parts here simply do not match the bill! You just do not believe them and who can include the performance of Edward G. Robinson from the original? If you want, look at it after seeing the original and even then you will be very brave if you watch it! It's almost sacrilege!
