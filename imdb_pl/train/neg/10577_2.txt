Some filmmakers who take part in this series have made some really great movies, but they certainly have not shown much of the skills in this series. Especially writing. OK, the first season was a bit better, but the new episodes they create simply stink. I am a huge fan of horror and in my opinion the vast majority of these episodes are total rubbish. Nothing new or really interesting. Few of them are visually creative. It's just typical fabricated Hollywood nonsense, uninteresting, childish, poorly conceived, and in some cases simple. Like Tales from the Crypt, the only good thing in this series is great nudity! The other is that this series is blowing heavily. Sometimes I get the impression that they have rented a group of eighth peers to write episodes. Maybe it was.
