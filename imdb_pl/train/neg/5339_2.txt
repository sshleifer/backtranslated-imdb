OK, so I'm like most people, give me free tickets and see most things now, when multiplex cinemas are so good (I remember the old monorail cinema "fleas" and I'm a healthy side 40). In England this movie was released as "Liar", this is a dog. This is the total loss of a good celluloid. 4/10 for a photograph and only a set.
