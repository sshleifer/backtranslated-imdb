It's funny when you stop thinking about it: fans of a frightening movie tend to have a deep and lasting feeling for those who scared their daylight. THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE can give us nightmares, but who of us (the Faithful) did not feel the real prick of love for Gunnar Hansen in BRUTAL MASSACRE - or Ken Foree, forever and always the emphatic hero of the original WILD DEATH? His episode in the remake made me want to get up and cheer (just like Tom Savini's cameo); I am not joking. And Brian Halloran and ... Well, you have my drift (if not, just stand with the wind ...). Here are some of Heroes of Horror. To see that many of them collected in one film are almost unheard of (at least to the point, to my knowledge). If only the writer (s) could do such a monumental task. Maybe someone else, somewhere along the line, will try again. Until this is another effort in half (eg BROTHERHOOD OF BLOOD).
