THE BROKEN is part of After Dark Horrorfest III. It is not tempting or filled with blood. Lots of broken glass and mirrors in this sharp thriller from France and screenwriter / director Sean Ellis. Successful radiologist Gina McVay (Lena Headly) combines a strange world because her life seems to be out of control. During the birthday party of his father (Richard Jenkins), the guests are stunned when the mirror breaks on the floor for no apparent reason. Things become really strange when it is a witness to a woman who is a spitting image as she rides a London street in a car identical to her own. Gina sneaks into the apartment of her doppelg√§nger and finds a photo of herself with her father. Departs and participates in a collision. Then, mysteriously her boyfriend is not the same; to be an exact family and friends is not easy to trust her. Is Gina next to her? Is she in a parallel world? Her nightmares are becoming more frightening ... are they broken? <br /> <br /> Kudos, if you can figure it out ... it will not be easy. Editing could not be tightened up. Lighting is doubtful. Other players: Melvil Poupard, William Armstrong, Michelle Duncan and Ulrich Thomsen.
