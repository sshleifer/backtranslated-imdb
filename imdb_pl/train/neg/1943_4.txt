What a job! It started with an intriguing mystery and interesting characters. I must admit that he was moving at the speed of a snail, but I was still kept and watched. <br /> <br /> David Morrissey is always a good value, and Suranne Jones was a good host. The Muslim aspects were very interesting. We have been deceived by possible terrorist connections. <br /> <br /> But then the Morrissey character died and all the air left the balloon. The last episode was boring, boring, boring. The whole turned out to be a very small beer, and the d√©nouement was incredibly weak. <br /> <br /> Five hours of my life for this? My advice: watch the dry paint instead.
