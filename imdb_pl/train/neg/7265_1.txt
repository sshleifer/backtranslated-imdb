That's what I saw at the Chicago Film Festival - avoid it at all costs, unless you have trouble sleeping. It is a film full of grudges - it opens with a small quote from "Hiroshima mon amour" and from there everything is lowered. Working with the camera - imagine a child trying to imitate Wong Kar Wai. Feature line - Smokey Robinson and the Miracles "The love that I saw in You Was Just a Mirage" expanded from 3 minutes to over 2 hours, but it was full of repetitions. For painful pain, this film is on the benches in the Methodist church, which my parent drew me into when I was a child. I want to receive over 2 hours of my life. The promoter Julian Hernandez preceded the commentary that the film is "controversial" - this only applies to the narcotic effect of the film.
