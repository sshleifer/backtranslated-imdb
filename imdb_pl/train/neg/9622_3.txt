When I saw that this movie is being shown on TV, I could not wait. I grew up in the 80's and like everyone who grew up in those days, I saw a movie of teenagers and summer camps from the 80's. So I could not wait to see this movie that completely impersonates this movie genre. What a disappointment !! The film was nothing but a few really bad jokes and gags, almost no conspiracy and no content. And the filmmakers try dark humor completely failed - some of these so-called jokes were nothing but cruel and abusive. The only good thing about this film was the dressing room, music and acting. It was nice to go on a nostalgic trip and see all the summer costumes from the 80s and the same applies to music. And the acting was at the highest level: almost all the best Hollywood comedians were present. It is a pity they did not have better material for work.
