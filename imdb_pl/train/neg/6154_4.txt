Portly, a nice guy falls in love with a juicy blonde; she likes him too, but not for the reasons you think. The little black comedy by writer Pat Profta is characterized by very good performances by Joe Alaskey and Donna Dixon, but he has no lasting influence. It's just a quick effort, directed by Norman Bates himself, Anthony Perkins. Even at the B comedy level, a somewhat similar "Eating Raoul" is better. There is definitely a fun setting here; unfortunately, the picture has nowhere to go in the second act. An interesting attempt, but it does not work. <br /> <br /> ** from ****
