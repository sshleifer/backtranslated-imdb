Without a doubt one of the most embarrassing productions of the '70s, GAOTS really seems REALLY to want to be something important. The tragic truth is that it is so worthless in every level that you can not help laughing. Reaching desperately for the earthly elements of Ingmar Bergman's films, he follows the urban couple in the wilderness ... they are walking along a shady path, while they are defeated like U.C. Berkeley coffee clatch. Almost every line of the tarradiddle dialog provided here is noisy ("I feel that life itself consists of as many small compartments as the grenade ... but is it so beautiful?") After what seems to be eternity absolutely nothing happens (well ... OK ... we are treated like nudity and a soft summer erotic scene), there is finally a VERY anti-climatizing confrontation with a couple of vet veterinarians who make a stage of nature and perform pretty strict ballads with an acoustic guitar. <br /> <br /> There is nothing interesting or interesting in this entire film. I thought the picture of Larry Buchanan "Strawberries need rain" was a weak example of Bergman's homage. The "Golden Apples" are just as bad, but the incessant accidental vocabulary he represents makes it terribly memorable. 1/10
