Last night I saw "Descent" at a film festival in Stockholm and it was one big disappointment. Disappointment, because the plot was potentially powerful, the prospect of seeing Rosario Dawson in a smaller intimate movie was exciting, and being a fan (pervy, I'm not!) Films "rape / revenge" of the 70s, I was unnecessary to say very interesting to check this movie . My conclusion: let's stick to the classics! Yes, the story has potential, but the dialogues are flat, the actors unconvincing. Even Dawson is empty. Some would say that this is the correct picture of the university world in the US, that the heroes' emptiness serves the purpose and all jazz, but only makes the whole movie irrelevant. Like the scene in which Dawson is raped: he is seriously lacking in intensity! I did not expect anything like "irreversible", but should not we feel compassion for her? I did not do it. Not for a minute it was so lame ;-) And I read that the photography was impressive. Well, it's really good, but there's nothing breakthrough. I have to admit that the show at the festival was not so good, so maybe I missed something, but at the end of the movie I could not help thinking: "I feel that I am watching" Inferno "Argento again. lol. More importantly, the first scene in the club is beautifully made and everything, but I had the bitter impression of watching a longer and more boring version of the scene in a dirty bar near the Canadian-Canadian border in Lynch's "Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Ja ... raw red and blue lighting, heavy bass music, general lewd / decadent atmosphere ... No, I just could not enter the movie. Detriment.
