I am very disappointed. This movie made me feel off of my time and mental energy. This is the next quintessence of Woody Allen's film: neurotic Manhattan from a higher class debates whether they cheat their spouses. Woody, I've seen these characters, I've seen the story ten times. Where did your creativity go? You must open your eyes and look around. The world has changed dramatically since Annie Hall - and you have to change with it. <br /> <br /> There are much more interesting and fun scenarios to which you can apply your anger and neuroticism - why not try instead of reworking the same old slop over and over. <br /> <br /> When I hear that Woody Allen has a new project, he does not do anything to me - because now I have come to expect his old readiness: a couple who are getting tired and end up cheating. Depressing and old, same old. <br /> <br /> If Woody wants to regain his fans, he must understand that our sense of humor and intelligence must be stimulated - not offended.
