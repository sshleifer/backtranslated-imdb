Oh, that was the most painful experience in my life. I could even finish what is happening with Nick. The best thing for Nick's teenager is Drake and Josh, and it's going to blow up soon. Songs for children are a bit annoying, just like children. My younger sister wanted to watch the program because she usually likes everything that appears on Disney or nickname, but after watching this program she said "one of the worst shows I've ever seen so boring". My little brother actually fell asleep, I'm jealous of him. In short, if your three-year-old child with no brain activity, you'll like this program, change the channel now.
