Do not waste time watching this! Unless you want to study him for all the bad things you should not do to make a good movie. I'm not a person who usually reviews a movie, but this one is personal. I wasted a precious time that they can not give back. I feel obliged to write this report to warn others not to waste time watching this shit. If it was a student project, I would have to say that it is not bad, but only for the first 15 minutes ... after that it becomes annoying. screaming, bad sound, bad movie (a good person with the camera could make it much better). and yes, what about the Blair-Witch effect? no budget? I was hoping it would be better, but it is not. How the hell deserves 4? 2 is more fair, but 1 for wasting time! I told my room.
