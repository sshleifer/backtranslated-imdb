I read the book and the book was fascinating. <br /> <br /> This film, its director, script and acting were completely unbearable. I cringed to the lack of a script that would not be able to follow a novel, a novel that has all the action, simplicity and courage to illustrate the temptation of a great story based on facts. <br /> <br /> I can see why this movie has not been made available to the public in most cities. I would never recommend this movie to anyone I know. <br /> <br /> Just one of the worst adaptations I've seen has turned into a story less exploring the sky on earth. <br /> <br /> The photos were indeed the only highlight. But how can it go wrong when they were filmed in a beautiful country like Peru. <br /> <br /> For potential viewers, do not waste time or energy on this flop.
