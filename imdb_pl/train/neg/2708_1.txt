This film is masked as a social comment, while in reality it is just as ridiculous as racism itself, which it condemns. Establishment of this film: African-American = Strong ... each other race = poor. The worst thing is that Rapaport pulls out a weapon from Omar Epps and a Jew. The Jew, in a stereotypical way, falls apart in fear and begins to beg for life ... but the big, strong, defiant Omar Epps stands strong without fear. We also condemn every member of the fraternity as an arrogant drunkard or rapist. The raped white girl obviously begins to consider a lesbian, because she is simply a weak white girl. When a brave white guy is rejected by members of the fraternity, he must of course fall into the skinheads who are amazing cowards; especially a big muscular guy who is quickly beaten by strong black men. Wait ... BUSTA RHYMES GETS A STAR TWO HIS SIZE ??? Yes, right. <br /> <br /> Of course, black men NEVER reject their people, and Omar Epps easily introduces them. The scenes in which the Ice Cube threatens his white roommates and keep them in balance are simply stupid - of course he is dominant, while his weak white roommates are afraid of him and eventually move out. This movie was just awful, and the ending made me really laugh. Too long a release between Epps and Banks becomes funny because of the faces they create - it's like watching my nephews and cousins ​​make faces (and everyone is below 5). Do yourself a favor and skip this nonsense.
