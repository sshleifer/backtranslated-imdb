What can I say, this is a brilliant movie that should have won an Oscar. The copy should be kept in a safe vault for posterity. You should be required to watch for all high school students around the world. Sam Mraovich is a genius, perhaps the most genial writer / director / producer / chef / guardian / walmart, whom he has ever given the cinema world his art. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Every millisecond of Ben and Arthur was so breathtaking! And Mraovich as Arthur, wow, he's so attractive that I'm surprised he did not go to Mr. Universe. I could not resist during the nude scene. I borrowed this movie for my brother and called me on the phone, saying that Arthur's naked place turned him into a gay. I absolutely support this movie, of course, and it's beautifully made lessons with tolerance. Why did I burn the church yesterday and write "for Sam and Arthur" in his smoldering ashes. <br /> <br /> Photos were the best thing in this movie. When the Fed-Ex plane got to the skies among the palm trees in Vermont, I cried! I never even knew they had palm trees in Vermont or that people could travel Fed-Ex airplanes before this movie. It opened my eyes to new possibilities. This movie inspired me to enroll in the school of writing scripts by Sam Mraovich, acting, directing, composing, casting, producing, designing production and real estate. I just want to say: "Thank you, Mr. Mraovich. Thank you for bringing this creature to the world.
