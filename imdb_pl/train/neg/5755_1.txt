I saw this movie also during the screening at the High Falls Film Festival in New York and I have to say that I consider it a complete and terrible bore. Although it was fun in some places, the only real laugh was that there seemed to be a real conspiracy to speak about, and acting in some places was awful and wooden, especially the "lovely lady" and the voice of the narrator (who never I heard) had a lot to be desired. J.C.Mac was, as I felt, the redeeming feature of this film, real action and granularity and (except cast) the only real acting game. I'm sure that thanks to the next cast and closer control over the direction, it could have been a decent movie. Hopefully, it will not be sent in the general edition or if you really want a copy, look into the bargain basket in Lidl.
