I must admit that Over Her Dead Body was not as bad as I expected, my mother wanted to see it, so I rented it. I thought I would just go ahead and see the terror in front of me, but in reality it was not that bad. I just expected this frightening movie, but it seems that the writers had nothing wrong, but the cast of Eva Longoria (Parker, I'm sorry) seems a bit weaned from the movie. I think it can be a little better without it, only it annoys me. But Paul Rudd and Lake Bell had a decent chemistry that made the film somewhat nice. But you have to admit that this movie did not make sense, it was one of those quick payouts for the actors. The film could be more fun if someone really paid attention to it and had a better cast. <br /> <br /> Henry just lost the bride to stay, Kate, who was killed by an ice sculpture on her wedding day. But when his sister takes him into the psyche, Ashley, Henry falls in love with her, but Kate haunts her from behind the grave. Kate is jealous and does not want Henry to go so fast, and she will make sure Ashley does not catch him, torturing her day and night with his vagrants. <br /> Over Her Dead Body is a good movie, I'm not sure if it's worth the money, but I would give you a rental if you want to see it or you're curious. Eva Longoria simply does not have enough power for the movie to work, without resentment for those who love her, just belongs to the small screen on the silver screen. Not to mention Ashley's character, it seems that she is still not very nice with everything she is pulling, or with her "gay" friend, Dan, just again, not very nice. Only with some overwork and proper attention, this movie could be better, but instead we get the average predictable romantic comedy that will go away with an empty feeling. <br /> <br /> 4/10
