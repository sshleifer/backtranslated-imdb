It's a disappointment when I saw this DVD after all these years. For me, the main problem is an uneven scenario. <br /> <br /> While some of them are witty and fashionable, a lot of them are boring, unhappy and dead. Many gags are just sitting there, they lack the spark and energy. <br /> <br /> The cast of Mae West and Rachel Welch are doing well. Roger Herren shines in the role of Rusty (it's a pity he did not make more films). But there's too much John Huston for my money, and poor Rex Reed has no chance to fight. His character seems to be degraded to skimp off the beaten track, wondering what he's doing in this movie. The original Vidal has provided a lot of potential that has been wasted. Even the "classic" movie clips did not do much. In summary, this is a subordinate effort and it is unlikely that it will become much better over time.
