Before I go any further, I have to admit that I am a big fan of Bon Jovi. In fact, that's what drew me to the DVD case. I would probably buy it and be such a big fan of horror movies and I really enjoyed the first vampire title. <br /> <br /> But it's not half as good. Even Jon could not save this movie for me. My main problem would be that it is simply not terrifying. In addition to the character of Jon, Derek Bliss, none of the other characters is impressed, and do not worry about whether they will die or not, especially an annoying vampire / drug addict. A female vampire is simply not terrifying or sexy. Rather, it looks like a 14-year-old anorexic, no wonder he wants blood so much. Another big problem is that everything is simply "too bright". There is no atmosphere or fear. I know that the first vampires settled in New Mexico were not exactly the twilight zone in terms of creep, but still there was a dark and bad feeling when it was necessary. This movie does not have such tension. <br /> <br /> History is basically the same as before. The vampire wants the Berzier cross to walk in daylight. However, the story has less cool pieces this time. There is nothing strange in the fact that it is the master of the whole master - the original vampire, as in the first movie. You really do not care who or what it is. There is no army of champions. Instead, he hides in some old ruin that looks more like a Disneyland attraction, then a terrifying temple. <br /> <br /> So you have it really. No fear, no atmosphere, no interesting history. A real profession for me personally.
