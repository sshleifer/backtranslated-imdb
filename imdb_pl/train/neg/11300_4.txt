First watched on 5/27/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir - Harold Young): The third universal mummy movie is more or less the same as the first two when it comes to the final result from the perspective of the viewer. The story is similar and the results are noise. This time the location of the story is USA, because the new follower of an Egyptian priest sends a mummy to our country in the hope that it can revive him to kill the descendants of those who opened the original tomb. This time the mummy is played by Lon Chaney (which does not make a big difference, because it is not really asked for much action for this character). The new priest becomes the guardian of the morgue in the city and sends the mummy to do his dirty deeds after feeding him with tanna leaf juice. Again, the girl stands in the way, because the priest falls on one of the fianc√©'s descendants and wants her, yes - to be immortal with him (have we not heard this before?). The plan is of course thwarted when the city residents chase a mummy with torches (similar to Frankenstein's monster), and burning the creature ends the story ... how to get a sequel ?? I think you'll find out about the next series? or not.....
