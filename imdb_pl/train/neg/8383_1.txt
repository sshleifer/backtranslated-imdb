...Always. This is the bottom. I am not joking. The theater should have some warning. "Give up all hope that you come in here" would fit. <br /> <br /> I have no words to accurately describe the hell that this movie is. His devastating stupidity does not even play. This movie is definitely directed at some of the slower turtles in the sandbox. The story was grossly stolen from the 10-minute Bugs Bunny cartoon, and then stretched out like Mr. Fantastic for 90 painful minutes. <br /> <br /> I remember when Wayans were funny. I think that Hollywood's pressure on the production of products is the blame for the pile, which is being released at a steady pace. I am sad and offended that they think that we are stupid enough to enjoy 90 minutes of ball jokes with a thin story based on the cartoon. <br /> <br /> I did not like almost everything in this movie. I will not ruin anything, but the child is actually a dwarf with the face of Marlon Wayans on the body of a dwarf. What I liked was the ending. Not the resolution of the film, but the actual end in which we all woke up and left. <br /> <br /> I gave this film one star, but clearly deserves less. I do not think that the six minutes they spent writing the script are worth the stars. He deserves it on Razzie and I pray to God that he will understand it. <br /> <br /> When people will learn; if you stop paying to see this idiocy, they will stop tearing it. Seppuku is a reasonable alternative to this movie. Avoid it at all costs. You have been warned.
