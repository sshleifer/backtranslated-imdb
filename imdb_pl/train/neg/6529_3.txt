This film is both funny and painful. "Cinemagic" almost gave me an attack. Despite what they imply, "Cinemagic" is not an innovative technical procedure. He was "developed" as a result of an accident and used it because he hid the fact that their "monsters" looked so stupid. I do not think it's a coincidence that the scriptwriter is Sid "Pink". <br /> <br /> This movie is good for laughter if you're really looking for a movie done in 9 days for $ 200,000. That's funny; at least I can say that. Nietoperz / rat / spider is the highlight.
