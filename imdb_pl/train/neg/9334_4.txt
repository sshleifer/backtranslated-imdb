A performance in Mexico, about a hit man (Scott Glenn), who after a hit plays with an American writer and his Mexican girlfriend. Is he paying them to take him to the border? but everything is out of control. <br /> <br /> It starts well, but it struggles quickly and dies. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> A possible twist relationship is misconfigured and it's hard to believe.
