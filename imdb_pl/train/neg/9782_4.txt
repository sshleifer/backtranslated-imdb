This movie had such a promise !! What a great idea, a weaker paintball team struggling for recognition and personal glory, only to lose speed due to bad dialogue, poor editing and a half-written story. The heroes were interesting at first, but they lost a pair half way to become one-dimensional people spitting out tired one-liners. <br /> <br /> Maybe if they spent a bit more time talking and dialogue, it was a great movie, instead of almost reflective effort.
