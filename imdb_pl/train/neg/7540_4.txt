The Wicker Man with Nicolas Cage is not a good movie, but I can not really say I regret it. I could talk about the negative aspects of the movie, such as terrible acting and long scenes in which Cage is looking for a girl, hallucinating, followed by another hallucination, followed by a sequence of dreams - hallucinations, etc., but simply not worth thinking about when it comes to such a movie. Instead, we have five reasons why YOU SHOULD watch The Wicker Man, although it's bad: <br /> <br /> 5. It's hard to deny that it has some really scary ideas in it, the only problem is its tacky, involuntarily funny implementation. If it's nothing else, it's a movie that can inspire you to watch the original 1973 movie, and even read the short story it's based on. <br /> <br /> 4. For a cheap horror movie / thriller it is really aesthetic. It is quite obvious that it was filmed on the spot, instead of using a green screen or complex sets, so we can see a very wonderful scenery. There are also many nicely composed shots. This is a very good looking movie. <br /> <br /> 3. Nicolas Cage is not an actor but a force of nature. Regardless of whether you are a fan or not, it seems that it is impossible for Cage to play a "normal guy". He always has some eccentricity or nervousness that he brings to the characters he plays, and personally I am always fascinated by watching him in every film. Regardless of whether Nicolas Cage is great or scary, he always brings his unique energy to the game and never gets tired of watching. He's awful at The Wicker Man, but in the most magnificent way. <br /> <br /> 2. Probably a student could write a hellish article about this film because it seems to be the strongest anti-feminist film ever made. "See?" you can write: "this happens when women can run a society!" In addition, the similarities between the society of "Summersisle" and the colony of bees are quite interesting and noteworthy. <br /> <br /> 1. If you're reading this, there's probably a good chance you've seen a YouTube video that has become very popular: a collection of 'lights' from the movie, including Cage running in a bear suit and of course the infamous' AAGHH !! THE BEES !! MY EYES !!! "line. These scenes are fun from the context and are still quite fun when watching them in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I bought a used DVD in Blockbuster for about $ 5 ... when you work out, it's around the dollar for the reason. This is quite a good deal. <br /> <br /> NOTE: The unrated version of the movie is the best to watch and it is better to watch the cinema version only for its small amount added on the epilogue in which the episode of James Franco.
