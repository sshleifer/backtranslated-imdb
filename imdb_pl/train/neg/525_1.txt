I looked through the other comments and was very amused when I realized that only people who actually worked on the film commented. I mean, I hate to say bad things about amateur production, but if you make a bad movie and want to comment on it, calm it down a bit. "Groundbreaking" is a bit over the top. This is a college production in Boston that does not even reach the level of most amateur student films. This would be expected from a group of children. Stupid action movie without much creativity. It's quite fun if you want to play with it. This is not something you'll ever see unless you're a student at Emerson College.
