Based on the personal experience of director John Singleton at the University of Southern California, he has a higher education. Film focusing on racial politics that takes place in modern universities. <br /> <br /> There are three main characters on which the film bases its story: Malik Williams, a carefree low sportsman, an African American man. Kristin Conner, protected white soft girl and Remy, uncomplicated, unrelated white man. All three are mastered by the sudden reality that college life is not as good as it is advertised, because all three are disappointed, being unprepared (Malik), being naÃ¯ve (Kristin) and being unwanted (Remy). > <br /> One good thing about the movie is that it shows that modern American universities are simply higher schools. Universities are not places where character can be built, potential can be developed or personal development can be increased, but these are institutions that gather different types of students in a universal atmosphere. This is an experience that is usually built with the thought of defeating the majority of students. It would be good if the film would build a story about this parody, not racial politics. <br /> <br /> But no, and there the movies are falling apart. It seems that Singleton had quite a bad experience in Southern California. Thanks to this film, it allows everything to spin. There is no need to fight in the bush. Singleton allows heroes and villains of this piece to be easily visible. <br /> <br /> The black characters in the film are seen here as heroes, while all white people in the film are seen as villains, except for Kristin, who was raped by another white student. <br /> <br /> Who can understand the inconsistencies of this movie? Black gang members who come to the aid of a white girl after he shows them who raped her? The ease that black gang members have at a university, while a bunch of leather heads meet in a dark, small bedroom, planning violence? <br /> <br /> The performances of Omar Epps (Malika) and Kristy Swanson (Kristin) are disappointing. They seem to be the third option for the roles they played in this film (Tupac Shakur and Drew Barrymore were to play Malik and Kristina, but they were unavailable). O'Shea Jackson aka Ice Cube, Busta Rhymes and Regina King are irritating their roles. And Laurence Fishburne was pitifully mistaken here as a professor of history. Only Michael Rappaport did well in this film and he did it, given that his character, the three main characters, has changed the most in the film. <br /> <br /> John Singleton wanted to address the issue of race and inequality in American student life with this film. And he did it very badly. It was like killing a fly with a rifle. Life is much more complex than it seems, and people are similar and should know about it. Higher learning proves that he did not understand it at all. Watching the movie, and then and now, only confused, disappointed and enraged the same audience with whom he would like to talk. Not to mention that he will not entertain them in the slightest.
