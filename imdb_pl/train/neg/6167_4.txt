Like most people, I was filmed to buy this movie because I took pictures of the powerful Bolo Yeung plastered in the whole box, and the premise (from the above photos and the title of the movie) that this movie is about the East Beast kicking the ass for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> However, to my disappointment, Chinese Hercules is for Bolo Yeung what No Retreat No Surrender was Jean Claude Van Damme, and Fearless Tiger had ... erm, Bolo Yeung - the maximum exposure in the field of video, minimum real screen time! Well! <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple, but it was well done - a calm kung fu fighter (played by Chen Hui Min) accidentally kills a man and promises he will never fight again. Then he escapes to work as a worker on the pier, where he impresses his colleagues with the heavy efficiency of lifting the bag, which makes him suspect that he is a powerful warrior (he does not quite know how it works, but it does not matter). Meanwhile, the corrupt head of the pier is doing business with gangsters, giving them the exclusive opportunity to use the pier. As a result, the workers are thrown in the ear and forced to live on the beach, where they unite against their boss, the boss of the gangster and his powerful follower Bolo Yeung. <br /> <br /> When the movie was quite watched (mainly by waiting for another look at Bolo), I had some problems with it - firstly, bad dubbing, but of course it's old in old kung fu movies. But also the movie had a tendency to drag between different battle scenes. And when it comes to the battle scenes themselves, I discovered that they are too long, badly choreographed (apparently by Jackie Chan!), Wrongly shot and sometimes performed by people who do not seem to have any martial arts skills .... in fact most of the fights in this movie it was not "fights" at all, only people were beaten without any resistance! <br /> <br /> Finally the hero - played by Chen Hui min. I have never seen any other movies with this guy, but I have not supported him at any time. Not only did he look rude and on the verge of tears all the time, but I thought he insisted that he should not fight with irritation! I understood his reasoning, but he could save many people a lot of pain if he did it earlier, which we all knew he would eventually do, and fight! The greater mystery was that this whole community of people bound their hopes with a guy with whom they had never seen a fight! <br /> <br /> The real great thing about this movie was Bolo Yeung's presence. Not only is it as huge and brutal as always, it has some great, fun lines and gives the rest of the cast a master class on the subject of the fight on film. The guy exudes the presence of the screen and you can easily see how he became a star. The guy scares me, but I'm sure I was not the only person who watched the movie that Bole supported for the whole fight! <br /> <br /> In conclusion, below the average kung-fu movie he raised some huge cuts because of you-know-who. I have never met a person who did not consider Bolo Yeung to be great. Man is a legend !!
