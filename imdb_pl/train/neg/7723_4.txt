Well, I did not even like this movie because of its iconic values. It is an action movie directed by the director of "Commando", which is too lame and stupid to consider it a good B movie with enough entertainment value. <br /> <br /> This is the 90's film, but above all the film should resemble an action movie from the 80's, when this type of B films were always high. These films always came out and never paid attention to their history or acting. It was about blowing up, great heroes of muscles and bullets flying around. This movie contains all of these components, but I did not like watching the movie as much as I like watching similar films. It's hard to say why, because history and acting are just as bad as any other genre from the same era. <br /> <br /> Probably because the movie is often far too stupid. All these types of movies have their own stupid moments, but this movie is just filled. Fights, Dolph Lundgren are running shirtless, characters, history. All this is not very good, because it is often too bad for words. History sometimes does not even make sense, or even the main storyline of the whole movie? His story is really everywhere, and it seems that it was written only to create a movie with combat sequences, weapon fights and the like. And these sequences are not very good to watch. Moments are too short and quite disappointing to watch them really, from the man who brought us "Commando". <br /> <br /> It's Dolph Lundgren, in which he can play the action hero star, he copies his butt with seeming relative ease, he knows how to handle weapons and other weapons and of course he gets a girl played by Tia Carrere. It also brings us one of the worst sequences in the history of action movies, and definitely one of the worst sex sequences I've seen in every movie. Both are simply too bad for words and simply very poorly connected. <br /> <br /> None of the characters really work. Good guys are cops, but they never behave like them. They simply kill themselves without liability to anyone and are not particularly interested in arresting or informing anyone of their discoveries. Even when they find out that a large Japanese criminal syndicate is trying to take over LA streets. and the brewery acts as a cover for a drug factory and large-scale drug trafficking. And just think for a moment, what is the general purpose of Brandon Lee in the movie? The movie could easily be without him and the girl. <br /> <br /> Too stupid, lame and simplistic and simply not very entertaining. <br /> <br /> 4/10
