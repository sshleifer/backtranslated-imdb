OK, this movie had a terrible premise. Be serious according to the film they just survived during the apocalyptic war, but they have the money to buy big robots and put them against each other. Each country decides instead of investing in the reconstruction of their country, preferring to fight against robots that no one could afford. Here's a better idea, let's rely on our most inept resources, jockeys to fight in our battles. <br /> <br /> Everyone says what about the director and what about him. He makes a good movie, he makes a bad movie. There is no reason to give the film some recognition only because of the director, maybe he was asleep? I really liked this movie because it was so tacky and funny that I had to laugh. Actually, I had fun watching this, except for a cowboy who turns out to be a killer (trust me, no one will see this guy as a killer, so it's a surprise, however lame). and so in the jungle. I was sad to see that Mst3k did not do it. I do, however, give a two-star rating, because nothing can be as bad as "manos at the hands of fate." <br /> <br /> The budget also does not matter, I've seen a lot of sensible movies that have nothing for budgets like dice. The plot was not even credible and I saw better acting in school performances. Unexpectedly, they could afford eleven years from every middle school game. <br /> <br /> In any case, pick up this nice movie to watch.
