... That would be the worst movie I've ever seen. Hmmm, OK, maybe he's connected to Boogeyman. Horrible, really terrible. <br /> <br /> I had low expectations and I could not meet them! I honestly can not think of one good thing. so here's the worst points ... <br /> <br /> 1. ACTION 2. THE PLOT 3. THE CGI (Xbox 360 has better graphics ... seriously) 4. THE PLOT 5. DIALOGUE and finally ... 6. THE PLOT <br /> <br /> There are so many unanswered questions. Did they make a movie that lasted 2:32 hours and then realized that they did not put Lex Luthor and Superman together in the scene and they were forced to settle 3 -minute bit, or did they really think that no one would notice that the main character and the villain have less time on the screen than Superman's son and the henchman he kills? !! <br /> <br /> Is half of the budget going to convince Kevin Spacey to do it? <br /> <br /> When Superman goes to the hospital, why doctors do not ask: "What do you, F ***, want us to do ?! It's a strange alien! We do not know Jack about his anatomy! "? <br /> <br /> What happened over 5 years of Superman's activity to make technology increase by 28 years? <br /> <br /> Where have people who posted good reviews watching the same movie? <br /> <br /> and finally, why? Only why? <br /> <br /> By the way, for those of you who are wondering why Superman can pick up the entire continent of krypyonite, I think I understood ... <br /> <br /> ... there is no superman on him the influence of kryptonite, until he sees something green in the rocks, it is clearly in his head. therefore, the thing of the continent is simply suppressing the fear of a shiny green rock ... <br /> <br /> or the writers are crazy half-minds who did not consider this a rather obvious mistake.
