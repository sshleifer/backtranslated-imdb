This is one of the worst cases of film drift that I have seen for a long time. It's so terrible that I'm not sure where to start, and even if it's worth it. The story is a real problem and I feel sorry for Sly because she admits that she is decent. But this conspiracy ... Oh my dear. I especially like the way in which he finally manages to jump from the top of the mountain to the top, while the helicopter is on his way. Climbing for a day or two takes him five minutes! I can continue: but it is not worth it. Apart from the grim opening (which even a five-year-old would have been able to foresee) the rest is nonsense. I'm sorry, but it's as bad as making a movie.
