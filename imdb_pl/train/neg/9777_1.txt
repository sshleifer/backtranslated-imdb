I was drawn to this movie, curious to see how they adapted Hubert's brutal novel. I thought that a literary piece of such depth, with a rich tapestry of characters, horrible situations and social criticism, can not translate into a bad movie. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This movement is a terrible movie experience, not its content, but form. Director, Ulrich Edel, in my honest opinion, performs a terrible directorial work that does not justice to the original book. No wonder Edel is a TV director; this movie looks and looks like a broken movie "created for television". Some of my views on this bomb (** spoilery forward **): <br /> <br /> - No directing creativity. Scenes are slow, slow, they look bad and barely move from the anchored position. The only freedom they take is the area of ​​cinematography with a nice, dark tone. In addition, the film has the same technical creativity as the television soap opera. <br /> <br /> - All actors do a great job in presenting these pathetic characters. The problem is that adaptation does not deal with the basic element of plot development: MOTIVATION. All these characters move like robots, with no clear motivation to act. They seem to do things in blue, like robots, for no reason. Edel misses every opportunity to enrich the development of the character, without examining the character's motivation and avoiding developing the personality of each character in its full range. <br /> <br /> This lack of character development is glaring to the Tralala. Jennifer Jason Leight does a great job playing this tacky prostitute, but her alcohol-induced decision to let the sailors break her is not explained. It looks very stupid because we see how this character does it in blue. This is a clear example of poor character development. <br /> <br /> The film also has many secondary tokens that do nothing, feel nothing and add nothing to the story. For example, I would like to learn more about Harry's wife and the interaction between them. This is another missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> Edel approaches character development only with Harry and his fiction with his gay lover, only to screw him up at the end without explaining clearly - I do not know - his motivations. Bandits are also a joke in their lack of development. <br /> <br /> - The soundtrack is one of the worst I've ever experienced. The horrible job of Mark Knopfler. I seriously expected more from the former leader of Dire Straits, but his work in this film is seriously neglected. Sometimes, like in a battle between union workers and the police, the music seems to be completely disconnected from the movie. I also feel completely poor and anachronistic; I could have sworn that the entire soundtrack was made using the Casio toy keyboard. It distracts attention from the actual action. <br /> <br /> - The adaptation of Desmond Nakano's book is so literal that it eliminates the sense of history. It feels as if they tried to keep the story of the action in the book so much that they forgot to develop the characters and once again explain their actions and motivations. <br /> <br /> I can not really recommend this movie, even to a Shelby fan, because it can ruin the original book. It is a very boring effort to adapt the novel and shows very little creative contribution.
