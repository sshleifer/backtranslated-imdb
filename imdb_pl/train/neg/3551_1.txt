This movie is simply awful !!!! Slow action, slow reaching the point and wooden figures that simply should not be there. It was best to show the Iron Maiden singing in some video in the theater and that's all. the end was worth a look and wait for it, but it was it !! The heroes of this movie almost put me to sleep. Avoid this !!!
