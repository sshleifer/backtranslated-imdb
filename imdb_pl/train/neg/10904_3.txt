I hired this movie, expecting a few laughter, hopefully I would be amused, but I was wrong. This movie showed very minimal moments of humor, and pathetic jokes made me flinch in shame that I hired him ... This movie, aimed at the age group of 10-15 years, will surely leave viewers outside of those boundaries who feel very unhappy about it . Worth not more than 3 voices very not recommended for anyone who does not want to waste 2 hours of their lives.
