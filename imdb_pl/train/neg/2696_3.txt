I know John Singleton is a smart guy because he did Boyza N The Hood, so how did he write and direct it? It is like a pilot of a bad "leaving for college for the first time", soaps for teenagers, a parade of boring stereotypes and clich√©s with some unjustified violence thrown to make him a commercial proposition. Who would have thought a rape victim on a date would sack sausage for seafood? An angry loner would have been wiped out by a group of neo-Nazis (and he would be equipped with a black and a Jew - only for laughter!). Even the terrifying reactionary story of Laurence Fishburne, the Professor just annoyed me and I love this guy, it's like everyone involved in this movie has just lost the story. Of course, with the exception of Busta Rhymes. Big ups.
