I can not believe people thought this stinky pile of rubbish was fun. Carrying out trials of humor between cruelty, disgust and stupidity "There is something about Maria" leaves little reason to stay until the end. Of course, Cameron Diaz is very pretty, but it's never enough to save a movie. Ben Stiller tries to work on the story and is obviously very talented, but the film is a loser. <br /> <br /> None of the scenes was reliable. The photos were poorly planned and poorly framed. Farreley brothers should not make films at any price. I check IMDB to see what they are working on, so I know what to avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10; the bonus is immediately when I smiled. In my opinion, it is not that I am immune to humor or alone. My wife also hated it. The next day we saw "Rush hour" and we laughed stupidly. This movie just stinks.
