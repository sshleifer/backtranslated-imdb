There are many pretentious people there who will pretend to have some beautiful meaning, and that ignorant people like me do not get it. Of course, this means that we should stick to Hollywood's impurities. <br /> <br /> It has everybody, ah-ha, artistic stereotype in the book - it's probably good that the director is one of the chosen ones. Almost a parody drowning in its own claims. <br /> <br /> The director (almost as embarrassing) of the movie "Ratcatcher" returns with another piece of artistic nonsense; it is difficult to understand and apparently it is a study of alienation. The best way to describe this video is alienation for viewers.
