This movie looked promising, but in reality it was quite bad. The assumption was O.K, but the plot itself was terrible. The actors tried their best with limited material, but they could not rise above the average spirituality of this shoddy student film. Jason Schwartzman was once again extremely irritating - even more so than at Rushmore, the rest of the cast was not very rich. Scenes that should be fun have been disheartening and unbelievably young. Trying to be a Road Trip / American Pie, but fails on all levels. A total waste of all time.
