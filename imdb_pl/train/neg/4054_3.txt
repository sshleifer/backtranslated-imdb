Ah, ghost '68. The streets of Paris were raging with rebellion, the hippies were high on the spirit of love. How has the United Kingdom marked this age of radicalism and revolution? Erm, in appearance, dear Old Blighty, focused on making films about boys in boarding schools. If ... it contains a bad establishment. It contains the rise of the oppressed. In contrast to the passion of Paris and hippie travel, he lacks excitement, except for the complete ending of ammunition and artillery. <br /> <br /> Lindsay Anderson's ... - wonderful Malcolm McDowell as one of the three private school students who decorate their dorm with pictures of Lenin and other leftist radicals. This is clearly an anti-plant movie in his description of evil upper class oiks who rule the anger and obsolete autocratic practices of the public school standard. What makes that if ... it is extraordinary that for all his radical sympathies, it does not give us a sense of great tension between human decency and a despotic school system, instead it is just a type of runoff: there is no conspiracy and he lacks personality. <br /> <br /> Surreal pieces disappear and disappear from time to time, and the film slides off black on white again (is it because of the low budget or is it an artistic expression?), but there is little interest. We only get a moving agreement in which young rebels reach for guns and shoot down the shady rulers of the plant. Bravo! Revolution! Finally, something that requires a second thought in contrast to the rest of this boring exercise in dreams at a boarding school. <br /> <br /> If ... it could be a powerful political statement, but just like it, it drifts and gathers only a sense of direct interest at the end. Instead of being a testimony to the dissident zeitgeist of the late 1960s, he manages to be a dazed document of British higher education. Anarchy? Apathy more, the only man that many viewers will want to hold after watching If ... Lindsay Anderson will be.
