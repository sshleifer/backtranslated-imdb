Wow, my first review of the movie was so negative that it was not turned off. I will try to tone it. Lets be honest !!! Nobody wants to watch the movie of Chuck Norris, in which HE is not the main character. At the end there was a good fight scene, but the rest of the movie stank. I have to wonder if old Chuck can not hang over the best anymore. Has he slowed so much that he has to throw away such trash and hope his reputation will take him to the whole movie? Chuck is an amazing martial artist and, as we saw from Walker, Texas Ranger, a pretty good actor, but the trick is to combine both of these features in his films, and he does not. Very disappointing for us Norris fans. Chuck, become the main character of your movies, because it does not work for you ... Gary
