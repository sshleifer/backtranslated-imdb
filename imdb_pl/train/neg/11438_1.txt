If there ever was a worse comedy than "Gray Matters", I'm not aware of it. The "funny" premise of the New York Jewish comedy is that the siblings Sam and Gray are confused with the couple, so they decide to fix Sam with the girl, only to see that Gray is equally attracted to their goal - Charlie. The finding that Gray is secretly gay is just a surprise to her. There is a deeply offensive wedding sequence, deeply embarrassing "drunken act" from Moynahan and Graham, and a performance that would embarrass the forests around the world for Tom Cavanagh's forest. Sissy Spacek demonstrates the total inability to perform a comedy and wants her to be removed from her biography. Molly Shannon plays a familiar friend with lumpen insouciance. Only Alan Cumming appears with any loan, but is seriously underpaid and gives nothing to work. The whole catastrophe is confirmed in the bizarre, rolling Graham spectacle, culminating in the penultimate scene in which he wears a comedy hat and mantle, even though the stage is set in a lesbian bar. Surprisingly, this movie has been released, has no buy-back function and should be avoided at all costs.
