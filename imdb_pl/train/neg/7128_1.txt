I am a dumber person who rents DVD REDLINE. Chicago Pictures, who created this stupid movie, never paid the Palisades Media Group for buying online advertisements in various automotive services, including the mine, which has the ALEXA 16K rating. They deceived me in connection with the transaction, and now I have 16 000 $ and have lost a lot of my personal time (petersport Palisades Media) you know who you are! <br /> <br /> Do not rent or buy this movie !!! That sucks, and the people who stand behind him are strangers. <br /> <br /> REDLINE has a cast of losers and poor actors! <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke
