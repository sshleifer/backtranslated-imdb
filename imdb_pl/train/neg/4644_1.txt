This movie is horrible. The story concerns a woman trying to find out what happened to her sister. The film struggles with its identity, going from Noir / thriller to erotica, with elements of horror thrown for good. The film has a very confused structure, for example with the frequent use of flashbacks without linking them to the story. The plot is underdeveloped, and the characteristics make it difficult to distinguish between who is who and which part they played. There are some incredible movies in many films, but the scene where the main character is happy to accompany a virtual stranger in his home agrees to go up alone (to the place where he says he finds the phone), without the gun that he brought with him, call on police, it was too hard to believe. Part of the cinematography is very poor: we watched the 42-inch TV, so anyone who has a smaller set can understand what is happening in scenes taken in almost total darkness, is beyond me. Generally, chaotic mess.
