If I could give him a zero, I would change my mind and give him a -10 instead. An absolutely horrible movie without the story of the movie does not make sense what is happening. Just ordinary boring. Do not waste your money on this one. Pleaseee !!! This movie could have done so well, if it really presented the true story of the killer of the zodiac, but nopes, I felt nothing but disgust while watching. Do yourself a favor and rent some classic movies, it's better to watch a movie that you've seen 3-4 times than to watch this nonsense! I do not understand why people even try to make such movies when they know that it will not be good. The killer of the Zodiac should be called "Boriac Killer" instead !!!
