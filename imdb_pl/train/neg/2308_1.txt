OK, the box looks promising. Whoopi Goldberg stands next to Danny Glover, who parodies the famous farmer and his wife. Then you put the child into the DVD player and lose all hope in less than five minutes. It's supposed to be a comedy. And I must admit that I was laughing once every ten minutes before the end. This film has the following elements: a battered and battered neighborhood neighbor, a boring lawsuit, racism, lynching, death and arson. Funny, what? No, please, if you never listen to anyone's review, do it here. You can not even force yourself to watch this shit. NONSENSE! I said this, CRAP! Whoever put the name in there should actually sue.
