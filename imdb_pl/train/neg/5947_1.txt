This is one of the most hateful and cruel movies I've seen for a long time. Unfortunately, I was deceived to keep him, because Donald Sutherland's presence confused him with some credibility. [This will be the last time.] <br /> <br /> The character of Lesley Ann Warren was annoyingly tearful and stupid as they appear. There were smarter characters than her dead in the movie. This is just one of many things in this movie that made me ask, "Where is justice?" <br /> <br /> Why is the night cable so filled with sadistic debris filled with pathological chaos? Most of these films seem to have a special problem with women and it seems that they focus on terrorizing and murdering them. This film could be just as tense without getting sick and twisting in the process. All that ends is the viewer's stomach reversing his illness and insulting the viewer's intelligence. <br /> <br /> The cast is misleadingly good. I guess they first COLLECTED Sutherland and used it to lure others like lemmings. <br /> <br /> I kicked off for wasting time, giving this piece a trash.
