the film looks as if the director was forced to make this movie by a gang of terrorists. this should be called dino crap. <br /> <br /> there is nothing good in this movie. do not waste time watching this movie. the director should be shot in the head for having the mentality to create such a bad movie. I mean, is not she ashamed to look at the faces of people after watching his movie? dinocroc looks as if it was made in power point and has a lot of "cut-and-paste" elements in it. and it's the same old story. man plays god. creates a creature. he escapes and is happy eating people. and finally a pretty girl and a guy in a sleeveless shirt have to come and kill her. blah blah ... u will discover the plot in the first 5 minutes of the movie
