I was eagerly awaiting this movie. It's a good family movie; However, if the assembly team of Michael Landon Jr. will do a better job editing, the movie would be much better. Too many scenes from the context. I hope there is another movie in this series, all are very good. But if you do another, I am begging him to take better care of editing. This story was everywhere and there seemed to be no center. Which is unfortunate because other movies in the series were great. I like the story of Willie and Missy; both are great role models. In addition, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoys a good love story.
