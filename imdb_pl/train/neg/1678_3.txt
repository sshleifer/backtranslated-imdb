I want to make a pun "Holmes with Doors", but I can not connect it. Properly dirty and converted WONDERLAND gives Kilmer a role that at the same time tells Morrison ... but how unfortunate is this film about the famous 14-inch! Australian crime movies are constantly shooting and ignoring graphic violence ..... as someone famous once said about the double standards of American cinema: "kiss the chest, and it's X, stab her and her action PG 13" WONDERLAND is in 14 minutes too long, and at the end of the tavern spiral, we were all happy to escape from the cinema. How many movies will WONDERLAND get? It must be six in the last decade. Pixelated violence and subdued color set a dingy tone, but the wobbly camera becomes tiring, as if we were staring at their nostrils all the time. Taking a few tips from the DOOR and TAXI DRIVER, everything becomes forgotten the next day.
