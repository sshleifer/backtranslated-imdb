Jack London's life was certainly colorful enough to get a dozen films about different aspects of his life. It is sad to say that what his life in the film was used for is war propaganda, which puts the best face on the least attractive parts of his character. <br /> <br /> Jack London, who barely saw 40 when he died, wrote some of the best stories. He wrote about what he knew, but also wrote the same as everyone else, bringing with him the luggage of his own life. Some of these experiences would be condemned as racism at a different date and time. But it was World War II and London was a great believer in the "yellow danger" as it was called in times. <br /> <br /> Two-thirds of the film covers his life as an author, we see his years as a sailor, from where he drew inspiration from the Sea Wolf. We see him in a yukon in a miner's cottage with a dog that was no doubt his inspiration for The Call of the Wild. London was able to capture the spirit of adventure that his own life was fine on paper so that the world could enjoy it forever. <br /> <br /> The last third concerned his time as a war correspondent covering Russo Japanese War. London was a socialist, but his socialism did not include oriental people. Like a few million others, he saw the growing immigration of Chinese and Japanese to our Pacific coast as a threat to white people's jobs. He was in favor of a strict immigration policy for the inhabitants of the East. <br /> <br /> The film puts the cart in front of the horse. London is portrayed as the man he saw because he was on hand during the Russo-Japanese War, what Japan's ambitions were and he was therefore as xenophobic as he was. In fact, such atrocities that were present during World War II did not exist during the Russian-Japanese conflict. Japan had its own imperial ambitions, but also everyone else, including the United States. But our immigration policy caused by pressure from the West Coast politicians was a big factor contributing to the deterioration of relations with Japan for several generations. London was part of the cause, not the prophet crying in the desert. <br /> <br /> This film was the first independent production of Samuel Bronston, who later made several films with a slightly larger budget than Jack London. If he had some more money, Bronston could get James Cagney or Spencer Tracy, both of them who were right. Instead, they got Michael O'Shea, who made his second movie after Lady of Burlesque. O'Shea is fine in this part, but it was certainly not a cash register. <br /> <br /> When London enters the war, he meets Captain Tanaka, played by Leonard Strong, an actor specializing in the Orientals and played in them during World War II. From the point of view in 1905. Strong outlines in the best tradition of Fu Manchu Imperial pursuit of Japan to adopt the US in the end. He must have been great in the crowd with the swing. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is not much life in London, including the first wife. The second and only wife in this film is Susan Hayward, who does not enter the film until the middle. It is a pity we did not see her anymore. Charmian Kittredge London survived her husband nearly 40 years of dying in 1955. <br /> <br /> O'Shea actually met and married a leading woman in his life at Jack London. Virginia Mayo has a small role in Jack London, and for 30 years they got married until O'Shea died in 1973. <br /> <br /> Maybe one day we will see Jacek London, who will be much better than this one.
