I feel as if I was, con is on, do not be fooled. After reading the great reviews (director for years was a film reviewer in Sky, he must have many colleagues in the press ready to do him a favor by writing positive reviews). I was expecting solid action, atmosphere, tension, strong characteristics, intriguing plot development and poetic moments. Unfortunately, "Sixteen years of Alcohol" does not meet the promises of critics, mostly sacrificing these qualities instead of cheesy special effects with a low budget (what is the cliche scene of cobwebs?), Unrealistic combat choreography and mindless, paralyzing mind narratives, cliches and camera angles. <br /> <br /> "Sixteen years of alcohol" starts interestingly from several beautiful shots in Scotland, but from here straight. Unfortunately, instead of spending some time building the atmosphere, creating characters we care about or building tension - the director decides to lead you crazy with indulgent lecturers. Leading heroes are so unpleasant and behave badly - the audience does not care about what's happening to them, the desperate actors do desperate things ... like this movie! To make matters worse, "tribute" (typical of a director trying to pay off his obligations to the old masters) is either completely trivial or unconvincing. The soundtrack is the only thing that picked me up and kept me in the cinema, but even that did not manage to maintain a dramatic narrative that would combine the period of time with the action. <br /> <br /> For some reason the movie was more and more flawed and quite frankly annoying. I still watched the whole damn thing! <br /> <br /> I think I liked the gritty realism in the film, but even it was destroyed when they were often combined with strange and abstract, sometimes pointless scenes. You do not need a huge budget to make a really moving movie, so much was said about how little money they had to do to make this film, half a million is not a bit of money ... YES NO EXCELLENCE! Sometimes I wonder what the actors ... Their agents thought about it! <br /> <br /> Give this turkey, unless you're masochistic and mindless ... NOT MY RARE. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10
