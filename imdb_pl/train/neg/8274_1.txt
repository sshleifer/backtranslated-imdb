Ahh, this movie had so much potential! Good cast of high quality B, thighs Jessica Simpson and ... that's all! <br /> <br /> I believe that some guy from some unnamed marketing department came up with an idea. Basically, let's make a legally blonde movie, but let's do it in New York. It is a big, bright city with chances, power and money, and where everyone is a soulless, strong / hungry person. Add to this Jessica Simpson, a bimbo in a small town, this brother Owen Wilson and for some invisible reason Andy Dick (only for this reason should ignore this movie). <br /> <br /> The basic story: <br /> <br /> The boy leaves the girl on NY, the girl follows her, the boy cheats, the girl stays in New York with a cousin, gets a job under a false pretext, tempts, is he is being attacked by another boy (brother Wilson) and together he saves the day kisses. <br /> <br /> a few words come to my mind when we think about this movie, i.e. horrible, horrible, unbearable, unacceptable and xenophobic <br /> <br /> Just do not watch this movie, be happier. One reviewer referred to Guantanamo and I strongly agree with him. This movie is shocking. And I know what you think ... at least at some point I will see Simpson naked or close. This will not happen, save time and YouTube. You will have a better sexy time! <br /> <br /> Film editing is weak, acting is unbearable and why use blue screens? <br /> <br /> In summary; it's a cinematic betrayal that should be punished to the utmost. <br /> <br /> Another question, why Willie Nelson always plays a kind of father in almost every Jessica Simpson movie and why there are no black, Latin, Asian or European people in this movie ?
