Anthology is always a risky business and I think that this venture should be praised. Many talents are involved. Very many talented actors, directors and writers. Unfortunately, I could not really enjoy the movie based on the three problems I had. <br /> <br /> First of all, the segments differ incredibly in tone and quality. And unfortunately, some of them interfere with others. <br /> <br /> Secondly, a few segments are poorly developed for me. Like seeds of good stories that will never bring results. I am not talking about happy endings (or even the end period), but rather they lack even basic development and even solid settings that draw you in. <br /> <br /> Finally, I did not feel New-York and its inhabitants were properly presented. <br /> <br /> You only have some short films that may be interesting for some, but leave the average viewer unsatisfied.
