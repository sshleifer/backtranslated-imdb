As it seems, this is the general essence of these comments, the movie has an amazing animation (I watched it on a blu-ray), but it really does not match any real depth. <br /> <br /> First, the characters are pretty boring. I got a hint of a situation in Laputa between Agito, Toola and the main antagonist Shunack. However, maybe my mind wandered and it was a wish (Laputa is my favorite animem, original Engilsh dub). The characters are not really nice and as mentioned in another post, they fall in love exceptionally quickly, leaving poor old Minek jealous and rejected (he loves Agito, who does not seem to know that). It seems, however, that he quickly forgives Toola without any explanation of the change in heart, which makes the ending a little more "happy". <br /> <br /> There is also a serious lack of explanation. How are druids really? Are they people? and who are these strange women / girls who seem to spend time with them and run in the woods? Nothing explains why they are there and how they can give superpowers to ordinary people. Plants from the moon still do not fill empty spaces on the subject. It's almost a strange version of The Day of the Triffids. <br /> <br /> And who is calling Toola? why bother yourself if it is not explained? <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this movie, but I think the plot is not as deep as a movie like Ghost in the Shell or having a real character like Miyazaki. I do not want to watch it, but I would like it not to buy it. My advice? Give it a rest if you have a few hours off, but borrow them or buy cheaply! Maybe if you have new animated films and you do not have much to do, you'll love it. It is certainly visually pleasing.
