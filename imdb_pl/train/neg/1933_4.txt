Final Score (average of various classical cinema features - acting, visualizations, creativity, payoff, humor, fun, ect): <br /> <br /> 4.3 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> Had "Atlantis: The Lost Empire "appeared a few years ago, it seemed to be a bold, serious new direction in the Disney animation. However, the year is coming after the innovative and almost brilliant "The Emperor's New Groove" and is a step back in the release of Disney from his repeated "Disney Formula". I am a huge fan of Disney animated films. I need to see how everyone likes or hates it. "Atlantis" is an animated return to "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" and similar science-fiction adventures from the 1950s and 1960s. The problem is that this version does not contain one original idea. It feels like a remake of something, even more than the real remake of Disney (Tarzan, The Hunchback of Notre Dame). The heroes are nothing more than the usual songs of ordinary suspects who usually fill such films (strange mechanic, gung ho general, sassy tough women). Apart from Milo Thatchem (Fox) and Rourke (Garner), the auxiliary cast is hopelessly unpleasant. The film also suffers from a concise pace. Instead of creating an epic tale, Disney often jams in the short time spent developing ... suspicions, characters, anything really. They bring us into this new and wonderful world and barely allow us to get our cowsheds. An awkward pace is sometimes misleading which is a relatively simple story. The animation is dark, gloomy and cheap. It looks like a Saturday morning cartoon. Let's hope they have not forgotten that traditional 2D animation can still be wonderful. "The Iron Giant" proved it among other things. <br /> <br /> Negatives: visuals, pace and pure lack of originality. <br /> <br /> Positive: It's probably probably the coolest death scene for a villain from Disney for a long time. This is a creative attraction of the film.
