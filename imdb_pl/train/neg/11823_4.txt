TOM BROWN'S SCHOOLDAYS <br /> <br /> Image format: 1.78: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Stereo <br /> <br /> In the late nineteenth century England, young Tom Brown (Alex Pettyfer) he is sent to a public school in Rugby, where he is undergoing a reform of the radical new director (Stephen Fry) and opposes the person living in the school, Flashman (Joseph Beattie). <br /> <br /> There is already a lot of filming - above all a breakthrough version of Gordon Parry from 1951 - the ever-green novel by Thomas Hughes underwent a treatment from the beginning of the 21st century, courtesy of screenwriter Ashley Pharoah (TV show Where the Heart Is ") and director David Moore (THE FORSYTE SAGA). It is quite pleasant and possible to watch, but it is also quite static and boring, stands out only by the sincere performance of Fry as the new director determined to wipe out some of the most dubious "traditions" of the school, and introduce a possible new star in the 14 year old Pettyfer, a talented kid with a graceful and elegant look who should take him to Hollywood and beyond. Otherwise, it is a typical television product in the UK, such as favored by directors who want to complete schedules with a "prestigious" product, even as uninteresting as this one. The British publication Radio Times described it as "oddly strange" and aroused strange eyebrows on "all this phage and brutality and handsome, noisy villain torturing life from sweet young boys". Quite.
