The gang of horny naked angels taken out of the sky (with large plastic canines) settled in a ghostly forest, where they feed on unfortunate souls who should wander. Soon after, a group of friends on a trip will fall victim to bloodthirsty babes? The independent low-budget horror produced in the UK, Forest of the Damned, takes an interesting assumption and empties them of the worst acts, effects and direction that I have seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> Director Johannes Roberts shows sporadic talent behind the camera? the scenes in the dilapidated house are quite tense and are cleverly "moments of shock" - but most of the film is technically amateur. Upload some really terrible performances from the horror icons of Tom Savini and Shaun Hutson, and you have one really bad movie on your hands. <br /> <br /> You can enjoy the sheer cheesy of the movie, and there's plenty of feminine nudity for the guys, but most of them will find it difficult.
