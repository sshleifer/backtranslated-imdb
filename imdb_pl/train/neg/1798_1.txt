How can a movie have Ozzy Osbourne and still suck? I just do not understand it. Trick or Treat managed to do it. It sucks and likes it. <br /> <br /> Trick or Treat is one of those movies I need to warn people about. It is a vile cruelty that causes vomiting, begging for watching, so you can feel a lot worse about yourself. Trick or Treat has no unnecessary factors. <br /> <br /> When it comes to heavy metal film, he certainly does not realize what heavy metal is or what he represents. This film makes heavy metal look bad and it was in 1986, probably one of the strongest hours of heavy metal. This is quite a feat, however negative. <br /> <br /> Trick or treat = so bad that you will be angry at yourself for watching it. This simple equation, hopefully, will stop you from this mindless and brainless movie.
