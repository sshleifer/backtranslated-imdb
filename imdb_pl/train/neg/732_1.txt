A young boy sees his mother die and his father hangs. 20 years later, he meets a group of friends to carry out exorcisms on himself so that he does not turn out to be like his father. All characters are in place: nice couple; "Funny" guy; hard (but sensitive) hood; smart girl (we wear glasses - we know that); nerd and two blondes without personality. All this is associated with some stupid wooden statue that comes to life (do not ask) and kills people. I knew that I was in trouble when, after a great opening scene, we jumped to 20 years later - ALL bad horrors do it! Palmer - why Betsy?) And the murders are stupid and / or unimaginable. My favorite scene is that two people supposedly have sex, and the statue rejects a guy from the bed to show that he is fully dressed! A real bad, stupid, incoherent horror. Avoid at all costs.
