Me and my friend rented this movie for 2.50 USD. And we both agree on one thing: <br /> <br /> THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE! <br /> <br /> Also me and my friend counted 475 shots in the face. (Which represents 95% of the movie). <br /> <br /> In other words: SEE THIS FILM WITHOUT ANY THAT COMES ON MONEY! And I do! <br /> <br />
