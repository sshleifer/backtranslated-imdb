It is quite simple. Friends is a comedy of very basic humor addressed to teenagers and young adults, with an unsophisticated sense of humor. <br /> <br /> It is also painfully obvious that in the end they desperately tried to do it for 10 seasons, most likely so that they could say that they defeated Seinfeld's 9 seasons. The problem is that Seinfeld had 9 amazing seasons with a great magazine, Friends had (and I'm very generous here) at most 5 or 6 seasons OK, then 4 bottomless seasons. <br /> <br /> It has become a soap opera with recycled humor and recycled features that were not so good, so start with and then get worse for the 100th time. It's difficult for me to understand why people rate it so highly. This is really terrible.
