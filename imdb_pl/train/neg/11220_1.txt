In the case of a movie with such promising features, it was disappointing, poorly delineated and acting, in the range from terrifying and unbelievable. The plot had more holes in it than Swiss cheese, and this is the worst trite end I've seen in the movie for a while. The last scene would rip my heart out if the whole movie was not so painful at first. I was numb! From the first scene - one wondered if the sister was trying to reach the twin for help, or just scare her to death, which would be better for the audience and save us from the two hours of the worst acting I have ever seen. It was a horror in the true sense of the word.
