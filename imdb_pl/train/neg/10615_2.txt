Strange how less than 2 hours can look like your whole life when you sit in such a flat, uninteresting nonsense. If the story is as personal as it probably was for Sally Potter, would not you expect a little passion to show up in her performance? Her acting was completely detached and I did not feel any chemistry between Sally and Pablo, and the tango scenes, which should be fiery, considering the nature of the dance, were instead awkward and painful to watch. Of course, revealing such a personal story in the film can be daunting and as such Sally Potter would be wise if he let a better actor take on a task instead of letting her passion fall victim to her own embarrassment.
