The special effects of this film are, especially for their time, ridiculous and used in such an underscored manner that one can not deny their terrible existence. <br /> <br /> The actor redefines the term "terrible abuse" from the hands of Meg Foster and Richard Joseph Paul, where Julie Newman and Andrew Divoff redefine the "bad". <br /> <br /> *** spoilery *** <br /> <br /> The charm in this movie can be found in two things: first of all, it's a perfect casting of Carela "Lurch" by Struycken as a mysterious psychic Gaunt who can sense where and when people will die and are always there. <br /> <br /> The second is the original finds, the combination of SF-Western is of course original, if terrible, but other finds are more original, such as gunslinger Zack Stone is able to sense the pain of the people he shoots (though his acting here it does not occur). <br /> <br /> Overal ... I do not see this movie unless you love this huge, brutal Carel Struycken, like every self-respecting Dutchman should.
