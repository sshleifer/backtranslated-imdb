Revolution is a scary movie, I do not care if you're a history teacher, writer, fan Al Pacino, no way that this movie could earn a reasonable "10". <br /> <br /> Key The point to the story is Tom Dobb (Al), who is trying to get money from the note he got for the radical patriots taking his boat. Everything revolves around this note. Tom's son joins the army to catch up, making Tom join the army, go on an adventure, try to get out of the army, years later the war ends and eventually they can pay attention to their boat. The End. <br /> <br /> There were several battle scenes and they were mediocre at best. Transitions between scenes were used "five months later" and magically placed characters in some famous historical battle. A love story is a joke, and the film as a whole is difficult to follow. So save your "Notes" and watch the Patriot instead.
