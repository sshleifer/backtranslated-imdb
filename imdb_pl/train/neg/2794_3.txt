Well, because I'm a musician, I thought, maybe I'll check this movie on TMC, nothing more good. One of the worst mistakes I've ever made in my life. I really thought it was one of those soft films with shit plot and bad acting, bad filming and bad effects. But no, I do not even enjoy it. Even the "musicians" were not very good. I was hoping that maybe he was laughing a bit, but I was not sure if they were trying to throw in some liners or not. But now I have to sit here and watch the rest until Pulp Fiction begins. Or maybe something better. And now I am sitting here, writing, until I have 10 lines
