The first episode of this new series was today and was terrible. Shaggy not only had a high-pitched new voice that made his line heard torture, but so different from the original concept and style of animation, which is barely recognizable as the Scooby-Doo show. <br /> <br /> Even on dark days, when Fred and Velma left and there was Scooby's nephew, Scrappy, the band kept solving mysteries. In this new show, instead of Shaggy and Scooby, he fights the super-black character of James Bond and his followers while living in the mansion. There is not even a van called "Mystery Machine" (and the trailer of the next episode, which the transformer robot promised, did not calm me down). How can anyone take Scooby Doo and DO THIS? <br /> <br /> The show earns two points for two scenes with the entire Scooby Doo gang, all of whom speak with correct voices, except for Shaggy, and even then I'm too generous.
