What did Ireland ever do to film distributors that try to represent the country in such a pejorative way? This film begins as a background for film students in Irish film cliches: vengeful priests, spitting handshakes, cattle marketplaces in the city square, cycling on rural meadows against the backdrop of folk music. However, it soon turns out that the main theme of the film is the great Daddy-O of Irish Cliches - a religious struggle. It concerns a Protestant who wants to decide where her child is being educated, who is the father of a Catholic, which seems quite a wise wish, though not for the people of the Wexford village from the 1950s with whom he must live. Instead of sending them to a Catholic school, he decides to get up and go to Belfast, and then to Scotland, where a few phrases are gloomy. While she is there, her father (who looks amazing like George Lucas) and the family at home are subjected to a boycott, which becomes very unpleasant. I will not reveal the end, not because I think people should see this movie, but because it is not very interesting. One of the problems with the film is the heroine: we should sympathize with her, but instead urge her to live. The villagers are portrayed as bigots whose prejudices should be opposed, but traumatizing children seems to be the wrong way to do so. In addition, he takes on the burdens that he unconsciously when he tries to draw analogies with the current peace process in Northern Ireland: her lawyer tells the woman that she "must set the prerequisites" until she returns. The film is allegedly based on a true story, but its motifs have been discussed with a much greater imagination, with less recourse to trite clich√©s in the past.
