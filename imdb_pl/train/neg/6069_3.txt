It never ceases to amaze me how to take the perfect actor and waste it in such a film. Robert De Niro is one of the best Hollywood stars in history, but even he could not save this movie. In fact, his character is very similar to the one he played at Cape Fear, which was pretty good, but I can not stand it when the actors do the same over more than one movie. I believe that it is getting old, and that's the case here. <br /> <br /> There is nothing strange about this movie, but the story has been told a million times. Wesley Snipes is a typical baseball player, and his self-importance is reflected in his characteristics. De Niro plays an obsessive fan, but his role in this movie is less than fun. <br /> <br /> However, because De Niro is in this movie, he makes a tie if you're a fan) who sees everything he does, no matter how bad. But to see De Niro at its best, see Run Night, Goodfellas or Cop Land and even come back and check Taxi Driver or Godfather II. Do not waste time on this drivel. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3/9
