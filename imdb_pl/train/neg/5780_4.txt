I really wanted to like this movie and watched it all the time thinking it must be better. Do not get me wrong, this is not the worst movie, but it never meets its potential. The premise is good, the cast is great (I was particularly excited about the return of David Naughton), and, I love them, you can say that everyone tried everything in their power. It just has no end. "Brutal Massacre" should serve as a constant reminder to filmmakers that only Christopher Guest can do Christopher Guest movies and even though it makes it look easy, you should probably just forget about trying to do the same. Naughton and Brian O'Halloran are fantastic at this and should be seen more often ... they are the reason why they get 4 stars from me. If you want to have the horror of "Spinal Tap", I suspect you might want the guy who created the "Spinal Tap" to steer it ... just think it out loud.
