This movie began with some sort of pretense of the story, and then abandoned it for an endless series of random characters and meetings that have nothing to do with moving the story forward. We were not able to stay involved in this movie. This film is a very cynical junk stack created by some people with animation skills, but completely devoid of creativity and the ability to tell stories. This is a shockingly bad effort on the part of a large studio. Of course Disney has problems with morality and motivation, not to mention total lack of supervision and quality control. This management allowed the film to see the light of day, which indicates their incompetence and desperation. This film joins my very short list of "the worst movies of all time".
