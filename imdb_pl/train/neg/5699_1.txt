WOW, this movie was so horrible. I'm glad I did not have to pay to watch this awful movie. it was like a nut of history that sipped Coke! the announcements made it look decent, but it was REALLY bad. I will say that the idea sounded decent, but give it a rest. it was really very bad. If you sat down and thought about it, you would realize that it is UNREALISTIC. Get back in the day when you think they had all these things to work. It was not like Ben Franklin sat down one day and made a goddamn riddle. it was totally funny, and you want to see a bad movie, then see it. The film "All and ALL HORRIBLE" can be on my top 10 movies I've ever seen.
