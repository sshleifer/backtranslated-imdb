I just finished watching it on TV and what can I say, but it's the worst movie I've ever seen! I'm embarrassed that I'm from Melbourne, where the movie was made. Diabolical acting, amateur makeup effects and REALLY an evil soundtrack. As for the plot, it's even stupid! Some scenes just surprised me. There is a reason why they put these types of movies on TV late at night - because they are complete garbage! Avoid at all costs.
