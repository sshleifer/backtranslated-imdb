*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** If we reviewed the film based on the assumption, you would think that you were looking at the average animal horrors. The plot is as follows. A group of documentalists are going to the island to make a documentary about surfing with sharks or surfing the blood. (I live in South Africa, so it was released as "Blood Surf".) Although it seems that there is a somewhat interesting idea, which, if it was further investigated, could slightly improve the film. However, this is not the case because some of the surf in the blood is minimal due to the fact that their document is interrupted by a fairly large crocodile with salt water. <br /> <br /> The script is absolutely horrible. A good example of this is the situation in which a crocodile eats someone, which is a common phenomenon in this film. Most people in the film made a toast for the victim in the scene, which was to be poignant, but it ended funny, because the dialogue in this film had a highly questionable nature. Another thing that really irritates this movie is that it presents characters that are completely unnecessary to the movie itself. They present a group of pirates who only see that they add another 10 minutes to the mercifully short movie. <br /> <br /> You can say that acting is mediocre. It would probably be a lot more impressive if they did not have such a terrible script for work. In total, there is not one person who would have a terrible impact on me. Every person seemed to be a diluted caricature and in this way none of these actors influenced me. <br /> <br /> It is said that the crocodile itself is huge, exactly over 31 feet and this sense of size is well represented by the obvious counterfeit of the crocodile that they provided to us in the film. The death of a crocodile at the end of the movie is so ridiculously false and invented that it makes the stomach turn. With a great shout of bravado, the hero of the movie announces that he has a plan that appears to fall from the hill and force the crocodile to dig into a happily placed spike at the bottom of this hill. > <br /> In conclusion, I would say that this movie is one that has to be seen to believe how bad it can be. What seemed like a good idea at the time suffered a horrible scenario and an overwhelming sense of low budget that served to create a truly awful movie.
