I stayed for five minutes when Beowulf received a double, automatic crossbow with crosshairs. Not only the crossbows do not have telescopic sights, but Beowulf defeated Grendel in close combat. A terrible, wooden acting game and eternal darkness, which harasses all original Sci-Fi movies, also did not help. It was only after a few minutes that I felt that the bile was growing and I decided to watch replays of I Love Lucy instead, that's all I have to say. But you might as well realize that it is a movie created especially for television and skip it there. <br /> <br /> Spoof.
