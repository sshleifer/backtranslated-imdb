Private practice is to be a medical drama. So I think that my biggest accusation is lack of originality in medical plots.

The character who does all this is, incidentally, a psychiatrist - the whole plot is so unrealistic that you really can not get involved in the alleged "drama". <br /> <br /> And I will not even complain about what the show did with a favorite Addison for everyone when we met her at Gray's Anatomy ...
