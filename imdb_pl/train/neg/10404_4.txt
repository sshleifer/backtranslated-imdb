This is a death-rattle from the Tremors series, which contains sixty inspired seconds (saw blade: you'll know when you see it) and more boredom and filler than you can shake a stick. Trembling 4 was, of course, shot in an extremely low budget. This means that they had enough mojo special effects for three or four minutes of valuable violence of worms on humans. A colorless, trashy cast and trite letter ensure that the remaining hour and a half of the Tremors 4 experience lasts at least fifteen thousand years. Only hardcore Tremors fans will be able to sit down, let alone enjoy this movie. If you're not among them, do not worry.
