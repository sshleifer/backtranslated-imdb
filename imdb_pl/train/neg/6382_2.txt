It's hard to say what was going on in the heads of Per Kristensen and Morten Lindberg when they wrote "Gayniggers from Outer Space" - the movie is announced as a comedy, but there are no jokes next to the raw character names (Capt. B. Dick, Sgt. Shaved Balls). The rest of the movie is (probably) an inadvertently amusing affair with absurdly non-synchronized readers ("actors" basically read their poems without a trace of feeling), "futuristic" computer displays full of spelling mistakes and a conspiracy that almost makes no sense. <br /> <br /> Although 65% of viewers have given the film an ideal 10 out of 10, this is the opposite of what a good movie is. Watching with friends can be entertaining, but this movie deserves only "2" of ten ... slightly higher than the lower possible rating just because of the very fact that the writers have somehow managed to get the black guys star in this movie.
