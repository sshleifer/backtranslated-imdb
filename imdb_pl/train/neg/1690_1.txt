this movie was awful. Because of that I could barely wake up. I would never see this movie again if I had been paid. The so-called horror scenes were unbelievably predictable and played. In this movie there was nothing that would make it original or worth $ 7.50 I paid to see it. Do not go, do not rent it, do not read it online, because each of these things would be a total waste of time. Sarah Michelle Geller gave a poor performance and she should really be ashamed that she misused her good name with this film. Shame on you, Sarah, you were connected to this horrible, horrible movie. A scary movie, you do not need to see it.
