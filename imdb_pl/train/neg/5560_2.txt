It looks like it's true that every movie starring Dolph Lundgren is wrong! I do not know if it's the fact that the plot is full of holes, or that Dolph is such a bad actor. There is no spoiler here, it seems that he was late with pushing, pushing, catching and moving in this movie. In my opinion, it is surprising that some of these projects find venture capital to get into the can and the theater.
