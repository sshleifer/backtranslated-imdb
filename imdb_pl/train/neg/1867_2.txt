Unfortunately, the only spoiler in this review is that there is nothing that could damage this movie. Even if B. Mattei never made any piece of the master he used to do his work with a little bit of humor and madness that made him a great Eurotrash director. But for the last 10 years it seemed like he lost it. This movie is just empty, nothing wakes us from a deep sleep that you get into after the first 10 minutes. No sex, no blood (I think it's about snuff?), No actors, no dialogues, just like 90's. It's even worse than his last epic cannibals and zombies. So relax in Bruno's room, and you will remain in our minds forever, thanks to such unforgettable gems as: Zombi 3, Robowar, Rats, l'altro inferno, Virus, Cruel jaws and a few others. So if you do not want to see B Mattei possessed by the new spirit of jess Franco, pass this one. I know that this nice craftsman's career keeps track of his old films and enjoys himself.
