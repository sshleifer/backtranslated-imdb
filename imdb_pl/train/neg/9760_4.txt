The film crew did not have good access to the occupied territories, so the filming of the Israeli side dominated. I was struck by almost completely opposite points of view of mothers. Israeli mother lost a child who had the opportunity to live in great happiness. The Palestinian mother lost a child who had only the opportunity to live and despair. With such different points of view, each meeting did not have a real chance to meet the minds. The word "peace" did not have the same meaning for each of them. Peace for Palestinians was freedom. Peace for Israel is security. Is this type of film really worth a lot with such a chasm? I finished with the feeling that I was watching senseless propaganda - both sides were unconvincing.
