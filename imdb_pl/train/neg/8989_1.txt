There are some good things about the movie. Music and photos are great. Alex Wilson is hot and gives great results. Ryan Bauer is also hot. Production was very happy because she threw them because they really give the film production value. Jonny Vincent (Sean) and many boys in the film who do not speak are sweet too. Why is the actress who plays Amy not listed in loans? Brandon Alexander gives a great comedy performance as Clitarissa Pink. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about the movie is probably the star, James Townsend. It can not work. He is also very thin, he does not look nice at all. His arms are like spaghetti. It's disgusting. They do not have muscle tension at all. No wonder he has to make his own movie and play in it. Nobody else would throw it at anything. <br /> <br /> James Townsend is not credible as someone who would even have a girlfriend because he is acting so cheerful. They should have cast someone else as a leader if they wanted the best in the movie. On the other hand, maybe he just wants to use this movie as a vehicle to start a career in the soft core of porn, he's definitely not real acting, because he'd take some acting lessons. Plus, anyone who has porn is blacklisted in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous thing about the movie is probably the filling of tannic tannin as the mother of Devon. Sonja Fisher does not look like an actress at all. In conclusion, this movie is the soft core of porn and is no better than something you can see at Skinemax. I think even Alex Wilson, probably the best thing in this movie, is ashamed and does not want to be associated with it. There is no picture on his IMDb site and nothing else has been mentioned, so Alex Wilson is probably a one-time scene name. Besides, I recently came across him in West Hollywood and when I mentioned the movie, he turned around and left. I understand. If I worked on this film, I would be embarrassed and would not like to be associated with it.
