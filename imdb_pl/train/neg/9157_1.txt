The first indication that this is a bad movie is that it was shot on video, not on film. The story is complicated, and the production is extremely sloppy. Note, for example, that when the title pair is on a plane that apparently lands in Vermont, where they went to celebrate their union union ceremony, the plane is shown at an airport surrounded by palm trees. Their ceremony - in Vermont - takes place in the garden of tropical plants, including palm trees, which would not last five minutes in a climate of New England. During the next plane trip, the starting arrow shows the starting FedEx cargo plane. Presumably they could afford to travel only by rudders. As for the plot, this movie expects you to believe that Victor, Arthur's devout Christian brother, is thrown out of his church when the church learns that his brother is gay. Not only that, but the pastor finally sets Victor up with a beaten man to kill Ben and Arthur "to cleanse their souls of sin." Apparently no one in the church has ever heard of the Ten Commandments. If it were not for Jamie Brett Gabel who is surprisingly effective like Arthur, this movie would not have any advantages.
