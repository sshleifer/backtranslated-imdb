I am sure that people on the border between Texas and Louisiana had to laugh well, or two, when the picture unit B Paramounta asked it during the public war. Very simply, the area along the Sabine River, where the film opens, is a cotton country, just like the rest of the Deep South, or at least the Deep South was after the civil war. There are no great empires for cattle, they are much further west in Texas, further than Richard Dix and Preston Foster can ride to set up their empire. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with both partners in a river boat and when Leo Carrillo tries to steal his services without paying them for pulling cattle, they keep cattle. And this is the beginning of a great Ponderosa-like ranch that begins. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Foster marries Dix's sister played by Frances Gifford and feuds with his much smaller neighbors. They also have a little to do with Leo Carrillo. <br /> <br /> In any case, we westerners who like westerns usually do not care about geographic tricks and it's still a good western from the Harry Sherman factory that has produced all those westerns from Hopalong Cassidy for Paramount . The climax is burning, and I mean literally the battle for the weapon, which should have been used in the production of A. <br /> <br /> But I would not have any other fans from the West.
