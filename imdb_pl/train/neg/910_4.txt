The plot was very simple and easy to follow and included many comedies without thinking, to the point that it just became boring. Some viewers seemed funny, but I like more intelligent humor. <br /> <br /> There were several well-known Swedish actors in the film, and their performance was decent considering the script. Lena Endre looked like always. <br /> <br /> I do not remember the original movie, so I can not say if it's better or worse. <br /> <br /> If you like movies like SÃ¤llskapsresan, this movie may be worth a look.
