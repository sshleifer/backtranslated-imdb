I am sad that the period of history, which is so fascinating and so rich in footage, can be turned into a ho-hum event. Wm C Quantrill was barely shown in the film, probably the most intriguing figure of the period. Frank James was never mentioned, Cole Younger, like Bloody Bill Anderson, who cried over his murdered sister every time he entered the battle, completely absent from the scenario. Instead, we were forced to watch fictional characters who never developed into anyone we cared about. so sad. The costumes, however, were great, as were shooting at places in Missouri. I hope that Ang Lee will make another movie from this period and try again, or some other filmmaker will take care of the huge wealth of materials to write a game on the screen.
