The statistics in this video have been well researched. There is no doubt about it! Al Gore certainly presents his case very well and it is no wonder that this film received the praise he received. Al Gore is certainly an actor. Sounds so disturbed. But deeds speak louder than words! Throughout the film, there are political tidbits and references to his political career throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Carter, unlike Al Gore, is an honest man who not only talks but also goes for a walk. When Carter thought we needed to save energy, he turned down the thermostat in the White House and warmed himself in his sweater. <br /> <br /> Al Gore tells us that we need to save energy and claim that we create global warming while traveling in our private jet. How much energy does his jet use and how much more dirt does his jet produce? How much energy do you need to warm up Gore's pool for his residence? It would be nice if we could save electricity using smaller devices and make everything that is not used be turned off. But if we did, the energy company would react to a 50% reduction in energy, calling it a "50% loss of revenue" and recovering losses by raising rates by 50%. So "turning it off" would not be a good idea. <br /> <br /> This video is a veiled appeal to let Big Goivernment take control of everything in the name of saving the planet Earth.
