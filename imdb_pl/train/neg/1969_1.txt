I just saw this movie and I have to say that although at first some effort was shown to produce a decent movie, it was absolutely horrible - but not in the sense I'm sure of. <br /> <br /> It was as if the child was directing this insult to intelligence with the conviction that all would-be viewers are morons or very difficult to entertain OR either .... Thank God for a quick fast! I can not imagine the viewer that the producer had in mind when creating this movie. I mean, actors are trying to be serious, but barely, and the scenario that calls for complete rewriting ... I just can not say anymore. If Harlequin Romance decided to do horror films, it would be a good effort. <br /> <br /> If you find this movie entertaining, then I strongly suggest that you look for clues about the purpose of the movies. There is MUCH BETTER fare. Join the club, READ THE REVIEWS, but above all, avoid such nonsense.
