The only thing worse than surfers without waves is a film with surfers without any waves. For viewers who love to surf in this video, it will be a gigantic disappointment, because the total number of minutes of filmmaking surfs up with the achievement of three. <br /> <br /> History is a piece of life about surfers on the beach who are not waiting for the perfect wave, but in general for any wave. J.C. (Sean Pertwee) is an aging super-surfer who flirts with commitment with his girlfriend Chloe (Catherine Zeta Jones). Just as he is about to find a bliss with the woman he loves, three of his old surfing friends appear and convince him to hit the beach looking for monsters at the Bone Shipyard. The problem is that there are no waves to the very end of the movie, so most of the story gets distracted in the meandering series of disconnected events on the beach. <br /> <br /> Acting is mostly mediocre. Sean Pertwee has a few comical moments, but mainly his acting was mundane. Ewan McGregor was decent as a wild man dealing in drug trafficking, by far the most interesting and peculiar character of this group. Probably the funniest performance was Peter Gunn in the role of Terry, who turned his body into a continuous gag. Catherine Zeta-Jones was as sexy as ever, but her character did not have enough meat to show her great acting ability. <br /> <br /> There are really not many comments here. I rated it on 3/10. It's a real bummer on the beach.
