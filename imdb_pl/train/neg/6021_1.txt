I can not believe that they managed to spend 17 million dollars on this film. Spectacularly bad acting, scandalous scripts and effects that you can do on your average computer, unbelievable plot tricks ... a reporter who can make an inexperienced stewardess become a major job at the UN? What? Not only this, but the message of this film is so unacceptable that you leave the impression as if they were trying to put you on the head with a full crucifix. Everything that this film will do will preach to the choir and make everyone laugh at such a ridiculous waste of money. If the creators of this film really wanted to get people to Christianity and show what it really means to believe, they would use the money to help those who really need it. Now / this could have led some people to actually listen to them.
