I'm sorry to say, but the acting in this movie is awful. Dialogue sounds as if they were reading their poems for the first time. Perhaps by mistake I got a version of "costume trial". The director abuses the slow motion during special effects, perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the poor performance of the actors themselves. The story is pretty well written, and the fighting sequences are actually better than I've seen in many action movies. The fights seem quite real. But all this happens when the two leading actors repeatedly experience the unbelievable amount of empty fire of automatic weapons, grenades, missiles and bazookas. Enemy soldiers are definitely one of the worst shots I've ever seen, especially when they have about 30 meters of a runaway truck, and every bazooka shot is at least 50 feet wide. These bazookas need serious calibration.
