Yesterday I saw the movie Flyboys and my girlfriend told me it was the worst movie I've ever seen ... Ever since I thought it was awful, it also puzzled me - which movie was the worst movie I've ever seen and it was just a movie that he came to me. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's been several years since I saw him, but I remember terribly badly directed Dean Cain as a cocky military (nice boy Cain is not too confident). Strange thing about a CGI helicopter, it would probably be cheaper to hire a helicopter than hire a few CGI guys to do it, but I suppose they found a helicopter as a free sample for some CGI program or producer's son he liked to play with his new computer. And what did it look like? Horrible. And when the dragon is loaded through the corridors of the complex, he again uses the same shots again - it looks VERY cheap. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie - it's really awful ...
