Guys from MST3K should see this dog from the movie. It's mainly about a stupid Hollywood actor who can not land at any concerts. And he has this strange obsession with the Taxi Driver movie. So what does this stupid actor do? He dyes blonde hair and begins to behave like a dude with surfers from the USA, in the hope of naivety, thanks to which he will become an actor. You will laugh at so many of the funny scenes of this movie. Just like when the girl's girlfriend is heartbroken and sobbing, saying, "How could you do this to me?" And why is she crying? Because he dyed blond hair and became a surfer to play acting. This movie does not make sense! The actor who played the governor at Benson also plays in this game, and he plays a stereotypical right-wing politician with a funny, funny dialogue. This movie will break you, trust me. Are you talking to me?!
