There are not enough gay movies and there are not enough "outgoing" films. Everyone is a welcome addition to the genre. Although the production value is high (the film looks "good", Matthias Freihof (Philipp) really looks REAL in jeans), this is bad. This is a piece from the era: the life of homosexuals in the oppression of the regime (East Berlin, 1989), which seems 40 years after the West. In a sense, we see our own story; how could it be for gays from the 1940s and 1950s (it often reminded me of "Last Exit to Brooklyn: the book is not a movie"). up Ingmar Bergman. It is so casually edited that I wonder if the director simply did not break in by accident. Yes, it's a miracle that the film was filmed and released before the Wall's fall and yes, life behind the "Curtain" was difficult for gays. A good director could show it all without fooling the audience. A good director would make me mark one of the best outgoing films, not one of those missing.
