Another FINE effort by the most underestimated American filmmaker. His knowledge about racism is STAGGERING and IMPRESSED me on more than one level. Accusations that Lee is in fact just a cunning racist, venomous dwarf who opportunistically uses Hollywood's affirmative action system to make movies of inferior quality, is a total NONSENSA, a simple right-wing propaganda. The very conviction that Lee resorted to abusing the current climate of political correctness in America to produce hateful anti-white films is simply FALSE and malicious. <br /> <br /> Some Lee critics have even gone so far, suggesting that the GOTB is glorifying African Americans, while putting on other races: of course, another FALSEHOOD disseminated by people who AGAINST the peaceful coexistence of different races in America and elsewhere. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene in the movie is a long dialogue between the rich black Republican and the others on the bus. The views presented by this man are simply WRONG. 100% UNTRUE. LACKS education, in contrast to the brilliantly informed guys who have enough to DO him to throw him off the bus. <br /> <br /> TERRIFIC performances and an INTELLIGENT scenario make the viewing experience that Rivally has been competing through any political films made since. <br /> <br /> I would also like to draw attention to the incessant LIES that only 80,000 people participated in Million-Man March! <br /> <br /> (And now all you have to do is take the antonyms of all words written in large letters ...) <br /> <br /> So what message does Lee send? If someone does not agree with your political views, you simply use violence and throw him out of the bus. I thought the movie said "get on the bus" ...? <br /> <br /> Apparently, Mr.Lee is bus segregation, i.e. He is no different from those crazy KKK in front of him: the bus is only for those black people who are in line with the Democratic Party's line of thinking. So much for "liberation of slaves" ... <br /> <br /> End points: "This film was entirely financed by black people". Distributed and sold by a large Hollywood studio run by Jews and whites who despises Farrakhan ...
