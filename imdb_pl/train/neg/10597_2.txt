This movie was absolutely horrible. I can not think of one thing well. The holes in the storyline were so huge that Hummer could pass through them. Acting was so surprisingly bad that even Jean Claude should be ashamed, and that says a lot !!! And dialogue, what dialogue? To think that I am a fan of the first (I use this comment loosely, it is more like guilt than anything else). This movie had Goldberg in it for loud crying !!!! Nothing good can come from this movie. What makes this movie even worse is that it's so bad that you can not even see it with a group of friends to laugh !!! It must be in my top five worst films of all time. 2/10, because it's hard for me to give 1.
