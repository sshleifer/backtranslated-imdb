I have read some books about Bonnie and Clyde, and this is definitely VERY accurate than the Beatty / Dunaway version, because her costumes and locations reflect real gang images. The death of Buck Barrow and the capture of his wife Blanche are especially well done. This actress looks exactly like the photographs taken that day, when Blanche was grieving over her dying husband. However, this movie is still Hollywood, and our anti-heroes remain quite to the end, even after shooting to the holes (in life Bonnie was heavily burned in a car accident a year before their famous ambush and did not look like a perky cheerleader at the time of her death). The script is boring, and the acting is weak, especially for leads. Very disappointing. Hold on to Beatty and Dunaway. Theirs can not be a "real story", but it's a great movie.
