From blocked material in digital format to acting, which makes Keanu "I am so wooden that I can be Plank for me" Reeves looks like an Oscar winner. The best thing is the eRATicate box in the second segment (which of the three seemed to be the strongest song in terms of plot and "turn"). It is a pity that I did not spend 3.99 pounds, which cost me something else, like erm .... Natural Born Killers: Directors Cut. If you buy it, you are really disappointed, do yourself a favor and avoid it like a plague. If you are looking for something amateur and actors who are more wooden than 2x4, go further. However, if you want good quality Werewolves, look elsewhere, like Dog Soldiers, Wolfen, Romasanta: The werewolf Hunt.
