They steal violence and are called sick. Well, violence is the best thing I'm afraid of, but unfortunately the characters are not developed enough to let us understand why they continue their (completely predictable) rage. This movie has a really horrible scenario. We never have the opportunity to meet Robert, and his actions at the end are simply pathetic. Acting is not better, the worst of them is the TV chef and teacher. The direction is clumsy, fast enough for you to sleep. And what is it all about in a school movie project? Maybe a comment to the movie itself? Using the chronicle during the climactic murder is ridiculous. These guys apparently think they are intellectuals, but they are hopelessly torn from their depths. Like, hell, they have a great Yorgos Arvanitis to illuminate him, I will never know. And the way they got the money to get it first is an even greater mystery. Absolutely terrible, not to be understood.
