I went to see this movie in the hope that we would see flashes of Jet Li, which we were surprised at at Lethal Weapon 4. Unfortunately, too many of his feats of battle are so clearly false that it took even this pleasure. Flying kicks would be much more impressive if you did not see the wires holding him in the air when he was flying in the air for 4 seconds and 9 kicks. <br /> <br /> Too cartoon and very disappointing.
