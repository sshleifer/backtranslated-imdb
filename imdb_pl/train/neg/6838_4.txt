Plot Summary: Hong Kong, 1966. Paul Wagner, the man who built the Victoria tunnel, is murdered along with his wife by his colleagues. His twin sons, Chad and Alex, are separated. 25 years later Chad, a karate instructor in Los Angeles, and Alex, a smuggler living in Hong Kong, join forces to avenge their parents' murder and rightly apply for a tunnel. <br /> <br /> This is the second time Jean-Claude Van Damme and Sheldon Lettich have worked together before doing "Lionheart". This is also the first of three films in which Van Damme plays a double role ("Maximum Risk" and "Replicant" are the other). The plot is a very simplified story about revenge, and the only redemptive film is Van Damme's performance as two very different people? nosy rich kid and rough - and - wobbly, cigar chomping tough guy. As it turns out, Van Damme does not do very good job in any role, although his approach to Alex is slightly fun. It is puzzling whether the brothers were wrong with each other, wearing different clothes and having different hair styles. Bolo Yeung is a very valuable helper for the bad.
