I quote Oedpius Rex, because it is a tragedy that this film was even made !!! <br /> <br /> It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen! I'm not in any way hated by Uwe Bolla, like most people without humor on IMDb! <br/> <br /> Uwe Bolls, such as Postal and Tunnel Rats, are fun and therefore funny. But to be honest, this movie was just awful. I hated it so much that if I could, I would give him a zero mark. The story is simply bullshit! He spends four-fifths of the film building a story, and then he has a medium that is just the scenes of a terrible, hopelessly murderous grizzly! Eventually it ends with "ending the win in the village", which is perfectly acceptable, but it could certainly be more tasteful than it! <br /> <br /> I am not against Uwe Boll (as I said earlier) or against violent movies! I love brutal movies! I loved Saw movies, movies from the hostel, Tokyo Gore Police, The New York Ripper, 28 movies, Dog Soldiers, My Bloody Valentine, Last house on the left, Watchmen, Wolf Creek, every movie Tarantino, every Sam Peckinpah, even Cannibal f ** king of the Holocaust! But it! OMFG !!! <br /> <br /> It was just cruel, sadistic and perverted! And look at the films I just exchanged! If I liked the Holocaust Kanibali, not this, it must be wrong! Uwe, do not go dark again! You're funny when you have a light heart like Ed Wood. It was just a terrible experience! I felt terrible after seeing this! <br /> <br /> DO NOT WATCH !!!! AVOID AT EVERY COST !!!!!
