is a seismic activity with small or negligible surface results. Therefore, the average IMDb voting result is in place. <br /> <br /> A Spanish film made in the USA with third or fourth degree actors, giving the romance of "Falcon Crest", is a wonderful way to waste time and also to waste the money of those who have financially supported the project. <br /> <br /> The snares participating in the project are originals from Asturias in northern Spain, but because they were not allowed into the United States, they had to be made of plastic. However, chopping them in lettuce used to make an evening salad for dinner contrasts quite strangely with Parisian music, and with a rather dingy collection of other forgotten hits in the US (or does not hit if you have no idea who was responsible for composing this). The actors involved were also quite crafty, simply adapted to a low-budget film that could be classified as frightening, frightening, horrible or simply horrible. <br /> <br /> As a result, the result is negligible on the surface, undetected underground, and more or less as attractive as chapter 17,000 Coronation Street or the latest news from Baghdad.
