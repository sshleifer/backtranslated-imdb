It is difficult to know where this adaptation begins, because I think the problem starts with the books themselves. Alexander McCall Smith discovered that you are not reading them for detective stories, but for his deeply condescending and completely false vision of Africa that does not exist. He did what Borat did for Kazakhstan for Botswana - not so effectively, but based on the same fact. <br /> <br /> When I understood this, it stopped to surprise me that Jill Scott, an American singer cast as Mma Ramotswe. If he is to represent a land that is not Africa, how accurate is a black woman who is not African? She is not the only American in the cast; Mma Makutsi plays Anika Noni Rose. Both women are far away, too young for the roles they play, and definitely too effective. Both brutally murder local accents and both focus so much on this brutality that they do not offer much in the way they act. Scott Mma Ramotswe is full of vigor, sweet and soft. Rose Mma Makutsi is an annoying bitch with motoring. <br /> <br /> The result is almost impossible to observe. The main cast is repurchased only by the presence of Lucian Msamati, who performs well as Mr. JLB Matekoni in a dignified performance. It is cleverer and more intense than in books, but I can not blame Msamati for it - it is a shining light in the ocean of sucking. The contradictions between his performance and the books are clearly arranged by the committee of butchers who wrote the script. <br /> <br /> For me, writing McCall Smith has always been very fun but notoriously bad. He does not want to be edited. As a result, his books contain grammar experiments bordering on science and characters changing the name in the middle of a sentence. It is therefore something that the writing team of this project has actually deteriorated. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is now largely uknown. Characters talk about "opening" and "sensitivity to needs". Mma Ramotswe and Mr. JLB Matekoni openly flirt. Mma Makutsi moans that there is no computer, but considering her constantly renewed hair, makeup and jewelry, I am surprised that there is no MacBook in the purse along with the Visa card. <br /> <br /> So what are we here? It is difficult to be worried about this poor adaptation, because to be honest, most of the things that I like in the original books are still apocryphal. McCall Smith paints a fictitious Botswana inhabited by charming, non-threatening black people who are full of fun and tasty nuggets of wisdom. It reads well despite linguistic parody, but it is a vision of how a certain type of white person wants Black people. It's just not true. <br /> <br /> Given this, it's no wonder that this show sucks as much as he does. It will turn out, however, whether the European and American audience will notice this.
