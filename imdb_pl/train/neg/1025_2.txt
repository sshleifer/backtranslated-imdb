This is the only question I have left. Why was this film so sucked out when it had such a great cast? Why was writing so bad that the audience was completely unrelated to the characters? Why did not it make sense at all? Why did the studio take a completely good assumption, and the "Hollywood" hell, what was needed was a good, intelligent story telling? Why? I never understand why movies that start well change into a pile of nonsense before they are released. I hope that because of Freeman and Spacey, who are the Oscar WINNERS, it will never be released on big screens in America. <br /> <br /> As someone who has a BA in journalism, the whole story is only completely fun. I just ... I think the script had potential, but the performance turned it into a clich√© and a terrible one. Just. No.
