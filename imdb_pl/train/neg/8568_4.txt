DEAD HUSBANDS is a bit stupid comedy about a group of conspiracy wives to run into each other's husbands. This is in no way embarrassingly bad, like some comedies I might mention, but it never fulfills their potential. Imagine what it would have been like if Farrelly's brothers were Ben Stiller in the role of Carter Elson. <br /> <br /> Oh, is Carter based on Jerry Springer? Interesting, because the phrase on Dr. Elson's show is "look after yourself and keep talking"
