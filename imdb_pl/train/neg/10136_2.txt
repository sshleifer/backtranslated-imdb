No one can like this movie because of its benefits, but if you have a sense of humor and enjoy Schlock movies because of the quality of MST3, then this is for you. You place there with "Road House" for absurd characters, sets and story. The bad letter really ruined me: "I want you to vacuum those guys" instead of "... vacuuming those guys". F-14 take off from the aircraft carrier, but when they enter the formation, there are F-16! Without a trace of anger and skepticism, Segal returns to work for a general who only a few minutes ago oversaw the secret "wiping of the mind" at Seagal. Segal has no bullets and is running to the knife to kill the guards. Of course, the guards throw weapons and fight with knives! Hand grenade is a dud, but it explodes anyway. A small invisible fighter can fly from California to Afghanistan without refueling. Then Segal flies back to California - for a long way, that is, through Europe - although there is a carrier that provides him with 20 minutes of air support in the Arabian Sea. CIC in the carrier consists of 3 black computers, 2 flat televisions and photos of indicators and maps on the walls. What a hoot!
