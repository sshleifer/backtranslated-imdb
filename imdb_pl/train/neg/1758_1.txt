If you have not seen it yet, I'm just saying go ahead, walk around the park, do not waste time. Neither the script nor acting is worth your money. * Spoilers * - I can not decide which one was worse: the film itself or Baldwin's hairstyle? The acting talent of Ellen Pompeo is very doubtful. I hope that he will be able to improve it over time. The story is unbelievable. Loose cannon An American policeman fights criminals in Europe alone? The infamous Slavic mafiosi protected only by two pieces ??? A teacher of emotional art leading a ruthless gang ?? Is a Spanish policewoman stupider than a bag of hammers ??? Give me a break. There is only one good thing in this movie: at least the production costs must be lower than "Ocean's 12", which was just as senseless as above.
