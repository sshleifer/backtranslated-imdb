I bought this DVD set, invisible view and did not want to. The script required a serious rewrite because it seems to be completely devoid of feelings and errors compared to the book. The lighting is terrible, very unpolished, but if only I could overlook it. The script is not focused enough on characters ... there is no introduction to different characters, which makes it difficult to distinguish who is who (especially on airplanes - no one knows who dies when). <br /> <br /> For a long time I think that the key to a good movie is to get recipients to look after the characters; if you do not have one, you have nothing. There was no focus on the characters at all - you never knew them - who they were, what they liked ... which made them do what they did. The series has 5 hours and is divided into 6 parts ... I bet you are wondering what they did all this time, if they did not specify the characters - they put in a lot of filler .... I will say that at least the whole hour is spent on watching how they land and take off in their LOL planes (I mean, do we really have to see it over and over ???). I would give a much higher rating if they only improved our knowledge of the characters.
