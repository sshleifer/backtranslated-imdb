Okay, so someone, somewhere a few years ago, he thought it would be a good idea to make an IMAX 3D movie about some flies coming aboard the Apollo 11 and going to the moon. They did it. Someone, somewhere, was an idiot. <br /> <br /> I want to give artists props for their homework on the equipment. As far as I know, rockets and launching equipment exploded. The graphics in general were quite good - the launch of the rocket gave me shivers, as always a good rocket launch (my blood with the flying mechanic's flying head still works strongly), and 3D was quite effective. CG was not Pixar quality, but overall it was good. The flies were quite average anthropomorphics, with a few half-past figures from the late 1960s thrown in for color (hippie flies, African-American flies with giant afros and black shadows, etc.). Worms looked more like larvae with human heads (although they did loud noises). <br /> <br /> Script writers certainly did not do their homework, based on offensive and outdated stereotypes (gender policy from the 1960s, including mostly useless female characters, racial stereotypes, bad Russians, thick fly who wants just eat, disgusting humor on level 2). In the film for IMAX, they created a great opportunity to sneak into educational content about physics and space travel - they did not get the right physics (zero-g in the moon module during firing during landing? PLEASE). Do not even bother reading the original radio transcripts between Houston and astronauts, all of them in the public domain; instead, they wrote their own dialogue, which sounds like shit. <br /> <br /> But we liked the worms. <br /> <br /> So they get one and a half points for rockets and worms. Uh, yes. 1.5 / 5.
