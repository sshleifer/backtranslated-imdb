This film is in no way a pastime, but rather a look into the darkest side of human behavior. Loosely combining a half-dozen stories about the worst type of depravity, perverted sex, greed, violence and intolerance. The whole action takes place over several very hot and sticky days during the heat wave in Vienna, and the heat can cause anger and hatred in the film. For me, treating the delayed girl by the seller of protective equipment concerned the worst episode, followed by the scenes of drunkenness and perversity in the apartment of "slag". You will be absorbed and I hope that this film will frighten me. I hated it, but I felt compelled to see it. 1/10 for "fun" 8/10 for displaying a "man", as it sometimes happens.
