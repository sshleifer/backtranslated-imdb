In my opinion, when you decide to re-make a very good movie, you should try to do better than the original; or at least give it a new point of view. Now Robert Wise from 1963 tells the story of Shirley Jackson's amazing novel The Haunting of Hill House, which is worth the price even today. Now fast forward to 1999 and re-make. I shook my head and asked: why? Acting is wooden, history is unrecognizable, and the whole being seems to replace the subtle horror of the original with so many special effects that computers can generate. I heard that this update was bad; but I could not believe it was so bad considering the source material. I was wrong. After seeing this and telling my wife how terrible it was, she said; "Well, they got your money!" She's right, do not let them get yours. If there are no profits from poor modifications, they may stop creating them or achieve a higher standard that does not offend their recipients
