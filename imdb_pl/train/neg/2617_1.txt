This movie was pure pain. Sitting in the theater for x minutes, I was wondering when the movie would start. All settings were in place; a typical love story, characters have to overcome their shortcomings, the villain must be revealed, but none of them have ever begun. Before it happened, I was bored and the devices were completely ineffective. In scenes that required huge tension and buildup, it seemed that a trimmed frame was necessary. Things for children do not have to be like that. Films for children can be as thrilling and engaging as adult movies. The excuse "hey, it's for children" is a bull. I will take "Sword in the Stone" every day. That was awful. I have the impression that Disney will release everything today. And as for children, the 10-year period in which I saw it, will agree ... clean trash.
