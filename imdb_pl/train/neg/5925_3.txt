Is this the "worse" episode of Star Trek TOS? Perhaps at least my voice is at the bottom 5. I mean, this episode does not make sense. Do you see something that makes you go crazy? Give me a break. This episode also has a different character, the music is strengthened, almost forced to increase the sense of anxiety, to the extent that it sucks. Give me some Klingons, Gornos, Tholians, Romulans, higher beings like Triskelion or anything other than Medusin√≥w, very boring aliens who create an episode. McCoy utters his famous phrase "He Dead, Jim." Spock puts on safety goggles while transporting the ambassador, but Kirk does not. They go through this crazy "barrier" for the third time, which I remember, boring. At least the next episodes of the third season are "Specter Of The Gun" and "Day of The Dove" and others to follow, which will make Trek a decent program to watch in a consortium, where he will choose people like me as avid fans. Personal observations, Trek loved to use purple, a kind of pinkish-purple, like when they are in the hallway outside the compartment, the gangway, which is normally gray, is now purple. We've never had a purple bridge, but it's worth seeing, I've noticed it in several episodes, I made it with a light filter and it works very well, but in this episode, the ship corridor is pretty bad.
