This is a review of "Freddy Mercury The Untold Story", a cinematic edition, Chicago Int. Film Festival, 2007 One of the greatest, boring and the most boring biographical documents I have ever seen. If the movie I saw at the cinema was originally released on television, I would ask its producers and distributors not to cheat the paid audience with a false promise of documentary documentary value. Even as a documentary to order, sentimental piano solos accompanying interlocutors sitting in front of flower arrangements in hotel rooms and a pompous, pseudo-literary narration rang more to the sleepy Infomercial bed. The only redeeming aspects of "The Untold Story of Freddy Mercury" - or, uhm, "The Untold Story of Princess Diana" are original concerts, video and television recordings - unbridled Freddy Mercury and Queen. Reports from interviews with irrelevant eyewitnesses, such as: "He was a free spirit" (I really ... I thought Freddy Mercury was a company man ...) downgrind the references of Freddy, Brian May or Montserrat Caballe, who threw new and a tender light in the complex life and nature of Mercury. And ... what about the segments of the Harry Potter-style boarding school? How does the interview with the girl's first girlfriend ("... who now works in a travel agency") and members of Freddy's first school band contribute to what I really want to know about Mercury? Key milestones of his personal life, sexuality, artistic style and growth, Queen, the band remains unexplored. These creators do not ask a single provocative question, nor do they engage in independent or visionary research on their subject, instead they provide arduous assembly of politely clean and very empty comments about the mysterious and brilliant rock legend that does not deserve to remember this History Channel biography , your grandparents can fall asleep on a Sunday night.
