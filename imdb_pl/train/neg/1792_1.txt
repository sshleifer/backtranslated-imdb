Let me start this review by saying: I love movies about vampires. They can suck (they're going to play) and I'll still love them because vampires are just cool in movies. Van Helsing, considered by many to be a steamy pile of nonsense, was pleasant to me because of the fact that there were vampires. You may ask, "What does this have to do with this movie?" The answer is: I'm going to inform you about how scary this movie is, that even a harharhar for movies about vampires like me can so despise a movie like that. <br /> <br /> Movie stars Van Helsing, a college professor who is not convincing at all. He is a terrible actor, like everyone in this movie, and he wrote it to add salt to the wound. Honestly, I did not want to offend him and I'm sure everyone had a good time creating this movie, but watching it was actually painful. I'm not sure why I watched the whole thing; maybe it was a morbid fascination, like watching an impending railway disaster: it's horrible, but you can not force yourself to look away. His main mistake is that he is so boring, and his story is so damn funny, even for science fiction horror. <br /> <br /> But digression. By the way, Van Helsing has sex with her mother. Of course, he does not know it's her then; he just thinks he is one of his students (which is still illegal and everything but not so disgusting and horrible). <br /> <br /> If I was Van Helsing, at least I would get Oedipus alone when I find out I did something so disgusting. It would make one funny thing if he just commented, but no. The point is not even touched by any of the characters. It's as if the writer did not even think about it. I would at least have another character laughing at him and saying, "Ha ha, you've had sex with your mom", which would be mildly funny (though grossly immature). Probably I ended up with a place, so a few words that will discourage you from watching this movie: it's a vampire's fight with a ninja with an old man. That would be fun, but the filmmakers expect us to take seriously. It's not worth even watching a movie to see how bad it is. Stay away, far away from it, if you value your time at all. <br /> <br /> I will say something positive about the film: the guy who plays Van Helsing is pretty good with his knife. There is a minute episode in which it revolves around a knife and performs really cool tricks. It would be boring in every other film, but here, unfortunately, it was the most important event.
