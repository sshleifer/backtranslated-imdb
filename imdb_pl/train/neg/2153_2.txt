Three-dimensional film "A man who was not there" means DUMB, DUMB, DUMB! This inept comedy contains poor three-dimensional effects, thanks to which the three-dimensional effects in "Jaws 3", "Amityville 3" and "Friday 13 parts 3" look better in comparison. Not to mention that the film is so extreme. It was one of many films from 1983, in which pop-off-screen effects were applied. Steve Guttenberg and Jeffrey Tambor were trapped in this mess, but at least they did not kill their careers. Tambor appeared in the HBO film The Larry Sanders Show and Ron Howard's box office "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" while Guttenberg followed the "Police Academy" and "Cocoon". What in these projects instead of them here in "A man who was not there". If so, you will regret it. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * (out of four)
