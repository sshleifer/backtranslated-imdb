aktorski / manipulated documentary about one of the darkest places in Guatemala. presented as fun, safe ... but a sad place, or a group of sex workers played in a football team, collected in less than a week! the main purpose of the documentary is to prove that society pushes this kind of "workers", despite the fact that it will never be possible to find a solution for these poor women, except that the people who documented them made "stars" (like the title he says so) in exchange for using it to create this documentary. however, it has its own documented reality ... but unfortunately it has nothing to do with the main story. I would not agree to see him again; but I recommend only for general cultural purposes.
