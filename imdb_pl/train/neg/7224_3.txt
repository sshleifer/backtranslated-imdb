The film stays in gray for too long. Very little is explained as the film progresses, resulting in many strange sequences that seem to have a deeper meaning, but because of the way the story is simply strange and unintelligible. This forces you to watch the movie again, but I will not do it in any way. The fact that I watched the film in the morning, I am sure that if I watched the film in the evening, I would fall asleep. For me, the movie was like "Blade Runner". <br /> <br /> The film leaves too many questions and improbabilities. This makes the film leave a senseless and impermanent impression. <br /> <br /> Also, the strange look of the film does not help much. The movie has half of CGI / half of real life, but it's not half as good, impressive, spectacular and ingenious as, for example, in later films such as "Sin City" and "300". They even created half of the form of the movie using a computer, which seemed a very senseless and strange choice, also taking into account that the character animation does not look very impressive. Sure, the futuristic environment is still good looking, and of course the movie was not cheap to perform, but its style over the content and in this case really is not positive to say. <br /> <br /> Some lines are also absolutely scary and uninteresting. The main God of the film constantly says such lines as; "I'm going to do it, but it's not your fear why I want to do it." Than just say nothing, Mr. Horus! It's annoying and very easy to put in a movie if you do not want to explain anything about the story. Also, the deeper questions and meanings of the film are mixed up in the drift of the film and its script. <br /> <br /> The actors continued to do their best. They seemed to believe in the project and were sure that what they were doing would be something special. So I can not say anything negative about them. <br /> <br /> History and film are not original. It breaks away from many classic and semi-classical, mainly modern science-fiction movies. Perhaps this is also the reason why the film made a very unnecessary impression on me. <br /> <br /> An unsuccessful and uninteresting film experiment. <br /> <br /> 3/10
