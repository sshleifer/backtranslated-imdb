Before I watched this movie, I read a review here, in which I found that this movie may be one of the best films ever! ha ha Scene by stage, the tension is growing in order ... from the annoying characters in this movie. From a little girl talking gibberish and trying to drown a little boy, to a killer who runs without any notice (and who was this guy on the beach talking to a little boy?) Unanswered in this movie. When I looked, it seemed like the movie was moving in one direction and then it just does not go anywhere, but in a new direction ... and then ... <br /> <br /> Acting is great, but the writing is horrible. Every character in every scene speaks or does something so unbelievable, unrealistic, and the reactions of other actors / extras are simply strange.There are no solutions to problems created throughout the movie, which makes it confusing and ultimately a great waste of time.
