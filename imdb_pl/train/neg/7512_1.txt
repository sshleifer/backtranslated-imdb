I had to leave the theater. After an hour, all I've seen are people cheating on their wives, schtupping like dogs in a rut and using the word f for a diabetic using Equal. <br /> <br /> No, thank you. <br /> <br /> It was particularly frustrating because the movie could do a lot. Each of the characters could be quite interesting if they were given more to do than commit adultery, talk about it, and curse each other. <br /> <br /> Several times it looked like it was supposed to be a kind of character development, everything that happened was a different sex scene. Development of the plot in the first hour can be summarized as 1) comes to several murders, 2) Vinnie sees the scene of murder 3) Vinnie looks moodily at the Atlantic / East / Hudson river 4) Vinnie cheats on his wife and 5) Joey (the most nice character in the show) is expelled from the parents' house. What's more, I did not wait until I saw. <br /> <br /> The photography and the interaction between the characters were great, but WE HAVE NOTHING for them. The flood of sex and vulgarity was not worth waiting for the next hour to make SOMETHING happen. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, Spike. Take a few lessons from Notting Hill or Shawshank Redemption. Each of them is a better study in social and interpersonal relations.
