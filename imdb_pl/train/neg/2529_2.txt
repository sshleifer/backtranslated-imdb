Bobby is a goofy kid who smiles too much and wants sex. So he buys a van to help with this task. Acting is poor, the comedy is pathetic, and the script is nothing more than a loose chain of stereotypes and cheap emotions. The creators of the film apparently wanted to capture some of the madness of other films of those times, but they failed. They even resort to Bobby, who slips into the banana skin, because it will probably add comedic value. <br /> <br /> I'm trying to find the redeeming part of the movie. If you like DeVito, this is another classic role for DeVito - but he is just a supporting actor and does not matter.
