Another flag of British cinema staggered. Real garbage is offered again. I do not understand (and I am British), why it happened that there was ever a patriotic nonsense. Eight years have marked you since World War II really ended! Other commentators drew attention to the editing and seemingly trouble-free use of archival materials. This is very poorly observed. The archive material is in abundance. Model aircraft swings with wires in "action scenes" like many kites for children in the wind. Ordinary sequences of maps in the room tattoo a film to probably drag him into the whole event in Malta. Guinness must have its worst performance ever. The shocking scenes of fighting dogs are funny. Hawkins bores us to death in a room on the map. Ealing made a lot of great movies. This is obviously not one of them. They should have avoided such unconvincing decay!
