As a Turkish man currently living in Sweden, I have to admit that I often watch Scandinavian movies. Most if you never understand them. I think the actors from Scandinavia work best in Hollywood. Last week I watched the movie "Polish wedding" with my Polish friend and we both said it was the worst movie we've ever watched. Unfortunately, I was wrong that the movie "House of Angels" is even worse. None of the actors can act, absolutely no woman the so-called star Helen Bergstrom. The plot is so stupid that no one can believe it. a lot of bad acting except Sellald and Wollter. Ahmed Sellam
