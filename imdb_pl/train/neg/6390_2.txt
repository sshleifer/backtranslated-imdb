I saw about a thousand horrors. (my favorite type) This movie is one of the worst. For me, the idea drives the movie. So even a poorly made, cheap movie can be good. Something strange is definitely cheap. However, he has little to say. I still do not understand what the karate scene initially has to do with the movie. Something strange has little to offer. Save yourself the pain!
