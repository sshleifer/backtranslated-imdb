Religious Bill Maher is not an attack on organized religion. This is an attack on Christianity and Islam. In addition to ridiculing the gang of rabbis who invented warped machines to circumvent the rules of the Sabbath, he does not really attack Judaism and seems furious when the rabbi actually questions the existence of the State of Israel. If Bill Maher followed his hypothesis to a logical conclusion, he would realize that the very creation of Israel in the Palestinian Territories is based on the so-called "Holy Books" of organized religion. This is evidence of his total lack of objectivity or focus on creating this film. <br /> <br /> It's really hard for me to believe that this man is an atheist, or even so intelligent. Anyone can approach a religious person and laugh at them and call them stupid because of their beliefs, but what do you have to offer them in return? He never tells them why he thinks they are stupid. What makes him a "rational" person in the room? In a sense, it reflects how it really is not and in this process it ends to look just as stupid as these people. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a good movie / documentary about a real evil religion and how religion can actually be harmful to human civilization, see "The Root of All Evil Richard Dawkins." This is a well-researched documentary, clearly defining what he hopes to achieve and how. <br /> <br /> Bill Maher's Religulous is not funny, does not pose any interesting questions or give you insight into such a controversial topic. It seems that these are the bullshit and madness of an old man dissatisfied with his Catholic upbringing. I almost pity him.
