It is an unnecessary science-fiction channel for television, which tells the story of Beowulf, especially after the latest 2005 movie "Beowulf and Grendel." This film does not really get into Beowulf's story, but it moves us through its fight against the predatory beast known as Grendel, who leaves the kingdom in absolute fear and confusion while a powerful Viking warrior, Beowulf, is called to release their monster frenzy. If that works, the king will no longer have to sacrifice the children to stop them. After several unsuccessful attempts, the creature is killed, but his angry and vengeful mother soon attacks, leaving Beowulf to re-lend his powerful acts of courage and strength to defeat him. "Grendel" looks like it was filmed with a small budget, and the effects of CG are terrible. As I said, this movie is absolutely unnecessary.
