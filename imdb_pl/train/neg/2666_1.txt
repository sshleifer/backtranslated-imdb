Honestly, if someone has a brain, there is not one positive thing to say about this movie, what ever. <br /> <br /> I lost $ 1 by renting it. I'd rather laugh at Will Smith saying, "If you have a dream, you have to protect him." <br /> <br /> all the actors had to be bored or did not have fame at the time. even Matthew Mc Conahay *, whatever you spell it, * was better than all the actors in this movie, when he played psycho in Texas Chainsaw 4. If you see this movie and you have something good to say, IQ, you have to be very low with such a bad taste in movies hurt. Thank you ... and TRUTH was spoken! <br /> <br /> Save yourself from misery. <br /> <br /> Get Devil's Rejects, now it's classic.
