Sometimes during the movie I would like to be killed. The only reason I survived the whole movie was that I could not believe how bad it really was and thought it had to be better. It was really a horror movie. I was terrified that I had wasted what seemed to me the 4 hours of my life that I would never come back. I spent the remaining two hours on mourning after losing. Recommend this movie to anyone you want to torture and say that tension will kill him.
