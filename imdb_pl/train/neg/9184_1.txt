F * ck Me! I've seen incredibly terrifying movies in those days, but it requires p * ss! <br /> <br /> Honestly, I can not express in words what the movie really is. In addition to the story, which does not really exist, a comical acting game, comically terrifying excuses for zombies; You know what, I could go all day. Every little thing in this movie is stupid, senseless, nonsense or embarrassing. I express to anyone who wants to watch this movie ... no! <br /> <br /> I am ashamed to tell you that I have it on my stand. It's hidden in the goddamn bottom of a huge pile. I could not even force that horse about the movie. That's wrong.
