I saw this movie yesterday. I must admit that it was not my cup of tea. Although this is to be a horror of this kind. But when I watched it, I thought ... "This movie does not make any sense ..." Where was this guy in the dark coat coming from? Where were the two guys when they left the girls behind? Where did the shark come from? <br /> <br /> All of these elements in this movie did not add up in some way. I felt like these filmmakers had wasted so much time and money on a film that was so mushy. <br /> <br /> I have seen many good horrors in my time, but this is one of the worst horrors I've ever seen. At the end of the movie, I told myself that I would not watch him again. So many pathetic performances in this movie, I decided to give him a thumbs up! Count me on this! 0 out of 10!
