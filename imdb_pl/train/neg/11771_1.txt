This was shown at the 59th International Festival in Edinburgh, though for reasons best left to the authorities. It seems that a lot of it is the first film in Thai, created with Thai actors and crew, but directed by a man from the West. I do not have to worry about being honest because this movie is boring, boring, boring. Why point to something, why wrap an idea into a secret, why subtly evoke a feeling when you can drive a point home with scary voice interceptors, obvious shots and over top scenes Spurrier awkwardly throws out endless stereotypes. No hints, no guessing, everything on the screen, no need to use our imagination. I wonder when the "terrifying" piece is coming? No, you will not, because the soundtrack will become more and more intimidating, reaching the crescendo ominously. Hell, I'm making up words to describe how bad it looks. I wonder if the conjured demon is real or imaginary? Why tax - it's really a snake, and it's really biting his crotch and blood is splattered everywhere. it's a strange, restless movie for several reasons. It is supposed to be a horror movie, but it is not terrifying - shocks are marked and obvious. This may be a vicious attack on the secluded side of Thailand, but the director has a disgusting, slippery style when it comes to showing barely maturing teenagers. Maybe he threw himself in the west as a virgin who sowed seeds of doubt in my head. Or maybe all these were just pants. Miserable, bland, repetitive, well-worn - all candidates for the best description, but boring seems the most appropriate and honest. All of this has been seen before, probably better, often with more thoughts, rarely with less imagination or with a flare. Excuse me. Thumbs down for each number. Really terrible.
