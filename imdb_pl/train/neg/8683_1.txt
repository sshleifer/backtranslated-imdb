This performance is not wise. It basically comes down to this. The "original humor" that these writers try to avoid in order to avoid completely biting off the rest of the worlds. In another comment, someone quotes some funny lines. The distinction for me was George H.W. Bush tells the children that they should not watch television outside Fox News. Wow. I thought the episodes I saw were bad. The fact that this line is the highlight of the series is pathetic. <br /> <br /> My problem with the drivel like this sad excuse for political satire is that these people get the second season. I am a liberal republican and I know that Bush was not a good president. We all do. But that does not justify the expiration of this completely waste of time. I put these writers on the same level as the geniuses behind "Meet the Spartans". Their formula, play as many obscene themed jokes as you can and throw in even worse the original material in order to be able to give yourself credit. <br /> <br /> Again, just bad. Amazing, and it makes me more unhappy that such nonsense is being renewed, but amazing and original programs, such as Arrested Development, are preserved after 3 solid seasons. Please, do not watch this shit unless you're one of those green-blooded liberal hippies who think that any sentence with the words Bush and stupid is comedic gold. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Bush's voice sucks. The only thing he does is to imitate the Texas accent and exhale really hard at the end of the sentence. At least South Park admits that the voices are not accurate. If you want a funny political satire, take a look at the Daily Show / Colbert. Or look for political sketches on Robot Chicken, which is nice to watch, because the animation of the time-lapse figure is VERY well done. Look for George Bush as a piece of Jedi on youtube. Priceless
