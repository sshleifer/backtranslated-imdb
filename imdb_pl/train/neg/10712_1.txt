This is undoubtedly one of the worst films, EVER, I emphasize, EVER. Worse, my old Dolph hero is in it and he plays it. Jesus ... The story is quite good, but the way it was carried out made even my body ache. The battle scenes at the beginning are just as choreographic as the fight between two drunks hitting the gutter. Actors, with the exception of Dolph who sucks too, are playing so badly that you can not help but wonder if their reason is that they are all friends of the director, who by the way had to be the most absent if not all the time. This is ยง12 million spent in an unimaginable way, because the cost and scenery can not exceed 1,000.
