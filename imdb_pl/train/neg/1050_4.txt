Nathan Detroit leads illegal dice games for high-ranking players in New York, but the heat is on and he can not find a safe place. He bets the chronic gambler Sky Masterson that Sky can not force the main missionary, Sarah Brown, to go with him to dinner. Sky takes up the challenge, but both men have some surprises in the store ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ???????? and performances for matching; Broadway photographed on a big screen if you like things that I do not have. My main problem with this type of film is simply music. I like all kinds of music, from Albinoni to ZZ Top, but the melodies on Broadway at the swings with endless trumpets Pah-pah-tah-dah at the end of every fourth bar are not my cup of tea. This was written by a team of tags by Frank Loesser, Mankiewicz, Jo Swerling and Abe Burrows (based on several stories by Damon Runyon), and although the plot is quite friendly, the songs are weak. For example, two Blaine numbers are identical, unnecessary, do not shift the plot and scaffolding on the ears (and are also misogynistically gross if they interfere with it). There are only two unforgettable tunes, Luck Be A Lady (sung by Brando, not Sinatra, as you'd expect) and Sit Down, You're Rockin 'The Boat (nicely done by Kaye), but you have to sit for two hours to get to them. The asset of the film is young Brando, who gives a thoughtful, relaxed performance; he also sings quite well and even dances a little and is evenly matched to the always interesting Simmons. The sequence in which two of them flee to Havana overnight is a pleasant respite from Noo Yawk's noise, hectic and murder. Fans of musicals can dig it, but in my opinion the musical has to do more than just film a stage performance.
