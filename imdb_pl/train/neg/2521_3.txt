There are many problems with this movie, but the most important thing is that he tried to do too little. The basic story is quite good, but the money simply was not to make the story justice. A non-existent budget really killed this movie. Stuart Gordon (screenwriter / director) wrote a book on "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," which was a box office hit. However, this movie had serious financial support from Disney. Honestly, this is a good example when you do not make a movie. If he waited a few years, the technology would make performing many effects cheaper. (not to mention that he could find a company with money).
