The only good thing about this unusual kickback is that I did not have to pay for it. I saw it for free in college. And if the student can not find humor in something that was free, it is hopeless. <br /> <br /> Steely and bad jokes can not be masked by a perfect, but stunning set design (which comes out of the way to launch the Volkswagon Beetles). I do not know what Michaels Myers was doing in this movie, but I've never seen anything more depressing. It was just a glaring effort to take advantage of Grinch's previous success (who has his opponents, but I really enjoyed it). It is hard not to endure this failure and wonder what better projects have been donated to finance it. <br /> <br /> Do you want an entertaining Seuss adaptation? Go with Grinch.
