For a moment I watched Phat Beach on the cable and I liked it. Fat Man is the best character because he seems to be a nice guy. The rest of the heroes are just different stereotypes of young men and young black men. I like to watch those low-budget movies that capture a certain period of time, because they are almost like a documentary about the attitudes and modes of the year. Phat Beach is also fun because the low-budget babes in this movie are girls from home. Most low-budget movies have this "local babe", and children from this movie can be said to have been local strippers and lingerie models for JC Penneys. Some of them had so much cellulite hanging from their bikinis that it was fun to watch how "young" were crazy about something that was really abused, with a high mileage. There were also some cuties. It's the charm of these poor films with a low budget. You'll see a lot of poochs and some real cuties! I checked some of them on IMDb, and seven years later Phat Beach is their only loan. Detriment. It would be interesting if someone ever had the book "Where are you now" on all the cuties that appeared in the history of the movies, and then they never came back. What happened?? There are probably one or two young people in every movie that seem to have a lot to do, but after years of watching TV again, you're wondering "what happened to X?" In any case, this movie is mostly blowing, but he has some fun moments.
