I am glad that I can read so many negative comments about the plot of Tritter. Everyone I talk to is saying the same thing. They like the harsh nature of House and his intelligence, but they really do not like the vindictiveness of this continuous conspiracy. It cuts into the true nature of the history of the hospital and makes everyone angry at police power. He must have a more protective character instead of being vindictive to everyone in the hospital. In addition, there seem to be many dubious legal aspects regarding what Tritter does. Only he can not freeze bills and has the right to stop doctors from writing prescriptions for patients. A lot of vindictiveness, which turns out, also hurts very sick patients in the hospital and is not a good story to present. I voted for this episode, not because of the story itself, but when you put in a piece of Trittor, it turns me on, and the rest of the story is hurt by him. Change it. Get out Tritter.
