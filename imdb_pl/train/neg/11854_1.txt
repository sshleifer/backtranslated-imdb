Throughout my life I do not understand the good reviews of this piece of nonsense. It was pointless. Matthew Modine was terribly lost as a leading female man. Gina Gershon, well, others have said it, but I will repeat why this stupid accent? Completely unnecessary. And her acting was just bad. I do not know if it was cast by accent or what. There was no chemistry between them. <br /> <br /> And the girl in which Modine was in love suddenly slipped half of the lettuce into her mouth and acted sheepishly? Where does it come from? I think we ought to feel sorry for her when we saw her husband and wife getting apart, but to be honest, I did not care about any of these people.
