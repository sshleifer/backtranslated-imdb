The whole world said that the movie Tashan will be a good movie with great pleasure, but it is not. Vijay Krishna Acharya made a serious mistake by taking the role of actress Kareena Kapoor. It was unbearable throughout the movie. Her boy's appearance does not look good. Even a movie in which the story of the film does not make sense. Everyone said Quetin Taratino from India was Vijay, but not Quetin at all. Talent Anil Kapoor was involved in this stupid movie. Anil is an actor of great caliber and this movie is not. Akshay Kumar also fell victim to this film because it is all Saif. Style and Phoormola are not very good in this film. I was disappointed
