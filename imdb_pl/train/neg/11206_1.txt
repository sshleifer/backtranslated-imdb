No one is a bigger Flashman Geroge Macdonald Fraser magazine fan than me. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see that Richard Lester directed the Royal Flash, because I also see that he did three / four Musketeers with Fraser, who turned out to be quite good. <br /> <br /> Not so Royal Flash. <br /> <br /> I was 12 years old when the movie was released and I could not have been more enthusiastic since I read all of Flashman's papers published up to that time and I've been into A Clockwork Orange and Malcolm MacDowel (I'm still, but never was given give him a chance). <br /> <br /> What a disappointment (I saw it again when I was about 20 years on TV and it seemed even worse). <br /> <br /> No sharp dialogue in the books is transferred to the screen. It seemed to me that the Flashman comedy was badly treated in the same way that you can imagine a group of high school students who try to parody it. The duel and fencing were terrible and laid back. <br /> <br /> Looking back with more mature eyes, the film failed to take advantage of the possibility of direct satire of earlier film versions of Zenda's Prisoner. <br /> <br /> If you've read the book and have not seen the movie, I can only say that the movie ends with Flashman and Rudi von Starnberg becoming quick friends and playing a game that Rudi just came up with: Russian roulette. <br /> <br /> A pitiable betrayal of everything books are about. <br /> <br /> My comments would have been more direct if I had seen the movie lately, but I'm glad I did not. <br /> <br /> If by chance Fraser ever reads this, I can only say that I consider him a genius - perhaps the greatest comic novelist of his generation, but based on my appreciation for this corpus of work, it's hard to believe that he wrote the script for this movie because he did all the horrible films of James Bond Roger Moore.
