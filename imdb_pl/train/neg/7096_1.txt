It's amazing that it manages to be scary on so many levels. The screenplay, acting, directing and cast selection are terrifying. Costumes, sets and pseudo-medieval language are also awful. I liked this movie in a strange way, when I accepted that it would not be good. It is a pity that people devote so much time and effort to producing something so poor that they could really create something decent (although not very reliable!), But instead we are treated quite boringly a story about dragons and knights, which lacks the charm that can be found in other such fantasy movies. Let's hope the Lord of the Rings is a little better! Oh, and David Thewlis's hairstyle makes him look like He-Man. It does!
