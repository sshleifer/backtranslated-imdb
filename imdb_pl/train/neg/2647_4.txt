I will say one thing to Jeanette and Nelson - even when they are stuck in carefree, godless, painfully inept music like this, there is still flickering in them. Yes, chemistry between the famous duo exists even when the material is thin as paper. Even if the score is practically a one-off, non-existent depending on a few catchy melodies. And even if the circumstances are so unbelievable - yes, even for fantasy. <br /> <br /> To be honest, she has more chemistry with Nelson than with her real husband Gene Raymond in SMILIN THROUGH, but that was a much better movie. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, I love Jeanette and Nelson the same as the next fan, but that's the bottom of the pile. Jeanette is more than embarrassing in his one "hep" with Binnie Barnes - and Nelson can come up with a blank look in the most absurd situations. <br /> <br /> You can only wonder what it was like on Broadway in 1938. Certainly it must have been more joke and style than it is seen in this poor production of MGM. Edward Everett Horton can not handle the role, and none of the supporting players can breathe life into this mess. It's like an amateur night in the studio, even if several professionals are showered with casts. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: Painfully clumsy rendering of Rodgers and Hart musical. I can not recommend it, even for fans of MacDonald and Eddy. And even if Jeanette's close-ups still shine with her beautiful spiderwebs, this movie is happily angry.
