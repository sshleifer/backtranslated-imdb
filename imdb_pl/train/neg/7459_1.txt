save your money and see something else. this movie was so shitty. I did not want to go, but I had to think so that I would laugh at least once, NOPE. Not one laugh, it was so scary! chris kattan will never get a good comedic role and a "night in roxbury". this film is completely obvious, there is no intelligent humor and repeats itself over and over again. Listen to me and get away from this movie!
