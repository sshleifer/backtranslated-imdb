I've seen some bad movies in my life, but this one must be one of the worst. Definitely the bottom of 100 materials (imo, i.e.). <br /> <br /> We follow two pairs, Dodds (Billy Bob Thornton as Lonnie Earl and Natasha Richardson as Darlene) and Kirkendalls (Patrick Swayze as Roy and Charlize Theron as Candy) in one car during the tour of Reno. <br /> <br /> Apparently Lonnie is not too happy with her sex life, so he cheats on his wife, Candy, who is desperately trying to have a baby. Meanwhile, Roy is not too sure his sperm is alright, so the doctor checks him. <br /> <br /> Now I read the back of the DVD, but my girlfriend did not, and she blurted out after about 20 minutes: "oh yes, she's pregnant, but her husband can not have a baby." Spot, because this movie is very predictable. Just as boring. Irritating. Irrelevant. Offensive. Horrible. <br /> <br /> An example of how this movie stinks. Two couples set out on their big car in Nevada, when 2 policemen stopped them because they did not stop at the stop sign. The guys know each other and finally bribe two officers with beer. This scene is not only pointless and is not important (or even important) for the movie, but it takes about 5 minutes! Just talk, talk and talk, not going somewhere. <br /> <br /> I still have to vomit thinking about finishing. Apparently Roy has NO problems there, so he is the father of a child. How many times it happens in movies ... try something new! The cheated wife ultimately forgives her husband and best friend for the affair and everyone lives happily ever after. Yuck. <br /> <br /> The best movie scene is at the end, with a few shots of the Grand Canyon. Why could not they just hold the camera for 90 minutes? <br /> <br /> You would expect more from this cast (though Thornton really tries), but you can not really blame them. Writers, you are ashamed! <br /> <br /> 1/10.
