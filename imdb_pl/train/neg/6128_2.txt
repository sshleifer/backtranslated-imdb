This movie was boring! <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some funny moments and jokes, but you can not resist the whole movie! <br /> <br /> Characters are too stereotypical, there is no real story - but short episodes with weird side characters that are not bizarre enough to make the story real. because most of the actors are recognized in Hungary, the secret is why they took roles. <br /> <br /> This is not * a new hope for a Hungarian movie. It was boring, though it was supposed to be real or exceptional. They could try a lot harder ... 2 out of 10
