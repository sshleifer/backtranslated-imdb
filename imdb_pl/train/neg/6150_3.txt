I saw this movie with the intention of not liking it. Certainly not. This is one of those movies that seem to be created exclusively for the Oscars: music in the entire movie almost in every frame, almost no vulgarity, embedded in long ago times, in sepia, in a pretentious title, no sex and genius that explains everything what he thinks and ends in sfx / cgi so that we (stupid recipients) receive it. One thing that made me laugh was the fact that they wrote THE HEAVY NOBEL PRICE! Instead, they are called the Nobel price (named in honor of a real person named Alfred Nobel) "a noble price" ... Jesus! How can you make such a mistake in such a large production, supposedly based on real history. What a fiction! What did you and others think about RON?
