Thomas Archer (Ron Eldard) killed his child, and his wife fiercely attacked in the home invasion. Dr. Heller (Christopher Plummer) tries to help him with post-traumatic stress. Then Archer meets a man (Til Schweiger) bound and gagged in a chair. It is said that a man killed his child and attacked his wife, and he can do whatever he likes. And there is a large selection of instruments that will help him ... <br /> <br /> In the beginning the movie is interesting (and shows real restraint about blood and gore), but it gets dumber and minute by minute probable twists. Everything ends with a finale that was so old and stupid that I was shocked that everyone could think about using it. How such talented actors as Eldard, Schweiger and Plummer get involved in such nonsense is beyond me. We get three stars for acting, but a stupid plot and really unbelievable twists make this a difficult task.
