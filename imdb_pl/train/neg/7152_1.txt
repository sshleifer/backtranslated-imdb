Based on an independent novel by one-time friend and groupie F. Scott Fitzgerald, columnist Sheila Graham wrote this kitschy story. Gregory Peck leads in shameless excess as a strong, drunk or accursed alcoholic; in contrast to the delicate and soft, spoken, real Scott Fitzgerald. Focusing on the era of Fitzgerald's writing in Hollywood, late in his life, the highly-honored author lived in a peaceful life and successfully fought alcoholism at a time when AA was not yet well known. Fitzgerald was not too proud of recycling his stories to support both his wife (in a psychiatric hospital) and his daughter (in college). Living in a small flat and running a second-hand Chevrolet, his life was 180 degrees different than the one shown in this film. <br /> <br /> Virtually every movie from the twentieth century in Fox realized during the management of Daryl F. Zanucka, and actually every movie directed by Henry King was a work of perfection. Beloved Infidel was an exception.
