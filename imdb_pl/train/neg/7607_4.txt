- When the local sheriff is killed, his wife takes power until he decides to clean up the city. However, not everyone in the city is happy with what he does. When the sheriff orders a curfew in town, the local saloon owner (also a woman) hires an assassin to take care of the sheriff. The owner of the limousine can not know that the sheriff and murderer will fall in love. <br /> <br /> - a gunslinger is an example of what happens when you have a fairly interesting concept and combine it with a poor performance. Somewhere here is a good movie that tries to get out. In more capable hands or with a larger budget, Gunslinger could be a fun look at the role of women in the Old West. How is it, Gunslinger is a sloppy movie mess. <br /> <br /> - There are so many things wrong in the film: a helpful cast with no acting skills, no residual and unnatural dialogue, and sets the look like sets. But the biggest criminal is assembly. I was amazed at how many times the scene began with actors (and horses), of course, waiting for Corman to shout "Action." The best is the scene of two horse riders who are standing next to the building. Suddenly they start and run around the corner, as if they were going hard for several miles. Or take the example of people who may seem to be moving through the city. We see a man entering the building and a second later appear in the city to climb a horse. <br /> <br /> - It's not that Corman did not have some decent actors to work with. Although none of them was a great star, Beverly Garland, John Ireland and Allison Hayes were able to achieve good results. But in Gunslinger they do not have much to work. <br /> <br /> - I have now seen versions of MST3K and other than MST3K movie. I definitely recommend the MST3K route.
