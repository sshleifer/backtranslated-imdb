"This is not a great mechanical toy," says the character at the beginning, commenting on "Jaws". Well, "Blood Surf" would like to have a beast as convincing as a "Jaw" shark. In other words, the digital special effects of this movie are horrible. Acting and directing are not much better either; they seem more appropriate for a deodorant or chewing gum than for a horror movie. The attitude of the people who worked on this film shows contempt not only for the genre, but also for the public. Saying that you "liked" this film only encourages filmmakers to offer us more of this shit, further destroying the poor genre of horror movies. (* 1/2)
