When I looked at this year's WrestleMania match card, I was very excited and could not control myself because I was full of emotions. <br /> <br /> It starts ... and it ends. <br /> <br /> I am sitting there, angry at the hell because of how much I wanted to get my money back. I mean, you're watching WrestleMania 22 (one of my favorites), which will go down to the classics, and then you expect the same and get the average rubbish that you have from time to time. The only moment in the whole series that ruined me was the moment when HBK tapped !!!! It was at this moment that HBK lost to JOHN PRICE !!!!!!!!!! John Cena is such a loser / poser. Wrestling almost ruined me when he beat TRIPLE H! I could not watch WWE after watching Wrestlemania 23. I start to watch him again (thankfully). Again, I believe in WWE after WrestleMania 24 (the largest I have ever seen), which was pure classic Wrestlemania. He definitely made up for "Mania 23" and gave us many unforgettable moments. <br /> <br /> If you watched EVERYONE with Wrestlemanias before those who turn you into fans (Wrestlemania 20 turned me into a fan), PLEASE, do not watch this and make the same mistake I made and leave WWE . And if you look at it and you're angry, you'll start watching it again and watching Wrestlemania 24, it's absolutely classic.
