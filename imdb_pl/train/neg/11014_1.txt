It's the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. It says quite a bit, considering some of the choices I made at movie rentals. <br /> <br /> I got this on netflix entirely based on the fact that someone with whom I went to high school is topless. The topless scene lasted about 5 seconds, and the rest of the movie was just as funny as playing the pungee sticks stuck under my toenails, while she was forced to listen to Roseanne singing the Big Spender. <br /> <br /> The skits "are stupid and consist of the worst kind of humor of underage bathrooms and gags from the locker room, and it's such a blatant (and bad) stoning movie The Kentucky Fried Movie that you'll be begging Big Jim Slade for a fall Wall and save us from the stupidity of "Vince Offer" (whoever it is). <br /> <br /> Unless you're a masochist, avoid this heap of trash.
