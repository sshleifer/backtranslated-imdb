I'm not surprised that even cowgirls have blues, if this movie is something that you can go through. I was expecting something better than Uma Thurman, which was the reason why I went through this experience. It's a horrible movie in which only music is salvific quality. It is a pity that we are not able to give 0 out of 10 in these reviews. This movie deserves it.
