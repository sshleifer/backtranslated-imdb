This movie is incomprehensibly bad. It starts with a few accidental explosions, and then pruning the T-Rex sock puppet, who is talking (!) With the audience. He wanders back and forth between dolls and sock animations, probably because the filmmakers could not afford to perform live. I will save you a long, tiring, unyielding plot that pulls this pathetic movie after brutal 85 minutes. <br /> <br /> One of my friends found this very rare movie in a hobby store that sells b movies, and he bought them only for fun, but as it turns out, our intervention was not necessary. This movie laughs better than we could. <br /> <br /> I thought "Plan 9 from outer space" by Ed Wood was the most popular movie, but he left it to Japanese cars / Lego / sockies to outdo him. If you see this movie anywhere, buy it without hesitation. It is very rare and worth many, many good laughs.
