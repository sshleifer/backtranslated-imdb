I am a Christian and I say that this film had horrible acting, unreal situations and a completely frontal front of Christianity. You might as well see "Remember the Titans" and at least not mix Christ in a football movie, like a steroid steroid for losers. Let me give you some urgent comments about what bothered me in this film. <br /> <br /> 1. The school was in Georgia and was a school of white academy. I did not notice a single black student or school player. I am dealing with white "Christian" academies in the south and they were built for a different reason than to restore segregation. This is disturbing when the film tells about Christianity and the life-changing Christ ... and maybe change the hearts of segregation? (Note: I loved the black chip coach, as with the completely white team and all black Giants players.) <br /> <br /> 2. Uncritical recognition by all Christians about this film. Can I get some people to say that it's bad acting, bad filming, bad writing and shortage compared to other movies. If we compared it to another football movie, would it have the same charisma and energy? <br /> <br /> 3. Half-baked Christianity, which was shown, made even less sense to me than an unrealistic ending. If Christianity is about simply reading the scriptures and praying for a complete change in life, then do not be surprised if no one listens to what the Christians have to say. We want to sell Christ as a cure for everything. It does not need to be sold and does not have to be attached to such a capricious lifestyle. No wonder everyone believes Christianity to be anti-intellectual in this unrealistic presentation. <br /> <br /> I recognize that this film can be inspiring for a few people. For most, it will not. It will not give a real picture of struggle and honest tension. The most important thing for me is that it is neither Christian nor extended. It has values, but it does not fit into the "pull-up-by-the-bootstraps" message, as shallow as positive thinking. If you live with people who are fighting and / or live in third world conditions, this movie will be empty, because most churches today are in their religion.
