I just got back from the movie and I'm totally terrified. This film is an absolute mockery for all mankind. The theater in which I was may have four other people. This film was recommended to me and I could not believe that this person likes it. I can not believe that any reasonable person would want it. There was no chart. NO MULTIPLE ACTIONS. It was a joke. How can you make a movie about nothing? This movie only shows why Hollywood is in this condition. I can only look at the spiral of the Horror industry and giggle. What a parody for all the filmmaking, this applies to all new "teen horror movies". It's all such garbage. Do not handle this type of laundry!
