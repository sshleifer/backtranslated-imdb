Apart from recognizing some nice cinematography, I can not say anything positive about this film. The only real problem is the main character's dilemma, whether to stay with your childhood friends in the world of misery, or leave them and take their own lives. The abundance of "emotionally strong" scenes does not fit this story, and due to bad acting they fail to create the intended atmosphere. The director only manages to present Anthony's dilemma and ultimately brings an easy solution. Characters do not seem to evolve, although it's difficult to talk about any characters ... except maybe Sonny. Apart from him, the actors do not play too much, and when some of them have to do it, they become devoted amateurs. I wonder what ruined the film: the superficial scenario, the expulsion of the plot's potential, or bad acting, interfering with any appeal that may remain.
