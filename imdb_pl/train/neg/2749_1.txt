This movie was very badly written. The figures did not have depth. They should never make this film. My 11-year-old son could have written a better script than Hyung-rae Shim. <br /> <br /> The only actor who did not suck was the zoo's guardian. He was the only funny and credible of many. <br /> <br /> I love movies and try to give them an advantage, but this one was on my lame list at number 2. Number 1 being Demonicus. <br /> <br /> For those who thought it was a good movie, you seriously need brain surgery. <br /> <br /> Most of the creatures in the movie were not even dragons ... so why did they call D-war?
