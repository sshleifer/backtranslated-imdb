Guy de Maupassant was a writer who wrote a novel about a man, a poor man, without any moral qualities. He just wanted to succeed in a society where all people, politicians, businessmen, journalists, and women are corrupt. The only king is MONEY. The hero Maupassant, Charles Forestier, is getting higher and higher on the scale of society due to his apparent appearance. He is in love with all women who could help him in his action of climbing into shreds of society. Towards the end of the novel, he married the biggest daughter of the owner of everyday paper in the largest Parisian church: "La Madeleine". "Le Tout Paris" is there. He has a fortune and more, he will become a member of parliament, and later a minister. "Useless" women are out of reach, but they always have contact with beautiful and useful women. The painting "PRIVATE AFFAIRS OF BEL AMI" is a story of MORALITY. That's all, but it's not a story in the Maupassant idea. Why did they put "BEL AMI" in their title?
