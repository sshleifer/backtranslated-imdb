When I saw the announcement of this movie, I thought it might be stupid, but at least it would be fun. Well, I was wrong. Although, somewhere deep down, the producers had interesting news to convey that parents are left alone and re-evaluate their lives, the way they tried to convey the message was horrible. The first fifty times something stupid happened to a couple was relatively fun. But in the end I could almost predict what would be a stupid event. <br /> <br /> In the whole movie, I like a total of five lines of dialogue, and everything else was mediocre at best, which is still more than I can say about the film itself.
