Medellin is a great place to live, work and study. I have been there twice and have never heard anything about guerrilla operations, paramilitary forces accepting tourists as hostages or anything similar. There are "invisible police", but this is not a Big Brother system. There is enough police to make them visible in everyday life, but they do not bother anyone without good reason. <br /> <br /> La Sierra is an interesting document in which the youth he presents in the film essentially become his characters. The directors of the film carefully plot the lines of the daily activities of the inhabitants of La Sierra, and when the "figure" dies, there is a real pathos. It is hard to imagine, however, that three young people are members of Bloque Metro, a gang that terrorized La Sierra before the Colombian government began to restructure the country. <br /> <br /> La Sierra is not an accurate representation of life in Colombia; there are of course things to watch out for, such as petty crime, but when we take into account that pocket theft happens in "modern" cities such as London, New York or Tokyo, Colombia does not seem so different. Colombians look forward to showing the world that a war-torn country is thriving more than ever.
