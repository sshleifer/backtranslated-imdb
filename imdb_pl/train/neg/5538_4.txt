This is not really a zombie movie if we define zombies as walking dead. Here the hero Armand Louque (played by the unbelievably young Dean Jagger) gains control over the method of creating zombies, although in fact his "method" is based on the mental designing of his thoughts and controlling the minds of other living people turning them into hypnotized slaves. This is an interesting concept of the film and was made much more efficiently by Fritz Lang in his series "Dr. Mabuse movies, including "Dr. Mabuse the Gambler '(1922) and' The Testament of Dr. Mabuse "(1933). Here, unfortunately, he is subordinated to his desire to regain the love of his former fianc√©e, Claire Duvall (played by Anne Heche, similar to the bad hair style, Dorothy Stone), which is really the main topic. <br /> <br /> The film has an intriguing start because Louque is sent to a military archaeological expedition to Cambodia to end the zombie cult he came from. In a relationship (where we get great sets of 30-year-olds and clothes), she announces an engagement with Claire, then only five minutes later gives him her ring, declaring her love to her friend, Clifford Grayson (Robert Noland). It's unintentionally funny how they talk to each other without eye contact. It would be a great movie for "Mystery Science Theater 3000" if they had not yet baked it. <br /> <br /> It has never been shown how Louque really learns the secret of "zombification", but then uses it to kill his enemies, create a gigantic army of rifles carrying soldiers and bodyguards. We will not see such willpower until John Agar in "The Brain From Planet Arous" (1957). <br /> <br /> Claire finally agrees to marry him if he allows Greyson to live and return to America. Louque agrees, but actually turns him into one of his hypnotized slaves. On the wedding night she realizes that Claire will love him if he gives up his "power". To win her love, she does so by calling the "rebellion" of the title in which all his slaves wake up and attack his relationship and kill him. Greyson embraces Claire and it seems that we are at the end of the parable: "Whom the gods will destroy, first go mad." <br /> <br /> So it really is not that bad, despite the low IMDb rating that it currently has. With repeated reviews (?) You can see the artistry in a well-formed script! Dean Jagger has not yet developed into a good actor and is almost unrecognizable in his youth - is it really his own hair? We remember him more from his bald, old roles in "White Christmas" (1954), "X The Unknown" (1956) and "King Creole" (1958). The story borrows many of the basic motifs of the Halperin brothers, the earlier film "White Zombie" (1932), in which the unfortunate Robert Frazier (as Charles Beaumont) uses "zombification" to win the love of Madge Bellamy (as Madeline Parker). <br /> <br /> If you want real zombie movies (of which there are hundreds!) I will start with "White zombie" (1932), "King of the Zombies" (1941), "I Walked with a Zombie" (1943) "Night of the Living Dead" (1968), "The Last Man on Earth" (1964) and her two remakes. In the modern era of classic films, there are "Horror Express" (1972), "The Serpent and the Rainbow" (1988), "28 Days Later" (2002) and its sequel, and many, many more. much to remember. <br /> <br /> This movie is not really a zombie movie. Judging by this film on its own terms, it is rather a semi-Gothic romance. In this way, it is slightly below some of the lower horror B movies from the late 30s and early 40s. So I'll give him 5.
