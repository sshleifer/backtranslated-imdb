I wanted to watch this movie, but one weird funny scene on the other forced me to turn it off. Characters do not react to anything. Consider this: Heath Ledger walks by night (I believe in the graveyard) when he is attacked by the ghosts who depart. After passing this trial, he goes away calmly and meets a friend who saw it all. Asked what is happening, he says gently: "attacked by demons, nothing serious." As if it was a bit more exciting than a flat tire. <br /> <br /> I turned them off when they ask something about a demon or something, I stopped looking after the question. The answer can be rented only to someone with the energy of their death, and the priest is watching what seems vague irritating when the man is tied and hanged, and they ask about his crushing, dying question. br /> 0 out of **** stars.
