Oh, it was a really bad movie. The girl who plays Jennifer is okay, but I think he's acting strangely in the movie, not because he has the ripped organs in the night, but because he thinks about firing his agent for putting her in this shit. Faye Dunaway behaves as if she was doing Mommy Dearest, and the ending is completely stupid. I really can not recommend this movie at all, even though as a fan of Edgar Allen Poe I was a little intrigued by references to his work (ravens, House of Usher-like family curse and being buried alive) - he would probably turn over in his grave if he knew about this movie.
