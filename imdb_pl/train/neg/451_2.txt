I do not care how many nominations this garbage has for this and that, this movie stinks. I did not know whether to switch off the set or submit a lawsuit with the lawyer O.J. for unjustified damage to my mental health. I rarely found it boring; calling it dung entertainment is a slap in the face of every viewer on the whole planet. The whole story was stupid, the acting was not inspired, the "drama" was devoid of emotion. I am grateful that I did not have to pay for this unfulfilled experience.
