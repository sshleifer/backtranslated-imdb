Writing on the screen is so stupid that it hurts me to waste 2 hours of my life I will never come back (where I heard it before). Acting is so-so. Things change so often that you can watch and wait for something macabre. Nevertheless, there is not one original thing in this movie. While the first Cube was a nerdian horror that did not make sense at all, the cube zero took on this and tries to repeat the same story, except that this time it's an unbearable point to try to explain all the details that the first movie did not answer. The comic is that the director reproduces the exact scenes of the first movie, which were a bit strange, and tries to explain them. But the scenes are simply copied, there is no consistency. This script is so pointless. I can imagine that it was written by some half-funny 15-year-old with a baseball cap and a pack of beer for a class project. The best part is that they mutilate the "good" guy wunderkind, and he becomes a delayed guy in the first movie and see him when they find him ("this room is green ..") in Cube 1997. Goodie gooodie, clap clapper, what surprise. First of all, if you have not seen the first one, it makes no sense that you do not notice it. Oh, another great idea: instead of numbers identifying the x, y coordinates of the room (cube 1997), this time it's 3 letters, each of which gives one of the 26 possible coordinate values. Duh. Except that now the permutations no longer make much sense ... so it allows the letters to disappear before anyone can use them. so many bad, inconsistent or just stupid ideas in this movie. Directors / writers are required to have a certain talent.
