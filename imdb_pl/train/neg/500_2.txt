The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance - what a funny title, it's so confusing. No wonder filmmakers try to mislead us because it is one awful movie. <br /> <br /> This story essentially involves the mystery of murder in a castle on a distant island. <br /> <br /> There is not much going on in this movie. And when something arouses the viewer from his dullness, it invariably is an unintentional comedy in the form of a cruel dialogue, led by a hopeless group of voice artists. These guys are so bad that they make the actors they give voices look like a group of moron remedies. It's really hard to determine how bad this game works when you dub it badly. But artists can not be blamed for the script. It's a parody. Unintentionally funny, pathetic at best. In general, history is uneven. The figures of women are particularly idiotic; men are either frightening or tedious. <br /> <br /> The whole venture smells of pure public use. It does not remotely deliver what it promises, and even when the murders (eventually) begin to happen, they all appear off the screen. We only get a few clumsy shots in the head. <br /> <br /> Several people have said that this movie is Giallo. I can not disagree less with this opinion. Anyone who likes Italian thrillers should give this film a great impression because there is nothing exciting about it. It is basically a porn movie about a soft core with a horror movie. But it is not too erotic. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this to anyone.
