I downloaded this video yesterday through the website. The quality was good! I watched a movie with high expectations (although I knew it was a flop), especially that the film stars superstar Amitabh Bachchan as a villain. At least such actors as he would do something worth his role. Unfortunately, Mr. Bachchan did not impress as a villain, which proved that no one can compete with the magic process of Radzin AMJAD KHAN to rekindle the past in a royal way! Sholay, this old man is a milestone in the Indian cinema with a star cast, cult dialogue, stylish photos and a genius soundtrack, which is still a hit also for current generations. A good actor like TALENTS Ajay Devgan is wasted and his performance was mediocre. Raj, the novice does not know what acting is. Nisha Kothari has proven that she is one of the worst actresses we have. I do not know how RGV Urmila and Abhishek are still seen in the song without excitement and passion. Mohanlal tried his best, and Susmith Sen's work was good. work in this movie It was the total slaughter of the original Sholay
