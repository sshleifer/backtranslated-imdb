Although it's been two years, I still remember the complete waste that makes up the entire story. Unfortunately, I came across this movie to my friends and chose it when viewing new releases in Blockbuster. We decided to choose a movie because it was the only movie we did not see and it sounded like it was pleasant. Although a lot of time has passed since watching the movie, I still remember the lack of plot (seriously, there is no real plot) and the total loss of time that I spent watching the movie. If you're in a video store and this movie catches the eye, go and find a better movie. If you finally saw this movie, I understand your pain :)
