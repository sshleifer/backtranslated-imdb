This film has Richard Pryor, Rosey Grier and others. This is an interesting movie from the time of World War II and serves as a statement about racism. It is worth taking a look to understand that the films reflect our feelings about the problems that arise and not about the time of their presentation. This means that it is a movie from the 1970s, not a movie from the 1940s (WW2). Nevertheless, there are some good action scenes with seven seven black men led by a white captain trying to get Dam. The story focuses on the captain, who will find out that these people are soldiers, not just a service company. There is a scene that can come from an American Civil War movie, not a movie from the Second World War, which reflects what the film is all about. The black lieutenant gives German women an innocent beak on the cheek, and the white captain gets nervous. I liked the film from the point of view of curiosity, because the stars and genre were interesting to me.
