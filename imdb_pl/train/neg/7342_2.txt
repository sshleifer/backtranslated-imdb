"The Man In The Attic" is a movie set from the 1910s. The real story inspires him. Unfortunately, this is a story that you did not have to tell. <br /> <br /> Looking at the box, the people responsible for packaging the film tried to make this movie seem steamy and erotic. They use phrases such as "unlawful passion", "forbidden romance" and "unlimited pleasures". They even show a picture of Neil Patrick Harris (little Doogie Howser, M.D.) holding a gun! <br /> <br /> The story is about Kristy, played by Anne Archer. She is unhappy with a gentleman who owns her own business. Edward (Harris) is an employee of her husband's company. Krista and Edward fall in love with each other. <br /> <br /> Apparently the "shocking" part of the movie is this: Kristy's husband finds out about the affair and forbids them seeing again. So what will they decide to do? Krista ends with Edward living in the attic. Wow! Krista ends up seeing someone else and Edward becomes extremely jealous. So on and so forth. <br /> <br /> "Man in the attic" does not include any new territory. This is the original photo from Showtime, which explains why the stars are a few actors from the B list and both appear briefly in the buff. <br /> <br />
