ha ha! you just have to smile and smile, if you managed to go through this movie. it probably says something about myself. the film itself was created as something like a psychological test, or like a drug, to take you to a place where you've never been before. When Wittgenstein wrote his famous first philosophical song, tractacus (sp?), He said it was pointless and useless, but if you read it, after finishing it you would take you to a new level like a ladder, and then you could throw your job out and see things with clarity and true understanding. this movie is the same as I think. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, the movie is the worst movie I've seen in a very special way. First of all, these are snippets. I loved watching this guy in different movies. and I suffered for a few weak people. however, although you know that the movie can suck, you would never suspect that it could be as bad as it really is. which is fun. I mean, it's snipe. You know it can be good, but it will be fine, right? <br /> <br /> so this thing on every level is pure boredom, pure non-originality. the reference to a professional is both dead and obvious, but so badly made that it is comical. in this movie there is not one character that would be interesting, at least. and to make the whole thing more surreal, they have a soundtrack, which in a way sounds like parts to different types of Bourne identity films, but it's not quite right. in fact, although it seems to be close to the background music of the action film, it so happens that it is done in a fantastic way. <br /> <br /> then all scenes in total darkness, where honestly because the characters are so flat, you do not really care what will happen, but regardless of when it happens and someone is killed, you'll tell yourself should I see it? what else? like about scenes with a blinding, unpleasant flash in stroboscopic light, for a time that is too long to bear. for sure, let's throw it in. when you stretch, and your eyes can not deal with it, do it in the dark, in which you really can not see what happened. and in addition, do not worry about it. you were bored from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> so I popped in and jumped out a few times, but I caught almost all of the movie. and it becomes something that you can observe without something that engages your mind at any level, so it becomes something that you can effectively separate and start thinking about your life, where it is, where it was, what we are, people. <br /> <br /> and this ... this is the real magic of this movie.
