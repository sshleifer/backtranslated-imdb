How many times are we immersed in caresses, we must see a fearsome passing in the background and passing through the mirror reflection? It was done in twenty films in the latest memory and four times in this rough, poorly made film. There were only two weird moments to appreciate ... when the ghosts entered the personal spaces of the two characters. Speaking of characters, the acting was as flat as Diet Coke in 64 oz. a cup from which I drew it. Side characters could be drawn from various Scooby Doo cartoons. He was a friendly, senior sheriff. A bizarre freak with Alabama's drawing lived in the woodlands. Lots characters without development. The most disturbing picture was the murdered child at the beginning. But instead of investigating the child's murder, which would be interesting, they simply let us know that she was dead and that her parents found it difficult to reconcile death with the community and with each other. When they reach the cabin, the scenes rarely flow together ... with the flashing images of a dead daughter thrown in here and there. Oh ... and the strange sounds were too exaggerated. You know what I mean .... creaking doors that open themselves, crickets in the forest, yada yada yada. Ooooohhhh. I have not seen this before. You will see an amazing, self-closing door in the movie again. NOTE FOR THE DIRECTOR: A terrifying scene is frightening if it is not repeated every 5 minutes in the same movie. Think about these things before you call "this is wrapping up!"
