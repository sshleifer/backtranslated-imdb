Facts about National Lampoon Goes to the Movies, a.k.a. National Lampoon's Movie Madness: <br /> <br /> 1. The movie is poor, even according to Lampoon's usual standards. 2. This is not funny. 3. Nobody watches a movie. <br /> <br /> So when I finished watching, I started to wonder why on earth it's called "National Lampoon goes to movies" and why it was ever made up, much less actually done. It would be like calling Austin Powers "An American Guy Goes to the Movies". How bad. He is not an American and does not go to movies. None of the heroes of the so-called "satire" Lampoon is funny and neither of them watches movies, which causes a certain problem. I was hoping it would be something like the Mystery Science Theater 3000, but it is not. <br /> <br /> This was the first National Lampoon movie for Animal House, although it could not be said from the quality of the movie. Poorly developed, rough and amateur in every standard, causes headaches? This is not a good sign for an 89-minute movie that seems twice as long. <br /> <br /> I noticed the pattern. Really bad movies are usually changed? and this little catastrophe belongs to this category. He has two separate titles - probably to try and promote him on people who are too stupid to remember how badly panning he received from home critics in 1982/83. "Hmm, Movie Madness? I've never heard about this movie before! Let's borrow it! And then, the realization: "Hey, wait a minute, it's just National Lampoon goes to the movies!" <br /> <br /> It has been postponed by MGM / UA, it will never be released on a movie or DVD; sometimes appears on television several times a decade, which is almost the only place you can find. <br /> <br /> Is it divided into three stories? parody of films with self-expansion, butter and corporate ruthlessness, and police brutality / buddy-friend movies (I think). The first episode is Peter Riegert (Animal House) as a frustrated guy who divorces his wife and does other things. I'm not sure what it was because it was so boring that my mind started drifting. Until the sex scene appeared. <br /> <br /> Part II concerns an exotic dancer raped with a stick of butter (do not ask), who decides to become the Queen of Margarine, so that she can cut off the inflow of dairy products. Ooops! This is the only funny line in the movie: "Only I can make love to my son!" If you think it does not sound too funny, are you right? This is not. And imagine? This is the main attraction of this movie! <br /> <br /> Part III concerns a policeman who is chasing a serial killer (Christopher Lloyd) just to lose his nerves and shoot a guy. It contains one funny scene, but it is very exaggerated? only Lloyd really shows humor, playing his character dry and compassionate, but strangely surreal. The part in which he choked his victim and the docile cop, watching all this, at least caused a giggle or two. <br /> <br /> It is a pity to watch such a cast of semi-famous names low standards. The writers of each segment clearly believe that they are very ironic and clever, impersonating so-called stereotypes? the fault is that the film becomes one big contradiction, favoring the standard T & A instead of the story; raw humor instead of witty dialogue; desperate performances instead of inspired ones. It is easy to see that none of the actors was charmed with this material, muttering their lines, often so embarrassed that they rarely can make eye contact with the camera. <br /> <br /> The movie is not funny, as I said before. I laughed once, only in one line, and even then he was a half-wit. Two giggles, a smile and a very weak laugh. Compared to Movie Madness, many other decent comedies seem to be mere songs of laughter. <br /> <br /> I like the National Lampoon's Vacation series (or at least three of the four parts), and their classic Animal House, but their recent lot of direct bombs, such as Golf Punks (with this great comic genius Tom Arnold) , is a good example of why their magazine stopped printing more than a decade ago. It's really old, really fast. <br /> <br /> It is sad that a new movie, called Gold Diggers, is released with their "seal of approval". Is it like condemning a movie before it hits the movie theaters? Maybe they should start not to advertise their name in the whole place? <br /> <br /> Distributor: "This movie is bad. He receives the National Lampoon approval. This will teach you not to do something so terrible next time. <br /> <br /> Forget about the death penalty. Just throw a group of criminals into the room and have them watch it again and again throughout the day. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that I can not even begin to explain her rotten meanness. I give up.
