Three writers made a valiant attempt to adapt the novel by Jane Stanton Hitchcock to the lamp, but this television movie was eventually grafted in too much melodrama and simply does not know when to leave. Fighting artist Meg Tilly is suddenly hired by wealthy, mysterious Ellen Burstyn, who wants a wall painting on the walls of her unused ballroom. After hearing the last meeting that took place - the upcoming reception of Ellen's daughter - Tilly decides about her artistic topic, never dreaming that her daughter died mysteriously before the function began, or that she and the dead were similar. ! Two great actresses lend their services to an amazing yarn that is not in-depth and which does not suit any woman's emotional intensity. Burstyna's role is balanced on the camp, while Tilly gets stuck in routine activities with dreamy eyes. Only one sequence late in the film (in the morning after the end of the mural) is burdened with honest affection, anger and betrayal. The rest is delicate.
