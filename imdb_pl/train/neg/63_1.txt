Damn it. It was the worst movie I've seen in a long time. All performances are fine, but there is no plot. Really! No story! A few clowns talk about this and that, and it's your movie. Ug ... Robert Duvall's character is old and he constantly asks the same people for the same questions. It gives him the same answers over and over again. I'm sure this movie has reached six because people think that it will appeal to him. Good performances with well-known and recognized actors, but the actual complete work is an exciting game. Well, maybe it's a bit misleading, because pairing from a fresh pile sounds a bit like something is going on, and in this movie NOTHING WORKS! Bag
