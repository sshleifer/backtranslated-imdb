(ATTENTION: I thought I would be the only one who wrote what I did below, but I can see that others agree, I think it was quite obvious - it was exaggeration with a piece of a cat.) Wrote :) <br /> <br /> Owners they went on vacation for two weeks - a trip to California - leaving the cat (New Year's Eve) alone and locked in the house. This means that there is no milk, but the cat, to its relief, finds a handful of preserved tuna. However, to his consternation, he can not find the opener. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the little mouse in the house has it ... and the cat lure. This is a mean rodent who irritates New Year's Eve with an opener and then tears it out in the last second. Sylvester tries everything possible to open a can of tuna, but he can not do it. <br /> <br /> It's a frustrating story, and that's why they make a sadistic "good guy" mouse be outside of me. It's like some of the Tom & Jerry cartoons, where poor Tom always has the worst, even if the little mouse starts a conflict!
