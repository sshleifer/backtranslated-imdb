Well. it was not a surprise. many people will tell you that it is bloody. but everyone says "shiztz" this movie is very slow. <br /> <br /> It starts with some guy who is doing a mixture to not feel the pain, he calls it "my son", there are some bloody scenes, but I thought they were weak. you might as well omit 40 minutes of the movie and reach the stage of the eyeball, which was surprisingly impressive and disgusting. there are some really stupid scenes in it. and dubbing hits and spanking with a stupid, false sound that makes me laugh! I would not recommend it. Look forward to gore hound. <br /> <br /> check this out if you want a similar scene ending 20-10 minutes, which is still not so amazing and has a random scene of a guy trying to like rape his mom ... so strange.
