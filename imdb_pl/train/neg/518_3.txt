Bela Lugosi is not a typemast in this fantastic twelve-part adventure series playing the role of Frank Chandler / Chandu the Magician, enjoying his role as a representative of White Magic forces pushed against Black, successfully displaying vigorous fighting skills seeking for a young Egyptian princess and cutting down the skinny and brindle figures on sailing equipment, with a sea hat. A somewhat uneven conspiracy engages Chandler / Chand in a continuous series of escapades pointing to the rescue of his fianc√©, princess Nadja (Maria Alba) and others from the clutches of the ubiquitous goddess sect Ubasti, who lusts for Nadji's blood to revive an ancient mummified princess buried on the mysterious island of Lemuria. Director Ray Taylor, an old man in such entertainment, keeps moving fast, but repetitive scenes and recordings, many of which can be found in last year's scenery of Skull Island from KING KONG, and the locale port from SON OF KONG, reduce the original action to less than 60 minutes from the length of the series over two and a half hours, and if you watch it in one sitting, it becomes ineffective for most viewers, unless you have insomnia.
