I became interested in this film as a kitschy film of cannibals. I was very disappointed. it was the same disappointment I saw on Friday 13th: jason takes manhattan. " so much wasted potential! <br /> <br /> opening scene is a decent gripper. then he stops. abundant bust and fashion of the 80s can not help this film. The only things they eat near the cannibal island are piranhas! I do not ask about the level of gore "cannibalistic holocaust", but I was looking for cheaper abuse-exploitation. I do not have this. <br /> <br /> I found some parts of the fight scenes a bit intriguing, hence 2 stars. I do not think, however, that it is worth taking the time to watch it. I saw showing him at a party where nobody cares about what's going on, and you just want something in the background. but I would not say to anyone, "Oh, dude, GOTTA, see this movie." he is neither good enough nor bad enough to arouse much attention.
