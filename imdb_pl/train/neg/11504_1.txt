AKA: Poniedziałki w słońcu <br /> <br /> I have no idea what I just watched. Three men wander aimlessly and drink, enjoying everything and everything in their path. It's supposed to be a drama, but what it is is a total waste of film, without one saving quality. <br /> <br /> I've read reviews of performances here as "wonderful," "beautiful," and "heroic." I'm afraid I can not agree unless these people would leave as the stupidest, ignorant proto-men who ever went. <br /> <br /> In total? It was not a movie. He wanders around and loses everyone but the audience. I watched it three times and I can not see what anyone can see in this trash all my life. There is nothing deep here. It's nonsense. <br /> <br /> Ocenia ZERO / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fienda :.
