If you like movies that travel with a small exposition plot spiced with perverse sex, this movie is for you. On the plus side, the main actor / actress (debutante transsexual) has an interesting presence on the screen, but not enough to add to it much more than a mildly interesting movie - if so. Essentially, this movie is about 3 social outcasts (transsexual prostitute, male hustler and Russian, gay immigrant) who have somehow developed a bond. Why is not it clear. We are expected to accept those unfit people who are basic, honest people who have the ability to love while they are crowding their bodies on the street. Well!! And Anna Nicole Smith was really in love with her ninety-year-old daddy with sugar! The creator shows the harsh, unpleasant side of life, and at the same time he wants us to believe that all these seriously damaged people are really quite normal to the extent that they have a trois menagerie that helps them in their lives. Pretty fantasy, but unfortunately presented here as a real look of life on the wild side. In summary, without plot, without the truth and for no real reason, to spend a lot of time here. Unless of course you do not like to get bored !!!
