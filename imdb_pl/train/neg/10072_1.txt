Unfortunately, I made a mistake and paid 7 euros at the cinema to watch this shallow film irrelevant. My points; <br /> <br /> The movie is based on 2 things; <br /> <br /> 1) Ethical point of view: As is the case in most American films, the writer considers himself an expert after learning 2 or 3 things about Asian culture. But unfortunately it is not enough. Knowledge of kunefe and 2 names of other products does not make people understand culture. For example, shaving is a sign of pure life in Asia, but everyone tried to stop the girl. Lebanese are Christians (Ok, but this is happening), and their cultural forms, beliefs and approaches are completely different than in other Arab countries. The main difference between Eastern and Western cultures is that we do not do ethnocentrism. So we do not judge people after their first question about our lives, just like a father did in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> 2) Sexual revolution of the girl: There is nothing to say about it. Show me 10 girls who have it in their sexual awakening, than I say I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> I wrote this comment because the producers promote the movie in the genre of black humor. Please, look at Dr.Strangelove and understand the importance of black humor. Black humor must reflect the truth and must focus the audience on fun parts. Where is the truth? Where is the meaning of this movie.
