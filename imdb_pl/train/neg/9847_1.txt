Peter Sellers plays Dick Scratcher (ha, ha), the cook of a pirate ship, who takes over the role of the captain after he murdered the previous one. Although he has witnessed the burial of the treasure, he begins to lose his memory, and the treasure map he receives becomes empty. So, Dick is forced to find someone who can see and communicate with ghosts (do you place an ad on it?) And help guide the path to the treasure. It's amazing how anyone could fund this senseless movie. Former Goon Spike Milligan replaced Medak as the director, and considering Medak's talents in The Ruling Class, you can guess which of the grainy, poorly lit scenes had Milligan in the director's chair. Peter Boyle appears in the first 10 minutes of the film as a captain of pirates condemned to death. He is probably very grateful that young Frankenstein was released in the same year in which he was filmed and conserved so that he could keep it in his CV. Franciosa looks impressive as a handsome man, but he and the salesman look desperate, and even make-up sellers and hair look quite horrible. They must have known that this film is bombing even when they film it. With these lines I can understand every possible anxiety: <br /> <br /> PIERRE: (will be hanged soon) You will pay for it. <br /> <br /> WINNER: No, I won 't. I will do it for free. <br /> <br /> And this is one of GOOD jokes. It's amazing that most of the prolific sales materials are still in the vaults, but it has been made available on VHS over 15 years ago! How about someone who will go on record and release the well-received British television program "A Show Called Fred" with Sellers, Milligan and directed by the great Richard Lester?
