With a tendency to repeat himself, Wenders has been a consistent disappointment since he hit Paris Texas. <br /> <br /> "Land of Plenty" is no exception. Given the fact that I expected the average average movie before I entered, Wenders' ambitions seem to always improve it. Now he is busy, his films are heavy and bombastic. <br /> <br /> I was not sure if I was watching a comedy that mocked Central America or a thriller. The result of Diehl's character is completely predictable. Wender's emphasis on putting many scenes on a rock song is also very irritating. He hid holes in his script and direction, jazzing the scene. <br /> <br /> I am sure that many people will find this film important and resonating, but to be honest, this awkward and didactic effort speaks of a bad direction. <br /> <br /> It is interesting that Wenders confessed that by creating "Paris Texas", he had a great help from Sam Sheppard with the script. Yes, it was the best Wenders and he should understand that he needs a good screenwriter. His films from the last 15 years + were a total mess.
