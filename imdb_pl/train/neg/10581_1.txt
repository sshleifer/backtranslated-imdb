There was not one original idea in this story. The topics have been downloaded from various sources; several are The Ninth Gate, In the Mouth of Madness (another film by Carpenter) and The Ring. He even went so far as to include the same damn glowing ring from the Ring and used it as the namesake of the film. Cody Carpenter's soundtrack was completely removed from Suspiria. I hope that no one will oppose this comment by saying the word HOMAGE. Yes, I saw the theater playing Argento's Deep Red. A homage claim would be nonsense. It was the bottom of the barrel. Throwing gore and "disturbing" paintings in a pot are not a good horror story. Carpenter knew it. It should disappear or get a time machine.
