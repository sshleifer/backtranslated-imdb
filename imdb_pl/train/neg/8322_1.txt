I was very surprised to see that this movie has such a good rating when I checked it on IMDb after watching. It's really one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of bad movies. At first it looks like a good movie, but when it comes to surgery, I could not believe how bad it was. This voice destroys EVERYTHING! Imagine that you are so cut and then listen to what he says. I saw a film in German, so I do not know what he said in English, but ironic things such as "Yes, it does not hurt .."? ... what is this? Talking to "think about something else", then forget about the pain, thinking only about your girlfriend, she is just ... stupid. And his mother ... how the hell is she like this? Someone will tell her that her son died in surgery (what she expected). Plus, she found several letters in Jessica Albas's bag. plus that "she knows the hospital" things ... and then you need her "one second" to figure it out? What the hell? ^^ And the end ... why does the police destroy them? The patient died during surgery, that's all that happened. This drunk doctor also knows nothing else ... and then spoil them all, even the girl ??? Why??? In spite of everything, I think that Christensen did a bad job, but it does not matter to me ... these mistakes and stupid things I mentioned above are a problem. I watched this movie with a few friends and we were VERY disappointed ... As I said, one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... Just do not watch it;)
