At the beginning we see the beginning of a kind of secret council. Everything looks very promising from the very beginning. With some supernatural elements, the mystery becomes more and more interesting minute by minute. The main character, who looks like a good guy, gets into trouble because of his claims for money, which he has the right (temptation) and other factors. You really get into a guy and you want to know exactly what's going on. Usually a person in his situation would have several options. Somehow, these options are not available. In this movie there seems to be only one solution, even if it is clear that it is not his fault. He meets characters from the sky, talking about the church, prayer and God. And they are the answer to his problem. At some point in the movie it should be obvious what the solution is. Let me say that there is nothing wrong with this communication. Because it is always helpful. But do you really need to hide this message? This religious element really ruined my viewing. Although the message is good, its simplicity can not escape the fact that in reality more has to happen to solve the problems presented in this film. The mystery that has been presented to us will never be resolved. Instead, you are forced to deal with another topic that has nothing to do with the plot. Do not be fooled by Malcolm McDowell. This genius actor is right, but if you look closely, you will see that he is not serious. He really needs to be desperate to get money. Otherwise he would have an actor of his caliber to act in such a film.
