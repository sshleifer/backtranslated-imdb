It's a really fat clone of `LOCK STOCK 'with a stellar cast and a horrible script. I have no idea why so many top British actors signed up for this trash, they had to be bribed. The longing for the plot lasts forever and always, and if I did not pay for that good money, I would turn it off after 10 minutes. This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, this honor really falls to the pathetic film "movie" (I use the term "loosely") "GUMMO" (I want to sue the so-called "director" for the lost half of my life), but this garbage he is almost there with him. By far one of the worst 5 movies I have ever seen. These things are like Hollywood, they do not have a monopoly on really awful movies.
