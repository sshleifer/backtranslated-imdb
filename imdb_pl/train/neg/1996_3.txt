This sad little movie is not much like the similarity to the Broadway revival in 1971, which was such a nostalgic hit. Remember that when Burt Shevelove directed this revival, he wrote an extensive book. I have the impression that this screenwriter made as many changes as the original version from 1925. In 1974, I played on the stage of "innocent filanderer" Jimmy Smith and I thought that this DVD for $ 1 will bring back memories. No way. Even the anticipated joy of watching "Topper" Roland Young played "my" part, which was a big disappointment. Three songs from the game remain and are performed very poorly. Even the classic duet "Tea For Two" is a virtual solo. Many famous faces in this fiasco of 1940. Not at all proud, and the star, Anna Neagle, is just ashamed. When I feel stunned by spending the dollar, I know that the movie must be bad. Another commentator mentioned the Doris Day version, which is actually called "Tea For Two" and concerns the stage play (of course the original), so those who are looking for a real "No No Nanette" can find a more recognizable version there.
