As a fan of Notorious B.I.G. I could not wait for this movie. Unfortunately, I see it's a scary movie. Jamal Woodward is not convincing or realistic enough to portray Notorious B.I.G. Many stories are about the true son of Notorious B.I.G., Christopher Jordan Wallace as Notorious B.I.G. as a child. Unfortunately, he is not convincing enough to pay homage to his father. Derek Luke is as unconvincing as Sean "Puffy" Combs. In short, nobody is convincing enough to play their roles here. The real people they play are a big problem with that. It was boring and did not give any information about Notorious B.I.G. that fans and non-fans did not know yet. I was particularly disappointed with Angela Bassett, a very good actress who died here as Voletta Wallace. Film slugs and snails, thinking that Notorious B.I.G. fans will spend a lot of money on it. Unfortunately, I'm saying that it happened. Nowhere is it close to a good movie. I expected so much, but unfortunately I did not get anything I wanted from her. I think you should definitely skip this one.
