First of all, I saw this movie when I was 7 at Christian Scholl, in which I participated. Needless to say, I was scared. Not because it was frightening, but because of the content.Cmon ... I was 7 years old. In any case, the pictures were pretty bad, and the acting was bad. It's very bad because I was only 7 years old and I remember it. The only thing that still haunts me is the awful song, "I wish we were all ready," where the chorus ends "... you have been left behind." I would not like to see this. Probably I will, only for a nostalgic reason. Besides, I'm sure the remake is much better. However, the best part of the movie must be when everyone "disappears"; empty cars break, mowers work on their own ... quite funny.
