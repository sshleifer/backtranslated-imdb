I did not expect much after this film, after a terrible "life is a miracle". It turns out that this movie is ten times worse than "Life ...". I have the impression that the director / writer jokes with the audience: "let me see how much emptiness you (the audience) can sustain". Dialogues are empty ... the scenario is minimal. In a few moments the photo is really nice. A few sarcastic lines are half-fun, but it's really hard to laugh at this "comedy". I laughed at myself that I could watch the movie until the end. If you manage to rise above the fiasco of this director ... you will find a good game of several legends (Miki Manojlovic, Aleksandar Bercek) and a very good performance by the son of Emir Stribor Kusturica. <br /> <br /> In short: a pity for such a great director! Emir Kusturica is still young and should make the best films. Instead, he decides to make a low-budget theatrical film "only for my private", with an arrogant approach to global trends and negligence towards old fans.
