This movie reminded me of Sopranos, not in a good way. <br /> <br /> The thoughtful mafia opera by David Chase never made a mistake twice, the most shocking and inexplicable case that occurred in the fourth season when Junior Soprano went to the test for his life. Instead of continuing this riveting (and key) story, the writers decided to completely ignore it, focusing on Bobby Baccalieri's constant moaning over the frozen dish of the recently deceased wife's pasta. <br /> <br /> When something is happening in Notorious that arouses real interest - for example, this first, mysterious attempt to assassinate Tupac Shakur, which triggered the entire feud of the East Coast / West Coast and ended in the death of both Tupac and Christopher Wallace - the film treats him as another piece of conspiracy that needs to be done. Why exactly Tupac was so convinced that he was sold out by his own people? Did he himself cultivate his later affiliation with Suge Knight? And whether the transformation of Lil 'Kim from a primitive office drone into an obsession with sex, a vampire diva was as banal as it seems? <br /> <br /> None of these questions is even briefly addressed by screenwriters who are much more interested in presenting Wallace's turbulent love life to zero, which brings great benefits. These sequences (including the staggering stereotypical groupie variety in a hotel room) are so toothless and vaguely manipulative that the only real comparison that can be made is the TV movie on the net. <br /> <br /> Storytelling in both structure and content is simplified and banal. But more fundamentally, as a biographical; as something dedicated to celebrating your topic and educating the uninitiated about the complexities of their life and work; the film is almost completely worthless. Relying on the delineation of meat and potatoes in combination with dead musical performances (the area in which a film like this should fly, certainly) results in a film that seems to be designed only to satisfy the whims and demands of those involved, leaving Wallace's questionable status as a giant in his field as a reserve of easily convincing and previously converted only. <br /> <br /> And the last twenty minutes in which Wallace's posthumous cultural identity is extensively painted as similar to that of the last day of the saint, honestly made me want to throw myself. <br /> <br /> On this basis, as with any other, Notorious is crass, calculations and compromised.
