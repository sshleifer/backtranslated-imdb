I was bored around 10pm, so I watched the movie. And I could not stop laughing. Everything was so funny. The way children behaved as if they were older than 11 years old just broke me. One of the children had a ring that supposedly killed people after three years. It gave me the impression that he wants to be a gangster. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to treat small children seriously, especially when it comes to eating worms. They act as if everything was as big as if Billy (the main character) did not eat bugs and the world would end. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie for young children (except for the fact that the 5-year-old says "penis"), but not for teenagers and adults who do not want to waste time.
