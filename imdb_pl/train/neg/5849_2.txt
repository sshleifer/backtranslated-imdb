Being a fan of silent movies, I could not wait to see this picture for the first time. I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, the movie seems to be one long, long car advertisement for Maxwell. <br /> <br /> Maybe if the chase scene was half that short, maybe I liked the movie more. But it quickly grew old. And although I realize that reality is repeatedly stretched out in movies, without reducing the spectator's pleasure, what happened to the Mexican bandits? I mean, they're chasing a car through the mountains, a car that's moving about one mile per hour most of the time, but they can not catch up with it?
