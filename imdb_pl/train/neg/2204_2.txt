I love sharks. And mutants. And explosions. Theoretically, with these parameters in mind, HAMMERHEAD: Shark Frenzy should be the best movie ever. <br /> <br /> It is not. <br /> <br /> The monster looks like a villain with Power Rangers, and has approximately the same range of rubber moves. It may be okay if the creators would not be as proud of their project as it seems. This means that for a guy in a big rubber suit in the action / scifi / horror movie that could take advantage of some secret, the shark gets a lot of time on the screen. It is true that it is usually unstable and irregular. I suppose you should assume that it is so frightening that even a guy from the camera gets angry. <br /> <br /> The camera goes to the person to be eaten, the camera goes to the shark. The camera returns to the person to be eaten, only now screams and they have no weapons. And so on. <br /> <br /> Costumes are bad, acting is weak, and special effects are below the norm, but writing is by far the worst. Things happen quite randomly so that you can eat more people, or something can explode. Because LET ME TELL YOU, the people who made the movie decided on more explosions = a better attitude. Characters shoot at cars and a huge explosion follows. They shoot helicopters, there is a huge explosion. Barrels, rocks, trees, EVERYWHERE, all explode, so much so that this crazy shark explodes even at the end. <br /> <br /> Speaking of which, I do not care how crazy a person is, I find it hard to believe that someone would think that trying to make a giant half-shark half of the person has sex with a woman to make that bizarre shark babies will be a good idea. This means that IF this person is not a crazy scientist in this movie. <br /> <br /> The bad news is that the movie is so random (and sometimes boring) that even its evil is not enough to keep a person's long-term interest. This may be good for MST3K with friends, but after that if you happen to catch this evil boy, do yourself a favor and change the channel.
