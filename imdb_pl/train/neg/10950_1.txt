If I had known that this movie had been filmed in an annoying and disturbing Dogme 95 style, I would never have rented it. Nevertheless, I took the drama for seasickness and gave her a chance. I went on very, very, very long, forty minutes before I gave up. It's just boring, pretentious talk. <br /> <br /> The last French movie I saw was "Romance" and it was also quite gloomy, but at least the camera was stable and did not breathe the neck of the characters. time. I am amazed at the continued popularity of Dogme 95 abroad - it will come in America at about the same time as the next big eruption of leprosy. (It's called Dogme 95, because it's the average number of times the actors are poked in the eye by the camera.) <br /> <br />
