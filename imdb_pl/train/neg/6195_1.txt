Badly done. The frightening acting and ending the director's seemingly out of the blue because the film was honest. It is shocking that this film is considered a prize at the Gij√≥n film festival. <br /> <br /> Everyone who left the theater was of the same opinion as me - what was the point of making a movie? References to Iraq were either bizarre or simply ill-conceived. I am amazed that this movie has been released - very, very disappointing and wasting my time. I'm sorry, it's a very negative opinion, but I hope it will discourage some people from making the same mistake. It's a pity we did not have Q and A at the end of the movie - now that could be interesting.
