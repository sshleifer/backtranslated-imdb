I'm a big fan of Charlton Heston. He is undoubtedly one of the greatest actors of all time, but what he thought when he made this film. Normally, if he made a bad movie, I could blame him on the screenwriter or director, but in this case it's all him. The suckiness of this movie is all its fault. This proves that even Heston can not make Shakespeare's story interesting. I wasted 2 and a half hours of my life on this nap and I will never come back. This is definitely the Worst Heston movie I've ever seen. If you're a fan of Shakespeare, maybe you'll find this entertainment movie, but if you do not waste your time, you'll regret it in the long run.
