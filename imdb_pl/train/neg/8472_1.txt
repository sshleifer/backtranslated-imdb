The film opens to Julian Sands, lying on her back, a black cat who drooling with blood into the waiting mouth from where she is holding him, about two feet above him. It was so provocative and I thought, "Well, let's go! Good movie about vampires! "<br /> <br /> And then he died. It was literally the only scene that captured every part of the imagination. Then there was a slow, dispassionate beating. I was very disappointed because my previous experience with acting Sands was quite pleasant. However, this attempt was obviously misdirected, and the script left much to be desired. <br /> <br /> Even the dubious performance of Julian Sands could not save the already sunken barge of the film. <br /> <br /> Ocenia 1,1 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fienda :.
