Definitely a strange debut of Michael Madsen. Madsen plays Cecil Moe, an alcoholic whose life is falling apart around him. Cecil grabs a phone book, checks the name of the preacher and calls him in the middle of the night. He goes to the preacher's house and discusses his problems. Preacher teaches Cecil to respect the word of God and have Jesus in his heart. It's improving everything. Ahh ... if only everything in life was so easy. The fact that this "movie" looks like it was made for around $ 500 certainly does not help. 1/10
