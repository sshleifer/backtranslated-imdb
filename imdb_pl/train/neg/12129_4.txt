Before the film, I saw only two films by the director Andrei Bianchi: the kitsch movie about the zombie Le Notti del Terrore (1981), known among horror fans for the unforgettable performance of boy-child Peter Barka and pleasantly poor giallo Strip Nude For your killer. None of the films was a particularly spectacular work of cinema, but both were fun in their own way (and the fact that they presented a lot of gore and nudity, did not hurt). But the massacre is boring, boring, boring, despite the large amount of splash and the strange place of a disinterested naked body. <br /> <br /> The story of a series of murders in a hotel where the cast and crew of horror reside during their photos are confusing and boring: when the blood does not flow and the skin is not shown, the film is a real difficulty to sit down ( It took me four attempts to finish), with endless scenes of unfavorable characters who argue with each other and make little attention. <br /> <br /> The only interesting theme of the movie is that its producer, Lucio Fulci, used several death scenes to recite his fantastic movie Cat In The Brain (AKA Nightmare Concert). And if you've seen this movie, there's no reason to care about Massacre.
