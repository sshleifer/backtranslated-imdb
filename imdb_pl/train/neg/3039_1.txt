I can always say when something will be a hit. I see it, hear it and feel good. I did not feel good watching the preview. I was not enthusiastic about this film and it does not surprise me that it is one of the worst 100 films here. In fact, I was proven to be right. <br /> <br /> The first thing that threw me was the title. It's not that I have a problem with ebony (I'm black by the way), but in the case of a movie, they could use a better title and use a title that does not have bad grammar. I heard a dialogue, I saw acting and everything I could do was make faces. <br /> <br /> I also think that the theme of the dance film is exaggerated. At least "You Got Served" was better than this, in my opinion. Even the soundtrack did not impress me.
