Marty's school gull (Simon Scuddamore) is sexually humiliated by a group of classmates, and then he is in a laboratory explosion (also by them), where his face is scarred with acid. Many years later all jerks are invited back to the high school (from the time of closure) to the meeting. They did not know that Marta invited them to kill them. Then the storm begins, closes in school and Marty begins to take revenge. <br /> <br /> Pretty silly. The murders are ingenious and bloody, and some deserted shots of a deserted school are terrifying - but that's the point. The humiliation at Scuddamore is more than cruel (undressed, has a head immersed in the toilet and is burnt) and just does not feel good. Given that Scuddamore committed suicide shortly after it was released, you could not see them. Also this movie does everything to have nudity. There is a full Scuddamore front (surprising for each film), but one girl decides to take a bath in peace ... he knows that the killer is wandering after them! And then there is a couple who have to have sex. It's a kind of movie where the killer seems to know where everyone is going and can teleport to them. It ends with a turn of action that caused me to moan and roll my eyes, and then ANOTHER turn that I wanted to throw something heavy on the TV! Operation is bearable - not good, but bearable. Caroline Munro also deals with this. She is a very beautiful woman, but she is not an actress. <br /> <br /> It gets 3 for some bloody murders and atmosphere. Otherwise, the mill runs and you can not forget it. Scuddamore's tragic suicide has given the film more attention than he deserves.
