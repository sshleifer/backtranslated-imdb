A bizarre story about Cinderella. A terribly bad script, but Kathleen Turner performs quite a decent performance of a bad stepmother. <br /> <br /> In some parts visually stunning, but that's all. Costumes from the period range from the Elizabethan era to the 90s of the twentieth century. Fast forward until you see something interesting and you will save a full 90 minutes of drivel. <br /> <br /> If you really feel like Cinderella's story - I suggest "Ever After: A Cinderella Story" or "Glass Slipper".
