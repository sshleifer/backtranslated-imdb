Written and preserved by sincere amateurs, produced by some exploiting monger, it is boring and difficult to look at. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie ever, but at least schlock like _Plan 9 From Outer Space_ usually had a real actor or two. I recommend _A Thief In The Night_ only hardcore ironists and hardcore dispensationalists. I'm not. <br /> <br /> Do not believe me? Watch it for free (although it comes from poor VHS) here: http://www.archive.org/details/Thief-In-The-Night <br /> <br /> Relevant links have been added mainly to achieve 10 IMDb lines minimum: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/3199/thief-in-the-night-se-a/
