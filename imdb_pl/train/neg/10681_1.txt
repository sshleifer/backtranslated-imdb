How unfortunate it is to have so much of my "list" and good actors from the "b" list, who agree to make this movie, but they did it and it drew me to watch. I have never heard of this film, but the cover of the DVD was Cuba Gooding Jr., and in the background James Woods, how bad could it be? In a word, very much! This movie starts o.k. he has a few twists and then simply puts an egg. The ending was so weak that the writer was dismissed, and his four-year-old son sat down by the writer and forged an end. How ironic for the movie entitled "The end game" to have such a poor one. These are the types of movies that can transfer the actors from the list "a" to the list "b" in a hurry. I hope Cuba Gooding JR and James Woods do not have this habit.
