This is not the right review because I have not seen the majority of the movie. I stopped watching him. The film is very brutal, with nasty drug dealers and street punks, but that's not why I stopped watching. <br /> <br /> Here's the problem: I was watching myself enough to be introduced to several characters, all of whom were not interesting. They were all a boring, despicable psychopath without engaging personalities, giving me nothing to look at. I was not the least curious about what they would do next or what could happen to them. <br /> <br /> If there was one person interested, and I do not mean a good or nice person, I mean an interesting person, I could stay with her. Watch "State of Grace" to see what I mean. In this movie, the character of Gary Oldman is a complete madman, but he is * very * interesting. Perhaps Al Pacino did a good job at Scarface, but his character simply did not involve me.
