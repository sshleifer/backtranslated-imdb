(First of all sorry for bad English) Of course, only a movie with Jessica Simpson can contain serious foolishness like this .. I'm a Norwegian and I felt offended and shocked that the filmmakers did not devote time to researching the creation of this American / "Norwegian" movie . Even Wikipedia is more accurate when it comes to facts about this country. <br /> <br /> So I publish my corrections from my frustration: - The country is called Norway, not Norway. - "Da" is Russian, not Norwegian. - Norwegian priests never use these black cloaks with this white paper around the neck, because the Protestant church is definitely dominant - it is true that we have a native traditional folk costume (which we use only twice a year), but the outfit in this movie more It resembles German attire. -I could not understand the so-called "Norwegian" in this movie .. Jessica did not make any sense ... closer to the "Norwegian priests" <br /> <br /> The only thing I recognized was the Norwegian flag (and the Vikings' Hats, but this is stereotypical what people think about Norway - Vikings !: O rany) <br /> <br /> Well ... I think people who have made this film will never read this comment. but at least I cleaned a few things and got rid of this frustration ..! <br /> <br /> I am proud of my country and I would love to make people in the USA less stereotypical and more accurate when they talk about this country. <br /> <br /> That's it ... Lenge leve Norge! ;
