This is an amateur film made on video, not an "electric drama", as the DVD liner is falsely praised. I've seen far better things than film students. A huge part of the story takes place as part of a night taxi ride in Jakarta. This video could have been made using a single video camera, but there are several sections in which two cameras were used and the content was later reflected. Editing is very difficult. The final edition was probably made with the help of two cameras, reflecting the contents back and forth, instead of using the appropriate editor. Maybe they also edited in a taxi? English subtitles have been written by someone who does not speak English fluently, eg "Where are you going now?" To say that the quality of production is on par with the Blair Witch is generous. If you are not afraid yet, this film was an ambitious and creative venture, with lots of cool and funky images from all over Jakarta.
