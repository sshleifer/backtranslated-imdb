The first two Ritchie films were funny, stylish. Here, he attacks the two latest classics? "The Usual Suspects" and "Fight Club"? and it still goes out empty-handed. <br /> <br /> Despite parading as a secret (with the sub-talk of "The Suspects", "the biggest cheater he ever pulled was to convince you that he was you" or whatever it was ...) and trying "Fight- Club "turn on which characters are real and which are internal manifestations, the film tries to maintain interest in the second half. In the last third part you know that you are in a dead end and slowly slow in this. <br /> <br /> Defects, chess and game theory are wonderful topics, but Ritchie delves into them too superficially and too repetitively to use material. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps the film (almost) in viewership is Ritchie's bold way with the stage and the dynamic camera of Maurice-Jones. If Ritchie sticks to a more satisfying story and is subject to more rigorous editing, there is no reason why he could not make another pleasant gangster caper. <br /> <br /> In fact, Revolver is a waste of your time. Misunderstanding does not equal depth. If you want to see a great movie that does not have logical sense, but is its advantage (and incidentally, which also involves an inexplicable escape from isolation), watch "Lost Highway".
