We all know that innumerable guys have acquired a genre from the 80's and often deserve our deepest revulsion. Maybe it's a bit hasty, but damn it if "Slaughter High" is not terribly unoriginal, even for a shorter movement. Almost, the conspiracy concerns a child who has experienced humiliation in a Carrie-style shower in high school and returns to a ruined building to seek revenge on a group of former persecutors who all appear to mention. As you might expect, they are killed by a masked madman on April 1 by electric shock, burning, suspension and chemically modified beer. I have a lot of problems with the plot details and the settings of this movie, but considering the ending, I feel the need to reject complaints and say that it is a complete waste of time. Ignore every thought about displaying this video ...
