I had high hopes for this movie because it has Charlton Heston and Jack Palance. But those hopes fell to the ground in the first 20 minutes. Palanka was funny. Even Heston's acting and the beauty of Annabel Schofield (or short nude scenes) could not save the film. Some of the spatial effects were quite good, but others were poor. The conspiracy was ridiculous. Even science fiction fans should skip this one. Class F
