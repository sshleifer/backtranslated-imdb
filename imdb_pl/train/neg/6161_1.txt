This is probably the worst film ever made in fencing with sword fighting. This is not only because the so-called sports fencing is weak, but because the character's plot is so weak that they have to put on a half-naked sex scene, and later a supposed group dancing around the fencing scene in the fencing club, trying, I suppose, to keep the audience interested . What a loss of the talents of F. Murray Abraham. You're better served with exaggerated movies like Zorro, Scaramouche, everything Basil Rathbone is a villain. As a swordsman, I see almost the impossibility of capturing fencing as a sport in a film, but if it ever happens, it must have fresher, better-drawn characters and a story with greater depth.
