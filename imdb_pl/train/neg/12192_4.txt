I think we're all starting a lot of reviews, "It could have made a GREAT movie." The mad ex-con recently jumped out, a neat suburban family its purpose. Revenge, revenge, manipulation. Marty usually put Karo syrup on. But, unfortunately, somewhere in the Universal skyscraper there is a memorandum: everyone is preparing it. <br /> <br /> Nolte says only with raised eyebrows, Lange is moving through cigarettes, Lewis "Ohmagod's!" her way through her stage and Bobby D ... well, he is on a completely different magic carpet. By influencing some Cajun / Huckleberry Hound accent hybrid, he whisks fat cigars and cries in random atrocities, such as "Child Problem". And I want you to imagine the above-mentioned accent. Imagine now that he is rushing religious rhetoric to the highest volume, as if he swallowed six bibles, and here you have the De Niro schtick. The most distracting, however, is his MOST USED use of the "De Niro face" for which he is so amused. Narrowed eyes, wrinkled forehead, hunched lips. Crimany, Bob, you looked like Plastic Man. <br /> <br /> This story apparently began off the screen 14 years earlier, when Nolte could not save time De Niro in the bighouse for various attacks. After his release, he feels that Nolte's mistake in relation to him makes him and his family terrorize. And we should give the hero of De Niro a slight transition, because Nolte stopped information that could shorten his mind. De Niro is one of those criminals who, despite the guilt of unspeakable deeds, feel that his lack of freedom justifies the continuation of such acts outside. Mmm-kay. <br /> <br /> He follows a close lover, Notle (in a scene from which some want to turn), his wife, daughter, a family dog, you know. This is one of the drawbacks of the Wesley Strick scenario: total predictability. Because every De Niro harassment becomes more gruesome, you can call the rest of the action before it happens. Strick should not be completely discredited, because he manages several attractive moments driven by dialogues (the ludicrous exchange of De Niro and Lewis in an empty theater is the best scene of the film), but for the most part it is all twisted. Scorsese's drawing approach to photography comes to light as forced, not to mention the obsolete, overworked result of Bernard Hermann of HORRIBLY (I've been waiting all the time for Wolf Man to appear with a genetically enlarged tarantula). <br /> <br /> In this way, we reach the comedy part of the film. It's unintentionally comedy. Do you know those scenes in which something graphically frightening happens, but you can not resist giggles from the eyes of others? You can do it here. Nolte and Lange scold about infidelity, flirting with the thumb of De Niro, dressing up and slipping on a certain substance that needs to be believed. And a hellish, constant, DANGEROUS, mind-destroying, bat-like roar of all the "philosophies" he discovered in prison. I wanted to kill him to shut him down more than save this annoying family. <br /> <br /> I always hate to borrow thoughts from other reviewers, but here it is necessary. This really * is * a version of Freddy Krueger's Scredse. The way De Niro relishes, he says, he steals himself, he can stand the pain, all the way to the one-liner, it's Freddy's year. After being burnt by a pot of dumped water: "Are you trying to" offer hot water "? Please. And this is just one example. <br /> <br /> Unless you were a fan of the original 1962 movie and would like to have a thrill while watching Balsam, Peck and Mitchum almost 30 years later (or you want a serious movie with head experience), avoid traveling to Cape .
