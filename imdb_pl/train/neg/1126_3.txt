I hired this thinking, it might be interesting, and it could be an interesting story, except that it was said in such an uninteresting way. It's hard to follow, a strange edition, a chaotic plot, heroes mumble, all in all a terribly boring waste of time. I just could not get into it and I did not care what happened to the characters - even Ian Holm could not save the movie. Unless you need a cure for insomnia, I will skip this. 3/10, and this is generous.
