it turned out to be another unsuccessful attempt of a funny science-fiction channel. I'm not sure who wrote the script and interpreted the poem, but I'm sure it was some 17-year-old teenager who thought it would be great to have a crossbow in the movie. Aaaaaaah! when I saw this part, I lost all hope. Then ... they set off for a heorot in what looks like the ship in which Christopher Columbus sailed! when they reach Heorot (which is supposed to be a Nordic mead hall), a group of sci-fi idiots decided to make the heorot look like a big stone castle. when I saw this part ... I wanted to scream. I really wanted this movie to be good, but science fiction does not have a good movie yet, so I do not know why I hope. Oh ... and Grendel and his mother are stupid too. (this comment is excluded from the "Grendel" theme). If somebody from the science fiction channel is reading this, there are some good tips. NOT ANY FILM YOU WILL DO, MUST BE ABOUT A BIG MONTH, WHICH MAY MAKE PEOPLE IN HALF, WHAT IS NOT A LEARNING SCIENCE! AND ALSO, STOP A LOW ACTOR, Like STEPHEN BALDWIN, TO BE IN YOUR FILMS! IF YOU DO NOT HELP A FILM, BUT WE DO THEM HOT !!!
