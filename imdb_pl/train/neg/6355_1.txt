I could not wait to see this movie. Around the middle of the movie, I could not wait until the end. All (white) actors were delivering their lines, as Woody Allen had just said: "Say it that way ..." Then they said their lines on the screen, as if they were trying to imitate Woody Allen. It was so annoying. We all know how Will Ferrell really talks and does not stumble over his words like Mr. Allen. The comedy part of the movie was as boring as the tragedy and it was definitely never fun or funny. I must admit that I have never been a huge fan of Woody Allen, and this movie definitely did not convince me. I think his writing was just as bad as his direction. This movie will be one of the worst 10 movies I've ever seen.
