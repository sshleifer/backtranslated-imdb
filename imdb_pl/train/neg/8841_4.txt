Parasomnia has interesting premises, but history is poorly made without any tension or even logical approach. The cast was unconvincing, even Patrick Kilpatrick, who played great roles in movies such as Scanner Cop 2, Open Fire, Under Siege 2 and Eraser. The rest of the cast is unknown (and not very good) except Jeffrey Combs. (Herbert West from the great Re-Animator trilogy). But he can play such roles in a dream (which is a bit of what he does here). The main problem is that the actions of the heroes do not make any sense at all. The story is rather boring and predictable thanks to cheap computer effects mixed with some scenes with bloody scenes, especially at the end. <br /> <br /> It could have been a lot better, I do not have good reviews about it. It is really below average.
