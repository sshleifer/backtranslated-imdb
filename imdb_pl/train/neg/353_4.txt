As other reviewers have noted, the film dies in the last 1/2 hour. Earlier, however, he suffers from the predictability and stupefying, uninteresting game of Kate Capshaw, who apparently never found her character and does not ruin every scene in which she is. with a sense of unreality. And the ending is just weird. The creators of the film apparently knew when they had gathered this mess together, that all they needed was sweet potato and pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving dinner, so to compensate, they added an exaggerated "dramatic" result. Each little jump is accompanied by the crescendo of orchestration, until it becomes ridiculous. If you want to see an example of a serious bad league movie, you can see it, otherwise skip it.
