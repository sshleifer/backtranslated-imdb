It's a simple story, but it's very manipulative. There is no pathos, because it leaves no room for imagination or a personal thought or time for reflection. <br /> <br /> The animation is well done, but I feel it is too presentable. I would prefer more pictures in the back, more space in the background and maybe it would not be so kitschy for me. <br /> <br /> But for a Hollywood movie it works well, but it's a very derivative of Aardman movies and it disturbs me. Perhaps a longer movie will work if the creator does not have a reader. <br /> <br /> I think that the voice is too glibic.
