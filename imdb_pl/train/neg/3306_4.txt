A very "nice" nice old lady, desperately looking for money to save her home and belongings, grows "in a pot" in her home, smokes him with some old-fashioned friends and then sells. This is the story of this low-key comedy, emphasizing the absurdity of the situation and a bit of humor that brings trouble. He works for most of the movie. Humor does not belong to laughter - loud diversity, but it provides entertainment for one and a half hours, so I think it is for this purpose. <br /> <br /> There are fun moments and Brenda Blethyn has a great time playing the main role. But the ending really ruined the "sweet" movie with insulting-bad news that only the ultra-liberals of the movie world would like to see. <br /> <br /> Like most people, I would prefer a happy ending, too, but not everything should be warm and blurry for those who grossly break the law. Also here are typical (1) extra-marital children, but they are not a problem and are considered to be okay; (2) clergy depicted as morally weak people; and (3) even a doctor who is also stoned! <br /> <br /> Hi? And the reviewers here are exploding Hollywood? It shows how lay society has lowered standards in Britain and Europe in general. Hey, people: at least they have a trace of morals instead of anything except Timothy Leary, "If it feels good, do it."
