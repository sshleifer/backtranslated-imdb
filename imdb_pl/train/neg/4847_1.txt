As always, I am doing a crazy review of films that I have not seen before while waiting for the Oscars. I really could not wait to see this movie because it seemed to be right behind me. I can not understand why this movie got noise all my life. There is no history !! A group of guys writhe in Iraq. One day they distract the bomb. Tomorrow they entwine the area, no less and start shooting snipers. Do not wait here, they return to Baghdad. There is no consistent history at all. The three main characters are so marked that they are ordinary caricatures. I mean, we have a sweet kid who's afraid of death. We have a hardened military who is practical and just wants to get back safely. And then we have a daredevil cowboy who does not stick to the rules, but has a weakness for a prematurely born Iraqi kid trying to sell DVD to soldiers. What do you think will happen? Well, do you think a cowboy soldier who does not follow the rules will make a sweet kid get hurt because of his renegades? Why so! Do you think an Iraqi kid, for whom a cowboy soldier has a weakness, will be killed and make him mad? Why so! There is no history here. The script is underage and predictable! The camera is very shaken to look "artistically". And for all of you who think it's such a great war image, go and hire "Full Metal Jacket", "Deerhunter" or "Platoon". Do not waste time or money on this boring movie!
