I would not give this film an assessment, it is not worthy. I just watched it because I'm a Pfieffer fan. I love her and I will watch everything she does. Even in this ass, she did not disappoint. Every scene she was in made the viewer watch ... wait ... for something that happened, but nothing ever happened. He had some good threads, but they ended abruptly when they started. Some other characters had potential, but nothing happened. <br /> <br /> Pfieffer was 29 years old when she made the film and its most beautiful. The wardrobe and set were surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> I can mainly watch everything and I rarely see a movie. I can not find anything I like about it, but it was a dud. I do not understand. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that at the end he had a large hanger for the cliffs. She had an ending scene that woke you up and said wow, that movie finally changed and then the subtitles. Oh, yen. <br /> <br /> I agree with the review that says .99 would buy 3 cans of cat food, and watching my cat would be more exciting. Well said. Actually, this comment was more fun than a movie because it sums it up so well. I also wasted 0.99 cents on this dud.dud.dud.
