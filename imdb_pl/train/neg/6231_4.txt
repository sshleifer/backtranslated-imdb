All components of the iconic b-movie cinema. Topless (and bottomless) girls, kung fu, kick chefs, slaves, evil Germans with mustaches, Cameron Mitchell and zombie swords. <br /> <br /> And of course, the breasts of Camille Keaton, which is the most famous exhibition appears in the feminist classic of exploitation I Spit on Your Grave. We must also mention the shepard gem hooters who play the whore in the last movie The Cooler. <br /> <br /> A lot of blood and action with knives, swords and martial arts among topless dancers in a bar, a brothel, and a cargo of martial arts boats heading for an island of zombies, where evil war artists are dying or something like that . <br /> <br /> Tops and bottoms easily fall off and often, because travelers are well lubricated thanks to the owner of the boat. <br /> <br /> Then a disaster strikes when their boat is destroyed and they land on the zombie island where monks massively sacrifice young girls to dead martial artists to bring them back to life. <br /> <br /> Once you thought he had everything, there are piranhas in the water. Yummy Yum Big fat German for supper. <br /> <br /> Only for your next zombie festival.
