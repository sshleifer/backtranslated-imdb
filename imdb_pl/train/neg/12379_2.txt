Based on the positive reviews above, we saw a free show of the last night. Now I KNOW filmmakers make positive reviews because there is no way an objective person can write them. "Intended to become an" iconic classic "? The theater was full, apparently with friends and families of the production team, because only a few of us left at the first hour. <br /> <br /> The songs were the most literal I've ever heard in a musical ?? "Do not take a shortcut, honey, there is a wolf in the forest ...". Debi Mazar's eyes blinked furiously as she tried to sing. Fortunately, most of the melody lasted only a few lines. <br /> <br /> Now everyone who plays a wolf in this story should be charming and seductive. Instead, we get Joey Fatone, a former N'Syncer who lives according to his name, because he is not of a good age. It is not a lithe with extra makeup weighing 50 pounds and juniors in high school and singing singing. Seriously, this guy was in the vocal group? The rest of the actors are semi-adequate, but they can not do much with an unimaginable scenario. You know, you can write for adults and children at the same time? see "Pixar". <br /> <br /> The positive thing is that the virtual sets looked nice and were well integrated with the actors. And it was not as insulting as "Crash."
