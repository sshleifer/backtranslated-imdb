I love Columbo and I've seen almost all episodes, but this one is undoubtedly one of the worst. Incredibly boring, senseless, jumbled pile of unobservable nonsense, which wastes both the time of watching the audience and the acting talent of the incredibly bored Peter Falk. The "plot", as it is, seems to have been invented, because the film goes hand in hand with even the smallest hint of ingredients to the formula, which made the performance such a great beginning. One of the parts of the proceedings that I found extremely mysterious (or probably annoying) was the figure of Peter Falk, who was presented to guests at the wedding as "Lt" Columbo. If the producers insist on keeping Columbo's name a secret, why would not they completely skip this line because it sounds ridiculous? As I said, these are the pits and all true Columbo fans would do well to avoid it like a plague.
