The main disadvantage of this movie is that you can not believe that any of these people will ever be cast in Macbeth's professional production. Hearing how the gentle voice of David Lansbury is struggling with the famous speech "Tomorrow, Tomorrow and Tomorrow", you can not believe anyone will ever consider him in this role. So I believed that he did not get a role because he was a bad actor; not because a larger name was available. Then, when we see the fragments of the show on the rehearsal, it's hard to believe that the director does not parody things hopelessly ill-rendered, misdirected parody of actors who are unable to express or even understand a poem and directors who see art using their own interpretations. Sometimes directors so much want their films to be made (and the authors think they have the ability to manage their own work) that they agree on less. This seems to be such an example.
