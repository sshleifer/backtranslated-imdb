I like silent movies, but it was a bit too moronic. As much as I would like, I could say that it was worth the hour when I got up. I can not. I do not think any version of the movie is close to the book. And do not try it on children, they may be surprised. And the lady who played Pollyanna, how old was she? 38? I know that labor laws were different then ... BUT PEOPLE HOLD.
