The film is about Sir Christopher Strongu (MP - a member of the parliament - in this role Colin Clive) and his romance with a character similar to Amelia Earhart played by Katherine Hepburn. Until they met, he was a very devoted husband, but when he met the strange but fascinating Hepburn, he "could not resist" and fell in love. It can be said because they often stare into space and talk SAFELY about how painful their unrequited love is. Honestly, it's a terribly outdated movie and practically impossible to watch. Part of the problem is that in the days preceding the Codex, adultery-making films were very common. Besides, even if you accept this morally suspicious subject, the total satisfaction of the dialog makes it sound like a nineteenth-century romantic novel ... and really bad. Sticky and difficult to like characters (in the end, Clive's wife is a nice woman and does not harm anyone) makes it a great waste of time. The only interesting aspect of this movie is the costume that Hepburn wears in the early stage when she is dressed in a moth costume! You have to see it to believe it - and it looks like Bugaloos (unclear but matching reference).
