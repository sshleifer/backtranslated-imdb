I've seen romantic comedies and this is one of the easiest / worst trials. Many of the scenes work in a "plug-and-play" manner, closely fitting the romantic comedy genre. Usually, it's okay because we're dealing with a genre, but the challenge is to be original, new and imaginative. This movie does not do this. <br /> <br /> There is no point in who the characters are, except Sylvie Moreau (who is the real star of the movie, not Isabelle Blais). They fit into this one-dimensional banality and become nothing but ordinary dolls for a very light narrative. <br /> <br /> The tempo of the movie can become irritating, no rhythm, and the editing is filled with unnecessary close-ups. I should also mention too stylized decorations, which make some of the scenes are deprived of natural or rather make the test seem obviously too obvious. Of course, along with this, you have good music that often sounds unmatched. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that the film that makes the obvious allusions of Woody Allen ends with this deceptive. If you expect a good romantic comedy, that's not it. Or rather, it was a bad attempt. You will leave the theater, wondering why this film is so praised when the cinema is over 100 years old, and Quebec's directors are better, making better films. <br /> <br /> Les Aimants is a good movie for what it is. But it's bad if you think cinema as an art and directors for the authors.
