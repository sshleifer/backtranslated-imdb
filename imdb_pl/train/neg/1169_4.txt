This interesting piece of cardboard, this unnecessary piece of time has nothing to do with it. It is too weak and spectacularly does not create the tension and fear that real characters must have felt when they avoided the capricious hand of justice of the French Revolution. Eric Rohmer at the age of 82? It shows.
