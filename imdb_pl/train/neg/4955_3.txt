In the light of the recent and quite good Batman Brave and Brave, it's time to take a fatal blow to this mistake in Batman's life. Being a big fan since Tim Burton first awakened 20 years ago, I was able to accept different tonalities of characters, dark or camp. This one is simply unbelievable: too many effects, bad intrigues and so few questions. Great in Batman is the diversity of his skills and aspects of his personality: detective, criminal, playboy, philanthropist, etc. Batman shows him only in karate days. And by the way, where the Penguin is capable of such virtuosity, jumping in the air, regardless of his crazy troupe? And look at Joker, Blanka's mix of Street Fighter 2 and the stereotypical reggae man that a Batman fan could accept such betrayal? In any case, not me. Batman is much better without the article "The" before his name.
