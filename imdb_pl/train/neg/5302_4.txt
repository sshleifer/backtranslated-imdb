Dewaana as the film passes ordinary stereotypes. A man and a woman fall in love and get married, the husband is allegedly killed by a family friend who wants their family fortune, the woman re-marries and unexpectedly unexpected husband # 1. The film reminds Chandni Yash Chopry and countless others. Divya Bharti and Shah Rukh Khan give good performances. Amrish Puri as a villain goes through the movements and is nothing but an ordinary Bollywood villain. The music of Nadeem Shravana is great, all the songs were brilliant. My favorites are piles of Sochenge tumhe or Koyi na koyi chahiyye. Dewanna is an ordinary movie that goes through movements.
