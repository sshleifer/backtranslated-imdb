The man wakes up from the nightmare of bats. He and his wife go out into the desert for a picnic on their honeymoon. He seems to hear a strange noise, and it is disturbed by the view of a bat crawling over a picnic blanket. He wants to go on a tour of the cave, which has something to do with some work he does, but he wants to enjoy the honeymoon. She gives way. They go on tour, but leave the group to look around. It falls on a slope where insects are troubled by it. He follows her. He can hear the strange noise again and he seems to know that the bat is approaching; one does and gets into her hair. He fights her and attacks him, biting his forehead. <br /> <br /> They leave the cave, but when they are in a gondola in a ski resort, they start to have attacks in which they have hallucinations or visions of bats attacking people. It's angry when it happens. He can not drink alcohol without spitting it out. His wife worries about rabies and starts treatment with Pasteur, but reacts violently to the injection. <br /> <br /> And then some people die. We see parts of the transformation of a man into a bat person. It looks like it's not just his mind. Whether the bite of a bat causes these transformations is not clear, because he already had some symptoms before the bite. <br /> <br /> Although the title seems inappropriate, at the end it is suggested that the same thing happens to the next person. Not a good movie, but I liked the diversity of the desert, the cave and the ski slopes, as well as some stranger scenes. I did not think it would be as bad as other people, and I did not think that Bats' movie from 1999 was as bad as others think (I rated him on 5/10).
