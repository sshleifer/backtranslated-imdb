My friend loaned me this movie and I was very excited about watching it, but after ten minutes of slow vocals from James Hetfield and Lars dashing into his drum kit in what seemed to be a slow pace, I started to think, "Why am I watching this? This question will move in your mind in 5 ?? 10 minutes after pressing Play. I gave the tape the same day you suspect, it's not worth buying or watching! <br /> <br /> Only my opinion! <br /> <br />
