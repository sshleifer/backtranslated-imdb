The plot was boring, the girls were disgusting, and the alleged Italian man had apparently never heard the Italian accent. Someone said the boys are cute in this movie, but it seems to be filled with average people. There were literally no redemption opportunities in this film. <br /> <br /> I think it's a cemetery for actors who will never work again, with the unfortunate exception of the Olsen twins who seem to be fascinated by people for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> I hope that the Olsen twins will find something in the spotlight to keep them out of the entertainment industry. There is no place in this place.
