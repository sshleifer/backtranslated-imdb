The rumor is true: girls like COYOTE UGLY more than guys. And the reasons are obvious as soon as the plot is given. The Jersey girl goes to New York to become a songwriter. And after the initial frustration of being unlucky, he eavesdrops on how some girls party around $ 300 they did last night. He gets a hearing at the bar where he works and surprises! The place is full of "two-year-old kids" breaking at the sight of dancing babes. <br /> <br /> The story is not bad and some characters are nice, especially Cammie (part of the "fashion coordinator" was lovely) and goalkeeper, but let's face it, the drama was horrible and completely ridiculous from the very beginning. Violet and her father looked too funny when they were talking in the whole movie. And check Violet on this keyboard with break dancer! <br /> <br /> For the first time, I could think how production could be so horrible? For a brief moment with this movie, Hollywood can stand on two legs and show a new place without major public protests, not saying "You have been warned!" Instead, it seems that COYOTE UGLY has the intentional desire to kiss every major backside of the world. Advertisement babes in the bar, but showing a thin story "make your dreams come true" disappointed every teenager you aimed! <br /> <br /> And finally music. There was absolutely no break in the music I found in this movie, especially when it was needed (a hospital scene). Each scene was like a short music video that you would like to keep until the strap opens. But the culmination was the ultimate laugh: a song similar to the 1980s. Cyndi Lauper would expect to jump on stage and play with Violet. Heck, I personally thought Bon Jovi was going to jump out with long hair and jam! <br /> <br /> Other than a really smart camera, it works with girls coyotes during dance (especially on a wet stage) and a pair of sweet cliches, COYOTE UGLY is something that can be completely embarrassed. Regardless of whether you watched or did it, it looked like killing time. Or waste depending on how you look at it.
