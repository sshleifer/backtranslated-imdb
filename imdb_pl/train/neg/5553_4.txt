The third Darkman was definitely better than the second, but still much worse than the original movie. What made it better than D2 was that the Bad Guy was changed, and Durant was not brought back again. What's more, there was a hint of character development in the case of the bad guy's family and Darkman himself. It made my heart soften and I gave this move as much as 4/10, i.e. ** / *****.
