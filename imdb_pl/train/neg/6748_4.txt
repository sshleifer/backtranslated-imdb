Let me say that I followed the movie watching Saw and Bleed, Saw looked like the greatest horror movie ever, though I thought it was only pretty good. Bleeding is very bad. The best thing is to see a female cast naked. The blood is very false. It has its fun parts, but it is extremely predictable and I did not want to stay to see a terrible ending. If I could, I would forbid those actors and actresses. The only reason is that Debbie Rochon (Maddy) was in over one hundred other films and I saw two other cast members in equally or inferior films. They should not let this madness continue.
