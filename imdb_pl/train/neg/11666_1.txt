As gently as I can, I honestly believe that this movie is a waste of time. I did not consider him a "warm, emotionally satisfying" movie that others did. I found it boring, with music that turned my attention away from the movie. The story was thin, the figures were exaggerated and the direction of walking. <br /> <br /> Fooey. <br /> <br /> Now I am going to write more about this film, so I'll make 10 minimum lines. There really is no more to say, and brevity is important, but IMDb has its minimum, so here goes. <br /> <br /> A young eager kid finds a nascent talent, looking for a time with an aging, embittered mentor despite his father's cartoon homophobia. An aging, discontented mentor turns out to drink a lot and teaches little. conflict arises. Although I do not think it's a spoiler, I added a warning if someone feels that too much information is too much. <br /> <br /> Mostly I just found a boring and pretentious movie. Loss of my time. Honestly, I do not understand how little confusion is there, mainly on this web page, about the transcendent quality of this film. I think it is really worth avoiding. But, as Dennis Miller said, "Maybe I'm wrong."
