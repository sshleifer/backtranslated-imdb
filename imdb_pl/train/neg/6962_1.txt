How could such good actors like Jean Rochefort and Carole Bouquet be involved in such ... and ... well, such things? I can not get it. It was horrible, very bald played (but some of the few major roles), jokes are stupid and absolutely not fun ... I will not talk about this film anymore, except for one small council: do not go see it will be a waste of time and money.
