This film, after a special extracurricular school, is not so bad, and this is a problem. Nothing happens. You feel as if you were still in class. The guy teaches a group of young weaker players how to be good football players. We never see how weaker people do bad because a good player is training them. Through meditation, they suddenly turn into good players. There are too many characters and no character development. Too much time is devoted to the main character and his sexy sister, and too little to other children. It may have felt the "Bad News Bears" (original), because there was a girl in the band of all boys, but he did not feel the movie at all. He has no feeling and leaves a dull pain in your bones after seeing him, he's not fun packing, he's not cool to watch, and he's just ... there. Plain. Boring. Something you see after school before the evening nap. As boring as the day is long and watching this movie took a long, long time.
