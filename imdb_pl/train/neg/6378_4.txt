This movie was sometimes funny, sometimes hell was almost fun. <br /> <br /> However, the message I received from the movie was that women are responsible for all human problems. Every time a woman appears in the film, she is lazy, slutty or regrets some poor guy for no apparent reason. I do not think the message is good for women and homosexuals. <br /> <br /> But it's a comedy and a work of art, so it's just someone's point of view. Even if I disagree with it, they are still eligible. <br /> <br /> A fun movie, but some of the comments of others are simply stupid. The best movie ever my foot.
