Urgh! 3 things that the film needs: a good script, a good story and a good casting. I watched this movie, which he expected to be awfully horrible and sadly disappointed when he was just awful. I lost the will to live in half. The only thing that stopped me from a piercing fork was Rose Byrne (which was primarily the reason I watched him). She did a good job because Rastus and her appearance have changed little since she turned 13. It was a fantastic first effort in the film. the dog was also very good. they both did a great job with such a terrible material. Sandra Bernhard, I think it was the biggest mistake of the film. she was completely confused and I do not think she ever got a character. <br /> <br /> I give the film 2 out of 10 - and only thanks to Rose.
