I just sat in the theater bored as hell, I wanted to leave halfway through the movie. The plot is simple 4 guys from Samoa destroy wedding parties. So they must bring dates to get married. Yawn. <br /> <br /> What pissed me the most was the so-called primitive jokes ... They were very unpleasant, clich√©d and thrown in your face so that you could enter a boring movie. Acting was below average and I felt that this movie just lasted and had nothing to do with many unpalatable jokes and a predictable plot. <br /> <br /> In total, one of the worst movies I've seen in 2006, obscene, bad acting, just ugly. <br /> <br /> Thank God, my friend shouted. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
