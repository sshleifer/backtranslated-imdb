The above title is used to introduce the film "Gen" to the public. Gen talks about a young doctor (Doga Rutkay) with a sick mother. The film begins with the fact that he leaves his mother to start a new job. While driving, we realize that it is not as close to the home as the hospital is in a remote area. As soon as he enters the hospital's garden, he sees the patient's dead body. This is the beginning of a nightmare for the next few days. <br /> <br /> Two policemen come to the hospital to investigate suicide. In fact, they will have to stay in the hospital because all roads are cut off due to bad weather conditions. All their communication with the outside world is also cut off. No way out!! There will be more nasty murders in these few days. Now everyone is suspecting each other. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the idea is brilliant. It could have been really scary. Of course there are positive sides of the film. I really like the beginning of the movie. Especially when he goes to the hospital and the first moments in the hospital. The actions are fine. Some of them try to be too mysterious and frightening. I think that the final shock should be transferred to the whole movie. I'm just saying that it was a good return, but instead of showing it as a parody, we should realize that it comes when we see what is happening. The director had to explain it, which in my opinion did not work well. The most dangerous patient in the film is to be at least 48 years old, but his body looks so young and suitable for someone who spends most of his life in this hospital. Finally, I would like to say a few things about the director. I'm sure it will improve. This is his first attempt. Recently, I learned that he is only 21 years old. Thanks to that, I felt more positive about him and his future films. However, I do not intend to evaluate this film * from *****.
