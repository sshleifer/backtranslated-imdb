I'm not sure what Diane Silver was thinking when she made this movie, but apparently it had nothing to do with Richard Wright's novel on which the movie rests. <br /> <br /> We read a novel in the past summer at AP English 12 and just watched the movie. During the periodic notes and clock checking, I considered the chances of a lightning strike. Of course, the sky was completely clear and I had to watch the rest of the movie ... and then write a 5-paragraph essay on this topic. <br /> <br /> Wright's novel discussed very real subjects, the mind of the killer and psychology. Silver's movie turned the murderer into a victim, which is NOT what Wright wanted (see "How he was born" 454). <br /> <br /> I'm going to do it short and sweet: if you want to leave your awareness, in the words of Raphael Lambert, unblemished, skip the movie and read the book. Adaptation from 1986. It is not a thought-provoking material. <br /> <br /> ... :: Sigh: Now I have to write an essay.
