I'm not a big fan of Stooges slapstick, but their story is interesting. Recently, I tried to check things from every Stooge era, but the opportunity to see Joe's short pants does not seem easy; this is the only one I have seen so far. <br /> <br /> Some argue that problems with the quality of Joe's pants are not really Joe's fault, and I suspect that's the case. Joe as a performer is not the worst of it. What disturbs me the most is highlighted in another commentary: the rage of the other guys against the third violates the entire ethos of the comedy band / Stooges. Perhaps Joe's style was seen by those responsible for not fitting him - though there were no real conflicts outside the camera between him and the others - and that was their way of working. <br /> <br /> And what about the titles of this and some other late Stooges shorts? There is definitely no creativity there; Do these things cause the cause or effect of the shorts to dry up?
