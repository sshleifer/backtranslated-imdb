My Name is Modesty is a low-budget film about the beginnings of Modesta Blaise. It's not that the movie is terrible, it's not what I expected and what I was hoping for. Although I have been aware of the character of Modesta Blaise for years, I am not too familiar with comic books or graphic novels, so I enter this film as something from the outside. This may be the reason for my disappointment. I expected more action and more comedy. The film is driven by dialogue. I suppose I was looking for something with a slightly larger camp value. In fact, My Name is Modesty is a deadly serious movie. There are very few lights, if at all. Acting, at least from Alexandra Staden, is acceptable, but nothing extraordinary. As others comment, it seems to be a bit too fragile to be completely credible in the title role. What action scenes are in My Name is Modesty are one of the weakest points in the film. I never thought that this woman could deal with a group of trained killers. <br /> <br /> I really hope that Quentin Tarantino will go ahead and make the rumor a big budget movie based on Modesty Blaise. I am convinced that the concept has a lot of potential and I am very happy about it.
