I can not say much about this film. I think it speaks for itself (like the current ratings here). I rented it about two years ago and I completely regretted it. Even / I tried / liked to watch it twice, but I just could not. I can honestly say that I have absolutely no desire to ever see this waste of time. And I'm not one of those who cost a movie, but I really believe it was awful. It was not even fun. The only thing I liked was a few scenes with Christopher Walken. I think that this film destroyed both Jacek Black and Ben Stiller. The only thing I think about seeing one of their films now is this horrible movie and reminds me not to waste my money. Amy Poehler is also very annoying. <br /> <br /> In general, I think you understand. By the way, the stars are for Walken.
