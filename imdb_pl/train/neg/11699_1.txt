The Thinner story is definitely thin. And disgusting. An obese lawyer leads a gypsy woman, and a gypsy curse causes him to lose and lose weight ... to the bone. OK, gypsy curses should be fun, but the weight loss went wrong? No. It's just that Stephen King thinks so. And Michael McDowell, another horror writer and screenwriter of this fatal movie, does it too. A lawyer is not only irresponsible, he is fat, haha! Thinner is like an immature piece of shit for a person who moans, like he has never seen anything so disgusting than obesity. Hey, I can only say: Well, look at the mirror.
