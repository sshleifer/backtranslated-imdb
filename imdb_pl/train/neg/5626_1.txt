I caught this movie on a tube on Sunday. I thought it was so bad that I checked IMDb to see what others think. I was not surprised by the amount of stupid people who liked this fluff. I was surprised, however, when I looked at the comments to read the "Hate" categories, but I found that they were not there. I was shocked by this; I always look at the hated, because they are always the ones who hate the film no matter how good it is. Somehow this movie survived unscathed by hatred I'm not talking about, and I'm proud to announce that I hate this movie! I know that I should describe in detail why I hate this movie, but to do this, the film would gain more respect than it deserves.
