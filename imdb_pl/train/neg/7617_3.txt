This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, but the Hostel is definitely inferior. This movie is more fun and funny than frightening. I laughed most of the time when I watched. Low quality effects (when you watch them, you will understand what I am talking about and HOW is quality), bad actors (I hear about them for the first time) and it looks like a camera is shot by an amateur (and therefore more like a TV show than movie). But at least I had patience to watch it to the end. How are comedies? Watch it. Do you want a horror movie? Go and watch Ju-On: The Grudge or some other good horror movie. <br /> <br /> If I'm talking about Legend of Diablo, I do not even know if I can classify him in the Horror genre. Just a bit of a bad budget. <br /> <br /> I rate it on 3 out of 10
