How many times do we have to watch bad horror movies with the killer in the Scream-ripoff mask? The Bleed story is somewhat original, but the film itself is a complete failure. First of all, dialogue is poorly developed, it is boring and it wastes too much time for trivial details, the action is bad and so on. I want to get my money back, this rental smells worse than skunks.
