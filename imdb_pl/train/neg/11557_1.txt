* SOILER * It's false! The whole thing is false! There are no ghosts or zombies, Alan is Lord, and his cousin, brother or half-brother or something like that wants the castle and its title. So he invests this overly complicated and unnecessary plan without SCOOBY-DOO, which is to get Alan to commit suicide. Most of the movie is collecting red and attacking them. He does not even kill them. He falls asleep, and the girl disappears and thinks he's buried them somewhere. If he looked at the so-called Evelyn spirit, he would know he was wearing gloves! My God, what a waste of time. Do not worry about watching, renting, and if you bought it and have not seen it yet, sell it. Fast! Do yourself a favor and stay away from the NIGHT EVELINES THAT WERE folded. I give this smelly CRAP-O-LANTERN.
