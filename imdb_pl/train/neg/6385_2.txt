Gayniggers from Outer Space is a summary of the name. Operating for just 27 minutes, he describes a homosexual black space ship arriving to Earth to free men from women. While I see little significance for the plot, it is also very illogical. It's true that it's supposed to be a comedy / parody about society and science fiction. I laughed a few times, so I succeed. <br /> <br /> The special effects are terrible. When a spaceship floats above the Earth, you can see the stars increase for no apparent reason. The asteroids shown at the beginning look false, the equipment on the ship is illogical, there are a few spelling mistakes in the text, the actors are unconvincing, the characters are collapsed; in general, the whole thing is not taken seriously. If you go through all the aspects that make it a bad movie, it's very accessible and easy to see. Some parts are fun. But in general, the only thing you stay about is that it was one of the most absurd concepts in history. <br /> <br /> Seeing that this is a short movie and has some fun aspects, this is not the worst thing to see. But this is illogical and has little long-term value. I can not really recommend it; if you watch it, do it for a unique concept, not for quality.
