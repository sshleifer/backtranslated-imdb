Question for all the girls who are there: If a man you've never met before accidentally called you on purpose and continued at the most indiscreet moments, would you be intrigued by him or so scared that you would call the police? Yes, I thought so, I could not swallow the idea of ​​Marty Gerrard, who can stand the unwarranted attention of Connor Hilla <br /> <br /> ***** MILD SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> It's really stupid history. Connor Hill's wife is murdered, and the plot revolves around the question of whether Connor calls Marti to let him have an alibi? But there is a huge logic gap here, did not Connor hire a frequent visitor? something that seems to ignore the accusation. And were there no criminals at the crime scene? Why, then, does the whole process rest on Connara, calling Marti during the murder? Stupid Stupid Stupid And this is as predictable as it is brainless. <br /> <br /> My lasting mention of this movie is that Marti Gerrard is really a bad downhill skier.
