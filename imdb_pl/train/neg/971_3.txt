After reading some very good reviews about this movie, I thought I would give him a watch and after I was very disappointed with the movie, I thought I would give him my own review. This is my first time so naked with me. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would scratch the horror of this genre, because in no way is it terrifying or scary in the slightest degree (except for a few weak attempts I will make you jump, unfortunately, one of them worked on me.) I would say that calling this movie a thriller pushes him because I was not particularly excited! The film is about a spoiled playful girl who faints a few times. In these times, he visits the house he draws, after each visit he decides to add something else to life, to revive one of the functions of a sad boy who is also sick in reality. When she makes friends with her boyfriend, she realizes that her imaginary world she created is actually better than the real world in which she is. and the boy must escape from his claws. <br /> <br /> Think it's an attempt to be a bit more mild version of A Nightmare On Elm Street, but more like a trip to the beach. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I hope that generous 3/10 will stop at least one of you from watching this gray!
