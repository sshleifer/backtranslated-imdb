It was a disappointment - nothing out of the nuances of the original. The British just seem to be able to create a really disturbing movie with none of the above-average histrionics in the American version. The original series combined terrifying stories and subtlety of execution with great attention to lighting and settings. I have watched the series many times and I am still fascinated. <br /> <br /> Another weak adaptation following the horrifying adaptation of "Cracker". Make friends with BBC America or BBC Canada and observe attractions such as Waking the Dead, Spooks, Silent Witness and Judge John Deed. Look at the original Touching Evil, then look for "Wire in the Blood" to get more of the really subtle, elegant performances of Robson Green. Hollywood must have a look at this actor!
