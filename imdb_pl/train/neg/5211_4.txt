Ha. no doubt Tommy is bad here. I do not know why, but for some reason, small children in horror movies tend to meet as small bullets. and because they are children, they will not die. because they are annoying ... well ... beyond the asylum of terror. but these are few. <br /> <br /> Anyway, on the movie. Can not find this movie on DVD? of course you can! all you need to do is buy the Chilling Classics DVD package! you will not only get Metamorphosis on DVD for $ 15, but you'll also get 49 OTHER FILMS! but the opportunity! pff. WELL. I finished advertising those bad movies. let's say that this movie is not worth $ 15 in itself. <br /> <br /> So we have a chemist-scientist. Yes. Because all chemistry scientists look just as handsome as this guy playing Peter. He tries to come up with a serum to stop the degradation of the body. The college in which he works wants to pull the plug from his project, so he tries it himself. but because it is a horror movie, it sucks it off and begins an incredibly long transformation sequence that occupies almost 3/4 of the movie. <br /> <br /> To make up the movie, it goes into a relationship with some woman who has a son. and she never married! scandalous! But of course Tommy is one of the most annoying figures .... no. I take that back. He is the most annoying figure. Much worse than an old, crippled guy who wants to take Peter's job and sink into it while he's in the hospital. it's true, even as an old cripple, you can still be a villain. <br /> <br /> So we see that Peter begins to randomly kill some people in the visions he has until he realizes that he is doing it and just decides to kill everyone on his way to return to normalcy. However, eventually it ends with an evolution into a lizard. Yes, I know, do not ask. The ending really does not make sense. And if you're hoping for a really good payout, you will not get it. <br /> <br /> This is not a scary movie .... it's just frustrating because of the lack of a good payoff. if you already have a package of 50 films, and this is next on the list, you're not on nap, but you're not in a great movie either. Sit back, relax and eat a lot of snacks. Because this movie will not make you jump out of your skin in the near future. <br /> <br /> Metamorphosis gets 4 plastic lizards, out of 10.
