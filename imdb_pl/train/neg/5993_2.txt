I grew up (born in 1965) watching and loving Thunderbirds. All my buddies watched at school. We played in the Thunderbirds before school, during lunch and after school. We all wanted to be Virgil or Scott. Nobody wanted to be Alan. The countdown from 5 has become a form of art. I took my children to a movie, hoping to see what I loved as a child. How bitterly disappointing. The only climax was the thematic melody. Not that it could match the original Thunderbird score. Fortunately, early Saturday mornings, one TV channel still plays replays of the series Gerry Anderson and his wife. Jonatha Frakes should hand over the director's chair, his version was completely hopeless. Loss of the film. Total rubbish. The CGI remake may be acceptable, but replacing the Homo sapiens subsp. sapiens was a huge court error.
