I wanted to see the action comedy with a satirical accent (how this movie was advertised), but it let me down miserably. For me, the plot was a bit confusing and I quickly lost interest. I am very sorry about John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff for getting involved in this movie. I will remain a fan of all of them, but only time can heal my feelings about it. The only thing I can say positive about the movie is that Hillary played Yonika so well that I did not even recognize Hillary; a few scenes took me to realize that it was her. Fortunately, I rented it for $ 1 to Red Box; If I paid to see it on the big screen, I would be really pissed!
