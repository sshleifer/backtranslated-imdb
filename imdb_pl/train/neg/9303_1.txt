I am writing this review, watching it a few months ago. The trailer looked promising, so I bought this bad excuse for the film. It's a complete joke ... and literally spit in the face of the real classics of the early generation of horror, such as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), which they even had the opportunity to compare on the back of the cover. The producer who played Brandon should flip hamburgers and serve greasy hamburgers ... hell, maybe not even good at it! The lighting was bad and the big irritation in the movie you sometimes did not even see. I do not even remember the other cast members, which is really sad and bad, they never do anything to make an impression to make them unforgettable. I will be wasting this review all the time. PLEASE stay as far away from this pile of rubbish, even if you get it for 25 cents, do not buy rubber, at least provide entertainment! br /> <br /> If you want good quality low-budget fun, much better than this one ... check Jeff Hayes' movie ... because it requires talent to do it in horror and the kid has it! <br /> <br /> I gave this 1 star only for the cover ... it's the only thing that you want to like with the so-called "film" <br /> <br /> -Rick Blalock
