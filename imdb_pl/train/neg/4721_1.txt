Before watching this video, read the online reviews on the falsification of events in the film, especially its forerunners regarding the widely accepted fact that 7-8 000 Muslims were expelled from Srebrenica and shot by Serbian paramilitary units. The documentary also belongs to various pro-Serbian American organizations. Watch this video critically and read reviews before. Most reviews say a documentalist raises arguments too much, even if he raises questions about conventional wisdom about war. Stephen Holden's review in NYTimes states that "it would be inaccurate to label this pro-Serbian document," but one should question both the presentation of facts, many of which come from credible sources, and the omission of those facts that inculcate Serbian forces. I do not recommend against watching this documentary, but I warn you that you should examine it with a particularly critical eye (as you should do all the time).
