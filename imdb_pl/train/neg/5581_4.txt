1960s (1999) D: Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sisto, Jordana Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Annie Corley, Charles S. Dutton. The NBC mini series (later released as a video / DVD as a full-length feature film) about the treacherous 1960s, seen through the eyes of both the white family and the black family. The first half of the movie is driven by Dutton's outstanding performance as Reverend Willie Taylor and spreads the story evenly among the families. However, the figure of Dutton is killed in half, and the black family is completely forgotten in a dull, incoherent and almost horrible second half. RATING: 4 out of 10. Not rated (later rated PG-13 for video / DVD release).
