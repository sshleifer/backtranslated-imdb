Maybe it's dubbing, and maybe endless scenes of people crying, groaning or otherwise continuing, but I've found Europe 51 as one of the most overloaded (and therefore annoying) movies I've ever seen. The film starts promising if it is a friend, because mum Ingrid Bergman is too busy to spend time with his spoiled brat son (Sandro Franchin). While mummy and father (nauseate Aleksander Knox) ​​entertain their guests at the party, the youngster tries to kill himself, launching a life-changing series of events in which Bergman spends time with compassion for the poor and the needy. Inspired by the communist publisher Andrea (Ettore Giannini), she soon spends more time with the oppressed than with her husband who soon closes her in a mad hospital for her troubles. Bergman plays the role of a saint in his hand, reminding her of the role of Joan of Arc from 1948, and Rossellini performs a fantastic lighting job and filming it to get the best effect. Unfortunately, the script comes back to the heart with subtlety in the style of ham, because Andrea and Mama change the declarations of Marxist and Christian platitudes. In the last scene, steeped in tears, I had more than my fulfillment of these tiring characters. A real step towards Rossellini when he left the neorealism and embraced the mythical and mystical themes of 1950. Flowers of Saint. Francis.
