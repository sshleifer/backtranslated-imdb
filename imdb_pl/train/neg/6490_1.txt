Okay ... I've seen many really strange / unusual films in my time. The fear and disgust at Las Vegas come to mind when I think about it. Well, not anymore ... from now on, when someone asks me, "hey, what's the most amazing movie you've ever seen?" Slipstream is what I say! And I do not mean "unusual" in a good way. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning of the film, it was obvious that it would be one of those movies with the "trippy camera effect" effect. I mean small things, like flashing images on the screen, scrolling and scrolling words and scenes of people forward, wandering with the color on the screen, flashing forward and constantly flashing back ... then you have real action. People randomly become aggressive, shoot things / people, they say the strangest things that just do not do much, if at all. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of a writer who begins to mix real life with a book that he writes and the lack of a better way to explain it, basically you see the "journey" that he continues throughout the film. The thing is, Johnny Depp has made a similar trip in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, but the only difference is that his trip was fun to watch, not painful! Honestly, I had a really tough time, even finishing Slipstream. It hurt my brain a bit. <br /> <br /> I can see how some movie lovers claim that this movie has some cinematic nuances that make it not only unique, but also encourages dementia ... blah, blah, blah. The point is that this film hurts your brain when you watch it .... it has a very small meaning, you need all of your concentration to even remotely understand what's going on, and even at the end, the only thing you can be happy about That's the end ... and you can say that you actually sat through it! So at the end, if you want to see a movie in which you say "what the hell" time and again, both loud and in your head, go ahead and waste an hour and 30 minutes and check it out. </> <br /> Mr Hopkins, while I applaud you as an actor and I applaud your choice to strike a directing blow ... please, never make such a movie again. Next time try something that is based more on great story telling than camera techniques that usually leave the viewer a headache.
