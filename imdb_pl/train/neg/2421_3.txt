with this attempt of the ABC family of the hit hit "cheaper by a dozen" comes an unbearable amount of simple dialogue, shallow plot lines and tacky returns. With about two good actors among many people wanting to be, this movie was a huge disappointment. This is a Hollywood ditto with an already bad story. Then, because they needed a lot of actors, it meant they would probably be more lenient. So the acting was not five-star. The plot moved quite quickly, and the twists and turns were bad and they had a terrible time. The combination of characters and "final relationships" was too vague and banal to me. Save yourself and rent something better.
