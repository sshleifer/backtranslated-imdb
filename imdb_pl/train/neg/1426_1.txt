One question: why? First of all, the premise is not at all fun or addictive. They use recordings and take sound to animate it with animals that speak in parts. First of all, interviews are not fun or entertaining at first, and even if they were, I'm sure they would be much more entertaining when they were watched as they were originally without transforming into fairy tales. How does it add some hilarity to it? I included the Monday sitcom CBS (which became a regular way for me to relax after the stressful Monday working days) and found it on. Of course, the sitcoms would be repeated in the summer, but seeing these episodes would be more entertaining. I tried to give a chance to "CC". I really did it. When it started, I thought, maybe it will be fun. No. And then he continued. It was a long half hour. <br /> <br /> And I almost see if there was any purpose, if the interviews were shown in full and if they had points on them. But no, these were just clips with one line, cut and stuck really fast. It was like a terrible horrible version of the "Robot Chicken" Cartoon Network. I was not a fan of the now canceled CBS series "The Class". Although it lasted half an hour, I had to struggle. But if I came to me, deciding for the whole season of this or three subsequent episodes of "Creatures" ... let's say I will take "class". Given that it's been several hours since the broadcast, and I come here to see that I will comment first ... I think it's a good sign that nobody has seen it and that it will not take longer. Cartoon roadkill.
