Yes, the first "Wailing" was a classic. Quite a good movie about werewolves, which I admit, it started slowly, but gained momentum to have a pretty good finish, and then the presenter turned into a sweet werewolf who was shot at the camera. Yes, it was funny horrors to be sure ... forget about all this because this movie has nothing to do with this movie. Oh, they probably leave the anchor the same and that her brother or something wants to know what and why things went down, but they go from a small cozy retreat from the first movie to Transylvania or somewhere here, where they have to fight with evil magicians werewolves or something. I often wonder what Christopher Lee was doing in this movie in the world, but I read the curiosities here, where he says he's never been in a werewolf movie before, but he's still read the script before you take the part. Maybe you could get into the hell of an "American werewolf in London" that could have been possible. He was finally set up in London. Heck, it seems that werewolves do not deal with this movie except for the rather bizarre and prolonged sex scene. In fact, the most memorable death for me in this movie was when one of the girls began to speak loudly, and the ear of this one guy started to bleed.
