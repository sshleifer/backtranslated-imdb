It was the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life and I've seen REALLY bad movies. I saw this movie in my local video store, and the cover looked like a decent horror movie. I did not know that the cover would be the best part of the movie. Where to start? Filming the film was scattered and boring. At some point, there appears a one-minute scene in which no one talks, only a car riding on the ranch on a normal sunny day. Nothing happened, they just rode in silence. The whole movie is boring, with irritating, unbelievable dialogue and essentially no conspiracy. If you rent this movie, watch it with your friends and it can be a good comedy. Otherwise, when you see this movie, run.
