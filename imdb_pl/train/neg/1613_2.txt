Now that Che (2008) has finished his relatively short run in the Australian cinema (an extremely limited edition: 1 screen in Sydney, after 6 weeks), I can blame both hosts "At The Movies", taking Steven Soderbergh to the task. <Br /> <br /> It's usually satisfying to see how the director changes his style / subject, but the newest smelly Soderbergh, The Girlfriend Experience (2009), also lacked stories, so the narrative (and editing?) Suddenly seem to be Soderbergh is the main challenge. Strange, after 20 years of work in the industry. Probably he was never too good in the narrative, he just hid it well in "sharp" projects. <br /> <br /> Nothing justifies this present, almost diabolical failure. As David Stratton warns: "two parts of Che do not create (even) the whole". <br /> <br /> The epic biographical name, Che (2008) barely qualifies as a feature film! Certainly there are no legs, because apart from the unusual final resolution forced by history, Soderbergh after a 4.5-hour song just does not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Even Margaret Pomeranz, the more forgiving Australian At The Movies duo, drew attention to Soderbergh's recurring losses (digital HD storage): "you are in the forest ... you are in the forest ... you are in the forest ... ". I am also surprised that Soderbergh did not give us another 2.5 hours of THIS somewhere between his two parts, because he still skipped the massive fragments of Che's "revolutionary" life! <br /> <br /> When it comes to the biography of an important but infamous historical figure, Soderbergh imperceptibly alienates, if not intentionally, offends his audience. <br /> <br /> 1. I never pass on most Che stories; <br /> <br /> 2. imposing unreasonable lengths of the film on a simple repetition; <br /> <br /> 3. ignoring both the true past and the narrative of events; <br /> <br /> 4. barely develops an idea or figure; <br /> <br /> 5. it will be claustrophobic episodic; <br /> <br /> 6. ignoring the proper context for the scenes - everything we get is plunged into destructive time shifts; <br /> <br /> 7. linguistic dislocation of all recipients (even Spanish-speakers will be confused by inappropriate exhibitions in English); i <br /> <br /> 8. aimlessly whitewashing my main theme into one dimension. Why at this late stage? The franchise t-shirt was a success! <br /> <br /> Our sense of claustrophobia is surely due to the fact that Peter Buchman and Benjamin VanDer Veen base their scenario solely on Guevara's memoirs. So, like a poor student who only read ONE of his assigned texts for his task, Soderbergh's product is extremely limited in perspective. <br /> <br /> The audience is imprisoned within the same limited knowledge, scenery and circumstances of "revolutionaries", but that does not cause our sympathy. Instead, he makes us realize that "Ah, Soderbergh is trying to tempt his audience in the same way that the Latin American peasants were then." But these are THESE illiterate, Hispanic peasants who sold a good doctor to their enemies. Why does Soderbergh feel the need to identify us with them and to keep us equally in mental captivity? This duplicate audience must have a purpose. <br /> <br /> Part 2 is more chronological than Part1, but it literally paralyzes the mind with repeated bush strokes, miserable prospects and lack of diversity or arcs of character. Che DelToro has no chance to develop as a person while he is fighting for the education of his own disciplined soldiers. The only dislike is the sense of humor when Che deals with its sometimes deeply ignorant "revolutionaries", some of whom are brutally not self-controlled around local peasants or food. We certainly have no insight into what caused the conditions, nor any strategic analysis of their guerrilla rebellion, such as it was. <br /> <br /> The tearing Part2 countdown remains terrifyingly episodic: again nothing is telegraming or contextual. So even scenes with Fidel Castro (Demi√°n Bichir) are unexpected and disturbing. All selected events are presented in the minimal and Latin center, and interviews with Part1 have been replaced by meetings changing the time between the corrupt president of Bolivia (Joaquim de Almeida) and representatives of the US government promising CIA intervention (!). <br /> <br /> The rest of the "woods" Part2 and the blue filter from day to day simply irritate the audience until they look at the exit. <br /> <br /> Perhaps DelToro was too much in the frustration of many non-American Hispanics who never got the real, unspecified history of Che's feats in their own countries. When foreign governments still do not give their people a free press - for whatever reason - then you can see how a popular American indie manufacturer can set out to lure a not very well read ("I can not be able to read or write, but I'm NOT illiterate!") General Inspector (1949)) to their local cinemas. The obvious negligence in this film and blatant excessive simplifications strongly suggest that it only aims to understand those who are less aware of WHO, WHO SAYS SMALL English. If they did, they would read books on the subject and criticize the relevant social issues among themselves - learning history as they should. <br /> <br /> Such observations are exactly what they still need society - and not only the other illiterate Latinos of Central and South America - but what Che (2008) is happily failing to achieve. Soderbergh burys his advantage because he is weak in the narrative. I'm surprised why Benicio DelToro deliberately chose Soderbergh for this project if he knew it. 44 years have passed, it was very difficult to look at the past about Guevara: for this I went to see this film, but the director diabolically robs us of it. <br /> <br /> David Stratton, writing in The Australian (October 3, 2009), noticed that while Part1 was "uneven", Part2 actually "goes down quickly" from there, "presenting the final Che campaign in Bolivia in the tearing details "Which" ... seems almost unbearably slow and restless. " <br /> <br /> Che: Guerilla aka Part2 is certainly not a traveler for Bolivia, painting a picture of misery and atavism. The entire other half is redeemed only by the aforementioned humor and dramatic - but tragic - capture and execution of the film's theme. <br /> <br /> The rest of this infinite cinema is simply a tangled, annoying misery - shocking, for Soderbergh's film, which should be avoided at all costs. Certainly will break the hearts of all who know a little bit of this topic (2/10)
