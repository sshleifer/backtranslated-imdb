This movie is bad to be okay on Friday the 13th. The film is about a killer named Bernie who kills people in a camp training camp. He kills people because the camp council's training camp is on the ground owned by his father, and when the police arrived to take the land of fathers by force, they accidentally killed his mother (another F13 start). Intro sees Bernie killing her first victims. Then we move to a family campsite in the same forest, soon after arrival a strange old man joins them, who likes to talk about his son. Later, we find out that his son is Bernie and that he locked him in the back of his caravan after he snatched it from the psychic institute. He sets Bernie around the family so that they can take their belongings and then pursue. <br /> <br /> This video is recommended only for those who like B class slate from the 80's.
