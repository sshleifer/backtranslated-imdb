Ever since Caligula did not consider excluding the movie in the middle ... but in this case I had only 15 minutes when I was wondering. Unfortunately, I managed to achieve it. Make sure you do not. <br /> <br /> It's not that Cradle of Fear is shocking, bloody, scary, scary or sexual. This is not one of those things, but I want to be all of them so much. Instead, it is boring, trivial, ordinary, predictable and extremely poorly made (shot on video, special effects in high school, lack of sense of even basic visual stories, barely audible dialog ... not that it is worth hearing) /> <br /> This film is proof of the argument that even direct distributors have to draw a line somewhere in the sand.
