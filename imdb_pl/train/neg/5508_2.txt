Tim (Gary Daniels) desperately wants to break into serious television coverage. When the job he asked for does not work, he is released. His beautiful but empty girl (Elizabeth Hurley) also says sayonara. Returning home, Tim is surprised that his home has an uninvited guest (Christopher Lloyd) from the planet Mars! Calling him Uncle Martin, Tim is soon trying to help his new friend navigate the land. But Martin gets into trouble, no matter where he goes, from the bathroom to the laundry room and many more. Lovely Lizzie (Daryl Hannah) finally sees the opportunity to make an appointment with Tim, but in this case the course of true love does not run smoothly. Soon everyone on television persecutes Tim, hoping for a story about a real stranger. What should a man do? For those who loved the old television program of the same title, with Bill Bixby and Ray Walston, this movie is not worth bonding proverbial shoes. It's really, undeniably horrible, with no plot and reliance on the supposed special effects that are also falling. Daniels is okay, because he is a landowner, but Lloyd is just as scary as a stranger, breaking the storm. The rest of the cast is appropriate, as are the costumes, set and details of production. Even if your children see the cover and beg for the video, convince them to choose another video in the video store. We assure you that children and adults will consider this movie an enormous bore, so choose A Night at the Museum or Around the World in 80 days instead.
