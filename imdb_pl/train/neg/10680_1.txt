SPOILERS UNAVAILABLE <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst films ever - it's so simple. There is no one of the salutary qualities of this film. The first 10 minutes are quite complicated - they lead you to believe that this movie will be shocking and will keep you on the edge of your place. Instead, you'll spend 83 minutes hitting each other while watching stolen and misplaced scenes without an organization. The lake was ridiculous, it looked like an aquarium and had the same plant in different parts of the lake bed. Characters show their advanced teleportation skills, for example Alex Thomas, who falls into the lake (drunk) and then lands on his boat in an impossible position. Angie Harmon presented a pitiful performance as Kate, worsened by the time-space dialog of breaking a continuum that was apparently written at the last moment by the fifth-grader. An example of this would be when she said "Flashlight!" In such a stupid way that it shows the threshold of how much the human body can shrink before it breaks in half. Finally, the editing of this movie was by far the most bizarre and frightening I've ever seen. It was like cameramen were a bunch of chimps that scientists gave cameras. An example of this can suddenly be the close-up of the reflector on Alex's car. I bet little time has been spent editing this movie. The ending was completely pathetic. The writers apparently tried to create a kind of mysterious plot line that prompted the viewer to say "yes!". Instead, we have to see a stupid picture of a spider that somehow fits the plot. Unfortunately, there is not one perspective in millions that could save this movie from a festering piece of shit. <br /> <br /> I give it 0.5 out of 10, and 5 out of the fact that this movie was recorded on film instead of becoming a picture book.
