I hated that shit, every Friday as part of what it was, and consistently sucked the big time with stupidity every week. If you want to see something funny, look at "No On Would Tell" with Candice Cameron and Fred Savage, it's really fun, it shows exactly why nobody goes to a good film career after a terrible TV show. This show really will make me sick, I hate these children, and the bob saget must jump off the bridge for always doing this nonsense. I've seen fun things everywhere, but here. I write 10 lines! Watch the "full house" to see at least humanity has to offer in the field of art and entertainment.
