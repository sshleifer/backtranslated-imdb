Usually I am disappointed with the films on the web. Even flix, which attracts great actors, is usually ruined by TV people. However, this is the worst of the worst. The script is weak, and acting, especially Tracey Pollan, is repulsive. I went to see my children's performances in high school and I was treated better. Pollan behaves as if she read the script during the conversation. When he tries to express fear, anger or regret, he is extremely empty. Due to the general quality of production, it was difficult for me to take it seriously. If you decide for courage, be prepared for a big disappointment. Terrifying things will not scare you, sad things will not make you sad, romance will not make you feel warm and vague, and you'll probably be as restless as I saw the end. "First die" says a lot about this film.
