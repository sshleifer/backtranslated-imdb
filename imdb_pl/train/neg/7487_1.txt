Unfortunately, this movie is so bad. The original Out of Towners was manic and very funny, of course they used a script written by Neil Simon. For some reason, Neil Simons' script is not used in this movie, so it's dropping again and again. Even the audience I was with never laughed. The direction is very slow and boring, and when there is a joke, a joke is given, i.e. a couple having sex in the park. They announce that this is a lighting ceremony in New York, we all know that the lights will turn on and we will be able to see the charming and attacking Goldie and Steve, who will do a little stick. The whole movie ends ... a joke is created and distributed. Why Goldies hair has never been mixed up in the movie. You will also notice every Goldie approach (they use a very intense soft lens). I suggest you borrow the original with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis if you want to laugh.
