Ohhh brutality, ohhhhh, dying race, ohhhh sense of loss, ohhhh prejudice! Jesus, when are you all scandalous revisionists who will stop analyzing westerns for loud crying? S ** t happens. If it offends this social sensibility, return to the comfort of the Meryl Steep collection. <br /> <br /> Boring, tedious and tiring waste of celluloid - especially in the light of Coburn / Hackman / Bergen presence. Nothing interesting or intriguing, unless you are obsessed with the dentist's nineteenth-century desert. It could have been a little better without the Mexican turning around constantly because of a bad tooth. A monument of stupid ultra-left creeping sensitivity from the 60's and 70's. Virtually impossible to sit in the whole movie. I think I would prefer to keep my eyes open for the entire Lucky Luke / Trinity series. 4 horses / 10-all dead hell.
