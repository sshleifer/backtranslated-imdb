A sixth escapade for Freddy Krueger, in which he finally managed to kill virtually every youth in Springwood; now he wants to broaden his horizons and (** SPOILER **) needs a family member to do it. <br /> <br /> Defeat as a horror movie because it is not terrifying at all. It works better as a dark, macabre black comedy, telling the truth. Freddy Krueger was deprived of the ability to cool the viewer. (It is certainly too much.) The actors are not interesting (except Robert Englund, as always, and of course the boring Yapheta Kotto) and there are simply too many visual effects. The finale is fine, but it does not provide as many sparks as I think, one would hope. <br /> <br /> By adding a new phrase to the story of the famous dream killer, he gives Englund the opportunity to do more non-makeup scenes than ever before. <br /> <br /> There are scenes worth noting: shared episodic couple Roseanne and Tom Arnold, devoid of entertainment value, the right look by the veteran shocking Alice Cooper and the funny episodic role of Johnny Depp, who also admits that she was pop icon. <br /> <br /> Film debut of Breckin Meyer, who plays Spencer. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about it is to play key scenes from previous entries during the final subtitles. <br /> <br /> 4/10
