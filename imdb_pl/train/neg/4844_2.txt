I am definitely in the minority in this matter. "The Hurt Locker" has won more Best Picture awards from groups of critics than any other film this year. However, not only did I not like it, but it was difficult to sit down. <br /> <br /> There is a minimal plot and small character development. They disarm bombs, fight and disarm more bombs. This is the whole movie. <br /> <br /> But the worst part was that the camera never stops moving and shakes constantly. It was a recent fashion for making movies that would make it more real because it has a cheap, documentary look. The camera was shaking so much that it was nice to look at the screen. <br /> <br /> I usually do not care about war movies, and "The Hurt Locker" was no exception. But you do not have to take it for a word, because critics love it.
