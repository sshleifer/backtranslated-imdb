There is not a drop of sunshine in "The Sunshine Boys", which makes the title of this alleged ironic moment comedy Neil Simon. Simon, who adapted the script of his play (which is not appreciated), equates old age with irrational behavior - and worse, clumsy, uplifting irrational behavior. Walter Matthau is merciless towards us playing the vaudeville who spoke to each other to meet former comedian George Burns in a special TV show (they are said to have been a band for 43 years, which raises the question "how did you still have a vaudeville? "). Burns, who won the supporting Oscar, has the misfortune to come to the movie about thirty minutes later, after this time Matthau has already blew the material to hell and back. The louder the movie is, the less tolerated and visible it is. Director Herbert Ross did a solid job only if he was not connected to one of the scenarios of Neil Simon; here Ross creates gags like a throbbing amateur, fighting warlike routines that do not pay off (such as semi-inconsistent Matthau appearing in the mechanics garage for auditioning for TV commercials). At this point, Matthau was still too young for this role and overcompensated by hunching and screaming. It was up to Ross and Simon to calm down the character, nuance his temper, to give the Sunshine Boys a little sunshine, and Walter continues the project as if we were all unconscious. The image looks terribly grim and creeps at a heartless pace; you lose hope. * 1/2 of ****
