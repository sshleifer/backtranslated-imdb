I have the impression that the producers of this mess have done the most painful, absurd western ever. "PAINFUL" is the best word I can come up with to describe it. <br /> <br /> On the plus side you have a nice colorful photo and beautiful and well-spoken Rhonda Fleming. My compassion is directed to Jacques Aubuchon (who played the cripple), who acted well enough in the annoying role, written so horribly that no actor was able to give a pleasant performance. The production values ​​were quite good, which served only to highlight the terrible story and scenario. <br /> <br /> Things I hated: Stewart Granger looked as scarcely as a western figure, which with his British accent, neat, fitted outfit, and stupid pristine white bandana tied around his neck. There was a torment in the manner in which the inhabitants of the city and his son were constantly speaking and offended Granger, and never spoke or answered. I know that we should suspend disbelief and appreciate westerns when symbolic morality plays, but this broke the spell with ridiculously unrealistic and predictable scenes, the worst at the end, where Granger miraculously, quickly and independently plants dynamite around the canyon to convey that the cattle of a bad guy will pass, and then Granger will plant himself in a perfect place so he can shoot dynamite from a very long distance to create rock tracks to bury and scare cattle and bad guys, seemingly destroying them all, the two main bad guys. The next worst thing is everything about the story, which is filled with soap opera scenes. Nothing in the film seemed credible: I could not believe what the whole conflict was about. The bad guy ran his pack to the market and wanted the cows to chew the grass along the way; I do not understand why something could not be worked out. Do you need a dispute over land ownership? Do not bother about it.
