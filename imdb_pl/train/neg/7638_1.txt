I could not even bring myself to watch this movie until the end. I can not comment on this story because I did not watch the whole movie, and the reason I could not see it was the "actors". First of all, most of them just looked stiff and I'm sure their scripts were just outside the frame in their hands - but that's a minor problem. The main problem I have with the actors is not really their fault ... who dropped the movie! Come on, this movie was released in 2003 ... I thought that casting people at the age of twenty to play teenagers went out of fashion with a new wave? I can not watch a movie in which one of the first lines, from an adult man older than me, is "I'm 17!" How can anyone take it seriously ????? Do not fall victim to this movie, go for a walk for 90 minutes and you'll get a lot more than this movie.
