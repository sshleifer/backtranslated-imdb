As a big fan of gorilla movies, I expected it to be great - and when it comes to gorilla effects, they were pretty good - that's the only thing I can write about this flop. The film claims that it is based on a true story, but in reality it does not even come close to what happened to "Buddha" - which in real life was the famous Gargantua, sold to Ringling Bros. through our alleged "heroic" Gertrude Lintz, known to many animal enthusiasts as a woman who did not have the welfare of her animals in the best interest. While Buddy was presented as aggressive, it was a total fiction and the gorilla did not resort to such behavior at any time. the colleague actually escaped from his wooden chest (not from the plush cage, as shown in the film) during the storm, to seek shelter and comfort at home, which terrified Gertrude Lintz to sell him. No, Buddy was not released into the family of gorillas surrounded by lush trees in a zoological paradise - he was abandoned in a wooden crate, for some time in the depths of the garage with only one bulb for convenience, and then sold to the circus - where he actually lived a better life, having peanuts thrown at him until he died (historically the oldest living gorilla on the album, by the way) before the show in Miami. Also notice, in the movie, how Buddy grows old, but chimps never age. (By the way, chimpanzees were not raised simultaneously with other animals, including the Buddha, as shown in the movie)
