At the end of this episode, Holmes asks Watson not to save the case for posterity. The super-wizard left his little gray cells (sorry Agatha) at home for this story. There is no deductive reasoning, no sharp analysis of characters at crime scenes. Holmes wanders about fifty meters behind the plot. The nasty CAM is finally resolved by the old, weak in a way that would make Charles Bronson's heart swell with pride - six bullets in the basket. do not decide on the story of Cinderella to extend the movie. The murderess, Holmes and Watson, avoid the scot free. Well, it's a bit of a change of pace in late Victorian London. Some sixguns right :-)
