It is a rehearsal, both by Edgar Rice Burroughs and filmmakers, in the Arabian "Tarzanie ma≈Çp". But this desert movie shows that none of the majesties present in Burroughs is more successful. We focus on the love between handsome English noble Jon Hall (as "El" Lion "Chatham") and exotic Arab beauty Kathleen Burke (as "Princess" Eulilah), with revenge that coincided with their desire to combine. She openly states that although guilty of behavior is inappropriate, the boy's mother is alive - but never returns to the stage. Unfortunately, "The Lion Man" has deteriorated and it seems that he lacks material. <br /> <br /> *** The Lion Man (1936) John P. McCarthy ~ Jon Hall, Kathleen Burke, Ted Adams
