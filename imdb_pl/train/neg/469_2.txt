Mad Magazine may have many crazy people who work for him ... but of course someone had some common sense there, when the powers renounced this celluloid waste ... the edition is el crapo, the plot is incredibly thin and stupid ... and the only one the reason he gets two out of ten is that Stacy Nelkin takes off some of her clothes and we get a nice arrow from the chest ... I never thought I felt sorry for Ralph Macchio, who decided to be on the case, but me. ... and I REALLY feel bad for Ron Leibman and Tom Poston, talented actors who should never have appeared in this movie ... at least Mr. Leibman had cajons to refuse to put his name anywhere on the film ... he goes ahead ... they're actually kicking this thing with Mad's starting sequence on her ... if you can find her, grab her because it's probably worth something ... that's the only thing in this movie that's worth anything ... and a note for people from IMDb.com ... there's no way to spoil this movie ... creators have spoiled it themselves ...
