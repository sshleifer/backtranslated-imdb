The moment you give the "artistic film" 1/10, you have people looking for your unconscious, half-orphaned, artistically delayed blood. I will not try to justify how not I am an aesthetically deprived retard, mentioning all the "home cinema" that I liked or mentioned, as I gave an unknown "cult classic" 10/10. I'm just asking someone to explain the point, purpose and message of this movie. <br /> <br /> Here is how I would summarize the film: the assembly of three unrelated urban legends depicting the almost absurd levels of cooperation scope. Then follows (in short, to save you 3 hours of pain) the following: a game-show host dying of lung cancer trying to patch up a coke-dependent daughter who may or did not rape when he was a child, and an inept cop with him trade union problems, while the game show star decides that he does not want to be a child's failed miracle, the fate of another 60's players we see is now a homosexual man in love with a bartender with braces and needing money for " corrective oral surgery ", while the game show producer, dying of lung cancer, asks his nurse for help, he patched up with his son, whom he left many years ago, and who later became a female self-help guru, even if the producer's second wife suffers from remorse for deceiving a dying man; and oh, eventually the frogs fall (you read correctly). And I am saving you the incredibly long and aimless, literally monologues that every character seems to invent in flight, without the rhyme and reason, besides, perhaps, to make sure that the film exceeds 3 hours and will be classified as a "contemporary epic" "< br /> <br /> You probably think that I could sum up the movie better (and hence do not confuse you) if I wrote this damn a little more consistently, maybe in a few sentences instead of one ... Well, now you know how to I feel.
