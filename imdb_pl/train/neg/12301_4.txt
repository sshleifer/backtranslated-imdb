Oh, my ... bad clothing, worse synth music and the worst: David Hasselhoff. The eighties returned from vengeance in Witchery, an American-Italian co-production directed by the infamous Joe 'D'Amato on the production side and the short director (thank goodness for little miracles) Fabrizio Laurenti directed. Introduced as a continuation of Sam Raimi's "Bad dead" series in Italy (called "La Casa" there), Witchery provides modest groceries and bad acting. <br /> <br /> A mix of ghost stories, possessions and spells, the film bounces off the stage to the other, not allowing some seriously wooden actors and amusing blends of day and night to slow progress to the expected ending, culminating in a WTF surprise. (I just love the look of her face ...) Surprisingly Laurenti manages to gather some tension and anger in a few - very few - stages; Unfortunately for him, these few flashes of gentle film magic are falling quickly and effectively. <br /> <br /> Pros are experienced when the blood hits the fan. This department is quite effective and entertaining in the classic style of latex and Italo-gore red paint from the 80s, when things were done 100% by hand and shockingly vivid, as modest budgets allowed. I could only look sadistic joy and a few laughter in all the main ways in which the nasty figures (and actors) distorted themselves and abused one by one. I was only sorry about Linda Blair, who apparently was not allowed to try other than this old, well-possessed role of a girl / woman in his career, or so it looks when I check his filmography. <br /> <br /> Well, people - not much else to say, and even less to tell about the house. Do not expect too much when you spend a rainy afternoon with it, and you will probably experience at least gentle play. It also helps if your rotten little heart beats the horror of the 80s horrors. Speaking of hearts - every movie in which David Hasselhoff is skewed by a large metal object and bleeds heavily around the room and corridors, MUST have it in the right place. <br /> <br /> This is my truth - what is yours?
