If they could get Ed Asner, why did not they get other actors than people who go to the same church as the producers? And why the hero threw the wise old sage to the ground when he was never in danger. It forced the older guy to mask the damage from pride, so the young guy would feel guilty leaving him with a disability for life. I think that's why the main character refuses money and why an old guy works with him like a dog, even if he reports an extra job. If a boy with a d-bag is a bad guy because he's a boy at a distance, why is the soldier better? He has a good reason to be jealous, a good reason to move her away from his hometown and protect him by controlling the manipulating father. All characters that are supposed to be nice are not and everyone else is a "bad" boy. How did they meet each other, a wine broker and a sawmill worker?
