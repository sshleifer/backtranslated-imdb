This is a thriller with a good concept, good acting, good photography and good intentions around, but which is confused and chaotic in performance. <br /> <br /> Garcia appears as John Berlin, a forensic detective from Los Angeles who moved to a small town in California on the recommendation of his friend about the power there. He soon takes part in an investigation into an unsolved murder that leads to his theory of the existence of a serial killer in which no one else believes. A known victim has a theory that he is blind, which leads to a romance with a blind girl - she believed to be a witness - at a nearby school for the blind. <br /> <br /> Despite the basically intriguing history, there were too many quantum leaps and holes in this movie, in which I wondered, "how the hell do we end up here? or "as we found out?" I thought it confusing and chaotic, despite the good game, etc. John Malkovich has a small part at the end as F.B.I. researcher to get Berlin. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
