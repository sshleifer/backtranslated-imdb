POPEYE AND BIG FOOT **; THE ENGINE COMPANY POPEYE **; DOSTANIE POPEYE'S GOAT ** 1/2 <br /> <br /> I used to go like a child, but I caught an episode of a series of three cartoons, a few years later (they were preceded by a theater projection of RAIDERS OF THE SEVEN SEAS [1953] ), I see how they can not stand that well! Popeye's character at the beginning is not entirely nice, Olive Oyl clearly overbearing, and Bluto's antics did not arouse much interest? in short, the scripts were disturbingly thin, quite awful and generally unpleasant to run. These are strictly youthful tariffs, but I doubt that today's children even have the patience to stick with them! What's more, the style of animation is unattractive. <br /> <br /> Taking every short per se, I think that they have improved from one to the other: after the initial shock, one adapted to its average quality, as was the Third cartoon easily makes it the most pleasant of all this? Popeye is entrusted with a mascot from the goat army, whose huge appetite causes that there is no end to evil (I almost do not know what I know, but always a fun trick). An interesting element was that the shorts were reserved from Popeye, providing children in the audience with moralistic pieces of wisdom.
