He must agree with another reviewer. It must be the worst movie, let alone the western one I've ever seen. Terrible acting, a dialogue that was unimaginable and pathetic (not to mention completely unsuitable for allegedly in the nineteenth century) and oh, did I mention the set of batteries visible on the back of one of the characters? I waited for the microphone to get out in the middle of the stage. And the end? At least I can say that it was in line with the rest of the movie ... totally awful. And yes, it contained all the stereotypes in the book from a slow walk on an empty dusty road to funny shots, "remember," when the main character dies. Fortunately, I saw it on free television. Do not waste time.
