I was expecting the film to be completely stupid. With such a low expectation, any form of entertainment would be a pleasant surprise. The soundtrack was the best part of the movie, but playing with nonsense in individual branches was also fun. <br /> <br /> It said that in The Singles Ward there were many things that were totally annoying. The whole film was poorly named and made watching the lips while listening to their voices very irritating. This lack of professionalism has been exceeded only by episodes of known Mormon stars who do not run a business. <br /> <br /> This movie will do well in Mormondom, especially in college communities where there is a singles division. However, the conclusion will give no hope to the poor loser who found themselves in a free state. (Only nice girls in the Single branch get married, fat, ugly no, but all ugly men) Ultimately, we realize that the whole movie was an advertisement for LDSSingles.com
