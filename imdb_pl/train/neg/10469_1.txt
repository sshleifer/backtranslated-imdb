Yes, I admit I cried during this movie. It was so incredibly disappointing that I could not resist, but I cried. TBN (Trinity Broadcasting Network) has done it again. First with Million Dollar Man (former professional wrestler) in his program, and now this. <br /> <br /> The Omega code follows a stream of sketchy religious films. It was quite fun, but it was also disturbing to say that it was so inaccurately biblical. The film follows what is called the "biblical code" instead of following the biblical fact. This film is extremely poorly made; from his writing to directing and hilarious horrible acting. It is depressing that people really put effort into this movie. It looked more like a movie from late evening, which someone would watch on a channel in the US, or an ordinary movie home instead of a movie film. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend that you do not watch this movie, even if your life depended on it.
