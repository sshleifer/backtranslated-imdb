Until now, the worst movie I've ever seen was Ben and Artur. You really should check the reviews of this movie instead. The review statistics of this movie have been distorted by the relentless and unscrupulous pressure of some people involved in the movie, which is quite easy to discover online. At least the people who created Ben and Arthur were honest enough to let him stand on his own shaky legs, instead of unscrupulously promoting him, so suckers like me would buy him. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is awful, script, history, casting, acting, direction, photography, editing, music ... what else is entering the movie? Whatever it is, here is as bad as it gets. If it was not so unpleasant, it would be ridiculous. I watched him all the time thinking he must be better because I have not yet discovered that none of the positive reviews are reliable. <br /> <br /> You do not need a lot of money to make a great movie, a low budget does not mean that the movie has to be bad. My favorite example of a modest budget masterpiece is the amazing Mala Noche by Gus Van Sant, but there are many more. Sideline Secrets? The Director's Cut or the original is not bad because the people who created it did not have the money, but because they had a giant ego and had no talent for anything but self-promotion.
