This may be the worst movie ever made, and it's probably worth seeing only because of it. Streisand is ridiculously unbelievable as a young woman posing for a man to study Judaism. The soundtrack is tiring, with Barbara taking on some of the weakest characters ever made. And do not even start me from the story. In fact, you will have more chuckles from this movie than many comedies because it is terribly horrible. The raging ego of Streisand, thinking he might somehow pick up this stinking Oscar, led to this catastrophe. I'm sure the novelist Isaac Bashevis Singer hated the movie and never forgave Streisand. I can not blame him. This movie is like watching a slow-motion car wreck for two hours, and the soundtrack "The Sound of Music" is played back on an old turntable. It's really that bad. I am amazed that everyone from Streisand enjoyed the film at the level where it was intended.
