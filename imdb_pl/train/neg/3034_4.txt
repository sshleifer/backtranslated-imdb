This movie has a lot of great adult stars, but you're not interested in the way an adult movie should look like. Among all the stars you did not get out of any scene. The film is shot in a dream middle age, which is embarrassingly cheesy. Acting is worse than Keanu Reeves, sex scenes are just as exciting as listening to a neighbor talking about your child in college, and the dialogue is worse, as I saw in the movie. The plot was also worse by ten times. I would stick to an amateur tour. The audio commentary was useless because it is a movement on the skin, but even then it was bad. If you're not a fan of Jenny Jameson, there are not many. 4/10
