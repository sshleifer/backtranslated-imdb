"Scary Movie 2" is the profession of the Terrible Movie Franchise. Horrible films 1, 3 and 4 were good, but this one was boring and not very funny. Fortunately, they chose their show after that and they made two great awesome movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a group of teenagers who have been cheated by their professor for the night at a haunted residence. Things are starting to go wrong, and then they realize that they have to escape. <br /> <br /> This movie is not scary, but he could have improved a few things. It's a bit funny, and if you liked other Scary Movie movies, give me a watch - but I do not think you'll like it.
