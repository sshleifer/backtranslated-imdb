This typically melodramatic Bollywood movie has inexplicably become the favorite of Western critics. The script is ridiculous, the acting is top and looks tacky. The only reasons for watching this soap opera are the wonderful songs sung by Mangeshkar and the curtain of the legendary Meena Kumari. Watching an actress who was sick during filming and drunk to death at the age of 40 shortly after the film's premiere has the same fascination as watching the train wreck. Her ex-husband, Amrohi, wrote and directed the script, but lacks the competence to do well each of these tasks. Bollywood produced much better films.
