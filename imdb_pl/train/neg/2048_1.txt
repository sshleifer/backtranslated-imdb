1 is quite generous here. I really liked BOOGEYMAN, although it's not really BOOGEYMAN promoted on the DVD cover and we all know that! It scared me. But this movie is something else. For the guidance of a guy who has long and directed many movies, it looks like he was filmed on a VHS camcorder by a 10-year-old! History and acting are terrible! David Hess, you disappointed me too. After playing one of the most dangerous villains in movie history, have you resorted to this? However, history and acting could be forgiven if anyone would take the time to make the video look a bit professional. There are a lot of pictures for videos that do not look like that, or at least they are not so obvious that they distract you from the movie. I can not say it's the worst movie ever, because I could not go through the whole movie, but it's definitely close.
