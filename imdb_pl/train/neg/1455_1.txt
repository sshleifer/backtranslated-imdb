I have rarely been subjected to such nonsense in a film that is to be based on a historical figure. A terrible joke from the movie. Terrible, banal, distorted and full of lies and half-truths. <br /> <br /> Hitler's famous biographer, Ian Kershaw, was initially supposed to be a consultant for this film. He decided, however, that the script was so historically and absurd that he refused, and demanded that he stop using his name as a source (embarrassing him to believe that people would think he was involved). One scene shows Hitler the beating dog. There is no one source for this. Hitler loved animals above people. He introduced the strictest rules on animal welfare in Europe, forbade vivisection and experiments on animals. He was also a vegetarian. <br /> <br /> The film changes his acquisition of the Iron Cross into a farce, including bribery. Complete lies. He was awarded for repeated acts of courage over a long period of time. <br /> <br /> There are no historical documents indicating that Hitler had ever had sexual relations with his niece. Not one. <br /> <br /> In addition, Hitler is portrayed as a rabid simpleton in this trash. <br /> <br /> If he was half as ignorant, mad and fat as he is this nonsense movie, like in real life, you would not even know he ever existed. It does not matter to become the leader of Germany. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this movie was totally awful. <br /> <br /> Go and see the Fall and give it a very wide field.
