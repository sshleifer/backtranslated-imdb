The early eighties of Richard Pryor running down the street in case of fire had to touch him somehow. In his booth, he jokes that he is laughing great. He seemed to have done something about the projects he chose. The toy is the worst you've ever picked up, except that you're probably the other one. <br /> <br /> A movie in which a white man buys his son a black man? A pretty small element of political irregularity in front of you was something like that. I see that Richard is getting sentimental, which made me finally come out before the end. I wanted to see how Pryor gets along with this brat, instead he becomes a misunderstood children's museum! At least Gleason had his moments. Ignore this and watch Pryor with Gene Wilder or any of his 70's material. It's a waste of time for every movie watcher!
