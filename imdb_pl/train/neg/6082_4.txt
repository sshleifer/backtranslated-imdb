Although there are many well-known "television" names associated with "A Man Called Sledge", there is nothing extraordinary in the film itself or in any of the performances. In fact, the only thing that distinguishes him from the television series of the 60s and 70s, such as "The Rat Patrol", is a larger cast and a lot more violence. <br /> <br /> James Garner is the biggest star and apparently he thought he should try to get away from all the light comedies he did ("Maverick", "Support Your Local Sheriff" - "Gunfighter", etc.). Unfortunately, his earthly sympathy acts against him, because Sledge is a humorless character, written to earn the popularity of spaghetti western character Clint Eastwood. But Eastwood's things were not so flat and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> I suppose that "A Man Called Sledge" can be classified as a spaghetti western, although the pace is too slow to really match this subspecies. Fans of the slow TV series "Combat" will feel an immediate connection, because Vic Morrow directed the film and co-wrote the script with Frank Kowalski. Put in a few trendy shots in slow motion and dissolve, which pay attention to yourself and do not serve the purpose. <br /> <br /> The plot is the standard thing of the "big assault" (insert "The War Wagon"), and Sledge plans to catch a gold ship worth $ 300,000. His gang includes Claude Akins and Dennis Weaver. The problem is that when moving, the parcel is guarded by 40 outriders and the detainee is locked in the treasury inside the territorial prison. I think there was an episode of "Alias ​​Smith and Jones" with the same story. <br /> <br /> The story would make a decent hour of television, but it would quickly grow old, as a very padded movie with a length. Garner does not allow any of his charm to penetrate its characteristics, and the film does not generate enough tension to keep the viewer interested. <br /> <br /> The thing is finally falling apart and burning soon after the robbery, when the gang engages in an elaborate and completely illogical card game. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
