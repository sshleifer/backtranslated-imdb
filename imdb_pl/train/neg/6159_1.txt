Why do all those who have seen this film feel responsible for telling us if they are swordsmen? This point is completely irrelevant to any argument against this whole dog from the movie. <br /> <br /> I think that sports films fall into two categories; well-made films about human spirit and competitions and "By the Sword". <br /> <br /> To be honest, this movie could never decide what it wants to be, a moving drama for trying to be the best in life, accusation of motivation for competition or flicks of martial arts. In the end, it did not make any of those convincing or completely sufficient to make me care about any of them. <br /> <br /> As a reminder, I'm also a fencing instructor (and now I'm officially as bad as the rest). But putting bad fencing in the film does not automatically make it wrong. I mean look at Star Wars (episodes 4-6, good movies, bad fencing). I liked these movies. But when you're directing a bad sport for a bad movie for some reason, people think only purists think it's a bad effort. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by any comments about the smaller fencing number. This is just a bad movie. After all, this movie has nothing for a fencing enthusiast, movie lover or just for someone with a pulse and three brain cells. <br /> <br /> When I see a movie and I am forced to think: "Man, I would like to watch Mighty Ducks. I know it's time to get past the director of the theater to get my money back and see if there's anyone in the lobby who will give me two hours in some way.
