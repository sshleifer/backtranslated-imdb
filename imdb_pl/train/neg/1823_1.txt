The figure of Jack Black, Tim Dingman "Dreamer" at Envy, finds wealth and success in the "Vapoorize" aerosol spray concept, which after spraying on the dog's dung makes it disappear into the air. <br /> <br /> For a moment I was hoping that Vapoorize was a real product, thanks to which I could spray this "smelly" film and make it disappear in the air. <br /> <br /> Although Envy is not the worst movie I've seen in the last 12 months (this is Cat The Hat's honor), it's an honor to take a second. <br /> <br /> It is not funny, not sad, nothing. The real "Stinkeroo" !!!!! <br /> <br /> 0.2 out of 10 !!
