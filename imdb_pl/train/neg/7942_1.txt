Really. Does one week pass that Oprah does not remind us that she was abused as a child? <br /> <br /> She focuses on each interview. <br /> <br /> Oprah can not resist commenting on any question he asks. He often interrupts guests before the answers are over to reject their own anecdote. Directors are, of course, instructed to focus on the reaction to the rapprochement, not on the guests' faces, because that's what counts - what Oprah feels, what Oprah says. <br /> <br /> Oprah, Oprah, Oprah. It's always about Oprah. <br /> <br /> Oprah says - I'm sorry for me, I was so poor. Feel the pain of my fight with my weight. Feel my pain when I turn away from the fancy store after they've closed. Feel good by buying my magazines and books. Feel good because of my success. Feel good when you give my love to look good. Feeling good, making me rich beyond faith. <br /> <br /> My interpretation of her point of view: BROWSERS ARE ALL DEEP, AND YOU NEED MY DAILY COUNCIL. I have all the answers to your life, although I have nothing to do with you. I've never been married or wanted to be. I never had to raise a family - but I know everything about it. I do not respect men or marriage. I clearly prefer people like me over others - witnesses of "Legends Ball 2006". Gayle is my best friend, but we are not gay. <br /> <br /> From July 31, 2006, the headline on her website reads: "Oprah.com is your main source of information about love, life, self, relationships, food, home, spirit and health. "How is it suspicious and unpleasant? <br /> <br /> In June 2006, he crashed two private wedding parties in Oklahoma to collect footage for shows in September 2006. He promises to give up television, but her yapfest goes on and on. <br /> <br /> Contrary to what he thinks, Oprah is neither a queen nor a goddess nor a personal mission of God. She is just one very happy, overweight, black woman who copied Phil Donahue's style and called her her own. It so happened that she found herself in the right place at the right time and knew exactly how to reach the right demographic group. <br /> <br /> Oprah is P.T. Barnum at this age and it amazes me that people do not see her facade. <br /> <br /> So ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, and you too, Oprah, if you can match this overstated ego through the door - That way, now for a great exit ...
