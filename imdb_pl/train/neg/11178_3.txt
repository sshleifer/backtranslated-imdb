First of all, I have to admit that it is not a good movie. And I would never watch this movie if Pacino was not there. <br /> <br /> The film is about a strange 24-hour journalism. in general it is a character. It's really boring, you can fall asleep after 20 minutes. And I do not understand why Pacino wanted to be part of this awful movie. Only because of money or what? <br /> <br /> Since I am an avid fan of Pacino, I bought this "People I Know" movie from 2002. If you have not bought it yet, do not even think about it, it's just a waste of time.
