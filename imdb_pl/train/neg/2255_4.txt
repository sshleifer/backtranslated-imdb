Was this film stupid? Yes. Is this depth of film? No. Character development? No. Story returns? No. It was just a movie about the very fictionalized Springer program. It shows the length that some people will go to get mugs on television. Molly Hagan did a great job as mother of Jaime Pressly. Jaime is ... well ... WONDERFUL! This movie was not so much created to be a "breakthrough" movie, but rather it was intended to live in a park of trailers (I live in a trailer park and ours is nothing in this movie), where everyone sleeps with all other than that all the girls got pregnant through different guys, and all guys drive rusted Ford pickups from66 (exaggeration, of course, but that's the picture everyone can see when you mention the "trailer park"). Some people over-analyze movies (case-in-point: Star Trek maniacs). I watch movies only for entertainment purposes; I'm not saying that the girl is wearing a different shirt in a different scene (read the track "Goofs" about Connie's shirt.) Could it have been better? Of course, it was funny as hell.
