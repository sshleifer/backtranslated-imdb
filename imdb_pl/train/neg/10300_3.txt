I am a fan of artistic films, but I regret to report this film as pretentious nonsense. Tiring slow development of a non-existent plot based on a promising assumption, this experience, let us say, try. Even after bad movies, I feel that I'm learning something or I'm enjoying some aspect, but there was nothing to appreciate. The premise was not interesting, but the movie begins and ends. Acting was fine, though the characters were completely boring. For the hero to be able to aim at such a daring target, he is very empty. Detriment. I usually like non-formulated films, but the lack of a formula should not be confused with zero content.
