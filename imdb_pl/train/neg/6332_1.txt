I could not wait to see this movie when it appeared, because I was a huge fan of SNL. When my boyfriend and I went to see him, people leaving the early show were shouting: "Do not waste your money!". But of course we had to find out about it. <br /> <br /> Although there were some funny bits (Laser Bra 2000, Root Boy Slim), most of them seemed to be seriously edited to form a fun 1 hour show. It was very bad. <br /> <br /> When the opera singer came, many people got up and went out. That made me laugh, because I realized that O'Donoghue was intentionally pushing people's buttons in this movie. Or he was just crazy. Whatever - you do not have to waste time watching, it's so bad.
