Major Payne really was not very good. Despite the fact that he was funny here and there, the story was ridiculous and the acting was weak. Major Payne's voice and temperament were particularly annoying. The idea was ridiculous and the things that the boys had to do in this movie were even more ridiculous. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
