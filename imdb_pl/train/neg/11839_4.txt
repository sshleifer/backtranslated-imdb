"The Cat's Meow" contains several scenes that boast intelligent dialogue and some great performances, some of which surprised me. Eddie Izzard is more effective than I expected as Chaplin (partly thanks to the perfect hairstyle and make-up by the talented designer); Joanna Lumley is attractive as a novelist Elinor Glyn; and Kirsten Dunst wins as Marion Davies (though why films never use her stuttering in life, it is difficult to explain). But these elements do not make up a successful whole. The screenwriter apparently worked very hard on certain scenes - Davies and Chaplin's meetings are particularly well done - but not so hard on a big picture. A few smaller characters do not have to be there and do not behave consistently. The basic plot is full of illogicality (eg. Why is Thomas Ince thinking that it is a good idea to tell Hearst something he really does not want to hear?), And party scenes are repetitive and exhausting. I would like to think that the journey on Hearst's yacht was more pleasant than the film indicates. Davies is characterized as a standard type of Flapper, which is not very accurate, and writer's ideas about Chaplin and love are unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Strange, Bogdanovich, who seemed so connected to the thirties in "Paper Moon", there is a lack of similar affinity with the twenties. He insisted that the perfect costume designer would only use black and cream, which gives partiers a very artificial look and plays only the most stereotypical songs from that period (eg "Yes, we do not have bananas"). When Hearst insists everyone "Charleston, Charleston!" It seems that the actors had a ten-minute dance lesson just before the scene was shot. <br /> <br /> The life of silent movie stars can create fascinating movies, I'm sure, but not this time.
