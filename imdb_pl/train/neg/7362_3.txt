Average quality of a TV movie, a completely formal story about a religious fanatic (Ron Perlman, who gives good "I'm not just the president of" Psychos R Us ", I'm also a client") who gets control over the biochemical virus (think about the virus from The Rock "). It is a pity that he also got stuck in a bank building during an earthquake with bank robbers and government agents trying to stop him (led by impressively physically fascinated, slightly funny Wolf Larson, backed by Fred Dryer) with the standard wrong place at the wrong time "spunky female (eternally insipid Erika Eleniak) and "lived like a mollusk, but died as a hero at the last moment" man (Brandon Karrer). Has a standard history to express sympathy to a religious fanatic (wife and son were killed in a police raid a few years earlier). <br /> <br /> Essentially a decent movie with a rainy day. <br /> <br /> Favorite line, spoken by Ron Perlman after finding a vial of virus hidden in the neckline of Erika Eleniak: "Woman and her secret. "<br /> <br /> It's worth to rent.
