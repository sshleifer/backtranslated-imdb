I was intrigued by how a little-known film from 2008 somehow won an Oscar for the best picture of 2009 and thus went to The Hurt Locker. Unfortunately, for two invested two hours I received a gloomy confirmation that this film won prizes only for reasons beyond the screen. <br /> <br /> the direction and visual style of this film are one of the weakest you will ever see. when he is not busy with another homage to Bourne's identity with the terrible, irritating visuals of the "shaky camera", he shows all the features of the second soap opera during the day in terms of lensing. <br /> <br /> The "plot" is trivial, the characteristics are as well developed as the rejected ideas of the Beetle Bailey comic and dialogue - in cases when the film resigns from being a "minimalist" and for no apparent reason turns one or two soldiers into right gadgets - there are some of the worst that has ever been registered. in fairness, the actors do everything in their power, just not enough to obscure how bad the project is. <br /> <br /> the whole movie has the impression that it is a kind of "mockumentary" that they have been tactless, and thus re-edited the best they could to convey it as a serious drama. <br /> <br /> if you spend two hours in this movie, then two hours never come back, and two hours wasted, that you will regret for the rest of your life.
