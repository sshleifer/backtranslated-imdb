The sixties were a time of change and awakening for most people. Social shocks and anxieties were common when people talked about their views. Racial tensions, politics, war in Vietnam, sexual promiscuity and drug use were part of everyday material and everyday news. This film tried to capture these historical aspects into a funny movie and largely succeeded. <br /> <br /> In this movie, we watch two families: one white, one black. In the first half of the film, history follows each family on equal terms through social and family struggles. Unfortunately, the second half of the film is almost devoted to the white family. I must admit that there are more characters in this family, and the plot lines are intertwined, but the equal racial aspects of this century are not taken into account. <br /> <br /> In general, acting is well done and historical footage is mixed with the colorful and black and white original footage to give the film a documentary character. The film is a fictional work, but clips of known historical figures are used to establish the timeline. <br /> <br /> I liked the film, but the situations were predictable and the plot was one-sided.
