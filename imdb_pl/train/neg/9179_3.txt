This is cheese. If all you need is a video game, along with what looks like a simple action sequence from a computer, the movie was too cheap to really produce special effects, that's it. My friend and I really had a great time, because the theater was mostly empty and we could tremble a bit. This movie requires really heckling. <br /> <br /> The plot? Was there a conspiracy? OK, some stupid colleges or later types are invited to "rave of the year" and go to one of the San Juan Islands ("If only they were back in Seattle, they would survive." - direct quote, or almost.) To participate. They get in there and everybody left and the site is a bit damaged (but hey, the barrel is still full!). With the help of a crunchy old captain and a Coast Guard woman (who only behaved less often - and a bit worse - than Cynthia Rothrock), they fight many zombies (some of them spit acid), get a lot of strange legends, and most often die. The point is. <br /> <br /> It's not as bad as Demonicus, but not too much, and still better than Severed (these are my own alpha and omega for bad movies - the first one is bad but it's nice to shake and the other is just too weird to watch more than once). On the other hand, if you expect a movie with video games to be as perfect as Resident Evil, run away !!! Run now !!! <br /> <br /> OK, some serious questions (without too many spoilers): Ever since the Spanish ships from the 18th century have been exploring the North Pacific Northwest ????? Why is anyone in the army smuggled in the Pacific Northwest and who - CANADA, cry loudly ??? Why rave on unnamed (oh, sorry, it's called "isla del muerto", shya, right) San Juan Island - and outside, still remembering it's PACIFIC NORTHWET. And rave has about 30 people - "rave year", my patoot. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, there are many axes. Many of them. Everyone has them. This must be an ax shop nearby. <br /> <br /> Finally, when the movie started playing with a small "parody" (with nudges in "I Know What You Did and Jaws"), it did not move close enough. <br /> <br /> OK, really finally - when introductory comments (in the voice, no less) mention that one of the characters "gave up his boyfriend to focus on fencing", you can be sure that at the end of the movie there will be some fencing. Not a GOOD fencing, but still a few people swear at each other with swords.
