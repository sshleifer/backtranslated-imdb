Because others took the trouble to sum up the plot, I would like to mention a few points about this film. There may be spoilers here; I do not care to filter them out. <br /> <br /> - Given the low budget of the film, the creation project was quite good. It's really nice to see a horror movie with a direct movie that is not disgusting with a terrible CGI. Unfortunately, the quality of digital film is quite grainy in places and is most visible in well-lit white halls of asylum. <br /> <br /> - Funny lighting is designing a part of the movie, not to mention the time lapse variations. I understand that the director may have tried to simulate dementia, but to be effective, it was necessary to establish a flow of time. So far, it seems amateur. <br /> <br /> - The plot returns were numerous but consistently predictable. I had no doubts about the identity of the devilish cultists or the fact that some lame evil would emerge at the end - good development. <br /> <br /> - It may seem like quarrels, but the characters in this movie reliably do not use any common sense. First of all, regulatory committees would be in the whole mental health center, which would unilaterally declare the death of all patients and employees caused by cardiac arrest. Why would the chief psychiatrist also have the ability to conduct autopsies? Why did not the feature point contain these impressive qualifications or its introduction to the strange choice of religion? What is the background? What is to make us care? And what's equally important, who in his right mind will go through the introduction to this place, will see everything that was so terrifyingly bad in it, and then he will come to the conclusion that it was still a good place to live? This movie did not even respect his heroes enough to give intelligence the benefit of doubt. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: see The Wicker Man instead.
