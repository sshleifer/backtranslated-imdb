What was the worst film of 2003? "Cat in a hat?" "Gigli?" Mais non! I suggest that this is a terrible little film from the previous year. Poorly written, badly edited and (if I can be so brave) poorly preserved, "The Order" is a black hole in the movie - a film so dense that even the smallest part of entertainment can escape from the horizon of events. It is not even accidentally funny, as (for example) "Showgirls". <br /> <br /> You know that producers assume that their audience will not be too smart. They changed the name of the film, originally entitled "The Sin Eaters", because they thought that the Americans were too stupid to understand what a sins eater, even if they try to explain what the eater of sin is in the movie. Instead, they have a completely generic title, and the image of Heath Ledger looking grimly is more than enough to get you there. <br /> <br /> And, hey, what do you know, they were right! My ex-girlfriend saw a photo of Heath and pulled me inside. Congratulations, producers, you've met your target market. She also liked "Grease II", so you're in good company. <br /> <br /> Returning to the subject, Heath plays a Catholic monk with a specific (guessed) order that attempts to investigate the murder of his mentor. He has problems with celibacy, perhaps because no one in his right mind would believe that he knows about the smallest thing about religion, let alone about a celibate monk. The only other member of this order is a funny fatty alcoholic. Although I wanted to see the return of a funny alcoholic to the big screen, his attempts at humor reminded me of all the dorkies in my high school, who were doing Monty Python imitations, thinking that if they only said such lines, Pythons would do it automatically. You know what people I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> If I said something, I would be in danger of generating spoilers. To be honest, the thing that ruined this movie was the fact that it was created.
