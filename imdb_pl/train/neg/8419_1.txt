I could not wait to see Dreamgirls for a long time ... what about these crazy reviews, nominations and media attention. And I must say that the first quarter of the movie was good! It really presented then the scene of black music. However, when the film was worn, me and my whole family were bored with our reason. Singing was coming, one by one. I mean, seriously, just one more music number and it would even explode when RENT. <br /> <br /> Besides, I did not notice almost any character development in any of the characters; I did not care what happened to them! Even when the character of Eddie Murphy died of a drug overdose, I knew I should have been sad, but I could not feel any emotion for that character. The characters received a poor background about singing in childhood and the like, but the personalities were not revealed enough to get me involved. <br /> <br /> Finally, the conflict was simply irrelevant enough to interest the viewer, which goes hand in hand with the lack of character development. This movie reminded me of a movie with cats based on Ray, Chicago and Rent (in my opinion, Ray and Chicago were great movies). In general, I think this movie would best suit someone who really does not care about general history, but would enjoy two hours of fun and funny performances.
