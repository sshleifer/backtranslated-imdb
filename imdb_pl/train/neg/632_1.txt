Well, what was cool ... except the funny part. <br /> <br /> This is my second least favorite so far, I even thought it was worse than "Lazarus" and "Ghost in the Machine". /> <br /> Let's start with a good one. Teaser was incredibly well made and emotional. Being a great animal lover, which I am, it was great to see so many beautiful animals in this episode. <br /> <br /> But then everything is wrong and believe me that there are a lot of them. Little sense, so these animals were abducted by aliens and impregnated? whaaa ??? the window was also awful. There were about one or two quoted lines. <br /> <br /> and worst of all, having almost all of these animals died was very unpleasant for me. In the end ... what's going on? they all almost died. We have not learned anything, we have not been entertaining, and I could not even find Sophia's death sad ... simply frustrating. <br /> <br /> * a star. It's a pity because season 2 was doing so well.
