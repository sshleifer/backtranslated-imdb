*** SPOILERS *** As in the case of the bad game Tinkers-to-Evers-to-Chance in the doubles game that we have in "Omen IV", they return the bad seed of the deceased AntiChrist Damien Thorn. Terrorizing her parents with schoolmates, neighbors and finally the whole world, what was called Delia York, Asia Vieila. After receiving the "deserved" pair of Yorks Karen and Gene, Fay Grant and Michael Woods, through the orphanage of the Catholic Church of St. Francis. <br /> <br /> Little Delia did not waste her time making her peasants feel like scratching her mother at a home party. Later, Delia is almost killed by the escaping truck just to save her this "Devil Dog" named Ryder. Going to school Delia takes care of the local rascal, forcing the big guy to get wet in front of all classmates. Later, when his father threatens York with legal attire, he has his head cut off in a car accident! Delia is someone you never bother with, if you know what's good for you. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile Dia's dad, Gene, becomes a big man in the city alone, or at least he thinks so, after being chosen as a master of clean air and a crowd of green trees, instead of letting smog and concrete boys take over the area with your eye on the White House itself! Did his brother and strange daughter Delia have anything to do with Gene Jones's sudden happiness? <br /> <br /> Only later, when Jo, Ann Hearen, is employed as a nanny Delia, the truth comes to light about her strange and bad powers. Jo New Age realizes that Delia is a bit strange after she changed all white crystals to black and calls her New Age Guru Noah, Jim Byrnes, to come and check her out. Noah is so nervous about what he sees in Ville Kirii with vibrant colors, all black and blue with a touch of red that throws him so badly that he almost hits Delia's mother's car. <br /> <br /> Taken on a trip to a mental festival, Jo Delia turns the whole event into hell, setting the place, through mental telepathy, in the fire and picking up everyone running around the cover, including poor Noah who was at the festival and finished with broken leg. Shaken and battered, the Guru was so shocked by the whole experience that he later left the country to become a hermit in the Tibetan wilderness. <br /> <br /> Jo herself is later thrown out, with the help of Ryder's sweet and cuddly family pet, from the second floor window to her death because she knew and spoke too much. When Karen is pregnant again, she decides to finally find out the truth about Delia's real parents. That's when she and we in the audience face the truth. She is not only a terrifying AntiChrist of Revelations, she is his twin sister! Her brother, AntiChrist, is about to appear on stage as her brother, son, and unborn Alexander York! <br /> <br /> Three times more than it was enough for AntiChrist to return to Earth to bring Armageddon. The public film was already a bit tired with him and his bad adventures. The fourth really is not necessary, because Daimen Thorn, the original AntiChrist, was dead and buried for years. We were subjected to a simple bell, nobody believed that little Delia was "You" AntiChrist until it was almost too late to stop her in the deadly rounds of destroying the entire human race. A film as bad as it is is too long, 97 minutes, because the movie is terrifying, which could say that its history is only 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> Having private eye Earl Knight, Mchael Learner, and later a Catholic sister, Yvonne, Megan Lehch, and now the healer of Felichy's faith in the film just to die, also did not help the plot. It only prolonged the suffering of those of us who watched the movie. You could see that the surprise comes to an end as soon as the movie "Omen IV" began when the bases were cleared of the possible takeover of Delia civilized and uncivilized world. Delia was a bit surprised, who did it with a little help from her friends.
