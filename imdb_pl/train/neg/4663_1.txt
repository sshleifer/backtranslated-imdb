This movie was just bad. I love war movies and I can usually move away from most movies and find something I liked, but it was not one of them. The film lacked content and intensity. OK I understand, the Finns fought in hell and that's great, but the story is poorly told. You have no real relationship with any character and there is no real story to follow. You just go from one random scene to another, nothing flows to create the story you are trying to convey. If you want to have a war movie that catches attention and amazingly no battle scenes, I would suggest "Downfall" (a German movie from World War II). And if you prefer a great story and a lot of action, I would suggest "Brotherhood of War" (Korean war / Korean film). These two films will not be disappointed when there is a winter war.
