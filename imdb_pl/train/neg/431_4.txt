I think Al Pacino is a guilty pleasure. He was a great actor up to the Scent of a woman, where he apparently overdosed himself irretrievably. I was hoping that this movie, about which I heard almost nothing, would not be a nice jewel. Skipped, overtaking time, intelligent and engaging thriller about urban policy. This is not. <br /> <br /> The Town Hall is a movie that wraps its plot with so many characters, names and "realistic" global problems that for some time you think it's a conspiracy so wide and engaging that when you discover the truth, it will dispel yours mind. In fact, however, these sub-topics and digressions ultimately lead to quite familiar and well-known urban signs, such as corruption of power, two-faced politicians, mafia with police ties etc. In theory, this configuration allows for some exciting tension, fear that none of the characters it is not safe and everything can happen! But again, really not. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the only thing that happens is quite predictable and we have a few monologues of "confessions", which as a whole aim to create a modern fairy tale, a lesson in the moral ambiguity of the "real world" of politics and society. But after 110 minutes of names and missing reports and a spider's web of lies and covers, the audience is usually treated in a somewhat satisfying way. I do not think we'll stay with City Hall, and although it's a very full movie, I do not consider it completely rich.
