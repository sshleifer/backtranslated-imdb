Can you say, "Don Johnson as Elvis? Can it work? Is it possible? It seems like a terrible choice, but maybe I should have an open mind. Maybe I will be surprised. . <br /> <br /> NO! <br /> <br /> Don Johnson is not a bad actor. But he is a terrible Elvis. It's too short, too weak, too sharp ... well, you already imagined how bad it would be. Add to this a hokey black wig and a thick-skinned eyeliner and mascara. far away, after some time you do not even think of him as Elvis. Instead, you see him as another crazy pop star. Then, at this level, the film becomes visible. <br /> <br /> Stephanie Zimbalist is also not perfectly manned as the tall beauty queen, Linda Thompson. But she is attractive herself and plays a role in honesty, elegance and intelligence, which we expect from all roles. There may be too much intelligence in its performance. You have to be a bit stupid to stick to drugs that abuse drugs. <br /> <br /> There is nothing new in this story; we've heard it many times. If you are looking for new information or information, you will not find them. It is told as a love story - unrequited: Linda for Elvis and Elvis for drugs.
