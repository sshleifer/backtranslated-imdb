0,5 / 10. This movie has nothing good about it. Acting is one of the worst I've ever seen, which is really amazing, that EVERYONE is terrible, not just a few here and there, everyone. Direction is a joke, low budget is hopelessly obvious, the result is terrible, I would not say that the film was edited, roughly cut would be a more appropriate phrase. Combines serial killings, voodoo cards and tarot cards. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. This is not at all frightening, the special effects are hopelessly lame. ridiculously bad. Writing was terrifyingly bad. Pictures are really cheap and sometimes very grainy, and the work with the camera is terrible. Again, what the film really does is how much all the actors are. Cheesy.
