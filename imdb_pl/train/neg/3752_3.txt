I grew up watching and loving TNG. I recently finished watching the whole ST Voyager series on DVD, which could have increased my sense of disgust with this episode, because the difference in style and approach between the two shows could not have been more severe. The idea could have been good, if it was used as an opportunity to further develop the character of Riker, he would probably be treated as VOY. They could have memories that would be "new" to the audience instead of simply returning old show clips. The transitions between "memories" and "present" in this episode begin at first as trivial and very quickly become unbearable when the tired pattern is worn and lasts. The bar is the worst episode in history.
