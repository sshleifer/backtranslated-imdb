Forced by my children to watch this at least 10 times for each of the last two Christmas holidays, I feel suitably qualified to judge this version of Dr. Seuss's classic story, and well ... it's not very good. First of all, following a classic act, such as the animated television series Chuck Jones, will be difficult for everyone, but this interpretation is so heavy and padded that it is positively paralyzing. I agree that there are a few inspired gags, but overall the movie comes out as a calculated cash gimmick, at the same time as it allegedly destroys the commercialization of Christmas. Jim Carrey is usually at the top here, but this is completely contrary to the character of Grinch. As described by Boris Karloff, he was slow; methodical and cunning. There is no method for Carrey's madness, and this is just the most obvious mistake. Talented actors such as Jeffrey Tambor and Christine Baranski are completely wasted. Why, Universal, why? I mean, I understand that Tony Hopkins will take almost every role (like his compatriot Michael Caine), but it has to be made as part of "Movies that should never have been done". It does not bode well for Cat in the Hat, an even thinner volume that Universal is preparing for the holidays. I have the impression that I will be doing the same recommendation for what I do with it: skip this and read a book or watch a TV program. It's 2 hours that you can never recover.
