Ah, movie about sex and gore. It is a pity they do not create them anymore (unless you live in Japan). But if it all ends, it's not a bad thing. <br /> <br /> The movie consists essentially of two charming vampires who collect "pants" along a country road, take them home to their castle, have crazy sex with them, and then eat them (except for the first sacrifice they keep for no special reason). Things get complicated when a woman camping with her husband gets too curious about these mysterious women she still sees. That's why it really gets ugly. At the end, two vampires are in such bloodlust that they eat everything in sight and manage to escape their captivity. Oops, this is because of this secret existence. <br /> <br /> The fact that two vampires do not mind taking off their clothes and fooling around with each other is the only thing the movie aims at. Otherwise, it is a bloody, confusing mess (why their tomb is so far away from the castle?), Which can be watched only for a few minutes of vampire fun. The only thing I got out of this movie are these two valuable advices: shooting lesbians will not kill them; it will only turn them into vampires, and do not pick up whores along the country road; they are probably vampires. Besides, it really was not worth my time.
