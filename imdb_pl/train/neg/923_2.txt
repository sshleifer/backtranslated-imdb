For some reason, different young couples wandering through the Italian Alps are parting to see who can reach the designated place on the campsite. James (Gregory Lee Kenyon) enters the cave, finds the skeleton of an ancient demonic gladiator and is possessed by the spirit of "Tyranus" when he puts on a helmet belonging to the corpses. Then the rest of the movie runs through the woods, hunting for friends and chopping their limbs to add to the goulash to bring back the undead "Demonicus". The release of Full Moon from film shots is stupid, meaningless, has terrible acting and sound, and Los Angeles National Forest is a weak substitute for Italy. However, this is a fairly high result in the case of unintentional scale of laughter, mainly due to excess lead efficiency. Regardless of whether they run their eyes in cheap armor, waving a sword, or spouting a neurotic Latin mumble about demons and resurrection, Kenyon's unbelievable face and inconvenient line supply must be faith. Well, at least he's not bored like most of the rest of the cast.
