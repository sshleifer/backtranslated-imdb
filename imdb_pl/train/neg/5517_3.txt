I rate this film only as a pity 3, because it tries to pay off. I love to praise a great movie and I am not focused on "male" films. Legally, the blonde was a great movie. On the other hand, Georgia Rule was a disorganized, weak, ill-written, unrealistic example of making the worst-case movies. at the end of the movie I did not care who was lying or something was solved. <br /> <br /> The most important thing in the film is a good HISTORY. This story is weak and never develops (just because the subject is deep, does not mean that the story is good). Good story has dynamic characters. A dynamic character is one who experiences a serious change of character and is prepared for this change during the film. In Georgia Rule, changes in characters were violent and undeveloped. Second, there were too many INTERESTED dynamic characters. Breaking a really good dynamic character is hard work and takes time (you only have a few hours in the movie). This means that too many dynamic character attempts will not pay enough attention to their personal changes. Even if I ignore the badly written story and the litter of weak dynamic characters, I can not even say that I liked anyone. Each character was a mess. That's good if you're writing American Beauty, but not when you're trying a dramatic comedy. Georgia was a terrible mother, her daughter was a terrible mother and daughter, and Lohan was a terrible excuse for a man (no, I do not cut her off because she was molested, shit happens to everyone and we are all responsible for our own actions). Mormon child "Dudley Do Right" should have the courage to not jeopardize his religion and commitments ... and Simon, I mean seriously, what guy allows 17-year-old girl who was molested, from time to time to stay (unless that he is an actor or politician). This movie is worth a look if you want to remind yourself how good film making is. NO!
