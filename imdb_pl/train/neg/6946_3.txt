I watched this movie a long time ago (about 10 years) and I liked it then. I remembered it one day and decided to watch it again. The second time was not pleasant. Acting is "yes, so", the plot is illogical, unreasonable and predictable. <br /> <br /> Acting ... I'm sure that the actresses were not able to play these characters. The conspiracy ... in hell there is no way that these women escaped with the first robbery much less than 2. (Additional note: Why TT did not realize that even if he gets a lot of money on his court date, they'll ask where she got it from and it will not have a logical answer!). Black women were very stereotyped, basically saying that the only way black women can "beat the system" or get a large sum of money is to steal and not use their intelligence or other resources. Game too much for sympathy b / c all die in the end (Jada bar), but it is not sad (you think: "They were so stupid, deserve to die"). You just do not care about characters unless you're a shallow person. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that this movie exceeds 5.
