... fortunately he has not done it yet! It's a primitive, simplified student policy turned into a drama. I need a viewer to buy a series of conceit. Conceit 1: That the British electorate can be shifted from being essentially the center of the center to the overwhelming left. Concept 2: All debates in the media and public opinion are unanimously concluded, and the only critics of the new prime minister are ominous government officials, MI5, big business and Americans (naturally). Conceit 3: That this radical socialist prime minister can solve all union, economic and social problems with total ease in a unifying nation. Conceit 4: That breaking all ties with the US and NATO is a good thing. Conceit 5: That the Soviet Union is not a brutal and oppressive regime and that we should have closer time with them in the 1980s. And finally, Concept 6: US reactionary forces will actively pursue a coup against Britain. <br /> <br /> It's ridiculous, and the show has gained the reputation it has gained by trying to earn some anti-Thatcher feeling in the country and after left-wing TV critics singing their praises. When it came into being, television was still an extremely popular and influential medium, and the shows received great marks, so widely discussed dramas with a hint of controversy had a good chance of winning a large audience. Ray McInally's performance was great, which is one of the few pros. History and time showed a huge weakness of the premise and plot of this series.
