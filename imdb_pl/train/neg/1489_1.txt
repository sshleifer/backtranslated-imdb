It started badly, it worsened, and before the girl attacked the old lady at the end, I literally wanted to take a DVD to the person we borrowed and strangle her C ** T to death. Avoid this movie, some good cinematography and some nude photos, it would be almost acceptable if I was 14 and I have not seen Jenny Jameson naked a million times. If someone feels the need to watch this movie, I would strongly recommend that you devote this time more appropriately, as an example I would like to say, trying to drive Lego into your butt without lubricating would be a good start. I heard that this movie was not the original version, I'd love to see the original, because it seems that the cut version is devoid of the entire story and apparently most of the nudity, can anyone tell me how I can get in touch with Christian Viel I owe an hour my life!
