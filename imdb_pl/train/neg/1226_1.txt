Oh, how powerful they fell. Kim Basinger is a great actress, but she definitely took part in this role. This movie is bad for one reason, in particular: logic disappears. It looks like one of those movies that would be satisfactory with all the feature holes if it appeared in the 80s and 90s, but in 2008 it looks really stupid. This is the worst thriller I've ever seen. I saw The Bone Collector and Twisted. <br /> <br /> Details of the story of Dell (Kim Basinger) is just starting to buy presents in the mall and is being harassed by a gang of bandits who kill a policeman who came to her help. Since then, these idiots chase her through the abandoned street and get rid of them one by one with a toolbox full of tools. <br /> <br /> There are so many things wrong with this movie. As I said, this movie jumps over logic at every turn and with the exception of Kim Basinger, acting is spoiled for television. Hell, this pseudo-thriller is bad for television. The way he kills each of these politically correct thugs (1 Caucasian, 1 Latin, 1 Asian and 1 African-American, all together to persecute a Caucasian woman ... Do not you just love America?) She's funny because of guilt. The way she killed the Latinos made me laugh hysterically. The sex scene with the main hooligan was in the left box, shaking your head with shame. I recommend this only to lovers of bad movies and no one else. Someone else, especially fans of Kim Basinger, would do well if he was not the owner of the movie. Do not you want the actress you respect in the movie to be so bad now? Of course not. You have been warned.
