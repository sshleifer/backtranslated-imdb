I just had to write this one liner, but it really is. I love gangster genre and this is the weakest entry I've seen in recent years. I have praise for everyone involved in most aspects, except the most important - the script. It's a bad story about a petty criminal. No amount of delicate or black and white film stylization can compensate for the total lack of substance. I love Kevin Spacey and I hear that he will make another film about general. My advice is do not waste time.
