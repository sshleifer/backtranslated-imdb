This movie was terrible in the worst way: you just did not care. You did not care what happened on the plot; you did not care about the characters. Everyone was heartless. I ended up going in about 45 minutes because I just did not want to pay attention. There is too much sex in the movie. Sex can be fine; he may even make a movie (hence the Karma Sutra), but the attitude here was not beautiful or sexy. It was simply ugly. Do not watch this movie.
