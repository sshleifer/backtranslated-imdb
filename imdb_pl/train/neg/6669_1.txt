I saw this movie in my cinema class. I'm glad I did not pay to see it. I came up with an open mind and was even a little excited. I really like Ed Norton and Evan Rachel Wood, and the rest of the cast was interesting. I have never connected with this film. Acting was great, the photos were interesting, but the plot, or rather its lack, was a problem. There was no central connection between the theme and the film. Was it an affair between Norton and Wood? Well, no, not exactly. Was it western? Kind, but not. I am for curly films, I have recently seen "Brick" and loved it, but the place where this movie went was just too much. It was so weird, and if I did not have to sit in the whole movie, I would leave. Writing was not terrible, but it was just everywhere. Before this movie ended, I was terribly confused and I wished I had finished earlier. In this movie there was something that did not resonate, I understand more unconventional films, such as "Fight Club", but I did not care about characters at all.
