Besides the fact that George Lopez is a pretentious jerk, his performance is terrible. <br /> <br /> Nothing about Lopez has ever been fun. I watched his performances and never uttered any similarity to laughter. <br /> <br /> His things turn out to be vengeful, and his aversion to white people flows from every pore of his body. <Br /> <br /> I used to laugh at white people joking with many comics and I love many of them. <br /> <br /> This guy has a grudge that he will not end. <br /> <br /> feel bad for Hispanics who only have this show to represent themselves. <br /> <br /> The plot of the shows are always a cookie cutter with a Spanish accent. <br /> <br /> Laughing in cans with the stupidest comments and scenes. <br /> <br /> Maybe that is why this series is always in the replay at 2am.
