This movie was the worst movie I ever watched. It was like "homework" for a movie lesson. Completely omits the character when it comes to the "message" that he is trying to convey. Characters are exaggerated, bad acting and plot ... it's totally ridiculous. The cover shot made me think that it could be a decent movie, the co-creator is handsome and that's all. The moral of the film: NEVER MAKE THE FILM THROUGH YOUR COVER! Save your time, money and energy and create your own home movie, and you'll be much better than me. It was painful to watch and to be honest, I am surprised that everyone will spend money on its production and distribution!
