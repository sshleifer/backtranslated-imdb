I bought this movie during the sale of a car boot, so I did not expect it to be horror on the same level as Nightmare on Wiązów Street (1984) or The Hills Have Eyes (1977), but I thought it would still be nice to watch. It turned out, however, that it was not pleasant at all, but instead, acting and the overall movie were mocking, such as the way in which "unsees killer" murders its victims and how all killed people simply are a young blonde woman. It was a stereotypical horror. I say this for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) Three blond women in danger, the majority are killed. 2) One survives, crawling in the dark while being pursued by the killer. 3) Surprise, surprise, help appears in the form of a shotgun! <br /> <br /> Using three simple points, I've saved you two weird hours, summing up this poor excuse of horror, so now you're lucky enough not to watch it.
