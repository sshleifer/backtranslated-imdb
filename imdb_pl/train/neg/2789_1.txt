Savage Island (2003) is a lame movie. It's more like a home video with minimal lighting and horrible action. Not only this story and the script were unhappy. I do not know why this movie was made. In my time I've seen a lot of movies, and the ones I really hate are movies that annoy me. This made my blood boil. The situations were closed at best. If I made such a movie, it would be short. Really because these "idjites" would not be in the picture. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the cover of D.V.D. I am an avid observer of bad cinema. But this movie is virtually unseeable. I do not mind movies made on D.V. but if you're going to do what will make the movie enjoyable, not some tired retread of perfect horror movies (sans Wrong Turn). <br /> <br /> I do not have to recommend this disk waste. If you come across this at the rental company, pass it through. <br /> <br /> Movies that make you really angry, get an automatic 1.
