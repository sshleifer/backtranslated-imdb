Ah yes, the VS series, MVC2 is the top. It is said before, this is what you get when half of the crew fell asleep at work, unfortunately the game is over. Do not get me wrong, it's cool, but you're bored with the buttons of mashing. As for the plot summary, AHAHAHAHAHAAAAA ... There is no story. Defeat this guy at the end and win! Eh, who is playing this anyway?
