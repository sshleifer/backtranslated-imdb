Basically, I think that the curve of Eden is very poorly constructed, which makes it difficult to watch. However, there is something I have to say about how the director captured something from the atmosphere of the early '70s in choosing settings and clothes. The philosophy of "return to earth" and interest in sexual exploration and drugs, which were not dramatically decadent, as it was presented in many later versions of the 1970s, was just as pseudo "do not ask," liberalism of a brotherhood composed of Eastern intellectuals the coast, except that I thought it was more likely at school in New England than in Virginia, where I imagine that the mentality of the "good boy" still dominated even elitist schools such as this one. Another thing that I appreciate and that I could relate to is that it was a time when homosexuality was not so much associated with peels or drag queens and I appreciated some homosexual roles unrelated to these terribly abused images. I felt that it was very unfortunate that "gay culture" took some standard forms in the 1980s with Castro and Christopher Streets, who defined this movement and omitted a huge number of gays who were more subdued in their lifestyle. I appreciated this film mainly as a way to remember the more natural way we were about our sexuality and personal relationships without a "scene".
