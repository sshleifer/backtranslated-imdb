This film is NOT the same as the 1954 version. With Judy Garland and James Mason, and it's a shame because the 1954 version is much better in my opinion. I do not deny the talent of Barbra Streisand. She is a good actress and a brilliant singer. I am not familiar with Kris Kristofferson's other work and therefore I can not judge her. However, this film leaves a lot to be desired. She slowly spins, has free nudity and a disgusting tongue, and can be very hard to sit down. <br /> <br /> However, I'm not a huge fan of rock music, so it's only natural that I would like the version of Judy Garland better. See the movie from 1976 with Barry and Kris and judge for yourself.
