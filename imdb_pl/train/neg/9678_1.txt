I'm sorry to say it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Although visually fascinating (eg Using color was absolutely stunning), it was quite boring and disturbing (see incest father / son). <br /> <br /> What's more, music is completely absent, and if you think about the great soundtracks of Michael Nyman (who wrote the soundtracks for most of Greenaway's films), you can imagine what difference it makes. <br /> <br />
