Wow, I hated this movie. The topic should result in a really good movie, and the main actor was so sensitive and talented that he coped with the topic, but the script - if he was even * a * script - is a mess. It's less a movie than a random slide show that does not appear anywhere. I would say that it is not going anywhere quickly, except that it is actually the longest 81 minutes you will ever be sitting in. As I mentioned, the main actor is good. Like Faruza Baulk (SP?), As his sometimes harsh but ultimately loving and accepting mother. The filmmakers have a lot to say here because it's a mess. A real shame because I really wanted to like this movie, but it's basically coming out of a movie that's never been made. Skip this - it was not even worth $ 6, which I dumped for pay-per-view.
