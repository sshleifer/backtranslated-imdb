This movie is like Conan the Barabarian, but with more sex, rape and murder. Somewhere under this debauchery is a conspiracy, but the filmmakers do not do it well, which is a shame, because "it can" be a decent story. Richard Hill gives solid performance in the lead role, as does the villain - which unfortunately did not appear in anything else. Combat scenes are also not that bad - I love the way Deathstalker allows his sword to "drink" the blood of his victims - and there is plenty of nudity and sex to ease the general level of machismo throughout the text. <br /> <br /> All in all not good - but not necessarily so bad ...
