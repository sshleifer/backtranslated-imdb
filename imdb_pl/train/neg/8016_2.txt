First of all, this movie is slow moving and I can see that most viewers lose their patience in the first thirty minutes. <br /> <br /> The theme of the film was the one that in my opinion would be the basis of a perfect movie; the plot lacked the most, which would advance the basic motives. <br /> <br /> This is unfortunate, because in the hands of a writer like (say) Lanford Wilson, I think that the symbolism resembles a mountain lion attacking the school campus could take a great, tragic proportion, without being too heavy. <br /> <br /> I think that with a good screenplay supporting the film, the same filmmaker, the same tastes, and even the same actors who did not even have the chance to impress me), he could be able to present a meaningful and touching description the pain and struggle a boy goes through when he develops a powerful "falling in love" with an older boy whom he admires. <br /> <br /> However, I am sorry to say this without foundation and armed with a vague, dull and very uninteresting scenario, with no conspiracy in sight and without any kind of reasonable structure (for example, after seeing it, I think you will convince that you can not point to the climactic scenes, and instead you will find the enumeration "well, maybe this scene or this was the culmination ...") - the result is 95 minutes of boredom. <br /> <br /> Without a good storyline, we are never terribly interested in any form; their attempts and difficulties are simply boring and boring. <br /> <br /> Without a good storyline, dramatic devices and surrealistic director's freedoms become mysterious and confusing rather than improving the plot. I never really believed in the creation of "Leah" and I think most viewers would be completely surprised by the conventional way in which her phone calls were filmed. <br /> <br /> As the movie spins, I'm afraid I can not recommend it at all. I never understand why a film like this one is not processed by an entrepreneurial filmmaker ... instead of all the average remixes of films that were super good in the first release! All you need is a good script, written by good writers, and I think that this movie can be easily transformed into an unforgettable classic about the aspect of the maturity of a man who is rarely treated in the drama. All the elements that were so bothersome and seemed so bold in the film (messages written on the belly of the boy, the "Leah" scene, fantasies on the television screen) can become rich if supported by a good HISTORY. <br /> <br /> I see in a few comments that people talk about this movie as a "gay" topic and I think they are wrong. Of course, "crushing" is presented by a newly-mature boy on an older boy, but the figure of Logan is much too young to decide on any particular sexual choices, and even in his masturbated masturbation fantasies we see all kinds of stimuli, sexual and non-sexual, how could we expect a very young boy like him. I think that 'depression', such as Logan, is common among young men who grow up and have a strong preference for female sexual partners.
