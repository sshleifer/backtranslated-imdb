I caught this movie on FX last night, and when I sat there watching it, it occurred to me that it could be the worst movie ever. Bad acting, bad pictures, bad sound, completely unbelievable fighting sequences, stupid characters. All this has become the most ridiculous movie I've ever seen. It was so bad, I was fascinated by the lack of something semi-competent, which I had to watch ... and they did a sequel!
