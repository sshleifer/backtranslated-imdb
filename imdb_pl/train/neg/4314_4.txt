I am deeply convinced that the best Oscars award ceremony in recent years took place in 2003. For two reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) Host Steve Martin was the smartest: "I saw the players help Michael Moore in his trunk limousine "and" I better not mention the gay mafia in case I wake up with a poodle in bed "<br /> <br /> 2) Surprise winners: No one had Adrien Brody down for the best actor (Genuine applause) or Roman Pola≈Ñski for the best director (Real jeers and boo), but they won <br /> <br /> Last year's award ceremony was not too bad, but there were few surprises and I was happy to see RETURN OF THE KING skip the prizes, even if they did not they were the best in the trilogy (FELLOWSHIP was a lot better), but what allowed the BBC to limit himself to Jonathan Ross, led several of his snoofant colleagues and pretended to be hilarious but. I was saying that Sky was doing a British television interview, I expected Barry Norman and Mark Kermode to be doing links, but instead it ended with Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne! Oh, gawd, is British television desperate for film critics (of course they are) I'm sure both Bob The Moo and Theo Robertson will be happy to go to LA to give an honest opinion on winners and losers <br /> <br /> Chris Rock was not so bad, but he is not Steve Martin, while the location resembled a sports hall with inserted seats! In my opinion, this is not a very brilliant arena. The main problem I had with the ceremony was the format of "small" Oscars given to the winners who sat in their seats! There is no such thing as a "small" Oscar and only because it is the best animated short film or best costume award, they are also deservedly the best film or the best director. All winners should be able to go to the podium. What an arrogant snob that becomes an Academy and I quite agree with the comments that this format is disgraceful and if it were not surprises, it could be the worst ceremony in history. As for the awards themselves. <br /> <br /> Best supporting actress - Cate Blanchett. An amazing surprise for the competitive category. <br /> <br /> The best supporting actor - Morgan Freeman. No real complaints, because Freeman is one of the biggest living actors in America. <br /> <br /> Best actor - Jamie Foxx. The most predictable night prize. Yawn <br /> <br /> Best actress - Hilary Swank. Big surprise, because everyone thought that Annette Benning would just win in academy politics, but Swank deserved it and gave the best speech of the night. <br /> <br /> Best director - Clint Eastwood. Big surprise, because everyone thought that Scorsese would get the prize only because he never won. Actually, I'm happy because if he did not deserve TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS, he did not deserve it for THE AVIATOR <br /> <br /> Best film - MILION DOLLAR BABY. Again another big surprise, because everyone thought that the academy would split the best director and best photo awards, while I thought that the Hollywood friendly THE AVIATOR story would make it a dead certificate for the Best Picture, while the controversial subject of the MDB would turn many voters off <br /> <br /> These rewards can illustrate that this year voters have decided to ignore the Oscar policy and honestly hand out prizes to people who deserve what they have not done in the past, I mean A BEAUTIFUL MIND beating FELLOWSHIP THE RING for God's sake! And for a long time the academy can vote with heads, not with hearts
