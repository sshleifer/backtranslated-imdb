The identical twin sisters Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen gained fame in a series of comedies such as "Two of a Kind", I've never seen them before, but I knew what to expect, but it was much worse. Essentially, Hunter's sister Charla (Mary-Kate) and Leila (Ashley) are in Rome on the summer apprenticeship program, but soon after starting work they are immediately released for a series of mishaps. But the man who owns the company in which he works, Derek Hammond (Julian Stone), gives them his job, and they slowly turn out to be useful assets and talented (fashionable) artists, and help stop the malicious man taking over the company. He also starred Leslie Danon as Jami, Derek Lee Nixon as Ryan, Ilenia Lazzarin as Dari, Archie Kao as Nobu, Valentina Mattolini as Heidi, Michelangelo Tommaso as Paolo and Matt Patresi as Enrico Tortoni. You could say that this movie was created to go directly to the video, working with the camera is completely unmatched and does not help when we want to admire the monuments of Rome. In fact, the background is the only good thing to watch, the twin sisters are the two most annoying stars around. I knew before I saw that they would not interest me in any way (even not so nice), it's a terrible breeze of rubbish. Pretty poor!
