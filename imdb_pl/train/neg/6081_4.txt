A typical Italian movie from the '70s, original and good music, but with some quirks, interesting but not fantastic photography, poor and sometimes confused plot (eg. The role of a wolf dog and where does the boy come from?) With a bad dialogue, nice atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The reason why it is still (relatively) well known and sought after are probably nude scenes (including typical pseudo-coitus from the 70s) with the participation of an 11-year-old girl with an older teenage boy (Eva Ionesco and Laura Wendel) - it is interesting from the sociological and political point of view that these representations of very young teenagers were considered acceptable and normal throughout Europe (and the US) 30 years ago, while now it is more than taboo. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around intimidating one girl (Laura) by the other two characters and her sex discovery, a fairly accurate representation of the aspect of teenage life. The protagonist Eva (Silvia) does not evolve until the very end of the film and seems to be very knowledgeable in erotic arts - there is no "maturing" for her: she is a very vain young girl who is already aware of her sexual charms, but is ultimately just used and ends the movie crying like a little girl who really is. The boy is a completely evil tyrant, while Laura is a very na√Øve and weak victim.
