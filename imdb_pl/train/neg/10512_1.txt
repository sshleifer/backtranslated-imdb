I rented this movie for one reason, Tom Savini, I respect his work, but it was a real profession, I had horrible stereotypes, half of the movie was naked women, so-called "fallen angels" running around, trying to behave horribly, oh and then they happened sporadic black and white scenes with "Blair Witch" cameras. Tom's character was a really terrible, terrible scenario. And you must love the lines they use. "Is there anyone there who is there, it's not funny" No, but your game was. I would like to give this move 0! Oh, the names of the heroes. Judd, Molly, Ally, Emilio, but they gave up Anthony, The Breakfast Club united in a forest of unforgivable acting.
