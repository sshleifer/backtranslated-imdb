I was an avid spectator, until I personally spent long cold hours helping to build a home for the White Family, but to be sick to see home a year later. All the beautiful rock landscapes were removed, the magnificent rocky footpath and fountain were removed from the front, all pine trees and pecan trees were cut out from the front, the sprinkler system was plucked out. Now looks like a disaster area. They do not live there anymore ... they live "in the city" and only go out for the weekend. I am disappointed to think about all the hours that the great people of Oklahoma passed on to these people and saw the result. The story we all saw on TV was not true ... do not believe everything you see and hear.
