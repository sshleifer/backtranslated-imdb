The TV guide described the plot of SEVERE ties, so: "The experiment on the severed arm does not work," so I immediately thought it would be an arm that has its own mind, as seen in THE BEAST WITH FIVE FINGERS or HANDS or someone who transplant hand, as in BODY PART. Both rooms are tried and tested to be more thoroughly tired and tested, so I was curious to see how manufacturers approach this story. Actually, I thought that at the beginning of the film they make a movie like PI, using black and white photography, but the creators seemed tired of this approach after 20 seconds and decided to make a splash comedy similar to THE EVIL DEAD. I have little to say about this, except that I did not like the movies "BAD DEAD" and I did not like BIG Ties and it seems really unjust that such films use indecent amount of rubber when the third world calls for a condom
