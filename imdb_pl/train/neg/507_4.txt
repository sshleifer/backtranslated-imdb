Unlike my fellow reviewers, I always try to find something redeeming in every film I see. Yes, the quality of dubbing and lighting is terrible, the acting is wooden, and the opening sequence is very misleading, what about all the lesser vampires of lesbians with dripping blood. Something must be lost in translating the word "Bloodsucker" from the Italian in the title; almost as if the producers originally intended to make a story about the Gothic Vampire, and then changed their minds, but they could not afford to give up the dramatic opening sequence, so they stuck it on the film anyway. <br /> <br /> This movie was made in 1975. It was recently released on DVD and has its own theater trailer, which in some ways is more daring than in the movie! Now anyone who buys this movie has probably already read its summary and knows what to expect - an Italian softporn from the mid-1970s. I bought it because it attracted me to Christa Nelli (most often referred to as "Krista Nell"). No cast of characters that frustrate most in many Eurosleaze movies from the 1960s and 1970s. He hoped that Imdb would show the cast of characters, because one of them hears their names in the film, but without a cast list, it's very difficult to link them to the actor. I think that Krista Nell played "Cora", but under this massive haircut, the costume and make-up is difficult, I certainly distinguish her. <br /> <br /> The actor's parts are mainly two-dimensional portrait and nobody really stands out. Maybe something gets lost in the process of dubbing. What were the positive sides? the music was moody and of course if you are a beautiful lesbian porn there. The external locations were good and I would like to know where the castle was filmed on his island. North or the Republic?) In 1902, so everyone is wearing costumes from the era. Some of the scenes I found were accidentally funny, especially those sex scenes !! In any case, nice romp.I rated it 4/10.
