Believe it or not, I have my own copy of the DVD of the "movie" that I bought at Walgreens for a large, big dollar. I'm still not sure if it was a well-spent dollar or a stupid dollar. <br /> <br /> Pretty amazing stage designs and costumes. Apparently a lot of effort and effort was put into creating them. Scenery designs are very Mexican in style. I liked them very much. And Santa Claus is impressive. One of the more impressive Santas in moviedom. <br /> <br /> I guess that the original purpose and purpose of this movie was to be something uplifting and joyful for the children's audience. But in some way it turns out to be quite insane. In fact, I'm stunned by how demented he is. <br /> <br /> Maybe English dubbing makes it seem so demented and bizarre. One of the reasons why I prefer to watch movies in the original language in which they were made and the use of English subtitles as dubbing often gives unintended alienness. The kids were at least called real childish voices, unlike women who pretend to be children, who seem to be very, very strange. <br /> <br /> Did you know that the devils in hell spend their free time dancing around ballet in long skirts? No? Until I watched the movie, no. He learns something new every day. <br /> <br /> Is this movie really worth watching? This is a toss. I can not recommend it to anyone with a clear conscience, because it is quite disturbing in my own strange way. However, his unintended oddity makes him worth watching. You decide what you intend to do. I do not know ... it made me feel uncomfortable seeing demons still doing wonderful ballet movements. Now it's just bad ...
