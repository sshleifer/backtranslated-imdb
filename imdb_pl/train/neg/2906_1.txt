-can contain spoilers ... but believe me, this movie breaks down from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> I entered this movie with high expectations. It was my fault. I have put too many actions into Steve Carell's previous record. 40-year-old virgin ... Little Miss Sunshine ... Office. And I made a mistake by coming to IMDb and seeing a user rating of 7.5 before going to the movie. In the past, it has always been a very good prognosis, but lately something is wrong. Last time I felt embarrassed and in this great pain in the cinema I watched "Blue Steel" in 1990. <br /> <br /> This one fluttered from the beginning to the end. The script was great. Awful letter all around. "Murderer of love"? "Love is a skill"? Whoever wrote this shit, he suffered from the same ailment that touched the writer (s) of American Beauty ... trying to waaaaayyyyyy too much. The whole film was filled with company moments, such as a horrible and fancy scene in the shower. Or a senseless / misleading aerobic scene. Or a terrible laundry scene. When you think something serious and / or real is happening, they throw themselves into one of those horrible moments. And it happens over and over again. <br /> <br /> And what about the character of Carell? Does the guy meet some bad guy in the book store and suddenly fall in love with his head? Let's face it. Their conversation sucked. They should both say goodbye after a few minutes. Pay special attention to the initial conversation, when you have the misfortune to watch this movie ... Carella character tries to say something that is absolutely random and not funny (I think the exact line was "this time when I was a kid" ... that's it seriously), but both laugh so hard that the coffee is going to jump out of the nose, the actors themselves looked like they were in pain, wondering why they are directed to what they are doing. <br /> <br /> Returning to things IMDb ... you have to come up with a way to stick to the promotional band from this site. I know it's impossible, but it's painfully obvious that the first 20 ratings / reviews were published by 12-year-olds or by flunky's hired by the studio. Family Stone ... if it's half 5, then it must be absolutely 2 ... and it moves.
