Garson Kanin wrote and directed this look at "contemporary Las Vegas" and the gap between generations, his first directing effort since the forties! David Janssen is somewhat ridiculous as the owner of a big casino that meets his son (Robert Drivas, who looks worryingly like older Jason Bateman). Janssen approaches each scene in the same way: defensively, with a chip on his shoulder. In this role cool and relaxed, he asks too much from Janssen, who barks at everyone like a grouchy, depressed husband (even chews Don Rickles and makes him cry!). His son, good at finding his own identity, makes fashionable comments about how young people look at Vegas (give them another ten years), and his disapproval of Dad's lifestyle causes friction. Brenda Vaccaro is adorable as a self-conscious secretary, and Edy Willaims has great fun as a showgirl at audition. Unfortunately, "Where It At" has nothing else to do, like outdated thoughts about ethics between adults and their children, quick pictures of T & A and fun-controlled satire bits in the world of high-stakes gambling - most of them have already been discussed, ad nauseum. ** with ****
