Quite possible. Like Francis Veber, one of the best comedians in the world (at least adhering to his native France), he managed to incorporate a film that is completely unobtainable, beyond the ordinary mortal man. It's not just that the heroes are so unlike or that the movie is so completely devoid of even the lowest form of joke: watching it is really painful physically, so endless parade of inept writing, acting and filming that you can not believe this work experienced - and talented - filmmakers. For the first time, almost an eternity spent in the cutting room and on the shelf in front of her cinema release "blink and miss" is the whole story. What were they thinking?
