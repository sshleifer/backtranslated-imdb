This movie was one of the worst I've ever seen. A clean drivel. If someone can make contact with the heroine or have empathy for her, he is beyond me. I felt that I was watching a case history of a schizoid individual with a borderline personality disorder. Just horrible. <br /> <br /> In his most generous light, this can be considered an attempt to produce and the "art" of the film - except that I could not find any art in it. <br /> <br /> If this woman lived in today's world, she would be taken to a psychiatric hospital and subjected to several days of treatment with antipsychotic drugs. That or just let me roam the streets and become a woman with bags. Why other characters in this movie have discovered that something in her is redemption - and tried to help her in her efforts to become an actress - appeals more to their pathology than any convincing traits that made her worth this effort.
