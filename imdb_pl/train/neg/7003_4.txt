(aka: TRINITY IS STILL MY NAME) This continuation looks like the outstanding European cash success of THEY CALL ME TRINITY was used, but this time the photos of Joseph E. Levine and Avco-Embassy wanted to use America also. It is a pity they did not go too far because Hill / Spencer photos were only marginal success in the United States, and this largely boring, dragged movie does not help. <br /> <br /> Trinity and Bambino swear by their dying father (Harry Carey Jr.) that they will become effective outlaws and look after each other. Later, they engage in weapons smugglers who smuggle weapons from the monastery and who mistakenly think they are a pair of federal agents. Despite some funny scenes in which this Trinity and Bambino are in an elegant French restaurant and they do not know how to get up, everything goes flat. Scenes with card sharks were also mildly humorous. <br /> <br /> The music from the first title sung by Gene Roman sounds like the beautiful pop song of Bobby Goldsboro, similar to the early 70s, while the music sounds throughout the movie are pretty good. I'm not sure I would like to buy a CD soundtrack, but some may. <br /> <br /> The film could break away for half an hour and it would not go on for so long. It seems that many scenery is chewing here. Actually, I lost interest about 2/3 of the way. The DVD is also awful, with constant noise in the soundtrack and poor print that looks like it should have been sent to this huge heap of scrap in the sky. <br /> <br /> A big step down from the previous movie. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
