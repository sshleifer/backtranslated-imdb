"Piece is Cake" is a defeatist, revisionist story of the worst kind, whose sole purpose is the unjust cruelty of the reputation (albeit fictional) of the pilots he presents. This left an extremely bad taste in my mouth. <br /> <br /> In "The Aircraft Monthly" from March 1989, Roland Beamont wrote a harsh condemnation of the way RAF Fighter Command was presented in the TV miniseries. A few of his comments are worth repeating: <br /> <br /> "In none of the squadrons I saw in action, there was no sense of defeatism and a complete lack of madness depicted in" Piece of Cake. " For a moment he would not be tolerated ... ... The prevailing atmosphere was closer to that of a good rugby club, though with more discipline. There was also no sense of "death or glory". The training insisted that we were there to defend this country, and now we had to do it - no more and no less. <br /> <br /> "There was no discussion about" courage "or" cowardice ". People either had courage or not - but mostly yes. We knew, however, that fear, we recognized him in each other and in mutual relations, we condemned him to control him, and then we started work ... <br /> <br /> "... I did not feel" glory ", but there was a sense of size and none of this had the slightest similarity to the "Piece of Cake". <br /> <br /> Beamont was, as he said, "a fighter pilot who, unlike the author and producer of the last TV series, was there at the time. "<br /> <br /> Beamont served in 87 Squadron in France as well as in BoB before becoming one of the leading representatives of both Typhoon and Tempest and post-war test pilot. <br /> <br /> "Piece of cake" is an absolute, completely incorrect representation of how the pilots work in the Hunting Command. It is nothing but a complete and complete disgrace ...
