The film My Name is Modesty is based on an episode that covers about one side of the tenth modesty of Blaise's novel "Night of the Morningstar". He describes the incident in which young Modesty (17 years in the book, in the mid-twenties in the movie) provides her leadership in the casino war. Because it is set before Blaise's real adventures, her trusted helper Willi Garvin is not in the movie. This is one of the main problems, because the relationship between Blaise and Garvin has certainly always been one of the fascinating aspects of the novel and the long run of the comic. Another problem is that the movie is simply unbelievably boring, because it really is one small episode that has been drawn into the script. The cast is fine, but Alexandra Staden is not as convincing as the heroine, or actually too old to play young Modesty. I have the impression that this movie was a quick and dirty solution, not to lose the rights to the Blaise franchise.
