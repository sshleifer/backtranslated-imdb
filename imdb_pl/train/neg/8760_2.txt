This film concerns allegedly non-establishment (aesthetically and sexually) who apparently can not resist basic romantic needs. Although some brilliant players are involved, including Jon Tenney, Timothy Olyphant and Cynthia Nixon, they are embedded in a childish script that is based almost entirely on clever dialogue; what is not. Nixon's role has the best lines, but he often finds himself in too fast, which is a temporary defect to be taken by the director. The grotesque culmination uses every available clich√©, released or not, and ends this gray comedy attempt accordingly.
