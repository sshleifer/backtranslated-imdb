I just did not get this movie ... Was it a musical? no ... but there were choreographies and dances in it ... <br /> <br /> Was it a serious drama ... it was not good enough. <br /> <br /> Is Whoopi Goldberg a high-class actor ... Definitely not. <br /> <br /> I had a hard time waking up through this chaotic movie. There is a message about apartheid and a "tribute" to students who died during the expropriation of students. But because the entertainment was very poor and as a documentary, it was worse. <br /> <br /> See for yourself, but in honesty I hated it
