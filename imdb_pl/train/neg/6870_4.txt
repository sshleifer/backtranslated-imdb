A film about goodwill about Sonja Horowitz (Ren√©e Zellweger), wife of the pious Talmudic scholar Mendel (Glenn Fitzgerald). who is deeply unhappy. Mendel's brother, Sender (Christopher Eccleston), sees this and hires her to work in the field where he is already a jewelry expert. He starts an affair with her, and when he spends time with a Puerto Rican artist, he throws her and reveals to the family, which closes her. There is a thread in which Sonja's dead brother talks to her and apparently takes the form of a magical beggar, but why is not it clear. Unfortunately, it is not clear in what is happening with Sonja why the Rebbe says that a fire broke out inside her and maybe it does not come from God and what it means, and what a magical beggar says her means. To some extent, history affects the fate of women in the ultra-orthodox community, and yet Sonja is not completely liberated. There is also a well thought-out concept of the redemption of another race by love. The title comes from the biblical definition of the value of a good woman, and it is Brent Sender who is quoted by Sonja. Zellweger is struggling with this part; she should be a midwestern Jewess, and sometimes her accent is flat, and sometimes it is the characteristic sound of Brooklyn. She's in the best shape when she's hard and takes control, but in the end the movie is a mess.
