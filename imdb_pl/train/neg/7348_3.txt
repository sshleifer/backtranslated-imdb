I was very disappointed with this film. The first movie of Waters I saw was the Mom series and I loved it. Then I saw Pecker and I loved it. Then I looked at the polyester and I really hated it. The only thing I liked about this movie is DIVINE. She / He had a lot of talent. I was really surprised. As a whole, I would not recommend this movie ...
