When people ask me what the worst movie I've ever seen is this movie. It is not even close to riffing on the MST3k level, nor watching at midnight in the theater, or even as a filler of the Disney night channel. The only time I ever wanted to jump out of a ride at Disney World (or in this case Disney / MGM Studios) is to grab Dick Tracey's jacket from the mannequin, tear it to shreds and hammer in the throat of tour guides saying "Eat it! Eat this damned cloak of darkness !!! "I've never been so bad for a movie, even" Nutty Professor II: The Klumps "or" Flash Gordon ". Do you want nice colors and photos? There is no love here. The reviewers are still saying "oh, but it also looks like a comic book", well, for me it is Gordito's color after a few weeks in the sun. It's so nice. Beatty wanders around this landscape jumping and talking to his watch, alone and occasionally with other actors, hoping someone will tell him what time the sequel will start shooting. To be honest, I only saw the movie once, but my pain is human, not God.
