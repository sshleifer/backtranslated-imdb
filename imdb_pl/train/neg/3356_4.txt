Shirley Jackson's novel "The Haunting of Hill House" is a romantic tale of horror that carries supernatural phenomena in an old mansion. The atmosphere is well prepared and the shivers are well organized. A haunting masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Aggregate from 1963 "The Haunting" remains closely related to the book, but also adds details to the plot. Fortunately, there are very few of them, so fear of the book and chills are even better on the screen. Black and white photography only adds to the madness of the film. Perfect! <br /> <br /> And then Jan de Bont did it. In 1999, the remake of The Haunting went to theaters - if you can call it a remake. Why did they have to make a remake of the 1963 film, it's a mystery in itself, but let's look at the movie itself. <br /> <br /> It starts on average, as most horrors do. The set used in Hill House is beautiful and strangely mysterious, and for a few minutes it looks like the movie will be quite honest. And then the first fear comes: a loose harpsichord wire cuts the woman's face (assistant Dr. Marrow). This is hilarious, and to tell the truth, almost tears. <br /> <br /> From now on, the movie simply moves down. The actor seems to be slightly wooden as the film progresses, and the character of Owen Wilson is particularly annoying (so it is such a relief when he cuts his head). <br /> <br /> The special effects practically create this movie, it's a pity, because most of them are incredibly tacky and look very outdated. There are many examples, so I will not worry about it. <br /> <br /> So, in general, along with hundreds of others, I strongly recommend watching the original aggregate, or, as an alternative, buy a novel by Shirley Jackson. But please, stay away from it. If you choose to watch it, watch it on TV (because many channels love to display this movie, not the original) or rent it cheaply, but please do not buy what you do. Do not waste your money! <br /> <br /> Final rating: 4/10
