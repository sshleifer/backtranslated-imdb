I am a big fan of old horror movies, and because I'm middle-aged, for me it's a movie made before 1970, most of which was made in the 1920s to the 1960s. I'm not a big fan of more modern horror movies, except for Creepshow 1, which I thought was great. I could mention those stories, but I really liked the monster in box history with Hal Holbrook, and the really clean guy was a great ending. All stories were great. So why did I like them so much? The heroes had a decent development, the lines were very clear about who was good and who the evil, terrifying fragments were strengthened with a close-up face frightened with fear, and the funny pieces were really fun! This sequel is either very missing these elements or are completely absent! I only write it after seeing it partially, because the movie was a complete waste of time and I turned it off to do other things like writing a movie review on IMDb.com, lol. When George Kennedy and old Dorothy Lamoure start charging the highest bills, he tells you something ... 4 out of 10. It's also difficult to find Romero's knowledge here, they had to tell him to standardize it to the PG standard (I do not know what it was rated but it looks like it's PG), and that's not a good thing for a movie where nothing else happens. It is displayed on the Encore television channel if you die (yuck yuck) to view it.
