"Witchery" may just be the most inconsistent and pitifully written horror of the 80s, but fortunately it has several compensating features, such as fantastic gore effects, thrilling musical score and great choices. To be honest, the script does not make any sense, but who cares when Linda Blair (with an exploded haircut) presents yet another girl possessed by evil powers, and David Hasselhof presents a handsome photographer (who does not seem to put him) a film that constantly contains bloody voodoo, stitched mouth, crucified crucifixion, cruel burns and abused, but really terrifying melody. Eight random people gather on an abandoned recreational island off the coast of Massachusetts. A young couple is to examine the dark history of this place; dysfunctional family (with pregnant Linda Blair, although no one worries about who the father is and what his whereabouts are), he is considering reopening the hotel and the delicious architect who just joined ordinary sex. Are they forced to stay at night in a crumbling hotel, and then suddenly the previous housekeeper? an aging actress or something that always dresses in black? it begins to delete them in various engaging ways. Everything is in some way related to the intro sequence showing that a woman accused of a witch jumps out of the window. Anyway, the plot is definitely less important in the Italian horror series, which began as an unofficial spin-off of "The Evil Dead". The atmosphere is sometimes disturbing, and the effects of makeup are undoubtedly the most advanced element of the whole film. There is something extremely morbid and disturbing in looking at a vulnerable woman hanging up a chimney and waiting for it to fry.
