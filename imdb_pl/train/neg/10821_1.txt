I read the novel Jane Eyre for the first time in 1986. At the time I saw the BBC version of Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. It was the perfect version and very similar to the book. Many years later I looked at this version and was terrified. William Hurt is completely confused like Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester is a passionate character in which William Hurt presents him as a lump of ice. The same applies to Charlotte Gainsborough. It was like watching two zombies together. It's a story about love and passion, but I have not seen it in this version. No, go back to the BBC version. We guarantee a great time.
