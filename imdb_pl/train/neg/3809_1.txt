This performance is simply annoying !!! I feel sorry for the actors for trying to be funny (especially Bob Saget), the song of laughter trying to hide the sad jokes, and the song "Awwww" appears in the most unnecessary moments. Too dramatic children are no exception, especially the Olsen twins. Also this show is a banal city. If you search for the word clich√©, they would read "Full House". Each story has a "lesson in life" that must be learned at the end. Brilliant speech makes everything better and even has the ability to make the kindest child suddenly realize the goodness. GASP is a pity that it is impossible in real life. I do not know how anyone could watch this program without stopping the characters' behavior or laughter. I'm shouting at the TV saying "THIS IS NOT SAUSIVE / SAD / CUTE" If life were really like that, the world would fall apart.
