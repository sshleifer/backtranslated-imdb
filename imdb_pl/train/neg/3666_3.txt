This is a very confusing movie. The film is very difficult to make, and the story just did not make sense. The Fury of the Wolfman was made in Spain and I think that when a movie is dubbed from one language to another, it does not translate exactly as it was originally marked. Maybe this is part of the problem, but I doubt if it can explain all the problems with this movie. Dubbing is very bad, and the voices do not match the character very well. The scenes are restless, there are a number of strange and irrelevant figures that are even more confusing to the viewer. What I liked about this film is the appearance of the wolf himself and the scenes in which he attacks. If they could collect all this and make sense, they could have something. Do not waste time on this.
