While watching this program you are not sure if it's history or acting is more annoying. First of all, the plot of each episode is very predictable, writers had to use every possible film, you can guess not only the general plot, but also the layout of the scenes and lines of each character, so that the presentation is a kind of collage from each police series. In addition, comes the "message" showing that the good are good, and the bad are bad and that at the end of the day good will win and that we all should love each other, be a better person and better citizens, all in the most apparent way. Actors, as carriers of this message and nothing more, will use a limited set of acting skills: smile "I am a good person carrying", worried look and "victory is our" body posture, while bad guys have "bad I am" frowning and looking "You caught me," and then the headband "I'm good for nothing and I should be removed from society" (this kind also sums up the overall development of each show). A real story or not, the show is rubbish, another evidence that the producers do not care about the viewers that we are all considered to be idiots. Well, this series makes every possible attempt to idioticize living brains.
