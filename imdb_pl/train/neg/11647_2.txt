BOSS BOSS is directed by Alberto De Martino; an Italian crime drama partly filmed in Hamburg, Germany. An easily forgotten movie. Even despite the good sequence of the car chase, this movement seems to be almost without purpose. The new Don takes over a powerful mafia family and fights for his own life. The unwritten laws and ethics of the mafia code make it difficult to trust anyone, especially when the stakes are millions of dollars. Brutality and violence are born in the same way. This can not be put on the shelf with real epic gangsters. The look of the film brings back the memories of the American drive-in tariff. Even the popular American actor Telly Savalas can not increase the caliber of this crime drama. Antonio Sabato also performs with: Paola Tedesco, Guido Lollobrigida, Serio Tramonti and Piero Morgi.
