So what's the big fuss about the fact that INDIANA JONES wants to be when you have an actor who is cast as a fictional guy from adventure stories who does not want to go on an adventure? Whoever wrote the script for JAKE SPEED was probably released, but for whatever reason, this movie is very excited! It does not mean that there is no action, but look at the dark side of the image. There is no similarity to INDIANA JONES or other emotions associated with adventures that contain goats and narrow escapes, and JAKE SPEED was promoted in this way with clever propaganda, so that I and a few others will be interested! Besides, I've never heard of a guy, so who needs his attention?
