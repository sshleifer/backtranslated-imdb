It's one of those movies I remember being in a tin for years before something happens. I think it is not terrible, but it is not good either. Alec Baldwin was quite good, but the plot is weak at best. The cast is pretty good at what you're giving, but again you're only as good as the script. Baldwin directing this, although I could swear that he did not direct all of this, I thought I read somewhere, or that many repetitions were not bad, but he definitely has some potential there. Although his work on "30 Rock" is nothing short of brilliant and should take him a little longer. I just hope that the show will appear gracefully a la Seinfeld, but maybe not even that long. 9 years it went. So if you want to see a movie that you do not get a lot from, but you do not really hate it, it's for you. I do not remember when the last movie was wrapped up until it was finally released and only on DVD. It was nice to see Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins again because their excellent, but few people saw The Edge. Now choose this great movie to get real entertainment.
