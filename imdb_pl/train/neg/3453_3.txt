It seems that more attention was given to IMDb reviews of the film than it went to the source. <br /> <br /> Here's the unqualified review: <br /> <br /> Only if you think nothing will happen, it does not. <br /> <br /> Dress it in any way, it's a boring movie, full of uninteresting characters who are not interested in anything. <br /> <br /> if you want to convince a sensitive emo stick, that you are so deep, man. <br /> <br /> You can not view this for your own pleasure. <br /> <br /> Unless. <br /> <br /> You are. <br /> <br /> Pretentious.
