Almost a two-player game, so the dialogue and lead performances will be important. None of them are particularly good. It can be stronger if it was first created as a two-player game and then converted into a movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a whirlwind vampire who seems a bit autistic falls in love with a stripper (as a result of too much porn watching in his poor house). She wants her to tell him about daylight. It would be better to find someone with daily work or someone who excels in painting the picture with words like a poet, but then he may not have a hot body. <br /> <br /> do whatever he wants (and he's not terribly good at it), he's going to feed on her at 6 am when the sun rises. Much is happening with this term, despite the fact that he says he can go without feeding, it will only increase his hunger. Additionally, he claims he can not let the stripper go because he knows about him, but he lets many other people go to find out who he is. There are many inconsistencies. <br /> <br /> Why is this vampire deciding to live in a house so poorly killed that the light of streetlights and neighboring buildings is poured in as if it were a day, I'm not sure. At all times in the world one would think that he would do a better job or repair a little space. He is certainly not a wealthy vampire. <br /> <br /> This is supposedly a remake and I'm curious about the original version of this, Dance of the Damned. Although it was directed by Katt Shea, and the other films she directed for Corman (Stripped to Kill, StK II) were very bad.
