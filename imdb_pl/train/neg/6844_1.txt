I have a copy of this on VHS, I think they (TV networks) should play it every year for the next twenty years. Let us not forget what was and remember not to do the same mistakes again. Like placing some people in the director's chair, where they do not belong. This movie "Rappin" is like a vaudeville musical for those who can not sing or play. This movie is just as entertaining as trying to teach blind people to run a city bus. <br /> <br /> John Hood, (Peebles) just got out of jail and returned to the old quarter. Of course, in serving time, it was a pretty good crime of necessity. John comes back to the old street and is greeted by children who the older ladies and his peers dance and sing along the way. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it if I was sentimental, and if in truth someone smoked a medicinal pot prescribed by a doctor for glaucoma. Anyway, this is a poor director, script, action, and even production (I never thought I was sitting in this way) satire of life in the ghetto with "Hoodie". Although it seems to me that this is a redeeming part of history, thanks to sequences of gang fighting and dance numbers, his friends take care of their neighbors and want to save the ghetto from destruction and cleaning up. <br /> <br /> Forget about Sonny's teaspoon, Mario could have won an Oscar for it compared to this rap. Well, if you want to laugh at stupidity and embarrass three-quarters, drink first. <br /> <br /> And please, watch responsibly. (No stars, better luck next time!)
