If you have read the book - do not put high hopes, if you have not done so - read it and never watch the movie. It is strange that Toby Young was very involved in writing the script (as he himself claims in the e-mail script of the book). Because the film is very different from the book. <br /> <br /> It seems that the movie is aimed at - taking a rather thought-provoking and engaging song that combines philosophical ideas with the usual funny sarcasm and simplifies them so that everyone can understand - achieves with perfection. The movie is full of bad and cheap jokes that are suitable for comedy series and has lost any meaningful message it could have. <br /> <br /> It's better not to see.
