Spoilers in front of you - handle carefully. <br /> <br /> My main problem with this movie is that when Harry knows the identity of the three blackmailers - with relative ease - he continues to deal with their demands. And then the whole scene with a kidnapped wife decides to connect her classic car to the explosion (with money), which makes us do quite a jump of logic. <br /> <br /> Okay, so he wanted his romance with Cini to not be visible in public because of his wife's involvement in the DA campaign. I see this, but why not hire someone to hit this turn a bit, and even kill them as soon as he determines that there is no actual evidence of blackmail (eg Cini's body?) It was quite an interesting film for the first 2/3 of this. After that it falls apart.
