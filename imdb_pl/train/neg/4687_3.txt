SPOILERS (THERE IS NO REPRESENTATION IN THE FIRST TWO MINUTES OF THE FILM) <br /> <br /> Robin Williams is pretty good at it as a friendly, lonely, emotionally inhibited loser Sy. He creates a very human, even sympathetic psycho and really disappears in the form - it is not a small feat for such a recognizable performer. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the rest of the movie is such a loss. Supporting performances (and performers) would not look out of place in soft-core porn (it does not help every character, but Sy is made of 100% cardboard). Sometimes it seems that the director tries to thwart the tension: from the first moments we know that a) that Sy is a complete job, b) that he survives, c) that he will be caught by the cops in the end. We just have to think about hows and whys, and the answers given are not that interesting. <br /> <br /> The story is sober and invented, and contains a few pointless moments (for example, a husband is angry at his wife for her dear likes, although he seems to spend all his free time at a local supermarket with discounts ). About two-thirds of the way, Sy is doing something so stupid that he wonders how much he cares about his great revenge program. And the ultimate stereotypical explanation of his psychosis, straight from "Peeping Tom," is awful. <br /> <br /> Dialog is absolutely the worst. It is not overwritten or clumsy, unbelievable or otherwise bad, which could be considered funny, even for lovers of bad movie. Instead, each line is clean, disgustingly functional - it's as if the director gave the outline of the plot to the copywriter from the newspaper and said: "Hey, I need a working script on the subject - in an hour". I really wanted to scream. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be a return to the suburban guarded thrillers of the eighties and nineties ("The Hand That Rocks the Cradle", e.g.), and although it is certainly unpleasant, it is never so scary. Sy fetishism sometimes makes you feel uncomfortable, but in itself is not enough for the movie to work. After all, the lack of craftsmanship from everyone involved, with the exception of Robin Williams, sinks this one. 3 out of 10.
