The only good thing about "People I Know" is that it serves as a great example of movies in which Al Pacino should avoid performances. The first big failure I had was the way Pacino tried to present an accent from Georgia; sometimes it was weak and unattractive, while in other segments it seemed too exaggerated. The dialogue and interaction of the characters were horrible along with a weak story. The support staff did an amazingly cursory job to make the film interesting, and within an hour I did not see any signs of a strong plot. The story is really boring and I had to hit my face several times to wake up. <br /> <br /> This movie will surely bore you ... avoid at all costs.
