This film is a portrait of a half-spastic teenage boy Benjamin, who must visit a boarding school because of his poor grades in mathematics. He did not have the best experiences in life before and had serious problems with self-esteem. After a hard start in his new school, he begins to make friends, falls in love with a girl and makes some American songs. <br /> <br /> In addition to some of the comedy elements, the film is told very seriously, focusing on Benjamin and his problems. <br /> <br /> If you do not like this outline of history, save time and watch something else. If you do, remember the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Benjamin is totally lost. Whatever he does, he's doing it terribly bad, and then he is self-pitying all the time. For me, he was not such a "lovely loser", for whom you can feel compassion and laugh at him. Instead, he and his behavior really annoyed me, and my own teenage years were not so far behind that I could barely stand. experience that characters are simply not (maybe with the exception of Janosch). And yes, I know that this movie is based on an auto-biography written by a 17-year-old - but with some experience with German schools and German youth, I do not believe him. <br /> <br /> 3) Showing sexual awakening is really an important thing for a movie with this topic. I doubt, however, whether teenage boys are doing "Ejakulat na ciasteczku" - a competition in which everyone has to hit a cookie with his sperm during mass masturbation in the forest, and the loser must later eat a wet cookie. Although it amused me a bit, it is neither amusing nor stressing the serious attempts of this film. <br /> <br /> 4) There is a sub-thread about the family of Benjamin and his father cheating on his wife - still, I do not know why he is there and where to put it. It just bored me. <br /> <br /> Well, personally, I hated the movie for being Benjamin, without a message, an idea, a schematic, no matter how he could not be dramatic and serious. However, I can imagine that some people may consider it sensible and moving. If you liked "The Other Sister", you'll probably like it too. I hated both. <br /> <br /> 17-year-old boys should not write autobiographies, and if so, it's not the best idea to make this movie. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10.
