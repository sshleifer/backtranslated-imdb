East Palace, West Palace reminded me a bit of The Detective, with Frank Sinatra as a policeman, and William Windom is a boy. I think it is a progressive film for China, but it also captures myths about gay femininity: a lot is said about Chinese myths in which men take on women's roles. The film focuses on an effeminate man who desperately wants to be dominated and wounded by macho. He floats in the park with no worries - he hopes he will be taken by the officer to the station. And it happens. Then he tells the officer the whole story of his life, subjected to gentle torture: forced to squat for some time, handcuffed, slapped. That's what gay wants, and indirectly gay questions the image of the cop as a male man. The story of gay life (including flashbacks) is bearable, but when it begins to describe old Chinese myths and dramatic works, the film becomes unbearable. It becomes a cry of mercy for gays from China who only want to play a traditional role in Chinese society. I'm sorry, I can not relate.
