The fifth "Black Emanuelle" I've seen has the potentially most intriguing feature line, as is the case with a fearless reporter investigating a white slavery / prostitution racket that takes her from San Francisco to Rome to Macau and returns to her own hometown, New York! The film is populated by former veterans of the series, who inexplicably play completely different roles, namely Ivan Rassimov (appearing here as the head of the UN committee for Third World countries!), Karin Shubert (as a feminist rival reporter) and Don Powell (as a Rassimov chauffeur) ). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, as usual with this type of film (despite showing it in the middle of the night), it is heavily edited and is a particularly graphic scene (described in "Stracultr"), in which the Asian slave trader gains his favor when it's sodomized by a dog, you can not see it anywhere !! Still, the shocking sequence in the movie, when a clever politician is cheating a pair of girls (including, of course, Gemser and Shubert) for a meeting at midnight under a New York bridge with a group of tramps (this way gets their votes, take it!) - with his high colleagues from the company looking around - it seems almost untouched. <br /> <br /> The most absurd element of this entry - apart from the Gems, it tends to be completely broken every time it enters the house (even before the perfect strangers) - or its trip to India to conduct an interview with a charlatan / Guru (George Eastman is supposed to look like Christ!) Who has found a way to extend the period of cooperation into infinity; of course, when Emanuelle calls him, he ends up premature ejaculation ... !!
