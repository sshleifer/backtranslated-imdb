Taking into account the limitations of this film (The whole film in one setting - a music studio - only about 5 or 6 actors in total) should be better done. If you have such limitations in creating a movie, how can lighting be so bad? And the actors were horrible, they said hair under the actors in the movie, except that it was a nice movie, it did not matter. Well, he tried, but he really fails. <br /> <br /> He tries to appeal to himself in several parts, but the lines were delivered so badly that it was just bad. And the main character Neal, what a pathetic slack. Clearly like 10 people in general created this "movie" and everyone knew each other, and it was probably a real rock band they had, but unfortunately these people really have no idea how scary they are around. This was done in 2005. But they all look like they have nothing to do with the pre-grunge age. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I did not pay to see it (Starz on Demand delivers it again!), but he was titled "The Possessed", not Studio 666, it does not matter what you do with the title, can not help me. It could be a much better recording - there is no excuse for this bad film making, when you have obvious limited parameters that filmmakers had when they did, working within these limits, you should do things that you can control, you can work with the best you can . Instead, they decided that mediocrity would be good enough. And this music video, wow, it was bad, I was going through it fast. <br /> <br /> So 2/10 is fair, if you're in the whole b-movie shit, I suppose you'll go and see it.
