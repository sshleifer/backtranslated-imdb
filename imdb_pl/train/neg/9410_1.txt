As long as you can suffer! If you like watching people waking up, getting up, getting dressed, having a shower, preparing dinner, watching, having sex in the dark and then going back to bed ... if you like cheesy apartments, narrow bedrooms and kitchens, long minutes of silence ... If you like to be bored for two hours, feeling the thrill of "real, intimate false art", you will like it. But if not, just try to see a good movie, there are thousands. "As long as you are here," but do we want to stay? This German film received the prize of the gay festival in Turin: Italian journalists still do not understand why the jury made such a bad decision, because the festival presented many talented films. Can he be nice with a German because they often do not receive rewards? Well, "The Lives of Others" did ... but this one is perfect, but not gay. So maybe it's a fashion issue. Germany are again "in"? It does not matter what? Or maybe just to take a look at some of the directors?
