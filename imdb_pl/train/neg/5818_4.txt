--- what happened to these unpopular people. Alan Arkin was, as usual, unaware and simply going through the role. The kids are all messy. Mariesa Tomei probably wants that role never came to her mind. And what are Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno doing in this really bad film? If you enjoy watching losers who are sinking in their dysfunctions and are not trying to improve in any way, this is your movie. Everyone else, go for a walk, read a book or see something else. <br /> <br /> Jane
