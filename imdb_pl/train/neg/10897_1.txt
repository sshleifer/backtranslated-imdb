It was probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life !! It was stupid, there was no plot, and the special effects were funny! And I've never seen such a bad thing in my life! The only good part of this movie were all hot guys (especially Drew Fuller). I do not know what those people thought when they made this movie !! I did not even want to finish all this because you got to this point in the movie where the guys are in bed. I mean, it was like sick and twisted kiddy porn! I would advise anyone who has heard about this film and was interested in watching it, just to forget about it and find another movie to watch! I was very disappointed !! The whole movie was, in my opinion, a total waste of time.
