Honestly, it also seemed like seven hours of boredom. What is this? What is it about Will Smith that I can not stand it anymore? It seems to me that it just seems too hellish to be taken seriously and get an Oscar. I understand what attitude it is, but if it does not get new acting lessons, I will never see him win. He has a huge name and is therefore generally confused with being a talented and diverse actor. He just does not. I give him recognition that I tried so hard and I was able to cry in one fell swoop. That's all. <br /> <br /> Seven pounds was something like an eyerolera to me from the very beginning. Talking about suicide 911 in no way intrigued me. I was not interested in why he was calling in his own suicide. There were no surprises. The best I can say is that Will Smith and Rosario Dawson had some decency in screen chemistry. Besides, I do not know her name, but the Latin woman did a great job with her role of a terrified and beaten wife. Woody Harrelson had a very limited time on the screen, but I would say he stole the program when he was present. <br /> <br /> In total, it was just an extreme storyline. I could not help asking myself why I cared about any of these people. I have never been sorry about Tim / Ben. He killed himself with a medusa? Is the only one who survived the accident in 8 people? Geewiz.Nie seen any of those coming ... <br /> <br /> 5/10 is quite generous.
