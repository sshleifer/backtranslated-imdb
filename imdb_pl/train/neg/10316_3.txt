Honestly, when I first heard about this program, it may be a bad idea to make a show that makes Muslims use racist jokes on themselves, but it's exactly opposite. I realized that a show that can help people understand that if a Muslim uses a real word in reality, it does not mean that it is a terrorist matter. It also shows how people give Muslims a bad reputation because they play their stereotype, watching the performances of ordinary people realize that although everyone can be bad Muslims, it does not mean that we are all bad, we just try to live 1 day after day, how difficult it was for Amair to get on the plane and use words such as "Blow up" or Yaser, saying that we would blow away the competition and people took it the wrong way. Being a Muslim, I know that such things usually do not happen, but they do it and many people think bad about Muslims, Afghanistan or Iraq, it's not right. people will see how we are treated badly by watching this program and it can force them to think about how it works. I am glad that such a program appeared in the air. Many programs show that Piotr Muslim people as terrorists, many people find them funny for my opioire, it's OK to do it now, and not because much is laughing about who we are to say that you can not to laugh at it. unjust, but it is often done and really gives Muslims a bad name.
