I can sit in this movie once, but I doubt that I managed to survive for the second time. Softly entertaining mainly for the physical presence of Lindsay Lohan. Fun of Matt Dillon (think Something about Maria) and the reappearance of the more serious acting Michael Keaton. This is not a funny game, which was The Love Bug, but it is possible to watch. One of my main obstacles in the film was the fact that Herbie mostly evolved into the antics of R2D2. I was bored with the effects of the eyes of the headlights about the second time 30 times when they were used, and the bent front fender triggered the same reaction. See it with your kids, or "one-lined bracket" of children and do not expect much from this movie. <br /> <br /> _X
