The film looks great on paper. A romantic comedy in which a crazy lover is drawn into the smuggling thriller, should be a cross gold, especially with this great Romance cast. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid that Lawrence Kasdan just gives his two stars too much, but they are also hanging out. Adam Brooks's script may be guilty, but one would expect it to be better than Kevin Kline of A Fish Called Wanda. Instead, two ping-pongs from each other, and an unbelievable blossoming romance will never be reconciled in a satisfactory manner with the reason why any of them are in a hurry in France. <br /> <br /> Jean Reno fits great as a policeman - a heart and I think he wants him to be a star with a part. Please note that he did these remakes from Pink Panther! So maybe he was fine with this ... 3/10
