The social comment was exaggerated, and the mystery itself was built and solved by a series of unlikely coincidences that were completely unbelievable. In Fitz's personal life, nothing has changed over the last decade, which makes him interesting. <br /> <br /> I even had a problem understanding why he was complaining about his stay in Australia compared to the ability to solve the puzzles he has in England. Can he not interfere with the Australian police? It seems that this is a very artificial conspiracy to involve him in a criminal investigation. <br /> <br /> These last episodes of the original series were quite melodramatic and unbelievable, sometimes bordering on stupidity, and this one raises this cloak rather than returning to the theme of the first series. Sad.
