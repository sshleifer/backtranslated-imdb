Acting in the film is really well done, but the film is as slow and as boring as it becomes interesting, everything slows down, until a serious stop. I'm glad to see Sam Rockwell in it, he did a great job, like the other actors I mentioned, but man ... is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Perhaps in the short film this movie would be good, but otherwise avoid it. This film has so much filler that it makes the Twinkie cake jealous. <br /> <br /> I never, never go out on movies, but watching this at home with my family, I left. Yes, it was so boring. Apparently, my comment does not have enough lines to publish, so here's some more filler. I think I was inspired by the movie I just watched.
