Scary Movie. If there is one Turkish film that you should avoid in 2006, it should be Banyo. What a waste of time. Apart from a few cheap laughter, this movie does not achieve anything, nada, zilch, nil. Dialogue is cheap, and sexual stereotypes are everywhere. The director has to watch more films before he starts directing his own. The red heads of a woman show examples of what an actress should not do. If you want to learn how not to act, this is a perfect example of bad action. The only good thing I can say about the movie is waiting, waiting, I can not say anything good about it. I really did not like writing about it. Jesus!
