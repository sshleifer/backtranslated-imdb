I've seen horrible horror movies in those days, and although it's not the worst, it's definitely in the bottom half. The script starts with OK. The young doctor goes to the hospital as an intern, hoping that he will manage to get a better job for him and his future wife. Lovely what? The film then goes straight to the toilet when you realize that something is killing patients. It turns out that there is a demon in the basement that gathers human souls. The task of 1 doctor, 1 nurse and 1 bodyguard in the entire hospital staff is to drag this mental patient down, a ritual that almost only involves cutting out the tongue and then leaving the haunted house in the likeness of a demon exit and stealing his soul thanks to the magic of trashy special effects. At the moment the movie is so absurdly stupid, I begged it to end. There is still an hour left. It looked like a half-hour episode of "Tales from the Crypt," which somehow was stretched out for an hour and a half. From Tina Lister performing his best incarnation of John Coffey (The Green Mile) to Tracy Scoggins playing the stereotypical icy nurse Ratchet, this movie fails on every possible level. I gave these 2 stars only for two reasons. 1) His fianc√© is quite hot, he eased the pain a bit at the end and 2) The film actually looks good, much better than the current trend of horror movies created with high quality wal-mart home cameras. <br /> <br /> Finally avoid this turd, even if you have a Blockbuster movie (which I do and still feel cheated). As a bonus drinking game, you and your friends take pictures every time Matt Stasi (Dr. James Bishop) shakes his head during a conversation. You will be drunk 15 minutes in the movie.
