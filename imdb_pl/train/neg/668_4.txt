So Prom Night was supposed to be a horror movie and a thriller. I am a big friend and I was afraid to see this movie at the beginning, but when I see it, it's not a horror film or a thriller. <br /> <br /> Basically, making fun of the movie in my place was so predictable. You can predict what will happen next. The young actors were alright in playing their characters, but I must say that the killer was definitely at the top of the game - playing smart. <br /> <br /> Yes, I will give props for the story, because it was good, but it is not exciting or scary. There were almost zero scenes "jump to the seat." So do not waste ten dollars seeing it in cinemas, wait until it appears on DVD.
