I can not believe that the blockbuster brings this movie. It was so bad. I was completely cheated with box art. IT WILL NOT BE AUTHORIZED !! It is not worth your time. I promise you. I do not know if the positive reviews of this movie were a joke or something. I am very disappointed. :( <br /> <br /> The description on the back of the box does not even match up! The girl who is wearing voodoo is a stripper.The summary on the back says she is only 17. People who write a movie description even try to watch it ! "These positive reviews must have been a joke that simply had to be. And do not even start telling me a story compared to the title, or the fact that the whole movie was made in two places, or that the cops did not even have close real uniforms. Say what the uniforms of the cops care about! Compared to the rest of the movie, the uniforms were in place. <br /> <br /> This movie is an insult to the zombie genre and all its fans.
