this film, despite its "independent" status, is a silly Hollywood version of the bland relationship of mother and daughter. at the beginning it was not so bad, but somewhere in the middle of the movie - more or less at the time when my daughter comes out with this guy, I think - it turns into a cheese movie connecting mothers and daughters. I'm sorry, but I do not know any mothers who have such a relationship with their daughter ... it's probably better.
