Tim Robbins and John Cusack are two actors whom I appreciated during their career, and that was the only reason I decided to watch this movie. Well, I can only say that I regret it completely! These two great actors humiliate themselves by doing a series of irrelevant, unimaginable and bizarre to extreme (not that it's bad on their own) sketches that are supposed to make people laugh, but they do not. The only reason I can think is that the director was their friend and they decided to support his film by performing in it - I can not think of anything else because this movie is SO THAT Dear! Fortunately, Tim Robbins and John Cusack have never let me down. I recommend that you avoid this video unless you want your opinion on the two actors to be broken.
