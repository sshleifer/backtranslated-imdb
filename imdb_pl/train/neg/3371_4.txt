Incredibly unlikely and stupid potboiler, which has at least a salutary, clear location photo, but it is too unbelievable to generate a lot of tension. I was hoping that Stanwyck would not make it back in time, because she was saddled with a wet, in many respects, husband, and she also had an idiot child. But the nagging question remains ... what kind of wood did the support for the pier get if the broken piece broke down? Stanwyck, always spotlessly professional, does all he can with the material, but it's trivial.
