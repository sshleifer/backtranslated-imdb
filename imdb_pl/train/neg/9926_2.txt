I just watched the 30th anniversary of the release of Burning Saddles, one of my favorite times !! The TV pilot Black Bart stinks. The plot did not exist, and acting was not good. It was, of course, an attempt to make a profit from the success of the Burning Saddles and television programs that succeeded in making large films appeared, but this one would never work. Given that for many years TV would not even play farts when they broadcast a movie, you can not imagine that they could put a program on TV using the word "N". On the other hand, I enjoyed seeing many familiar faces !!! There were many actors / actresses that I recognized from other concerts over the years. I had to write down all the names and do some searches. It was funny. I was arguing with my mother if Steve Landesberg was with Barney Miller or Mash. I won! :)
