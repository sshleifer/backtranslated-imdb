Mark Hamill should feel embarrassed about CORVETTE SUMMER! This time he uses a new type of "strength" to regain possession of his dream machine, the bright red "Vette". It seems that another sour teen in the first half-hour turns back towards the wrong direction. Tasks related to writing and directing are frighteningly difficult, with a few scenes that can not be imagined. In any case, you expect it to happen, and you smell the smell of the mix from the late 70's. Only a former novice such as Annie Potts could easily steal the show and save this poor movie from repositories! Her impractical but delightful personality keeps you interested for good, and this is the best opportunity to see her in a bathing suit. Well done to Anna! I'm sorry, Mark! I think this time Power was not with you.
