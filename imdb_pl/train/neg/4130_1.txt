The best candidate for the worst film ever made. The figure of Joanna Pakula seems to have an IQ. 3, which is only one less than the writer and director. The scenario would not be in the high school writing class; "Jokes" are underage; corny concept. These performers were obviously desperate for work. I stayed until the end to see if it would be worse. Did that. Life is too short to spend any part watching this movie.
