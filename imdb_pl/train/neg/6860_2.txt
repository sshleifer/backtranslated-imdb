except for the fact that there are crazy people and there are religious nuts there. <br /> <br /> Characters basically do not make sense most of the time. <br /> <br /> The film has no real beginning, neither ending nor explaining much. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a young man with the unlikely name of Hazel Motes, apparently returning from the internship in the army. <br /> <br /> He goes to a two-story house, which is in an extreme ruin, with camouflaged windows. He goes into the house, walks and finally writes a note he leaves. This scene is not happening, and we do not learn anything more about the house or its history. <br /> <br /> It is never explained who this house belongs to or where people have gone, but we have the impression that Hazel probably lived there once. <br /> <br /> Hazel decides to go to the city. Why - we do not know. Upon arriving in this city, she writes down the name and address she sees on the bathroom wall, and visits this woman who is a surprisingly fat whore. He sees her for a moment, and then apparently does not see her anymore. Like everything else in this film, nothing happens and serves no purpose. <br /> <br /> A young man named Enoch, tries to make friends with him, but Hazel really is not interested, though they are still crossing paths. br /> <br /> Enoch is as crazy as you can. One of his habits is to go to the zoo and stand in front of the cage where the chimpanzees are and speak offensive to them. <br /> <br /> We never really know why Enoch behaves like him, or why Hazel behaves like him, except that Hazel had an overdose of a terrifying, fundamentalist religion through his grandfather. <br /> <br /> Enoch is later bewitched by a man who dresses up in a gorilla suit and manages to get a gorilla to get out of it and then runs in it. <br /> <br /> The filbert, which is rather tightly clothed and seems to be in constant border rage, does a bit of street preaching. I got the impression that he was trying to free himself from the untruth of the religion that had been drilled to him. <br /> <br /> He has several meetings with the preacher and his daughter, although their interactions do not really do any special point, and there is no feature line. <br /> <br /> In the end, Hazel succumbs to religious zeal and begins to hurt himself. <br /> <br /> It's a very strange movie. Interesting in its strangeness, but otherwise it has absolutely nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> The cast does a great job, but this movie does not provide any point of view or plot. <Br /> <br /> In the movie from time to time there are also characters with the letter N without connection to the rest of the dialog. <br /> <br /> 2 stars
