Hines and Goforth, the perpetrators of this crime, start with the wrong step, assuming that Wells wrote a gothic horror and that all his lines are to be taken seriously. It's just not true. Wells was the heir to the Enlightenment, and his main concern was that Victorian complacency could leave the British unprepared for the world that new technology could produce - both good and bad. <br /> <br /> Two horrible consequences - the character is portrayed as a naughty screamer (I was reminded of Fay Wray in the original King Kong), not a man fighting for the irony of an incredible catastrophe; and the dialogues from the "Victorian verse" spoke seriously that Welles apparently had to be on the cheek. <br /> <br /> All this looks suspiciously like Ed Wood with a huge budget, which is wasted on CGI effects - which by the way is so poorly implemented, the cartoon factory Warner Bros. from the 40s, she could do a better job. (Gobs of splattered blood looked like red balloons, I expected them to sail away at any moment.) Think about the Yellow Submarine, as the old EC comic book did. <br /> <br /> What's worse, the loss of the motive that robs the movie for any reason. Although the creators of this film restore history to the Victorian era, they completely miss the amazing way Wells' history predicted many horrors of the First World War - this fact was not noticed by Wells himself, who after the war transformed the motif in the shape of things to come. <br /> <br /> With no motive, there are only a lot of people running around, thrown on balloons from cartoons, when they do not try to high school production drunk student prescribed for Macbeth. <br /> <br /> Really, this is the worst, most senseless piece of nonsense I've had since my friend thirty years ago convinced me to see the Eastern European cartoon 'Fantastic Planet'. This movie was so pretentiously boring, my friend and I and two strangers gave up laughing at him halfway and sat on the screen playing cards, using the film as a light, through which you can see the cards - its only usefulness, how far, how anyone of us could say. <br /> <br /> But I already have electric lighting in my apartment, so I did not need this Wells suppression for nothing. <br /> <br /> Do not avoid this movie - steal every possible copy (you do not pay a penny) and burn each one. God, in His wisdom, created us for this very purpose.
