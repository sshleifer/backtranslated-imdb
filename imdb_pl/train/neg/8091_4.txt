(This is a review of the later English edition of Disney, starring Alison Lohman, Patrick Stewart and coworkers.) <br /> <br /> I really wanted this movie to be good. Really, really. I'm a big fan of Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, and after seeing all the great reviews about this earlier Miyazaki movie, I really wanted to see it. But I was shocked to say that the quality of the movie was shocked. These later films boast well-crafted themes, three-dimensional characters and the best film music from ... well ... ever. This movie just does not come close. <br /> <br /> But we might as well start with positive aspects. Like all Miyazaki movies, this one is still very ingenious, with a bizarre fantasy / sci-fi scene, in a post-apocalyptic world dominated by species of insects. Nausicaa can also boast of much better animation for other films from that time. (though not as beautiful and fluid as Miyazaki's later films) And the English voice is quite well done. <br /> <br /> But this movie ... just ... it's not ... good ... All the characters are cardboard - from sweet, sweet little Nausicaa, to the absolutely evil Tolmekians, to everyone in between. When you see each of them for 30 seconds, you've seen everything. And the fact that the plot is just spinning does not help. <br /> <br /> Then there is music ... Hisaichi is my favorite film composer, but Nausicaa does not do him justice. Half of the music is the 80's keys on overdrive, and it usually comes in and out so suddenly that it distracts the eye and does not help. I suspect that Hisaichi was told to compose a lot of music before even seeing the picture. <br /> <br /> But wait! There is great news with this movie, right ?! Save the environment! It is a pity that this movie hits you in the head like a sledgehammer. There is a scene in which Nausicaa hugs a tree. Not really. I am not joking. <br /> <br /> I am sorry to say how bad this movie is. But for some reason, all other IMDb reviews seem to adore. And when characters have to talk to each other in extended sentences to say what's going on, it's bad. <br /> <br /> If you are a person who loves anime, like 80's music and plant a tree every day Arbor, you'll probably like this movie. Otherwise, save your money for your later movies because they have a great time.
