Jerry spies Tom, listening to a terrifying story on the radio and taking the opportunity to scare his nemesis. <br /> <br /> I did not find this episode so funny: humor seemed rather limited, and the whole configuration was a bit bad (Jerry is basically a "bad guy" who torments poor Tom without any special reason). <br /> <br /> From time to time there is a flash of inspiration (eg the literal "heart in the mouth" of Tom), and the moment when his nines are sucked from his body), but overall, this effort is missing crazy stimulation, perfect animation and a pure joke of most other T & J cartoons.
