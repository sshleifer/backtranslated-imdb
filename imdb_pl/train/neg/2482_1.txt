(Lots of Spoilers) It's an absolutely awful movie. First of all, he has this guy with the medium. I suppose he made a career out of playing super-powerful fathers. It was all right when he tried to scare his son for the first time, pretending to be a monster ... but then 10 minutes later they did it deftly! And so on, this movie moves in a heartbreaking real time. At some point, I began to picture it a few days later, until I remembered that the plot was only the next day ... still in the early afternoon! I'm not quite sure who this couple should be in real life. First of all, they are presented as a couple of yuppie from Manhattan, who grew up and had a child. But they drive an old blue Volvo. These types ceased Volvos several decades ago. Today they drive Prius. But in 2002 I'm sure they still did not go on volvos. <br /> <br /> OK, this is Wendigo. The "Mysterious Indian Man" gives the boy a little magic Wendigo statuette and tells him about his powerful magic. Come on ... are we still doing ancient Indian secrets. In order to drive them home, they move all over the Indian statues in a tourist trap in the north of New York. American Indians are portrayed in a way that has not been seen for decades in this film! Oh, and Wendigo. In fact, it is not the cause of horror. He does not kill the father of the child who is the most terrible thing in the movie ... he was killed by an ordinary boy with a grudge and a powerful rifle. Wendigo appears late in the movie to avenge the guy who killed his father ... oh, but wait, it seemed earlier that Wendigo was mad at his father, maybe because he killed a deer ... so Wendigo had to be happy that dad he was killed ... but ... <br /> <br /> And so it goes ... offensive, boring and senseless. There is no reason to watch this movie.
