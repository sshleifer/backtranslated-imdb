I hated it. If you believe that everyone in the South is a stupid, morally bankrupted, stupid, brutal, religious madman or child molester, this movie may be for you. Everyone is poor and seemingly unaware. In one scene two older men are talking in a general store and one mentions that he was molesting a set of sisters before they could tie their shoes. The man seemed proud of his actions, and the other man clearly recognized this as a normal part of life. Very good. The teenager walks on the back roads, looking for her sister and no one offers her help - despite the obvious limpness and lack of food or water (without a backpack, etc.). The character of Strathairna is not only completely disgusting and slimy, but it turns out that he is a religious believer who (typical of Hollywood) reflects the vile nature of Christians. The scene in the film is very similar to the end of Cape Fear (the one from DeNiro) - the biblical verses are thrown out by the evil one. I'm from the Great North West, but I found this film offensive because of the wonderful people I know who are from NC, WV, AL, MS, KY, TN etc.
