I'm very tolerant of really bad sci / fi and horror movies - I've watched them since I was 4 or 5 years old, so I've seen really bad things, but I'm dealing with it. I even watched many SciFi Channel movies, so I know that you should not expect much - usually a promising movie that is endless. I believe that hope is born forever or the triumph of hope over experience. Unfortunately, it is a dog from the very beginning and I knew it, but like a moth to a flame, I still thought something, anything, interesting. It is not so. All actors give a decent performance - taking into account the scenario, I do not know how everyone held simple faces. It has something to do with starved collagen parasites that slowly take over the human race, one body at a time. There is a bad plastic surgeon who works with the enemy, giving them the external appearance of people ... do not worry, gets what comes to him. Slugowicze do not know where they come from, they think they could have passed a meteorite who landed on the ground, but ... somehow know about the members of the royal family among them - the snail princess has managed to grow with a man who knows he is a queen worms and loves it for yourself ... oh, I have to go on? Please, I am begging you, do not waste 2 hours of your life watching this ... whatever would be better ... think about the worst and least pleasant way you can spend two hours ... it would be better than this.
