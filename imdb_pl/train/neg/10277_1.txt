I feel completely cheated. Somebody has to pay back the $ 4.95 I spent in Blockbuster to rent this house mess. This is NOT a musical that is a total waste of time and my evening. What I do not get is why it was first distributed? ... someone MUST do heavy drugs the night the contract was made. I've seen better films from film schools and I've been to film school, so I can say that as a fact. The quality of this work is also very VERY bad to watch ... filmed on DV ??? Nuff said. Songs are not songs, but just banter, which sounds the same in every section. Do you want to see a good musical? THEN WE DO NOT MAKE THIS FILM.
