If the author gives himself 2 credits before the main title and about 15 credits before the start of the film, and the first shot shows how the author spins on the bed in lycra shorts, it will not be surprising that the author has a kind of body that should never be seen in spandex. Appearance that may be useful for therapist of homosexual dislike. <br /> <br /> Others have given what they deserve. For me, the most pathetic moment came when the journey from LA meant the landing of a plane on what looked like LAX; and the return was marked with a Fedex freight aircraft shot.
