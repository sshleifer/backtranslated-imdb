A good cast is terribly wasted in this slower than molasses and accidentally hacked comedy. Peter Ustinov tries hard to revive something, but the result is stupid boredom that longs for all the good strokes that could make him possible to watch. Regardless of the positive comments here, this movie is awful. Poorly directed. Badly edited. He worked badly. Poorly written. You have to sit down for a hundred movies to meet such a bad guy. <br /> <br /> The tortuous and tearing plot of the giants concerns Ustinov, who enters the American insurance company to break into the computer and bet on millions of pounds. The way he does it goes beyond lameness and credibility (he simply gets to know his computer skills from day to day, reading brochures, and cheats the computer expert Robert Morley who goes to South America and steals his identity). <br /> <br /> As a plot, romances Ustinov fellow loner Maggie Smith, who by chance becomes his secretary by accident, when he gets a flat in his building. It ends up sharing scenes that have sexual undertones with Bob Newhart that are not going anywhere, while Ustinov is gradually transplanting money and trying to overtake Newhart and Karl Malden. Then Marries Smith and fly to Brazil, which became the basic finale of almost every British comedy since (Nuns on the Run? Fish Called Wanda?) <br /> <br /> An amazing ending accent is more ridiculous than anything that was earlier. At the end I thought that I must be really away from my rocker to start this way. Even the Cesar Romero scene did not help. One of the most unpalatable, poorly mastered "comedies" I've ever seen, and certainly the worst. Do not waste time. If you love it, you need to see better movies.
