Yes, in 35 years of filming, I finally watched the stinker who surpasses all the other terrible movies I've seen. Defeating the "Hunt for goodwill" Baise Moi and "Flirt" for pure horrors. This is the pretentious blige of the first order ... not even funny pretentious bilges. The effects are cheap and worse - pointless. <br /> <br /> It seems that the script was written by a student of the first year of the film, which does not go much, but wants to be full of announcements! Acting is simply indescribable bad - Tilda Swinton covers a career full of vain woodess with a performance that changes neurotically between comotose and ridiculous "intensity". Apparently some fool let the director of this movie make another ... warn me
