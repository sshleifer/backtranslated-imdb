The assumption is absurd, unbelievable characters, trivial dialogue and the end of absurdity. <br /> <br /> Believe me, I am a fan of Kevin Kline, but watching him for 2 hours as an accent to Pepe Le Pew as an alleged Frenchman is not as much fun as it seems. <br /> <br /> Meg Ryan is once again as charming and charming as (take your choice): kewpie doll, baby, puppy, kitten, whatever you think, he is the sweetest creature on earth. She also does not have the slightest similarity to a real human being. <br /> <br /> This film seems to me an opportunity that the friends of Lawrence Kasdan and Kline used for holidays in Paris and in the south of France, while being well paid for it. So I can not blame them.
