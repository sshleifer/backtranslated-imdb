The only reason that "The Norliss Tapes" deserves ANY star is the presence of Angie Dickinson in the cast. Apart from seeing Angie Baby in a pre-"police woman", there is nothing more to see. <br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION: <br /> <br /> *** MA≈ÅE SPOILERY ** * <br /> <br /> David Norliss is used to write a book on the subject of the supernatural. One day he mysteriously disappears after calling the publisher and suggests that he came across something that caused a deadly danger. The entire series for which this unfortunate pilot was written was apparently supposed to be a series of retrospectives through "Norliss tapes" - a set of audio tapes that the author recorded during the study of supernatural cases. <br /> <br /> In the pilot episode a wealthy sculptor dies - but not before buying an ancient Egyptian scarab ring from the local occultist who provides it, the bauble will give him immortality after death. We will soon discover that the ring itself does not provide immortality. Instead, he resurrects the body of the sculptor, allowing him to escape from the crypt so he can run around the city, sucking up pretty girls with all their blood. <br /> <br /> Blue-eyed, yellow-eyed and roaring ARRRGHHHHH Since you last seen the cartoon "Scooby Doo" heard, the sculptor attacks his wife (Dickinson) one dark night. He escapes and thanks to a mutual acquaintance he contacts Norlis to get help in solving the mystery behind the amazing re-emergence of her husband in her estate. <br /> <br /> Is this guy a vampire? No. There is no vampire in this story, despite what you read or heard. The sculptor does not drink the blood of his victims - he collects it. How? I do not know. We only see him attacking, never collecting. Why? To fill the second part of your offer on immortality. It turns out that the lively sculptor will be able to live forever if he builds a life-size statue of a demon named Sargoth from a mixture of clay and human blood. After the end, Sargoth plans to live in the statue, using it as his gate to our world. <br /> <br /> FINAL ANALYSIS: <br /> <br /> "Norliss Tapes" were not picked up as a series for a very good reason ... it was rubbish. As you can see from my summary, history is a poor, ill-conceived mess. Acting and dialogue do not offer anything better. It is not even a contender for the "So Bad It's Good" award. Sometimes bad is just bad. <br /> <br /> After years of listening to underground grunts about the great benefits of "The Norliss Tapes", I was very excited when I saw that it will be broadcast on the Fox Movie Channel 10/15/03. It is a pity that I did not prepare for the fall. <br /> <br /> After the first show of this moaning two days ago, I can only assume that all the applause you have heard from other IMDB reviewers is from those who are viewing the show on the basis of dark memories and nostalgia of youth. Or maybe they're just Dan Curtis' faithful fans. Anyway, they offered you misleading reviews of "The Norliss Tapes". <br /> <br /> Pauly Orchid - October 17, 2003
