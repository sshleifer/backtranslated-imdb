The seduction of students is discovered by Bell Alumni, Elizabeth Berkley on the other side of the desk, and attracts the attention of the young and shapely Corey Sevier. Speaking for myself, I can honestly say that no teacher did anything hormonal to me when I was a student. It was Mrs. Diaz, who was a middle school music teacher. Even as a young gay kid, I saw what he was doing to the rest of the class. She was the only teacher that El≈ºbieta Berkley could play at all. <br /> <br /> Corey, who is a hot man, is also used to having his own way with women, regardless of whether they agree. The fact that it comes from rich parents strengthens this conviction. He spills chemistry, as Berkley teaches, and to maintain his GPA, he agrees to tutoring, but I do not believe it anymore. <br /> <br /> So when he tries to rape and does not get an answer, it's harmful to his ego. When Berkley leaves the canals and reports a police crime, the cops who remember the cases of Pamela Smart and Mary Kay LeTourneau simply do not believe in it. Sevier's parents have enough resources to get a good publicity for their boy. <br /> <br /> Seducing a student who is a misleading title, if he ever existed, is a trash all the way. After the showgirls were beaten by Berkley, this TV movie was not moving up.
