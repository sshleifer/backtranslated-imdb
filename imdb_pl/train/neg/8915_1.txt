My comments on this video have been removed twice, which I think is very offensive because I'm trying to rate this movie for other people. Be tolerant of other people's opinions. Of course, writing in the spirit of Nietzsches' works is not understandable, so I change my comment completely wrong. <br /> <br /> I think it's a really bad movie for several reasons. <br /> <br /> Theme: one should be very careful in creating a film about a philosopher who even today is not understood by the masses and among his peers, provokes passionate discussions. One thing the philosophers agree on is that Nietzsche was a great thinker. So making a movie about his life, which of course includes his "ideas", is something that should be taken with extreme caution, or at best not done at all. Wisdom begins with knowing what you do not know. One would think that this is not a review of the film itself, but the film is not about an imaginary character, but about the life of someone who really lived and had a great influence on the world yesterday, today and tomorrow. If someone tells a story about a tomato, I can express my thoughts about the story itself, but also about the topic chosen, tomato. Producers create a movie about real facts. Especially in a case like this and this responsibility was not taken. <br /> <br /> Scenario: One of the first things I noticed were funny touches. Why? It distracts attention from what should be; Nietzsche and the truth he found. It does not help in arranging things in the right geographical perspective or time! Come on, make it correct English or even better; German! Even Mel Gibson understood this well ... letting his characters talk a bit of Aramaic gibberish in passion. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it is well abused. <br /> <br /> 3d, Assante is not an actor who represented Nietzsche. Bad castings. <br /> <br /> 4. facts are far away. <br /> <br /> And so on. It is a loss of celluloid.
