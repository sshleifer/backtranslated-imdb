This is not the worst movie I've seen Peter Greenaway, but it's close. This shame goes to an even worse cushion. The films of this director from 3 years have seen that everyone is unhappy. Like The Cook ..., regardless of what positive film effects he shows, are completely unjustified by the repugnance of his material and general presentation.
