In this paranoid-powered potboiler, our reporter hero fights against enemy authorities, two-faced collaborators, renegades of UFOnauts and silent, sneaky aliens. (Although it is able to control the mind and shoot objects from a distance, three of them need to operate the control panel with about twenty buttons.) The script shakes from event to event, leaving puzzles full. Why did the aliens blind the dog? Why are radiation soldiers fired when they only patrol the empty landing site? And what space is worth their abduction from lunar cheese, first an ugly photographer, not a model? The inquisitive minds want to know! Screenwriter and director Mario Gariazzo apparently examined his subject, browsing a stack of UFO-related tabloids as he took the dual role of Sunn Classics. (A crawling screen with boasts is praised for being based on real events ... just like "Plan 9!") Some people may feel burned by a sudden final, but he should still refer to the conspiracy of the conspiracy.
