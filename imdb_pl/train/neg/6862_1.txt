This better inferiority of the original stupid movie "Blind Dead" is another waste from the trash can. So many people have rewritten these movies that I can not believe what they say about it. Ever since I was a kid, I've heard about how terrible and wonderful these films are and have seen them all, and I was very disappointed if everyone has been on drugs since the seventies, or do they just do not know how boring this ore is?
