Everyone will notice that Tommy has only 3 facial expressions. <br /> <br /> 1. Angry eyes are watching as he gives each enemy. 2. Holding hands in the face, agape lips and terrified eyes. 3. Smiling Tommy Turnbull. <br /> <br /> I have to say I hate this show, I do not watch it, but it's like Code Lyoko, we've all watched at least one, I have to say that this series is racist, uninteresting and pointless. <br /> <br /> each episode ends with a robotboy win, except for one exception, when the robotboy essentially allows this excessively geeky freakazoid to fly away on a jetpack. br /> These jokes are also quite primitive, I think it's mostly people say the word "Suck" or fart, I think the attackers of the show are also quite shocking. <br /> <br /> There is no one who hides the bowling ball under his hatred, and the other uses the chain, for God's sake, what school he wants. Not to mention his older brother, who is a borderline psychopath and has no other character traits. <br /> <br /> The whole performance, which I think is a break with mega XLR and Fosters. How can you say the coop, jamie and Kiva trio, as well as Robotboy, which is similar to Megas, where he beats everyone regardless of the chance and is free, even though he is a robot. <br /> <br /> There is simply no reference to this program, I am surprised that it still works.
