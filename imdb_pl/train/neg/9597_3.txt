As much as I like Japanese films, this movie just did not stop it ... The movie, which is about rebels and the survival of the royal bloodline, turned out to be a very slow film with a dubious plot. br /> <br /> The photo is OK, although I have seen much better swordfighting scenes in other Japanese films, quick cameras and the way they followed the characters, they did not convince me. The soundtrack is so weak that you will not even notice its presence. But the worst thing was how the plot evolved. I must admit that sometimes it was difficult for me to understand who is who and what is going on. ... In any case, the platonic love between the main character and others was totally unnecessary and seemed to come from Hollywood influences. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you're looking for a Japanese action movie, this is not it. It is very slow, with a very small number of scenes against the sword and very sentimental ... in a bad way ...
