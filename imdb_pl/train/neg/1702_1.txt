Let's be honest: the only reason someone bought it is the only reason someone saw it, and the only reason someone could enjoy it is that David Lynch did it and because you want David Lynch's children . But guess what? Even David Lynch can spend a lot of shit. <br /> <br /> Maybe Lynch wanted you to exceed normality and experience absurd yourself as a pure subject of knowledge. Perhaps the cruel, cacophonist sounds and visualizations of the chicken are supposed to suggest something about the place of humanity in the world, about our relationship with Real, about the absurdity of all this. <br /> <br /> Instead, it just tells me one thing: I just lost 20 $. <br /> <br /> If I wanted to offensive in the name of the offensive, I would have been able to shoot Hansen at a high level and let me bleed. If I wanted absurdly because of the absurdity, I could just throw it on the plate and watch it for 33 minutes. <br /> <br /> There is one feature of redemption for Dumbland - it's the finish line, it's funny. That means it's so bad that it's not even funny because it's so bad. This fact is however a bit funny. <br /> <br /> If you hate yourself and hate your money, buy Dumbland. If not, save agony.
