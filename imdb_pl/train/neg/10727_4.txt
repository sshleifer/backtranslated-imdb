The film is worth watching only if you stop it after half an hour. It starts with fun conversations in the bar and makes you expect a good, fun story. Well, I can tell you that it will not happen. In a few minutes, the movie that challenges your patience will get worse, as well as a sense of shame for actors you probably will not be happy with. <br /> <br /> In the interview I heard that the director wanted to express in this film the sense of identity loss, which according to him is the majority of people experiencing globalization. I was amazed to hear that. Do I live in the same world in which I live? OK, many people walk in the same clothes as mine and listen to the same music and everything, but it does not make me feel that I'm losing my identity. What does Chrzanoswka think that we are nothing more than the clothes we wear and the films we watch? Am I short-sighted or not? <br /> <br /> Well, my voice: a good start to the movie saves it before getting 1, a decent 4 is my application.
