Last weekend I bought this "zombie movie" from a container for occasions and watched it with a few friends, thinking it would be the budget version of "Land of the Dead". <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> They seem to have spent a large part of their budget on the cover, which is very confusing to zombie fans. <br /> <br /> We watched the point where the zombie chicks come to life and get into the car with some yuppim who is in the wasteland and talking on a cell phone. They're actually talking to a guy before one of the girls kills him; but when they started driving, I could not suspend my disbelief anymore. <br /> <br /> Some people consider this a movie "so bad, it's good", they are liars. I did not finish the movie, but one of the others mentions that in the end they somehow become policemen at the end of the movie, which makes me happy that I did not watch him all the time. <br /> <br /> It's even worse than "Zombiez" DO NOT SEE!
