I made a special effort to see this movie and I was completely disappointed with the result. On paper, the script seems hopeful and the choice of actors leaves hope - I liked Pacino in the Scent of a Woman and saw Anna Duperrey and Marthe Keller in several French and other 70s and 80s films. But I forgot how important the role in the film they can play dialogues, and in this movie they are absolute ..... rubbish! The filming venues were also attractive, but the hopeless, pretentious and forced dialogues brought the whole thing to a level below zero. Besides, I'm quite allergic to the world of motor racing and I'm not interested in this sport. Even the inelegant dialogues in "Love Story" were better than those in this movie (and that says something !!). I really expected better after this movie and I was very disappointed that I disappointed me so much.
