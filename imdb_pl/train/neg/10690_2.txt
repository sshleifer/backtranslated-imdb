I guess it's possible that I have seen worse films, but this one is a real smelly! the plot is not unusual, but it is not the worst. directing is not what you can expect from andy ching. he is capable of a good job, but he failed to collect the film together. <br /> <br /> Angie Harm, playing the female role as a reporter, catching up with who is behind the assassination of the president, really shocked the role. there was no chemistry with good, her behavior was flat and wooden, and the five-inch pins she wore throughout the film were absurd. this trip for harmony places it firmly at the bottom of the list "b". <br /> <br /> and what was thinking about Cuba ??? has had many great performances, but it was far below the expectations we expect from him. <br /> <br /> the poor James James and Burt Reynolds. poor poor poor poor poor man.
