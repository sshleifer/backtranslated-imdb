It is a pity that you can not go lower than one star. Before watching The Wicker Man, I thought Aliens 3 was the only movie that really deserves negative stars. Honestly speaking, The Wicker Man does not diminish the pleasure of an earlier movie, but the fact is that my accumulated pleasure from the movie has been reduced by watching it. <br /> <br /> There is also a cheap trick often used in Hollywood, when producers are too stingy to hire good writers or to hurry too much to allow them to finish the plot satisfactorily: strike a shocking ending and hope that the opinion public will confuse them with something significant. It is a gambit that rarely succeeds, and in this case it manages to only spat embarrassment on a great actor and mockery on the producers. The more that "carefully crafted" (or whatever it was) the conclusion did not seem to logically result from the story (which I naturally can not develop without the inclusion of spoilers), and instead denied the merit that the plot had to this point. <br /> <br /> It is a film that can logically speak to psychopaths, pedophiles and probably die-hard fans of Nicholas Cage, but only to a few major recipients. If you really want something similar, I would recommend the village of M. Night Shyamalana instead. I miss a pill to erase my memory. I suppose I need to see something better to force it on my mind, say: Attack of deadly tomatoes or the Great Pee-wee adventure?
