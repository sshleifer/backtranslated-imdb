Predictable, told a thousand times a story with an ordinary drama in between, a few fairly funny scenes of sex interspersed with paranoia of characters, accidental music of violent horror in the style of the 70s, which is sometimes comic, I could not restrain from laughing. /> <br /> I usually like Defoe and I have to say that acting is not that bad, "plot" is developing at a reasonable pace and I'm guessing from time to time. It's just too predictable, I felt that I was watching a TV series instead of a new movie. Maybe this is the style that the directors wanted, but it must be said that the review I read here before I saw the film could only be written by someone involved in its production. <br /> <br /> Do not expect too much, and if I could turn back the clock, I would not go and see him at the cinema. I would wait for occasional containers in your video shop, it will not take long.
