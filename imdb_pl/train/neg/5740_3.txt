I found Darkness too dark. He had a nice idea and some ambitious ideas, not bad action scenes and a few amazing moments for you to go to UGH! BUT, it was highlighted until confusion. You really do not know what's always happening in dark scenes, and when it comes to the movie shot in the movie Super 8, you're dealing with this horrible seed. As with Nathan Schiff's films, it's just too much. Director Leif Jonker seems to want to make an original movie, but he lacks the know-how to do it. The camera is never in the right place, there are no grounds, such as shooting simple dialogue scenes and how the film hurts. All actors are quite uneven and poor. But despite these negatives, the music is good, there are a lot of gore and it ranges from stupid putties to really good devices. Is this a classic, as he says? Does it deserve the praise of two albums? NO. But this is a good first attempt. Now, if these guys stopped slapping their backs on this movie (from what I mean here as the only one they've ever finished) for a while and try again, they can do better.
