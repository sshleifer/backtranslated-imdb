Stupid, mindless fool of a stream assembled in a few hours by mechanics who have never worked on airplanes (piloted by Burgess Meredith) chasing a Porsche racing car that operates on the decades of petrol sludge, led by Lee Majors, with Chris Makepeace as uncontrolled techno - A visa that can McGyver spare parts to a radio receiver that can receive all frequencies simultaneously, and which somehow learned to acquire and use chemicals to produce explosives in a perfectly calm society. It sounds like a moron. The terrible waste of Burgess Meredith, but Chris Makepeace can at least be forgiven on the grounds that it was only his second film.
