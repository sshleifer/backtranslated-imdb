Unlike another reviewer, I think it is well written, especially more fictitious, because more imagination would be required; and it worked well because there were no other characters to focus on in these few-minute, well-performed monologues. But I just do not enjoy such solemn, pious memories. Everyone has a story to tell, and some are more interesting than others. Everyone has problems, and some are more intense than others. These are just ten unusual stories and problems that illustrate the way in which someone's life (or part of it) is the feed for a movie. On the other hand, I think badly about the TV reality shows. So if it's your bag, you can like it. This is the kind of thing that would be good for "phone and / or internet gossip; but absolutely no non-verbal activities. And although every speaker is a woman, I do not want to do it.
