What a horrible movie. It sucked. That was awful. I do not know what to say about this film, but DinoCrap, who stole a reviewer with a nail in the ass. AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! sigh ... I do not hate Roger Corman, this is the awful movie. Well, really? But what can you expect from a film with homeric computer graphics. Another thing, CGI sucked out loud; I'm scared this movie. This is without a doubt the worst Roger Corman B-Movie, and probably the most gay B-Movie. This is-DINOCRAP! I'm sorry, in those moments I had to offend some suckers. It's just a horrible movie ... 0/1000
