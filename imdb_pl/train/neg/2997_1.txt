The film was filmed back with the re-make of Conan Doyle's famous novel The Lost World of 1992. And it shows. <br /> <br /> The film begins quite promising, with a ruthless organization intending to use the lost world, and Challenger and others are coming back to defend the prehistoric plateau, but then everything goes down. Everyone is trapped on the plateau, and we have poor, boring, long adaptations of the first movie. <br /> <br /> Dinosaurs (which are almost never seen) are just ridiculous. Should we take this toy, which is supposed to be an ankylosaur, seriously? And the tyrannosaur seems to be rooted in place. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and get a silent version of the Lost World from 1925. Incredibly in this era of CGI and other advanced effects, the twentieth version is the best and will remain so until someone finally decides to do a decent re-make.
