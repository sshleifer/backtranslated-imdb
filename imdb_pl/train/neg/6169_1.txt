As a big fan of horror movies, especially J-horror, and also gore, I thought Nekeddo burayda sounds pretty good. I researched the story, read the reviews, and even looked at some photos to make sure that it looks like a good and scary movie before downloading. So excited that she ended up and was ready to be scared and step back in horror at an amazing gore, I was expecting to be terribly disappointed. The plot was ridiculous and did not make sense and remained too unexplained, the blood was rather funny than frightening, and what about the sound effects in the cartoon style? Acting was probably the only thing that frightened him a bit. I did not understand the idea of ​​the cactus and the way the mother's husband disappeared in the middle of the sea after the flashing light, left both unexplained, and perhaps missed it, because my mind could not understand what I really saw. I appreciate how it should be; shocking and a few scenes (strange cannibalism and kissing your own mother?) certainly were, I just think that they went a bit far and even in a terrifying way, they did it unconvincing, which made it more believable to be a comedy than horror in my opinion. However, this is a very funny movie and has a lot of laughs from me and a few friends, but unfortunately we expected that horror will not be a comedy, so it's worth watching, looking for entertainment, but do not expect a dark, deep scary and terrifying movie; you will simply be disappointed. If it was a comedy / parody of a horror movie, I would probably rate it for about nine, and the culmination would be the strange scene in which my husband climbed into his wife's stomach and closed her wounds, but as a horror I sadly gave her.
