From the beginning of the movie, it gives the director something to illustrate, what I want to say is that instead of a story dictating the style in which the film should be shot, he went in the opposite direction, had the kind of movement he wanted to do and wrote a story to get it . And he did not succeed. I think he tried to create a stylish movie. Anyway, I think this movie is a total waste of time and effort. In honor of the director, he knows the media with whom he works, I try to say that I have seen the worst movies. Here, at least the director knows how to maintain the continuity of the film. And the actors gave a decent performance.
