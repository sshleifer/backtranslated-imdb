All children between the ages of 14 and 16 want to see this movie (though you can only be 18). They heard it was a very scary movie and they feel great when they watched it. I feel very sad that children can not see what a good movie is and what a bad movie is. It was one of the worst movies I've seen in months. Each scene seen in this movie is a copy from another movie. The end? It's an open end ... why? Because you can not come up with a decent en for such a stupid story. This movie just makes you scared, and if you're a little smart and know your music, you know exactly when you're afraid. <br /> <br /> When the movie ended, and I turned to my friend and said (a little loud) that it was a total waste of money, some stupid kid looked strange to me. That day I could do an Oscar using the home video of my goldfish, if I use appropriate marketing.
