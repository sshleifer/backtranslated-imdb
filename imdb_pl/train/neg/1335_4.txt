This movie was amazing !! (Not as good as Leif Garrett Longshot's masterpiece), but still amazing !! I thought Ashley looked amazing compared to Mary-Kate in this movie. I wonder why. Who would have thought that they could change such places and they would almost do it. Dad, however, was a little jerk, and my mother was a bit too fashionable with Helmit Head. I give it to 4. Anyone who likes this movie should check Longshot.
