For several years, I was looking for half decent movies to rent for my children, I developed a sixth sense to see really bad, direct movies that are really painful to sit down (for anyone who has gone beyond age eight). I dropped the ball on it and the kids spent half the movie asking me "why did she say that?" And "why did it?" And my eyes hurt from rolling with them every minute because the characters did a really bad job, introducing seemingly random plot changes . And the next time someone thinks that having a sword with absolutely no skill is simply "realism" of the movie, run it with boring butter. "Prehysteria!" Was above the head and shoulders. Arrgh.
