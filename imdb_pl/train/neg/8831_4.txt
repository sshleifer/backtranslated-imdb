Having heard so many people who were delighted with the film, I thought I would leave it alone. Besides being incredibly slow, which does not bother me until it's worth it, but it just is not. As many others have said, there are so many inconsistencies and so much of the film is simply not true. The reaction of four men changes from shock to terror, to finding the body to total indifference while fishing. Certainly, if they were people who would like to fish, they would just report the body and say that they discovered it after the fishing trip ... why on earth to bind the body to the tree, fish and then tell everyone that you found the body 2 days before? It is difficult to watch a movie, knowing that the behavior of the main characters is so inconsistent. As for the rest of the city, you would think that at least one of them can show curiosity about who really killed a woman! The body itself, naked, except for the panties ... what is the scenario leading to? If she was raped, why are still panties? If she was raped with clothes, why remove them later after the bars? If she has not been raped, why take her clothes off the panties ... leaving yourself with evidence to dispose of? I really can not think of any realistic scenario that would lead to the fact that I would kill someone who stole their clothes so that you could fill the coupon booth! Well, it is possible to watch, but only because, despite the poor script, acting is strong.
