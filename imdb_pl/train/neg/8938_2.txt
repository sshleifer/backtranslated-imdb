I still can not believe how bad the movie was. If I was not a masochist, I do not know if I would survive watching. It seems that it cost about 1000 dollars to make it, but it was not money that brought it back. Acting was awful - not just bad, 3rd graders could read the lines better. Secondly, the only other reason for watching this type of film is skin, which is very lacking in this movement. We do not even see more attractive chicas in the buff. <br /> <br /> Ah, well, better luck next time?
