I was excited about the discovery of a comedy from the late sixties, in which I saw my favorite people - Maggie Smith, the very young Bob Newhart and, of course, Peter Ustinov. My disappointment was met with the discovery that the film does not act as a comedy or as a perfect movie about the robbery. Ustinov plays a small criminal from prison, who places his pages in a large American corporation based in London. Ustinov, bluffing on the way to the general manager Karl Malden and tech geek Newhart, devotes himself as a computer expert and immediately plans part of the "perfect jump". To do this, it must go through a secured security system that protects the company's host computer. And here is the problem one. His perfect plan works only because everyone else in the film is extremely trusting and stupid. His flawed excuses are taken into account, and this must be the only computer center that has no problems with video cameras. The second problem is the robbery (really a scam) happens in the first 30 minutes of the movie stealing the rest of the image in a very dramatic way. Maggie Smith is unfortunately ill-equipped as a neighbor / secretary of Ustinova, who simply can not keep her job. I love Maggie Smith, but it seems to me that she's too much together here, too self-possessed, and a part requires more crazy physical comedian. What's more, Ustinov and Smith do not have chemistry with them, maybe the difference in age, but the later romantic relationship, so devoid of real romance, so far, is still a bit scary. Ustinov was a co-author of the script, which was well thought out at the time, but I thought it uninteresting, writhing and sad wasting a great cast.
