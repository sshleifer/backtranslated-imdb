OK, forget about all the technical inconsequence or physical impossibilities of a space shuttle that was accidentally fired by a bizarre robot with a golden heart. Forget the hideous special effects and poorly constructed one-dimensional figures. I only look at the premise of history. The very reason for the movie to exist and you will see how much the movie was put together. <br /> <br /> I know 9-year-olds who look at this insult to intelligence and just laugh at it. This story is horrible. Acting is comical, and the message he tries to show is incomprehensible. And what's worse, cable TV channels STAY THIS! It's twice a day every two or three days! Why does someone in their right mind think that people would like to see this painful piece of celluloid many times, especially that they will see it at all? <br /> <br /> My recommendation is do not bother spending energy watching this thing. It just is not worth it.
