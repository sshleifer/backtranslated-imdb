What made me look at the movie down, watch the vampires, I thought I needed to get other movies that this guy did (Larroz), I'm sorry I tracked him down, this is a poor attempt at an occult / satanic film with sex and just sex (with ugly actors and actresses, it's a pretext to madness.) The only factor he saved was the surroundings and atmosphere, avoid it, too much noise surrounds him, not worth the effort of finding him, this is welcome in the grind house edition. I hope that he has a few other movies that match Vampyres, Oh, and the goat scene was very boring, I understand that it's buzzing.
