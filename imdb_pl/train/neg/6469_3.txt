When I was younger, I thought the first movie was really good in my childhood, so I decided to see the sequel. This is an example of why some movies should not have sequels because the first movie is usually the best and it is. Essentially now, when Ariel and Eric are married, they have a daughter who is not allowed outside the home because they are worried about Ursula's sister (bastard with the legs of the octopus from the first movie), Morgan to her. When the child leaves, he asks Ursula to turn her into a mermaid, just like her mother. This makes Ariel go back to the sea to find her. The same good voice artists are just a story that could have a little more thought. Suitable!
