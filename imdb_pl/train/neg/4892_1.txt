they have sex with melons in Asia. <br /> <br /> fine. First of all, I doubted it, but after watching the recalcitrant cloud I changed my mind and I was convinced that they were having sex with watermelons, with dead or alive people. Of course, there is no safe sex. (terribly ugly) the leader shoots the woman's lips after he has made a dead woman. have you never heard of HIV? guess not. <br /> <br /> the rest of the movie is mostly boring, but also incredibly repulsive. in fact, it has become so disgusting that I could not tear my pristine eyes away. sex with dead people! How is it gross? And what is this message? we need water, we need melons, we have to be dead to have sex? I'm sorry, it stinks!
