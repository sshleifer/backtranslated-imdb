The cinema plot from the beginning of the 21st century allows us to encounter various evil creatures and evil people. We have not seen such things from Godzilla v King Kong and the like. It always sounds great on paper when you are connected, and in the haze of good things you have an inspiring idea and see how the whole game sounds before Beethoven's symphonies. Then you come to write this. Great ideas, like all vampires, are feminine. Ergo hot, seductively fatal, but in a sense I want to die. And all zombies are men. Well, what are the men for a woman right after she was abandoned or betrayed? Everything looks good to do it. Then it begins to rot. Mosters is fighting. Nothing happens. Another fight. Philosophical dumplings and codes wallop. Eureka, we found a way to win. Again, a great fight and an end. Sounds great, right? If an independent company was created, it would be great. But this is Hollywood with the eye on bucks: gloss instead of what fans want. It could all be permeated with beauty.
