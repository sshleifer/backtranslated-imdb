This movie is one of my favorites. It really is not good, but it's great to laugh. Dialogue can become unbelievably ridiculous and badly behaved (eg, "Manji, can we ask you some questions?" "Sure." "We think you can help us with answers.") All fights are more or less surreal. Watch out for Brock, a white guy who attacks the main characters. He has only two lines, but he is one of the best guys in the movie!
