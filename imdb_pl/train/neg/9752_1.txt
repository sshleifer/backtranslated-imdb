I really can not believe what entertainment is giving. Death (and mocks death), violence, sexual innuendos, adults threatening children, primitiveness, alcohol abuse by juveniles, drug theft, dysfunctional parents, a helper from hell, stereotypical jokes about African Americans, police and fat people and children escaping home in in the middle of the night - yes, it certainly sounds like a movie for children - NOT !!! Add dark and frightening elements to it - a dead woman who owns and turns into a home and keeps her loving husband in prison for over 20 years, and terrorizes the whole area - how sweet for children. PARENTS - is it really what you want your children to watch - is this what you want to teach them about life ?! <br /> <br /> This movie is too scary for young children and I'm afraid teenagers today may be part of this movie scenario - so why rub it into their faces? As for the adult audience - it will not be scary or fun - just boring, elaborate and predictable. And characters are just bad - ignorant parents, ignorant policemen, stupid and annoying friends, nasty and manipulative babysitters and beer drinkers / women's boys. What great material for children - does it really sound like a movie for children? Even computer animation and good voice work are not enough to realize this horrible movie. Save money, save time and save the minds of your children - go to borrow Ice Age, Monsters Inc., Incredibles, Shrek, Bug Life - EVERYTHING is much better than this awful movie. Spielberg and Zemeckis - it is a pity for both of you that you did such a disaster, and then you made a bill for the children / family !!
