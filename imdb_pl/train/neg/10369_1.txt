As a writer, I think that movies are so bad that it is a complete blow to the face. Talk about insults. I wrote better stories than in the eighth grade. Bad action, bad writing, bad targeting and after adding everything together, the result is complete and complete failure. <br /> <br /> The only thing that this movie manages to achieve is to persuade unsuspecting consumers to waste time. Who green light wrote so bad? It is not artistic, wise, intelligent, full of tension, mysterious, terrifying, dramatic - NOTHING. <br /> <br /> Characters are flat and boring, without development. The plot is just as processed as an aluminum can. Somehow they managed to cast a few very well-known actors who all must be desperate for work or hoping that one of those low-budget independent films will turn out to be another "Pulp Fiction". This script should be used to show the birdcages, not the movie. <br /> <br /> And finally, a woman with a weight of 5'2 105 pounds obviously has the strength to kill men and women twice as large without a fight and one blow. <br /> <br /> Avoid a bomb that will catch you with a sexually transmitted disease.
