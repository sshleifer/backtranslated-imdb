Reporter Darren McGavin (like Carl Kolchak) returned; this time it is after the "Night strangler". Once again, police officers and journalists either do not believe or want to hide the supernatural angle. Producer-director Dan Curtis presents the same basic story as his previous "Night", with a comprehensible smaller success. <br /> <br /> Mr. Curtis gathers a fun cast, including graduates of "Dark Shadows", George DiCenzo and Ivor Francis. Jo Ann Pflug (as Louise Harper) directs a sexy collection of belly dancers. And although I've never seen it anywhere, it must be Roger Davis as a food companion to Mr. McGavin in the early stage, pretending to disbelieve in the existence of vampires! <br /> <br /> **** The Night Strangler (1/16/73) Dan Curtis ~ Darren McGavin, Jo Ann Pflug, Simon Oakland, Wally Cox
