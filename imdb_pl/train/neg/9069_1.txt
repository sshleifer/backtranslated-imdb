The screenplay (David H. Steinberg) seemed to initially have some really smart points that could make a good romantic comedy, BUT BUT baby! What happened on the way ??? !!!! <br /> <br /> I will tell you what happened. Originally it is (Animal House - 1978) and (Porky's - 1982). Although it was a long time ago, but they are pioneers, the godfathers of the new genre: a harsh comedy of teenagers. Then came the nineties. After important instances that have become hits (I add disgust), such as (Problem Child - 1990), (Dumb and Dumber - 1994), (The Nutty Professor - 1996) and (There Something About Mary - 1998), which I think that the followers are influenced by the peak of the era and the prophet of the next era, the only one: (American Pie - 1999), which is undoubtedly and incomparably an icon of the genre. After that, I think that every comedy of this kind must be so dirty, messy that it will be admired by young people, otherwise it can be out of fashion! <br /> <br /> I believe (Slackers) had a clever plot first as a script, and then its creators had to add some really big things: rudeness, dirt, strangely shameless sex - in those days - as easy as a cake! As if they had to fill each stage with any elements, such as: masturbation, oral sex, urination ... etc. Only to look in the "la" mode. They are completely unnecessary elements of history, but they are definitely needed to make profits and catch the latest fashion in creating comedy for teenagers. The problem is how everything has already replaced every possible comedy. <br /> <br /> Some of his moments looked literally horrible, and what you see makes sense. It's all in the look and performance of Jason Schwartzman; to the utmost disgusting. So ambition has changed from being a romantic comedy to doing what was never done before, from purely cutaneous images. Be more like a horror movie, where you ask all the time; what would happen? (vomiting, farting, etc.); it's the easiest combination to create a comedy nowadays. <br /> <br /> Although you do not like it, you have to love something (mainly because you are brave), for me it was just a scene with Gina Gershon. In any case, they designed it as a whole to achieve indignation-indignation, like a naughty teenager's dream. Although most of them were close to the nightmare of anyone. <br /> <br /> What made me sad was the fact that he was in fact a real potential job, not another cheap, another stupid comedy that eventually turned out to be. Remember well the details of the exam theft (first 2 minutes), so the main thread of the movie (a freak trying to reach the girl by blackmailing cool guys) by pattern (the boy loves the girl and the girl loves another boy) because it's nothing but honest schlock. He coped with his material in a trashy way, like a group of dirty college boys who have nothing to do but do something out of nothing. It ended up being sorry and I'm saying that, smiling sh * t! <br /> <br /> Finally, he said something (you can imagine!) about the time and place for a cheater or slack, just like this comedy. Sounds good, but for a completely different movie; which could provide my opinion on how smart ... Once! And it does not take much to understand that the creators of this movie were real grooms! Perhaps stupidity is a way to be intelligent in Hollywood, but even if ... The final result here was not at least witty in any sense of the word. <br /> <br /> PS: His screenwriter (David H. Steinberg), who also wrote the story (American Pie 2), has a homepage on IMDb, where you will find "Additional Information" his usual "storylines", which are: Sex / Vulgarity / Crude Humor / ... They just forgot to write Urineing while showering or barging a 70-year-old woman!
