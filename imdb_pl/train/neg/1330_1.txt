There's a reason why Jay Leno will not recognize the movie himself. Consistently one of the worst movies of all time. Acting is terrible, the script has no direction, and the director himself does not seem sure how to make this film. "Kumpla film", "action / comedy", "mystery". He seems to be halfway, give up and is on the road. Jay Leno and Pat Morita are talented and dedicated performers. It is a pity that they wasted their time and gifts making this film mess. Jay Leno and Pat Morita spent many years working on the Hollywood circuit before being involved in the process. Mr. Morita was already a star in himself, from the mid-1960s he played regularly as a star of such cult television and film classics as "Happy Days" and gloomy, but kind "Mr. T and Tina. " And he conquered America's hearts with his roles in the mighty film "Midway", "Karate Kid" and many others. Mr. Leno could be seen on television programs from the mid-1970s. And he was the best performer in comedy clubs in America. You can see it in countless TV spots and in big movies. It is a pity that they agreed to be seen with this nonsense.
