Listening and enjoying the commentary of Ovey II Harvey Bernhard, I was shocked to discover that he was also behind this absolute trash. It's a really bad TV movie that you can see in the middle of the day when you have flu and you're too sick to reach the remote. I think that at the moment when Michael Lerner is confronted with what I can only describe as a cast of Les Miserables from high school, my mouth was open in disbelief. And then my lips moved up and down because I was laughing so much. Horrible. I do not know why I have to write at least ten poems, I have briefly pointed out, there is nothing wise in this entire modern vocabulary.
