This "movie" is such a bad job! Nothing seems even realistic. The plot is weak, acting - unhappy, actors are wondering how on the first anniversary of production, trying very hard to act without a chance from the beginning. What a flap! What a waste of time, money and effort for all concerned, including the public. Well, like every thriller, here are murders, corpses and blood. Imagine someone who murdered a knife five minutes ago, went out calm and smiling, not to mention a clean whistle, as if a virtual agent had cut the throat. In addition, this murder was to be carried out by a tiny fragile woman on a strong man, and she cut his throat !!! Did she politely ask him to stoop for her? There is much more stupidity of the same kind and leaving the audience wondering if it was supposed to be a joke that turned out to be bad. Continuity is another huge problem, for example: a greedy hungry groom lies in bed, waiting for his bride to come out of the bathroom and after a long while falls asleep (!?!). The next scene opens with a young couple entering the reception, asking for directions to the scenery locations! NO WORD FOR THE LAST NIGHT ??? Such a waste of time, even an attempt to write about this "low" movie.
