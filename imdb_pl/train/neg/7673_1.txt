I do not know where to start. Tara Reid must be stopped before she can be placed in another film. Stephen Dorff looks like he has been motivated by his character from Val Kilmer in "Top Gun". Slater sleeps through this shudder. Direction, editing, sound (do we really need a heavy metal film in the middle of shooting?), Costumes (bulletproof vests with muscles) and hey, there is no visible plot. I am surprised that no one joined the project and said, "Hey guys, it just does not make sense, let's start from the beginning." I hope Slater's career will rebound after this catastrophe. <br /> <br /> No doubt the worst movie I've ever seen.
