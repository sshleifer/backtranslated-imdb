I watched the uncharted version of this movie and realized that I had never recovered my time. I continued until the end, hoping that dialogue would improve, martial arts would look realistic, special special effects would look really special. I was wrong. I love horror, I'm a complete bloodhound. I count several splatteries from the eighties amid the great worlds of the film. However, it was not made in the eighties, if this movie appeared in the early eighties, then the fax could be forgiven if it looked so bad. It was not that there was no defense. Dialogue is horrible with so many bad lines that I scolded in writing than writhing in torture. I do not like a hostel, I never had it, I thought it was exaggerated, overgrown and I did not feel anything for the heroes, but it shines like a lighthouse next to the rubbish. Back of the Live Feed cover promised a return you will never see, I'm still waiting for the promised turn of the action.
