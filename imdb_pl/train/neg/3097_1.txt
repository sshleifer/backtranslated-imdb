There can be no questions about spoilers for this movie, the director beat us all and ruined the film in so many ways. <br /> <br /> Glaring rip off of things like Critters and Gremlins, this movie fails on so many levels to regain the humor and horror of these better-made movies. It ends up wasting a lot of time in which bad actors lead a bad dialogue against an idiot director who occasionally throws toys at them. They struggle with these toys in the same way as Tarzan's old films in which rubber crocodiles were used, shaking them while shouting and trying to make them look a bit scary. Watching is painful and does not help him with the 80's mental fashion worn by the cast. <br /> <br /> Basically, some crazy strangers who have been trapped by an aging bodyguard in the movie, in the end free years of imprisonment and start to telepathically get into the minds of people. The guards, a new recruit, an idiot who released them despite repeated warnings, gather a gang of 80-year-old friends and go together to get the Grems together ... Hobgoblins. <br /> <br /> The whole life is here, with a gang consisting of a jockeys knocklehead, his 80s whores, an ice-cold and crafty hero girl, and a young hero who lacks self-confidence and wants his girlfriend and so it turned off. First, there is the infamous scene of the rake battle in which the former military jok shows how he was trained in the army to be a tyrant, poking a nervous hero with a bad end of the commission, which seems hours. Then they run, ending in a real style of fighting, ending in a nightclub with comedic hand grenades blowing everything except the people standing next to them. Then the movie ends and everything ends well. <br /> <br /> It is not. It's like watching a train wreck, you can not tear your eyes off it, it's so bad. Excellent fare for the Mystery Science Theater, but awful if you try to watch them alone and unscathed. Fashion police still have many outstanding commands for the cast, and I dare not laugh at anyone for pure mockery during a commission fight. That gives a maximum of 2 points out of 10 on a good day.
