Forget about Plan 9, this is a final fiasco, a costume drama, an ineptly directed, script-written, played, etc. This movie is based on Isabel Allende's not-so-much-better novel. I hate Meryl Streep and Antonio Banderas (in non-Spanish films), and other actors, including Winona, my favorite actress and Jeremy Irons, are trying hard to overcome such a horrible scenario. Lots of mistakes (as for example when the snow in Christmas in Chile?) And very cruel, with tons of this evil called "magical realism", stands out as the worst movie of all time. It totally sucks !!!
