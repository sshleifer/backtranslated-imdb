Strummer's hipper history was a revelation, but overall it seemed like a storm. The bonfire stories work best in the vicinity of a bonfire. There were too many anecdotes from half-boring old friends and too many recordings from stocks. I love The Clash and Joe for not joining and selling their songs so far (FU Mick Jones), but this document did not let me do more. Using storytellers of a bonfire without a proper explanation of who is telling an anecdote somehow discourages the viewer. They should have conducted the interview on their own. Even the use of Strummer's "radio voice voice" did little to glue the film together. And can anyone explain all the flags flying behind the fire scenes? After the incredible "Filth And The Fury" I was hoping that Temple could provide it. Joe Strummer's document deserves better.
