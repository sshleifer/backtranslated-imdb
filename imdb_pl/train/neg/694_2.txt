It is the beginning of the 80s. There is a group of suspicious old teenagers. And there is a manic trail. Yes, this is slasherville. <br /> <br /> This movie is called Pranks. Why is it called Pranks? I do not have the slightest idea. Unless your idea of ​​a great joke is repeatedly hitting someone's dinner with a baseball bat - in total, this is not a great joke; basically a fairly ridiculous joke, if you tell the truth. But go. <br /> <br /> The film itself concerns a group of teenagers whose job is to clean up a dormant dorm. They realize that the psychopath is at large. To fight this development, they parted and wander in the dark. It ends with tears for most of them. <br /> <br /> Pranks is a badly made slasher movie. The DVD release I watched was a Vipco publishing house. It seems that it is cut out of a bit of violence. This makes the DVD even more pointless, because, let's face it, a non-violent video is a waste of time. Only for filmmakers and filmmakers who are mean.
