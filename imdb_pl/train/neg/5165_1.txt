I could not wait for this ride and I was terribly disappointed. <br /> <br /> And it is very easy to have fun on roller-coaster rides and the amusement park. <br /> <br /> Part of the roller coaster was fine - and it was about 30 seconds of a 90 second drive. <br /> <br /> He was visually boring and badly made. <br /> <br /> Desperately tried to be a mixture of much better rides by Indiana Jones and Space Mountain and Disneyland, and disappointed in every respect. <br /> <br /> It was not exciting or exciting in the slightest.
