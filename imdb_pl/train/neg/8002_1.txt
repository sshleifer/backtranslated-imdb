What a horrible movie. Rotten tomatoes also had a good rating. do not be fooled by positive comments; It was not terrible. It was not funny. It was not smart. It will not even attract your attention. I just wasted 2 hours of my life watching this crap fest. The computer generated monster was interesting to see the first few times. after about 15 minutes he did not play. dialogue was terrible, it must be a translation. another negative who stood out were the idiots Americans. 3 were presented and all were of character, intelligence and judgment. Now I will write a few lines to do it, because we must have 10. The video store employees should hit me for bringing this title to the counter.
