If you can believe it, the * other * group of teenagers will return to * another * cabin on the lake three years later * another * one of these deadly 'accidents' reported one of their numbers. Low and weak, there is a psycho dressed in a patterned hockey mask (cheap paperwork) that wastes them one by one. This mechanical "Friday of 13th" gained little publicity as one of the first digitally made functions, but that's where interesting facts end, and all that remains is predictable, amateur production with performances below the norm and repeated intrusion boom. The last second has nothing to do with uplifting, and the "Remembrance Day" is something that is best tossed into the lake and forgets about it. One only for crazy slasher collectors.
