This probably does not fit in the bottom of the barrel of Slasher's average movies, but it's certainly a damned bad movie. <br /> <br /> The Christmas premise made it interesting, but after the first scenes the film shows that there is poor production value and a stupid plot. My point is that the subspecies were all invisible teens cutting teenagers for no apparent reason, but this one took it too far. There is absolutely no consistency of events or anything else to add. <br /> <br /> Clich√©s are more than boring, gore is minimal, just like the secret. <br /> <br /> This is a fairly average password that should not be hypnotized, even if it has a video label. <br /> <br /> I am really disappointed with this overrated piece of rubbish.
