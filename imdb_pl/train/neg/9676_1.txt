Movies have made me sleep earlier, but no movie has ever done it twice, so it took me three meetings to complete it. Dialogue was bad. The women spoke harshly, and the men were caricatures. And two of the supposedly Japanese women looked Chinese, had Chinese names, and spoke clearly with Chinese accents. I'm still trying to understand why the Emmenthal men were sexually tied to each other. 10 minus 8 1/2 is a difficult choice: do I give this film an assessment? or two? <br /> <br /> The movies have put me out of bed earlier, but no movie ever did it twice, so it took me three meetings to finish it.
