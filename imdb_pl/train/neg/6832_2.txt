I would like to enjoy this movie, but Van Damme just does the same old rubbish again and again. Poo pants are fighting the scenes as usual. The only thing that this loser left behind were the Russians, who eventually were eventually killed. This movie is a complete dog of the highest nature, please, please, give Van Damme the acting lessons you need. Everyone who likes Van Damme has problems. It seems sad that the only way Van Damme will do any kind of acting is to write a film, co-produce a movie and display a screen for a movie. AVOID VAN DAMME AND HIS QUICK WIG. I give this film two out of ten, because the one with sandstone was better. To add insults to injury, I wasted a pound on this manure
