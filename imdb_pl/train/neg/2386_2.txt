I missed the movie in the cinema, but I had some idea behind the head that it was worth watching, so when I saw it on the shelves in the DVD, I thought "time to watch it". Huge mistake! <br /> <br /> A long list of stars can not save this turkey, certainly one of the worst films ever. The incomprehensible plot is poorly delivered and poorly presented. Perhaps it would be more sensible if I read Robbins' novel, but if the movie is not completely different than the novel, and Robbins helps in the script, I doubt that the novel was also terrible. <br /> <br /> I hope the actors were well paid because they looked embarrassed that they were in this celluloid waste, and more recently on blank DVDs, like Pat Morita. Even Thurman is grateful to sometimes look uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> Save yourself about 98 minutes of your life for something more valuable, like trimming your toenails or sorting a sock drawer. Even if you see it in a container thrown under "5" in the local store, resist the temptation!
