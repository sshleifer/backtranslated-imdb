this film was clearly poorly done and in a hurry. I realize that it is difficult to get funds for such a movie. If, however, the story had some original substance, someone would see that she got the necessary funds, it was not, and such films are not necessary in themselves and have no purpose in existence. The story of this film was made and done better, which I could add many times before. There is no reason to create a movie that has no chance of competing with others. I have been informed by my computer that I need a minimum of ten lines to send my comment, so the following lines are just bulls to fill the space. In my opinion, you do not have to say anything more about this film. I said that there is a lot, and if you waste enough time to read this review, do not waste your time watching this movie for God's sake. The only exception is if you are a person who likes to watch bad movies that are played in the women's entertainment network at 2:00 in this case. Look what I care.
