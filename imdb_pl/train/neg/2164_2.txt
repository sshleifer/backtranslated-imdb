I thought maybe it's worth watching a movie that can boast of casting among others Peter O'Toole, Susannah York, Michael Craig and Harry Andrews. Unfortunately, I was wrong. From the beginning to the end, pretentious nonsense, and O'Toole and York are wildly worried. I watched it twice and still have no idea what's going on. I have the impression that O'Toole plays Laird from a Scottish castle who has a drinking problem and enjoys having fun with his sister (York). He is also barking. But otherwise your assumptions are as good as mine. <br /> <br /> The movie has no redemption function. I can only assume that the cast and director were blackmailed to make this grim, unimaginable, stagy piffle. Clearly a waste of time for the talented cast and director. Risible.
