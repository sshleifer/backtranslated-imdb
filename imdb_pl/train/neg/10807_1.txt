This movie has successfully proved what we all know that professional basketball players suck everything except playing basketball. Especially rapping and acting. I can not even begin to describe how bad the movie is. First of all, is it just me, or is this the ugliest kid you've ever seen? I mean, his teeth can be used as a can opener. Second, why would gin want to make a career in the music industry, since it has magical powers, sucks terribly music? Third, I read the Bible. In no way did shape or form say that Jesus creates genes. Fourth, what was the matter with all the shitty special effects? I assure you that every boring teenager with a computer with acne can have better results. Fifth, why did the ending suck so badly? What the hell is he a djin? And finally, anyone who created a nightmare known as Kazaam must be dropped from the plane to the Eiffel Tower, because this film takes the word "suck" to a whole new level.
