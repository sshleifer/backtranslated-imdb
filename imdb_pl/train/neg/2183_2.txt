This movie was really bad, whether it's a sci-fi movie, a horror film or even a comedy. The whole thing is funny. <br /> <br /> The film looks (and is) definitely cheap, the actors have no idea what acting is, and the scenario clearly shows that it was created with shooting. It is obvious that the monster in the closet has been added, because the living head was not at all frightening - it was even pretty - and they thought they needed something more impressive; it did not work here either (makeup is terrible even for the late 1950s, rather funny). <br /> <br /> The film clearly shows why the career of director Joseph Green as such and also as a writer never materialized; he was very angry in both. The same applies to actors, leaders and supporters. <br /> <br /> The best achievement of "A brain that will not die" is its short duration.
