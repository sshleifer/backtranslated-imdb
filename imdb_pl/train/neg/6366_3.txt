There was not a single redeeming factor in this film. Girl and I love action movies. Particularly the fight scenes (Bloodsport and Kickboxer were amazing), but this movie was not fun. Five minutes of action followed twenty minutes of speaking and "anger" facial expressions. The main character is an uneasy figure who saw the battle and is therefore forced to look seriously lazy all the time. The army disrupted his intestinal movements by improving his fighting technique. Music is not good either. They are fighting for rap and hip-hop streets, because these guys are bandits. The rest of the soundtrack is just plain background noise for low-budget dramas. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is a classic B style. The actors deliver their lines as if they were reading them from memory cards, and the lines themselves should be set on fire and left in the burned, rotten Hollywood alley. The film is entitled "Honor", but this film was not honorable. It was simply a waste of money, and spending it wisely is something that I consider to be honorable. <br /> <br /> Instead, go and see Felon. Combat scenes and situations are more real.
