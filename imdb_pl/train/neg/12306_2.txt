This film is a pure failure. I am a fan of Steve Martin, but even he can not save the tired idea and the scenario of Swiss cheese. Think about "Police Academy 7" and apply it to military parody. Yuck. <br /> <br /> I do NOT feel that other user comments reflected the poor rating of this video (and rightly deserved!). It is very confusing. I've often seen this movie at the grocery store for $ 3.00, and now I'm sure I know why. <br /> <br /> If only I could get back 90 minutes ...
