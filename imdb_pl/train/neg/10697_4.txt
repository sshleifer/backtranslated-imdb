First of all, I thought it was rude for them that the story and script were the work of Preston Sturges. Sturges was one of the better Hollywood screenwriters until his talent disappeared and he retired. However, it's not Preston Sturges, it's Preston Sturges, Jr. This story was basically based on Robert Louis Stevenson's story "The Bottle Imp." A good man comes into possession of a bad object that will give him any wish, but eventually he will lead him to hell. Fine. Nobody said that screenwriters must be original. The actors are usually quite competent, taking into account the average writing they had to translate to the screen. My biggest complaint is about the ending. The protagonist thinks he has discovered a way out of his dilemma, but tries to solve the problem in a slightly different way, trying to save an innocent person. At first it seems that it worked, but according to the code of modern horror, they feel that they must deliver the last portion of horror at the very end of the movie. It's a stupid convention. Older horror films got along well, letting the hero win at the end. There is nothing wrong with a good triumph over evil, regardless of what the current filmmakers seem to think. You can give your audience good healthy fear and make them happy at the end. In fact, I think it's better.
