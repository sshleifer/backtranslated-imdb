he had some lovely poetic bits, but it's just an artificial, mindless projection, with no direction and resolution. how are these people going through the film school? Who gives them money to make this shit? I could be a lot more, a great leading actor, and I always like Fairuza Balk, but give me peace, the alt-rock metaphor of staring unconsciously unable to find anything convincing is just so tired and certainly not good movies. the director has to go and live for a long time, and not return to the camera until they have something to say. it's like a school of art to throw spaghetti into the wall, you just put together some serious images and hopes that I hope hell emerges from. it can work if the director really has any vision or has a brain that knows when he is in the presence of potential, but here it is just a space filler, irrelevant. I felt the lazy end of the coming moments before he hit, and shouted "lazy bastard" on the screen when the credits appeared.
