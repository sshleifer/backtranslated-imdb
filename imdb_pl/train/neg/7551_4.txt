In the end, I saw a remake last night in London, unwillingly amusing, sexless and devoid of real humor. I really do not know where to start, while I was entertained by this strange tribute, it really did not move me. Acting is loudly hammy, there is no original music, the costumes are too "Disney", it's funny "six months later" after Nica Cage's burn (which did not come quickly enough for my taste) Piece of Cage in a bear costume crowd he suppressed the audience, as did the comedy breaking out of the various "bad" on the island. It's such a strange remake that I can not believe I saw it, it reminded me of something that The Comic Strip presents would do in the eighties, a bit like their Hollywood interpretation of a miner's hit, very strange!
