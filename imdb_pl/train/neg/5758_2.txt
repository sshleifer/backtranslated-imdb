It can be said that the actors will make a film, but this clearly proves that the statement is wrong. Most of the characters in this movie have nothing to stick to. They play the role of cardboard cutouts that move in a predictable and uninteresting way. The story is very simple. This can be summed up in a few words, but I will refrain if someone reading this film wants to see it. <br /> <br /> I had to rewind the parts in which Jack showed us how to be an unbearable eater. I must say that 70% of the film concerned cooking, eating or preparing to eat. Honestly, I'd rather not spend time watching Jack chew loudly with her mouth open. Personally, I could do it without reference footwear and jokes, which also make for the first half of the movie. <br /> <br /> In addition to my personal dementia, the movie really missed something worth attention. There were countless scenes and camera shots that seemed to drag on. When something happens, the reactions of the heroes are unclear and dry. <br /> <br /> It's best not to look at it.
