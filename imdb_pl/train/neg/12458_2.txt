The premise of the film is so simple and obvious that only a Texas millionaire with high oil vapors and whiskey would have trouble understanding it if someone shouted it through the proverbial parking lot. To sum up: the oil business is in collusion with the government (or Gummint if you prefer), Gummint is in cahoots with the despots of the Middle East, and the CIA is a single suppression game of double matching son-words to lift every line that will come their way. The only people who ended up are good, like Mr. Clooney ("Bob"). Oh, and terrorism is the result of the poverty that globalization creates when wicked international corporations are persecuting the world, looking for a tasty takeover or three. It really suits the profiles of skillful criminals of September 11. <br /> <br /> In Syriana, this easy tissue of political half-truths and Hollywood holograms is aroused in the hideous vermicelli of plot motifs that spin, twirl and whirl through the dark explanations of their own irrelevance, until the poor viewer alone concludes that : <br /> <br /> 1. "director" (good joke) never approach the camera <br /> <br /> 2. people like Clooney and Hurt can know how to act, but definitely not they know how to choose a script <br /> <br /> 3. If you want to see a movie that deals with corruption in big business and condition, go to Claude Chabrol's "L'ivresse du pouvoir" who is insightful, funny and brilliant. <br /> <br /> An empty, sentimental puff filled with annihilation has grown into an evening, ruinous length.
