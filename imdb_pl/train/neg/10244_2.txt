I work as a hotel concierge in Washington and take the word, there was nothing specific about the character played by Michael J. Fox # 1, we just do not go with pockets bursting from the theater tickets and $ 100! # 2 If I ever let anyone use the room for some "afternoon admiration", I will be fired on the spot! The organization to which I belong (Les Clefs d'Or) has very specific standards of ethics and conduct that we take seriously. # 3 Similarly, the concept at the end of the film was false that Doug simply takes off the gold emblem and passes it to another employee - we earn these keys and this is a badge of honor and knowledge that can be worn to them. Our entire application and verification process joins our organization. <br /> <br /> This film does not dispel the unfortunate perception of the porter as nothing more than a mercenary of money. In short, it harms our organization. I welcome any comments.
