"Anything that can be a great document"? Yes, if someone is deaf, stupid and blind. Everything except meaning, wit, visual style and interesting subject. Otherwise. . . <br /> <br /> Seriously, volken. This is a movie that is completely inauthentic. An adventure document without adventure, a war doctor without a sense of war, a camping message without a trace of wit. It does not mean anything, it feels nothing and carries a hidden message that absolutely does not matter. No wonder he has so many IMDb fans! Of course, knowing that the movie with the participation of the great Skip Lipman will not have any culture, intelligence, wit (other than a corrosive youthful joke) and no recognizable human emotions? just adrenaline. "Darkon" is not a movie - it's a panic attack! Avoid. Too many real documentaries and too little time to live, to waste them on building toilets such as "Darkon".
