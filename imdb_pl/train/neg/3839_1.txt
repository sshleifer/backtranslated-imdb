Some movies are so bad that they are good. This is obviously not one of them. Based on a true story, this movie was as faithful to the story as Pinocchio's chances of becoming a real boy. Acting was terrible, the direction was bad, and he traveled too fast. It looked as if the director just wanted to finish it and finish it and go home. and budget anyway. Like most of her other films, she drops heroes too much, talking too fast, as if speeding up her words made her more dramatic. It seems that before her is a team that talks with the camera when it should engage the viewer in his character. It's quite slowing down the whole movie, and every leg he could leave is ruined. <br /> <br /> Probably the only good thing about the movie is when it was finally nailed down. But even that was not satisfying enough to overcome my disgust at such a bad film. <br /> <br /> Watch out if your taste in the movie is milder than a piece of dry toast.
