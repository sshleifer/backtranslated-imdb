First of all, I'm not here to teach this movie. I find it very pleasant despite the low quality of production. Acting is just as nasty as a monster that haunts them, although the monster itself is quite well done ... impressively well. In fact, it looks a bit different, like a foreign family on vacation landed in the Himalayas and while Daddy took ... attending the call of nature, Spot came out and simply did not have time to hunt him down. Whether he is a Wishmager's Caucasian brother. I did not decide which ones. <br /> <br /> Actually, it seems that it has been filmed somewhere in the snowy country, yes, but more likely to be somewhere in Canada somewhere than in China. Trees and views tell me about Canada and it's okay that the designated area never takes on the cold chill you would expect in the Himalayas of China. It's a Sci-Fi Channel movie, so we can forgive the lack of location. <br /> <br /> Moreover, apparently (as we have just established), Sci-Fi directors do not travel often because they are not aware that commercial airplanes fly above the weather, as it is described here, and another disaster would not take place. But, as I said, this is a Sci-Fi Channel movie, so we have to forgive a few things. <br /> <br /> The movie is sometimes quite graphic and rotates between "Alive" about Donner Party, "Predator" about a stranger in the forest and every bad wushu movie in which they fly on the wires. Yeti apparently can jump like Spiderman ... or Super Mario ... remember? "Run faster! Jump above! Live longer! "<br /> <br /> In addition, Yeti missed his bear. He was looking for it high and low, but he did not seem to be doing a corpse. Poor Yeti! You can not help it, but regret it. It survived and evolved thousands of years just to lose a teddy bear. He missed the bear. Or maybe you want to connect, but this thought is REASON! Can you hear me? Well, it looks like he's an unperturbed man. RECONSTRUCTED! <br /> <br /> And this is superhuman. Well, this is not a man ... it's a super-Yeti! But again, what is normal-Yeti? I do not know, but it has a certain quality by Michael Meyers, which is completely disturbing. And he has this wonderful way to clean his fur. FABulous Dahlink! It is impeccably white at times when it should NOT be. He is a picky superhu ... a super-Yeti. <br /> <br /> In total? It was great fun to watch, has some great killings and some fair plot elements. Despite the terribly gravely style of production, it is quite fun. I can not stop wondering if they are planning a different one? <br /> <br /> Rates 6.0 / 10 in the M4TV Scale. <br /> <br /> Rating 4.4 / 10 in Skala Filmu od ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
