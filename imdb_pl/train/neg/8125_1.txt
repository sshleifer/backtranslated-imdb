"The Bat People" is a really bad movie that deserves the MST3K treatment, just like this other movie "The Creeping Terror". <br /> <br /> In it we are in some mountainous area full of bats. We see a lot of things like flying bats, attacking and other things, station wagons, accidents in the emergency room and much more! All this plus plus cheesy mediocrity of the 70s (hey, think "Mitchell" here!), Making "The Bat People" one of the best of the latest episodes of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" from the series! Move, it's awful. It should be avoided like a plague, unless Tom Servo and Crow are watching with you. <br /> <br /> "The Bat People" - more like "The Bad People !!!!!" LOL <br /> <br /> 1/10 of course !!!!!
