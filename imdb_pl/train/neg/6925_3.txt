I feel much less generously in this film than others like. The performance of the madmen in this century is always done so that they are so bizarre that they are a different species. Their antics are so outrageous that they are completely fictionalized. Everyone is Napoleon or another historical figure; or they are fascinated by chickens. They are on the line or are fighting each other. It's as if the screenwriter said what I can reward them without feeling what madness is or even mental illness. Watch the wonderful human portrait in the movie "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", where diseases are trustworthy and true. I used to work in a state psychiatric hospital. I did not see any of these guests. They are too intelligent and calculating to liven up.
