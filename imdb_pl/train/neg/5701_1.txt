And so great rewriting history continues the Hollywood style. <br /> <br /> It was senseless, absurd garbage. <br /> <br /> I am shocked that you can spend such an incredible amount of money to produce what is the most imaginative, badly preserved inaccurate movie I've ever seen. It's terrifying. <br /> <br /> Nick Cage's short flirtation with serious acting seems to be over. I can only assume that Leaving Las Vegas was a glitch in another litany of scary movies. <br /> <br /> Diane Kruger proves that her performance at Troy was not a fluke, it really can not work. <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel should be ashamed of working on such traps. <br /> <br /> Recommended only for people who regained health after recent lobotomy or for people who claim that America invented the world.
