Do not bother watching this terrible mini series. It's a six-hour boring, unbelievable love triangle between three people who do not have any chemistry for themselves. In this story there is no heat, no real passion, no real romance. It is dry, boring, drawn and uninvited as they appear. And it does not even meet the expected level of technical proficiency. Take these six hours of your life and use them for something more valuable.
