Oh my. How can they make films about such beauty, but they are so bad. I mean, even Uwe Boll does not do that shit. There is not even a trace of a decent story, multi-layered figures or attractions. It's just a random sequence of senseless talk combined to create a "movie". I suppose that only children under 3 years of age could enjoy it, considering that the world is so dimensionless and the history so incoherent that every elder would be upset. But on the other hand, it is too scary for people under the age of 6 that probably no one should watch this movie at all. <br /> <br /> Take my advice and stay away from this movie. Your daughter can create a better storyline and although she probably is not able to draw so nicely, her stories are much more worth listening to. And please, in the name of who you believe in, do not expose your children to this piece ****. I will give him 2 out of 10, and that's only for graphics, because the story and the development of the characters are so horrible that they deserve a negative rating. <br /> <br /> And if you decide to watch it ... remember that I warned you.
