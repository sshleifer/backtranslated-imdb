The wife of a stage producer in London hopes to repair an American man who is singing and dancing in her husband's latest program with a familiar American girl who makes her live in modeling fashion in social circles. Unfortunately, the couple have already met, and the girl thinks that the guy is actually the show's producer married to her friend (the fact that there is no wedding ring should discourage misunderstandings!). Waffles Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers musical has finally been brought to the ground by the idiotic script of Dwight Taylor and Allan Scott, who is full of juvenile behaviors. Astaire and Rogers not only "meet sweet" - they meet funny (dancing like a madman in a hotel suite above her, and she complains). The viewers of 1935 probably did not care how the two would meet - as long as they did it and happily. It seems that today's main characters do not have the motivation to end up in their arms: he gives her flowers (after he told his friend that he wants to remain "uninhibited" in the department of love) and she gives him a brush. Nothing that a small dance can not heal! This impressive twosome is just as deliberately unreal as the settings of London and Venice, but we simply watch because the tracks are Fred and Ginger. It's a fantasy for non-people ... those who do not mind a stupid story. Musical moments break the monotony of the imaginary scenario, but do not exceed the stupidity surrounding it. ** with ****
