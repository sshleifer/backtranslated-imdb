Andrewjlau, I could not agree more. My girlfriend is watching this at the moment and I find this film terrifying. Quote from my Chinese girlfriend, laughing: "Do it all for a man!?" <br /> <br /> I think that these women have no intensity, they have no sense of struggle between tragedy and identity and that these people are not about what to fight for. During the dance stage in which Zhang Zi Yi wins, men look stupid more than admiring. <br /> <br /> The Japanese have a much greater intensity than the Chinese, and being a geisha is Japanese culture. I'm sure the Chinese had something similar, but the faces do not match the main ones. <br /> <br /> In any case, the dialogue is so mysterious, so American. If a European did it with European orientals, they would do a much better job. <br /> <br /> I must add: it seems that most people who liked this movie are Americans. I'm sorry to say it, but no wonder. Everything written for you, not instinctive, not passionate. I think Chinese actresses are cute, but I could not say they were good in this movie. Yes, cinematography is great, but I do not really see how you can see that these characters are complex, deep people. <br /> <br /> I'm going to Japan to see the real thing. I'm sure it would be amazing.
