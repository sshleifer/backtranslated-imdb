I feel blessed to have what is known as Steven Seagal's worst film ever made. I knew that I was in something special when Steven opened his mouth and someone else's voice came out. In the middle of the movie my eyes started to hurt and I almost fell out of the chair with an uncontrollable laugh. <br /> <br /> Steven is Steven (with a constantly changing voice) and totally unbelievable in his role (as always). Who the hell still allows people with bad, feathery hair with a pony tail in the Force? He also always fits into completely unbelievable love interests with women at least 20 years younger. All supporting actors look as if they have been filmed in the dark - have they filmed the film in the dark only with a flashlight for lighting? <br /> <br /> It is really disgusting in every respect. Invite all your friends and make them a social event - it's really special.
