A real disappointment with the great visual master Ridley Scott. SOLDIER AMERICAN. Jane tells the story of the first woman who underwent a hellish workout at Navy SEALs. Training is the most difficult and the most difficult in the exam, as the instructor in the film tells the main character of O'Neil played by Demi Moore. In this movie there is no specific message or point, and then I could not reach it properly. It may be a kind of statement about the rights and abilities of women, but all of this is drowning under tired scenes and a silly weapon fight at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> I really can not understand why Ridley is using so much this last battle in the desert ?! It looks sooooooooo stupid and annoying and almost amateurish, so I'd really like to know what the director saw in this technique. When I look at his latest film, Black Hawk Dawn, there is absolutely nothing wrong with the battle scenes (which are numerous) and are very intense and focused with skills. The entire final in G.I. Jane looks ugly and is nothing more than stupid and mindless shooting and killing. <br /> <br /> This is Ridley Scott's worst film, in my opinion, and there are no significant accents that the great director is known for. Still, I'm happy that I've seen it in a panoramic format, because there are some great scenes and examples of Scott's abilities, but there are very few of them in this movie. <br /> <br /> Disappointment and nothing compared to the classics (Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, Alien and so on ...) of this talented director. So I'm forced to give G.I. Jane 4/10.
