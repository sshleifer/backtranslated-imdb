It was interesting how accurate the letter was about the whispered words of maniacs, but very naive in the corporate world. The Justice Department will catch more giant giants if they do such naive things to win. The real corporate world is much more subtle and interesting, yet equally sinister. I seriously doubt that EVERYONE will actually kill someone; even the mod is now more indirect. In the real world, they kill people with nicotine, impurities, additives, poisons, etc. This film had to be developed by some garage maniacs, I think, and the studies did not know the difference. They just wanted to use Microsoft's antitrust case in the news.
