As others have pointed out, this movie is a load of pretentious excitement for mindless or masochistic. <br /> <br /> We all know that after seeing the train and home with acids, Scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world. But unlike trainspotting and acid house without a good dose of humor or realistic realism, movies like this do not work. And more importantly, without a decent script, the movie will not work and there is nothing new, inspiring or inspiring to think about the script for this movie. <br /> <br /> The fact that this movie won a few Bafta shows, how bad the British film industry is at the moment. I thought that the film industry in Aussie is quite bad at the moment, but unfortunately the British industry is even worse. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that I would not even bother to borrow it from the weekly section. > <br /> Do yourself a favor and give this film a lot of space.
