When I saw this movie on FearNet, I thought it would be a scary movie. Apparently it was not like that. I have no idea how this video was allowed to be placed on this site. FearNet is a site that shows horrific horrors. <br /> <br /> Acting is great from all actors. I hated this story. The story was stupid. The film begins with a man with a signified word on it. It breaks the seal and some disasters happen. The water turns into blood, the oceans are dying out, the moon turns red, etc. <br /> <br /> The female character was also irritating. Many of the things she did did not make sense. Like when she sees a piece of paper with a date. Incidentally, it is the date when she expects a child to be born, and she begins to get mad at it and starts to examine it and ask religious people what it all means. <br /> <br /> * Alert Spoiler * <br /> <br /> The two worst things that happened in this movie are the execution of a mentally handicapped man who claimed that God had told him to murder his parents and the end, in which Demi Moore dies after giving birth to a child and transferring his soul to him. br /> <br /> Here's what's going on. A mentally handicapped person is shot and killed, and the apocalypse begins. Demi Moore goes to the hospital in the middle of a huge earthquake and gives birth to her child. He touches the child's head, bringing the soul to the child, and then dies. Then the apocalypse stops. <br /> <br /> Why does God suddenly change his heart? He becomes angry when the governor allows the execution of a mentally handicapped man, and then it comes to forgiveness when a lonely woman transfers her soul to her child? <br /> <br /> * Finish Spoiler * <br /> <br /> The movie is quite stupid. This is another religious end to the propaganda world. Acting Demi Moore and Michael Biehn and everyone else is perfect. That's all. <br /> <br /> I give this film 2 stars for 10. A good game with lots of nonsense!
