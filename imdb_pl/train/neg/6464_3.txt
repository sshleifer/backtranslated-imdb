Watching Marlene Brando on the screen is like watching a master carpenter carving complicated details into a piece of mahogany. Acting Brando is ONLY the thing that makes this movie look like. The story is obscene and ridiculous (not comical). Other great actors seem to be desperately trying to give character figures a touch of humanity ... these characters have a human nature of wet cardboard. Everything about the technical side of this movie is either average or just awful. The director throws shots with slow motion and in slow motion. Casual music is cartoony and destroys all traces of dramatic effect. This is not something I really look for in the movie, but even the wardrobe was far away. The worthless Brando could not tear himself away from the terrible rags in which they had dressed him. I heard that this movie is called "David Lynch-esquire" and "extremely funny" ... it is not. David Lynch's films have a wretched creativity - this film was by no means creative. And do not confuse respect with stupidity.
