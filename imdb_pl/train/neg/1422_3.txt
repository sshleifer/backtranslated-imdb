The original series of Lensman's novels is a classic of the genre. It's pure adventure with SF with some substance (here and there) and I always wondered why Hollywood did not film it literally, because it's the kind of thing that they love: huge explosions, super weapons, heroic heroism, the hero gets a girl, aliens (great CGI potential), good versus evil in the purest form, etc. etc. Instead (and remember that I am a fan of Japanese o-phile and anime) we get this frightening movie about children, who bursts the guts of the story, gets mixed up in Star-Wars ( ironic, because the latter from time to time ripped off the book) paste and fool the whole thing to the level of "Thundercats". To see Kimball Kinnison, the personification of the Galactic Patrol officer and the second stage of Lensman depicted as a small boy is pathetic (etc.). I just can not understand why the producers did it because they obviously had the right to this story and could have earned much more money (FAR!), Simply put. It does not make sense.
