I am sorry, but I will ruin both the story and the end, hoping to avoid a vacation fiasco, like the one I'm meeting now. The father dies, and the mother asks Santa Claus in a letter to bring him back to his family for Christmas ... and Santa is doing it. Dad is peach, happy, healthy and completely unaware that he died. Everything ends sweetly. <br /> <br /> But as a parent who recently watched as my five-year-old loses the best dog friend, it was a horror story. Now my son is convinced that all he needs to do to restore his buddy is to ask Santa Claus! Do not underestimate the willpower of the young heart - no amount of persuasion will convince him that it is just a movie and that his dog is NOT coming back for Christmas. Breakthrough was to observe his joy only to know that on Christmas Eve he would have to face his loss anew. <br /> <br /> Shame on behalf of all believers who have recently lost their loved one. It is difficult to deal with a loss once for a child, but there are a few wishes that we should not even present them as opportunities.
