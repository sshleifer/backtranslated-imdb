Simply put, it is a simplified and one-dimensional film. The title of "The Rise to Evil" should say that it will have nothing to do with the character of Hitler. Rather than the first minutes of the film, in which we see Hitler looking at evil in bad background music, we get a view of Hitler, who portrays him as a super-wizard who is seemingly torn out of a Saturday morning television program. The movie REALLY wants to make his case bad, but does anyone need a movie to convince them that Hitler was angry? In the end, making it so uniformly bad character is both boring and misleading (you have to ask how an inept, ficycotic figure in a cold movie persuades a nation to follow him or be called a man of the year). This movie had a great opportunity to take a character who committed some of the most terrible acts in the 20th century and try to delve into his mind. Instead, he simply says: "Hey! Hitler was angry! I just thought you wanted to know ... "over and over again. The great irony is that the film was still being attacked for presenting a very nice view of the character. Give me a break.
