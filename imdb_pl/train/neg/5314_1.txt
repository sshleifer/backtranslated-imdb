Music grinding on the nerves like nails on the board, playing such zombielike, it was a pity to waste the cast without making a second movie; throwing all of them as real zombies - with Sabrina's cast as a teenage witch as heroes ... a movie so terrible that if the "stoners" were still around, it could be considered a cult movie - but, oh, yes, amateur, scripts they might as well have been worn by actors, their lines were read as they slowly passed through the movie --- banal, illogical sets modeled on LA divisions, props straight from ToysRus! Have you ever made a movie that is so completely and completely unsuccessful? Logic flies in the wind in this struggle, senseless, aimless and with a "monster" so stupid and uncoordinated that it can not catch a turtle in an ice refrigerator - low, long legged --- and amazon! He kept my attention all the time; the way a horrible, continuous chain accident in the fog involving many vehicles lasts to the end ... as, after a funny fight on a ray in prison on another planet, a sexy and mentally unbalanced bounty hunter with a pneumatic handicap of a delayed alien escapee - -- TO THE GROUND! Do not let anyone pop into your popcorn, you can really enjoy watching it. It's so bad!
