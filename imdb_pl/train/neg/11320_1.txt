someone had to pay for the car ... it's really awful ... makes the cyborg Jean Claude look like it's abandoned with the wind ... this is the hour that I would like to be able to ask for a return ... thankfully it caused it's a serious sleepiness ... from which I fell asleep. how can the actors of this caliber create this dog? I would rather spend time looking at algae growing on the edge of the aquarium than to participate in this terrible mixture of several species. I now use the DVD as a stand on my coffee table. $ 5.99 in walmart is definitely too much for this movie ... if you really have to have it, wait for it to be thrown away after you wear it in your inventory for a few years and be frustrated that they will not sell. br /> <br /> I am asking for love for God, let this film die of oblivion.
