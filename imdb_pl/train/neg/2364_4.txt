"Freddy's Dead" did the wisest thing he could do after disappointing with the fifth movie. It started from scratch. Sure, this "last" movie in the saga is stupid, but at least original. Some of the visual elements are breathtaking. And the story of Freddy's kid (Lisa Zane) returning to the city to face the evil father is unique. <br /> <br /> In general, a movie is nothing but a cartoon creation for children in the theater. He has a group of good actors (Zane, Yaphet Kotto and Lezlie Deane) who basically look stupid and wander like sheep ready for slaughter. It's one-sided, it's a magic trick, and in the end it's just stupid, childish entertainment. <br /> <br />
