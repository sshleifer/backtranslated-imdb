I did not agree with any Left Behind theology, but nevertheless I found thrilling books and read 8 out of 12 of them. Undeniably good writing and interesting story. However, I did not have too high expectations for the film. There was no way that the Hollywood mainstream would take the Christian series and produce a large budget. So it was done independently ... and I felt that I was watching a really long TV show. It just did not feel like a movie; he did not have this "experience" if anyone knows what I'm talking about. That is why the film suffered because of this, and the low budget, weak special effects were another obstacle for me. <br /> <br /> Besides, I think that Gordon Currie was pitifully mistaken as Nicolie Carpathia. Reading the book, I had the impression that NC was this charming, dazzling, incredibly handsome guy who spoke English with almost zero accent. I imagined someone like Pierce Brosnan in this role. Instead, they found some of Aiken's clay neck, which looks like a month's employee from Best Buy, and gave him a really bad false accent. So I lost a few stars for me. The movie simply is not convincing when the main villain does not look or sound like it should. <br /> <br /> Acting was fine, but there is nothing to write about. Some scenes - like one of the conversion scenes (I do not remember which one) - were real squirmers for me. And some of the Christian rock music, or whatever it was, was really out of place in some scenes, like in the one with Kirk Cameron praying in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> In short, there was a bad movie, but he did not do it for me. Stick to books, people, it's much better.
