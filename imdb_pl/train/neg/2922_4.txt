Take young, nice people, put them in an exotic place, hold on to some bad guys, let the two main characters find romance after a few heavy breathing scenes, create the most delicate threads, and then work out a happy ending for all (except three or four who were murdered , of course) It's a classic (and successful) Romance Harlequin format. It is not very good, but it is not very bad, like most small yellow pocket books. Of particular interest is the location in Budapest, even if they did not use the great old train station (designed by Gustave Eifel) or did not show the famous thermal baths in the city.
