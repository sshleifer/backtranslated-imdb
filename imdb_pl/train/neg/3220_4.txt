I absolutely hate it when the movie completely falls apart at the end, after you've invested in this hour. and so it happened with this movie. I was intrigued by his actors and the fact that Malamud wrote his source story. I did not go to read the story, but I can not imagine that it will end when this movie ends. Fortunately, I did not pay good money to see or rent them, because my library had them. ohhhh such a waste of perfect acting (especially the wife was so perfect), but nice o'shea as a Jew? !!!! NOW IT was fun. I did not study its creation, but it played as if the director lost his balls or died three-quarters of the way through the movie. Before that moment, history and characters were developing, there were many neat feature points and not much time was wasted. but oh, it lasted half an hour - if it was not the innermost, most worthless solution I've ever seen, I do not know what it is. I just hate it when faith is so destroyed; it feels like an act of violence.
