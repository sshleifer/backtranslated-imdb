Three criminals with a low level of life, led by Matt Dillon, fall into burglary at night. They run away, but they quickly cross with the police who are just in the process of pursuing a terrorist. Of course, the police are confusing a gang of burglars with a terrorist, a real terrorist escapes, and burglars are forced to take refuge in a small bar dive, taking hostages, not knowing why the police want to catch them so badly. And guess who else chose the bar as a sanctuary for the night? <br /> <br /> Incredible? Absolutely. And from there it descends from the hill. Spacey gained a lot of acting talent; Matt Dillon, Faye Dunaway, Gary Sinise, Viggo Mortensen and M. Emmett Walsh, but all are wasted. Mainly because after all the characters are stuck in the bar, everything they do in the rest of the movie is contradictory. No end and no purpose. Long before the end of the movie you stopped wondering what was happening to them.
