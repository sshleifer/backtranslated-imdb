Well. Astronaut Steve West sits in a plastic space capsule, commenting that "you did not live until you saw the sun through Saturn's rings", while the window runs through the obvious sunlight in the middle of the day when you suddenly have nosebleeds. Then West returns home in a secret hospital, a melting jelly mass that rages and makes the massive nurse run through a fake glass door. Apparently the West "gets stronger when it's melting", which is about as much sense as in this hopelessly clean, club-shaped brain. Then this "silly" Army Brass, who looks a bit like Coleman Francis (director of many evil moovies), tries to hide information, but goo man runs around killing everyone he sees because he is melting. He attacks the arguing old pair because it melts. He makes one horrible actress scream and moan helplessly for about 10 minutes because it melts. It melts because it melts. Fx depressing Rick Baker is supposed to be a star, but they just look like hokey. The film is poorly filmed and everything looks so dark and confused that it is very difficult to understand what is - not that it helps. MooCow says who cut the cheese with this one? : = 8P ps - "You did not get any crackers?"
