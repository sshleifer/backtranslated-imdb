As a fan of horror, I try to see all the significant novelties of this genre, especially those that are products of my home cinema. And I can say that "Power of Fear" (or "Vedma" as a Russian title) is one of the weakest of them. First of all, he can not scare even a small child, he walks so slowly and so predictably that there is no room for a real horror. To be honest, it's bad at all points: from a stupid plot (I do not know why the Russian producers / director decided to transform the classic story of Ukrainian witchcraft into some bad and funny thriller of modern America.) I completely agree with the previous reviewer - this is not an exciting experience ) and the horrible and tacky work of the actors. All the actors, including the leading Valeri Nikolayev and Yevgeniya Kryukova, who are quite well-known in Russia, look like wooden dolls or something like that and it seems to me that they did not even bother to play at all, they only spoke English without no expression. And finally, I do not really understand why they filmed this film in English with Russian actors? I think it was their bad turn. At least they could cast some American or English actors for the main roles to make them look more convincing. I can say the same about the so-called "Small American urban environments" that were shot in Estonia and look like this. The only positive moment I found in "Power of Fear" are visual effects. They are not perfect, but rather good for the Russian film. And the music is fine, at least it does not irritate me. That's why I give it two stars. In general, if you want to see a good horror movie? do not waste time and money on this boring movie. And if you're looking for something that claims to be a Russian horror movie, I suggest you find a copy of "Viy or The Spirit of Evil". It's really a great movie based on the same novel as "Power of Fear", but much, much better.
