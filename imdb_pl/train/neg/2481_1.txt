I have never heard of Larry Fessenden before, but judging by this effort in writing and directing, he should keep his daily work as a journeyman. Like many others here, I do not know how to categorize this movie, it was not terrifying or scary, so you can not call it a horror movie, the plot was so thin that it can not be a drama, there was no tension, so it can not be a thriller it's just a bad movie that you should only see if you're a fan of the Blair witch project. People who liked this movie used words such as "ambiguity", complex and subtle, but they read something that was not there. Like Blair the witch, people got scared because people assumed they should be afraid and buy something that was terrifying. This movie started well from the "meeting" of the family with the locals after hitting the deer. It seemed to be the day of modern liberation, but then for the next 45 minutes (more than half of the film) nothing happened, the family reported about their holiday home, which was very nice and elegant, but not the least amusement. It was obvious that the locals would be involved in some way at some stage, but Essendon apparently has no idea how to build tension in the film. In the end, when something happens, it is not even known how the father was shot, how he dies (the nurse said his liver was just grazed) and all the time this spirit wendigo is apparently tracking the shooter in a very clumsy way with special effects 3 class. The film is called Wendigo, but I am not trying to explain it in any clear way, the film ends with all the wrong ones and leaves me very dissatisfied, I would have jumped out with 15 minutes, but I wanted to see if this movie can be realized. No.
