A "real" story about three girls who go to the Connecticut wilderness and end up hunting for a maniac in the woods. It's a movie that would play in America thirty years ago to gain mixed recognition. Not much of what the movie works with a low budget to get mixed results. The film is visible, but it is not terrifying (it blames some of the attack scenes). It's the kind of movie you'll probably forget about when you're done. You'll probably never think about it unless someone gives it to you and says, "watch here", which happened to me. If you get a copy, give it back, the film is not worth the effort to see it, even if it is visible.
