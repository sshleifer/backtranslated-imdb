I watched this movie on March 21 this year. I must say disappointment. But much better than "Tridev". The movie is hackneyed.Tells about Prabhat, who lives with his father, wife and his younger brother. The film opens when she saves the bride. Anyway. Agghar Jhurhad makes a conspiracy to kill his young brother. He makes a plan by sending a few people. They come to school pretending to be friends of Prabhat√≥w. Kill this kid. His father throws him out of the house. Then he returns. .Ie and Aakash go to Kenya to find him. Sunny gives a good performance, Chunky was annoying at best, Naseerdun is wasted. Divya did well, Sonam was wasted, Jyotsna was wasted, but he looked sweet. The kid who played Sunnys' brother in the movie was cute.Too sad he had to get his character killed. The girl was sweet but annoying. Another child did well. Alok did well. Kiran was right. Amrish and Gulshan did well. The photos are excellent in both India and Kenya. Script is weak, but has some good dialogs. It also drags. Movie. The music was fine. I liked only one song "Saat Samundar", the lyrics were good. Other songs were forgotten. Do not watch this. Rating-3/10
