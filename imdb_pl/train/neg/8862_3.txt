From the moment Christopher Lee puts on a pair of punk sunglasses and tries to sneak into a punk rock club, you know you've got a stink on your head! This movie had potential. Under the sludge there are remains of what could be created in a decent film, if not interesting. The final product, however, is a real mess. In addition to free nudity and some very attractive women, Howling II ends with a ridiculous excuse for horror. Christopher Lee gives him a lump of credibility, but even he can not raise it beyond the level of nonsense. <br /> <br /> He has never seen any of the other films in this series, this critic will have to accept the value on the face that this is a real continuation of the events from the first part. We start with the funeral of one of the characters from the original, and in the first ten minutes we are in Transylvania with a small group of heroes ready to fight the werewolf's coven. The film is quite well-moved and there are not many dead spots. The action is there; it's just not well filmed. The bright point is the music of the punk band Babel. Although their song is played quite often, it is rather catchy. <br /> <br /> Problems with this movie are very numerous. First of all, acting is worse than pathetic. Christopher Lee is good enough, but it ends. The two leaders Reb Brown and Annie McEnroe miss almost everything you want for such characters. The letter is miserable, redundant editing, and the amateur direction. There are a few cool tricks with special effects, but those bad ones that weigh a lot of them. Sybil Danning is nice to watch, but her performance is less than satisfactory. Judd Omen looks like a game, but his voice and acting are at least unconvincing. Many dialogues are in an unintelligible language that can be Latin. <br /> <br /> I liked the general idea of ​​history. I always like stories of true believers who fight against the seemingly invincible forces of evil. One scene in which a small group of good guys wanders through the dark forest and shoots down a group of werewolves is even exciting. Type. Perhaps a bigger budget or better director would make the rest of the movie more convincing. 3 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound. <br /> <br /> Additional Note: At the time of writing, the censors on youtube.com still did not remove the end credits from Sybil Danning, ripping off several times when playing Babel! Catch him until you can!
