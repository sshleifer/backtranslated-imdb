With Adam Sandler. <br /> <br /> This is without a doubt one of the most idiotic films in history. It's about the waiter of the cruise ship Shecky (Sandler) who wants to be a comedian on a cruise ship. First of all, there is not one funny or wise line in the whole movie. It is so indecent that it is pathetic. Surprisingly little is the primitive or sexual humor, but the word "f" is abundant. The budget is really low and it also ruins the movie. It takes place on a cruise ship, but it seems that they only had money to rent a small boat and they only had money for 10 additional vessels, one of which is Billy Bob Thornton. Initial loans are animated cheaply and simply pathetic. I hate this movie and everyone who sees it can not stand it either. <br /> <br /> 86 minutes. rated R for language.
