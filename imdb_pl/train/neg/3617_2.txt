Really, really a bad movie. A psychotic person escapes from asylum. Three years later, he kills a professor of sociology, the end of the stage. Yesterday's semester later (hey, that's the title card) at school is a new professor of sociology. He makes friends with another professor of sociology who works there, and begins to meet with another professor. Students are bored, just like us. <br /> <br /> There are many title cards showing how much time has passed. The scenes are quite short and cut to other characters elsewhere, which means that there is no progress. Many scenes involve characters walking and talking, sitting and talking. Despite the passage of time, many characters always wear the same clothing. Sometimes the vague passage of time means that when we see the body a second time, we ask ourselves: how long has the body been there? What's more, at least one of the dead people does not seem to be missed by others. <br /> <br /> The killers manage to kill one person by stabbing her in the chest, and the other by inserting into the crotch, and the other by cutting the forehead. Is his knife poisoned or something like that? <br /> <br /> There is a cheerleader on the cover of the video box: there are none in the movie. On the back cover there is a photo of someone in a hat and gown with a dangerous group of women in a dorm room. The main redhead in the picture is in the movie, but no one ever wears this outfit and there is no such scene. The killer is strictly one on one.
