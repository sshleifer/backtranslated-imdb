I should have listened. I was warned, and yet I paid for it, after reading all the reviews, after learning the original is "so bad, that it is good", and part 2 does not fit into this category at all, and even then I could not resist. Exactly what happened here? Part one was fun, it had so many political misgivings, and another Crazy, Fat Entertainment and this one just can not be an inferior sequel to God's green land, not Case 2, hell, even Troll 2. This is really the worst sequel in history and it really says something about the groundbreaking original features of the original. Criminally Insane part 2 was just a completely different brand of bad guys. Filmed on video, zero points, zero entertainment value, 1/3 consists of a retrospective of the original, and in addition crazy, fat Ethel lost part of her circuit. I mean, honestly, is this some sick joke?!? Many thanks, Nick Milliard. 1/1
