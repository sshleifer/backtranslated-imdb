There are many good things that can be said about this cartoon; the backgrounds are rich, exuberantly colorful and full of nicely made art deco details. Animation is consistent with the usual study standards of those times, which are undoubtedly higher than contemporary ones. However, I find it boring for many reasons. <br /> <br /> Music: Certainly not compatible with Scott Bradley's standard standards. Although it is likely to resemble the scenery of "The Great Gatsby", it ends in a gloomy, dreamy, repetitive and monotonous (repetitive and monotonous is not the same as confirmed by Beethoven's V Symphony). Because most people (including me) tend to close their eyes when they yawn, there is a lot of visual part of the cartoon that will be overlooked by the average viewer. <br /> <br /> The Storyline: I'm not giving away secrets that are not yet in the summary of the plot - good for the country, bad city. It is a common theme in films, both animated and live from this era. This is a mistaken nostalgia for a non-existent rural idyll, which nowadays is reflected in a similar nostalgia for "values" that never existed.
