How this movie may overlook so many fascinating, complex and mysterious aspects of the original story or the original movie is truly remarkable. Incredibly thin and uninteresting plot, ankle character / motivation and really awful soundtrack (replacing the tension with huge noise, replacing the mysterious musical references of the original for digitized accidents and roars.) Then there are specific references to the original that are only "wrapped" over the cracks ... Horrible In a world where the uncompromising, brain-dead remixes of The Italian Job (a tear appears), Get Carter (sobriety uncontrollably) and Alfie desecrate our screens, this one brings the proverbial sponge cake. Small nonsense. Like Ellen Burstyn has ever got involved in it, miracle ... Garbage.
