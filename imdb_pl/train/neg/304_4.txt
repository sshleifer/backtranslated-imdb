This film presents Ruth as a feminine, hard, drinking, gambling, overeating sports figure with a small baseball thrown in. Early life Babe Ruths was quite interesting and it was for all intents and purposes in this movie. In addition, Lou Gehrig was barely covered and it was a well-known relationship, good bad or indifferent, it should have been covered better than it was. His life was more than bad. He was an American hero, an icon that many baseball players formed later. I feel honest about the memories of a great baseball player that he completely ignored. Shame the creators of this film for using its disadvantages, not its size.
