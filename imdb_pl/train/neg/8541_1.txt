Welcome to film 17 about 50-year-old chilling ones. Where we will see is true. Another movie that absolutely does not make sense. Seriously, this movie had me so confused at the end, I thought I was watching "At Dawn they Sleep." The plot seems quite simple ... well, this is up to 3 seconds of the movie in which the girl supposedly killed the cat, and then ... um ... explode? I have no idea what happened. and it was BEFORE THE SCREEN TITLE. It's really sad when I can not even say what happened in the first 3 minutes. <br /> <br /> In any case, it's a photographer with a big mustache who finds this girl after dropping his second girlfriend on the way to taking pictures of something somewhere. so we'll get there, but before someone steals a jeep, it will pass him 200 feet towards the city. suspect? nah. they decide to stay in this abandoned village with one older lady. and then blah blah things happen and blah blah blah. The mustache guy comes out of the fog for some reason, although the old lady does not tell him. He gets lost and then finds his way back. <br /> <br /> Oh, I forgot to mention that this is all after the unbelievably meaningless 20 minutes of their stay in the house of a guy who looks like this guy with a Casablanca stroller. Then they leave. This scene does not make sense. It's really just a complement. if you break it, nobody would notice or care. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately, it was the best part of the movie. wait. let me reformulate it. REALLY it was the best part of the movie. because the rest is so confusing that I had to look at IMDb to find out what happened. But of course no one else knows that, I'm SOL. <br /> <br /> Seriously, the last 30 minutes of the movie are some of the most immersive moments I've ever seen in a movie. Dress her in a dress, she's kidnapped, then released, goes back home, and finally the witches are at home and it ends? seriously. I've almost never been so lost in the movie. I mean, it's as bad as movies like "War of the Robots", at least it's SENSE. this movie does not even make ATTEMPT consistent. the ending was as confusing as the end of "Sleeping at dawn", and the plot was much more boring. This movie gets 1 only for "I have no idea what happened in this movie". "The Mountain of the Witches" receives 1 confused observer of the movie from 10.
