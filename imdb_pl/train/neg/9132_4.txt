The magic plot of Dr. Fu Manchu with the participation of Peter Sellers in a parody of characters created by Sax Rohmer is an injustice to the end of the career of the Sellers. The plot was very simplified, and if it was done in the right way, it could be well served, but instead it was badly made. One of the reasons why this movie was not so good was a bad dialogue, cheap laughs, uncertain directing and the awkward feeling that the movie is a bit incomplete. <br /> <br /> Acting on the other hand was really the only thing that interested me during this confused picture. I found that Sellers presents a diabolical Manchu perfectly made, with occasional lines that will be remembered. For example, there is a scene where Fu Manchu is confused, which one is the one in which he says, "Ah, you all look the same to me." I hate to admit it, but I laughed at this line. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, a handful of strong supporting characters really caught my attention with Helen Mirren like a constabulary in the back, David Tomilson Sir Roger Avery (also his last movie, no way to end his career) and Sid Ceasar (who gives a rather capricious appearance of Al Capone's relative who works for the FBI). These characters also watched me. <br /> <br /> The sets were also nice. Oriental projects and English society in 1933. They were presented with elegance in this painting. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I advise you to watch a movie if you are a Peter Seller or Sidem Fan Caesar. Otherwise it will be better if you decide to chew aluminum foil.
