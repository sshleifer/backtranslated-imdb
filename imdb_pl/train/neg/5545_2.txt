"Revolt of the Zombies" proves that thanks to the same director, the reorganization and recycling of an idea does not necessarily result in a double lightning strike. <br /> <br /> The Halperin brothers, responsible for the horror of "White Zombie", have done trashy litter just a few years later to earn his popularity and even regain the eye-catching Lugosi's eyes from the previous movie. There was a court battle with the owners of the rights to the movie "White Zombie" who did not want the Halperins to use the word "zombies" in this title. This word was the only thing that could help this movie because, as everyone knows, bad movies can make much more money simply when the word "Zombie" appears in the title. Knowing that Victor Halperin was capable of a few years earlier makes this uninteresting movie more offensive. It looks like he never directed another horror movie after this defeat. Zombies here do not seem to be real corpses, but simply victims of hypnosis. <br /> <br /> Do you want to create a mind-controlled zombie army? Get ready to break some eggs, including your own. <br /> <br /> LAME PLOT: A man falls in love with an intriguing woman who plays with the heart and is engaged to him only to make his friend whom he loves jealous. It sends a man into a spiral of madness in which he tries to use zombie mind control techniques to change things to his advantage, trying to get a woman who is not worth spitting. <br /> <br /> This also applies to women from the most obvious story events I have ever seen. You would have to be blind or stupid not to see the end. Acting is not even good. This movie makes it insensitive to the race "King of the Zombies" (which appeared on the same double DVD that I bought) seems like a climatic masterpiece of horror compared to it and reminds us that not every black and white film is classic. This makes the "Invisible Invaders" festival from the sci-fi era of the atomic era a serious drama. It is one big ball of cheese, so absurdly melodramatic that it could probably do many Korean movie fans (South Korean movies are often known for using melodrama). In the lists, the Favorite Films company was ironically named. I'm not sure if it would be a favorite movie, but of course they are idiots. <br /> <br /> Not recommended for fans: zombies, romance or classic movies.
