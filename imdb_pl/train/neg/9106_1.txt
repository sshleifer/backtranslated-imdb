From the very beginning you will see how much they tried to imitate the very wise and powerful "cruel intentions" and how flat it landed. You'll also notice how terrible the choice was, by casting Robin Dunne as Valmont ... In the second scene, you meet the two best things in this movie, Amy Adams and Mimi Rogers as Kathryn and her mother. I mean, if you manage to avoid the fact that Kathryn was not blonde in the first movie ... And then the movie goes on, you see a cheap romantic story from many years ago and you noticed that Sebastian had already met Anette, here Danielle, and Cecile , here called Cherie ... How original it is for the prequel. Then it turns into a low-budget movie "Wild Things" with lots of "my phrases". As I mentioned, Robin Dunne was a very bad choice. Not that he's a bad actor, he's good ... He just does not have the charisma Ryan did. Amy Adams, who is in my opinion one of the most talented young actresses of our time, once again provides. But with all the talent in the world there is no way to save this basket. All in all, this "movie" seems to be an episode of "Beverly Hills, 90210". The score was stolen from "Cruel Intentions" and "Jawbreaker" ... Yes, they used the score from JAWBREAKER ... Could they at least leave the same ?! You will want to pass this one. If you want more cruel intentions, watch Stephen Frears' Dangerous Relationships.
