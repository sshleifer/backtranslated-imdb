Never watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Trying to be a trick in scifi / thriller movies from the '50s and' 60s, but everything he has achieved makes you really want to watch one of them. <br /> <br /> It's very bad. The parody must have some aspect that has a somewhat above-average quality. This film does not have this aspect. <br /> <br /> Sign up. It's too late for me, but ... just do not watch.
