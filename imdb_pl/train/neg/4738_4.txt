I loved watching the original Azumi with his mix of live manga, fascinating storyline, cool soundtrack, direction (Kitamura rocks!), Edition and not to mention the beautiful Aya Ueto, which perfectly fulfilled this role. So I really could not wait to meet with Azumi 2, but after I finally saw it, I felt like I won the lotto and lost the ticket :( Azumi 2 goes up where Azumi interrupted, but these are completely 2 different films The pace is much slower, the action is not so exciting and well choreographed and there is not much character development, which apparently was directed by the same guy responsible for further downgrading the TOHO monster series (if possible!) I agree with several previous reviewers who say it was a lost opportunity. If only Ryuhei Kitamura continued this part, there is a beautiful Japanese forest scenery that can be seen when slow action unfolds and we are too short to be introduced to bit characters who are quickly killed. bad guys are too easily killed without fighting too much. Fighting with the guy Spider (straight from the episode Monkey!) In the bamboo forest concerned an unforgettable battle scene. In Azumi 1 we had a climactic scene fighting the effects of the camera barrel, Azumi 2 brought us a camera with cape Azumi !! Azumi's madness at the end was unconvincing, but Aya is still doing a good job. She looks great in a cape ... but where did she get it from? I do not think I will watch this movie over and over again! ...what a pity.
