As others have said, "No, Luciano" is a more accurate title or response to this film title. For fun, a great opera singer should stick to the singing ..... not that he is a terrible actor. It just stinks. <br /> <br /> The first 25 minutes were fine - a nice family movie, as it was in reality - but then it's nothing but a boring soap opera. <br /> <br /> According to the singer, Pavarotti, as "Giorgio Fini", loses her voice several times, and the doctor "Pamela Taylor" (Kathryn Harrold) comes to the rescue. The singer falls on the doctor, the doctor slowly runs into the singer, they both argue all the time and further and further and further. <br /> <br /> Pavarotti has a winning smile and is a nice guy. Harrold is spoiling things and after seeing her here I am not surprised that she has not become a star. <br /> <br /> The film has a nice scenery, good photos of San Francisco and Italy, at least in the first half of the movie. I'm bored and I do not remember much about the second half.
