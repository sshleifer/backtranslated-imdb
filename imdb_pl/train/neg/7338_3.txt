I watched this movie, hoping to find a nice and interesting story, but the plot was not good at all. The actors' play was not better. <br /> <br /> Of course, Shahrukh Khan was there, but he was not enough to make this movie "credible" and interesting. <br /> <br /> I read that this movie was based on Flaubert's novel "Madame Bovary", but for me I did not see that it suited the Indian mentality. <br /> <br /> Generally, we're buying a movie to dream and have a good time not to waste our time and change our mood. I just can not understand how he can get such a "high" voice with an average of 6.8 / 10. <br /> <br /> So this is the kind of movie that you should run away and ignore, because there is nothing to appreciate in this! You just waste your time, unless you like "dark film" with "strange and unreasonable history."
