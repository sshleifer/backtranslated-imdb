I bought this film from a discount on the used Gamestop film, and the cover made me laugh out of control, so I bought it for 99 cents. The movie itself is delayed and is used as ten different monkeys throughout the movie, which hardly look the same. Not to mention that they use a stunt double, who is just a short guy in a suit desperately trying to impersonate a monkey. <br /> <br /> The director probably committed murder-suicide with chimpanzees after the film debut in the preview of other low-rent Warner Bros movies. Nor does he help that he was not even infamous because of the horrible work he did, he was not even known for producing a pile of poetry. <br /> <br /> Why was this film made?
