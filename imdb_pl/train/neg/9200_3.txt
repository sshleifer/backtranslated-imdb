One wonders how the script came about. <br/> <br /> Wayne and other artists do a good job, but because it's not a comedy, a romantic thriller or anything else, it's all rather disappointing. <br /> <br /> It feels like one of the threads has been implemented, it could have been something valuable. Nevertheless, it is interesting to see a real turkey from history, which was created just before the direct involvement of the US in the war. I wonder if the surrounding politics had something to do with trying to make a movie for all tastes, but with something that nobody likes. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it has a historical value.
