It's just like other Dracula movies, Dracula's servants always on Dracula's side, which disappointed me at the end. Regardless of whether a person wants to become a vampire or not, I would like to see something like that in the first movie in which the servant fights with his master. This is very interesting (because you can almost predict how this story goes) than just a priest or D. they win the game (we need surprising threads!).
