Okay, so introducing, with his hokey offer of a free coffin for anyone who dies of horror during the movie, is so bad that it is ridiculous. And so the first "skull scene" is so stretched and unstable that it is fun. The actual plot of the film is quite decent, there is at least some real food to rethink in the characters' behavior, and the turn of the action is decent, like in horror movies. Acting is average, not entirely bad. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this movie does not seem to be quite the same as the 1/10 film. It is not terrible enough to get the lowest score, and even the second lowest. If I just read the script, I would say it could be a decent movie. It was this horrible direction and production that ruined the film. So it's a bad movie, but it's much worse.
