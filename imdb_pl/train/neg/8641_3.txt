Grand Central Murder (1942) Directed by S. Sylvan Simon <br /> <br /> Production: MGM <br /> <br /> This average mystery "B" was one of only five films released in 1942 with Simon as director. He could certainly fit another Red Skelton movie or two in his set! In any case, Grand Central Murder is a shameless rip-off of Thin Man movies minus wit, charm and track chemistry. We are treated like a paper plot that can barely last 73 minutes, bad acting and tired gags. <br /> <br /> Van Heflin and Virginia Gray are playing Nick and Nara Char - er, Rocky and Butch Custer. He is PI and she is his wife and partner. They engage in humorous jokes with each other. See? This is completely different. Heflin is the only one who points to bigger and better things here, although he is really close to being a jerk. Virginia Gray was in Another Thin Man, but again, I will emphasize THIS FILM IS NOT NEVER, not sir. And just in case, if we started thinking that this movie is nothing but another movie (say THIN MAN) that we really like, Sam Levene appears as the main detective who is quite depressed and must make Van Heflin subtly he directed him to all important directions. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> Quickly, "murder" is the murderous schemer Mida King who likes to turn into rich men until he finds a richer one. He plays Patricia Dane, which is like Hedy Lamarr in version C, until he opens his mouth and changes into F. There are a lot of crazy suspects, all with their own motivation that they want Mida's death. There is a type of society, hard talking ladies, bandits, former lover and shady theatrical impresario (Tom Conway, here bearing the unlikely name of the character "Frankie Ciro"). Roman Bohnen plays a nervous, shaky type, which I think he could have done earlier. Millard Mitchell plays an idiot cop who, on the run, who does not want to quit, can not stop thinking about a piece of donkey he was waiting for when the case is closed (yes, Millard Mitchell, swordsman). Finally, in a completely groundbreaking story-telling method, something we've never seen before, all suspects gather in one place where they tell their stories (in retrospect) to the detective, as Rocky takes mental notes, and eventually he is forced to dramatic confession. <br/> <br /> In addition to the actual image being a dud, I thought naively that there might be some photos from the actual Grand-era from 1942 Central, but unfortunately not. At the beginning there is only one very short shot. Thanks for nothing, Grand Central Murder. In conclusion, a bit strange pattern, but Heflin was fine. <br /> <br /> * Â½ of 4
