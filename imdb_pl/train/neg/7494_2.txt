That word "Truth" in the title of this movie made my alarm ringing. They rang louder when the title page referred to the civil war in America as a "war between states" (bypass preferred by staunch southerners). Jesse James - a thief, slave and murderer - is described as a quiet, gentle farmer. <br /> <br /> How unfair is this movie? There is no mention of slavery, let alone the documented fact that poor mother Jesse James had slaves before the war and that Jesse and his brother Frank actively fought for slavery. According to this film, all these civil war soldiers really struggled to decide if Missouri is a northern or southern state ... that's all. (Missouri: It's a sweet mint! It's a peppermint breath!) Black people are completely absent in this movie, except for two flashes of beggars, one of which bears the sign "HELP OF WEAK", which is very unbelievably hand-folded. (Some photos of nineteenth-century newspapers are also inaccurate, with XX-century type fonts.) <br /> <br /> This video has a strange flashback structure. There is a very impressive stunting (and some great stunt work) and one perfect assembly. I relished one line of dialogue: "Some of these boys will never try beans anymore." The film presents several facts: Agnes Moorehead, as the mother of Jesse, hides his right hand in the scenes after Pinkerton's raids (called "Remington" here), in which Jesse James's real mother suffered injuries requiring the amputation of her lower arm. Some errors are excusable here: during the days of bushings, Jesse James accidentally fired part of the left middle finger, but Robert Wagner (in the title role) has no stumpfinger. I saw a picture of the real wife of Jesse James; if she looked just as charming as Hope Lange in this movie, Jesse James could stay at home more. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of revisionism here, and most of the male actors have hairstyles from the 1950s. But many mistakes of this movie could have been avoided. The mentioned mentor Jesse James William Quantrill is mentioned several times, but all actors mistakenly pronounce his name. We see that Jesse and his wife move to a sophisticated two-story house (where he will soon die) after paying the rent of 18 USD. In fact, the last residence of Jesse James (at 1318 Lafayette Street, St Joseph, Missouri) was a simple one-story house, renting for $ 14. There was no upper storey ... so when Jesse James was killed, his wife could not run in advance like Hope Lange here. (She was actually in the kitchen.) <br /> <br /> One error of continuity: Robert Wagner (without a double stunt) performs an impressive job, throwing the bullet into his jaw and falling over when his hands are tied behind his back ... but when he gets up, the string binding his wrists is gone. <br /> <br /> The screenplay makes strange and unnecessary juggling with dates. After attempting a robbery on Northfield, Jesse says he expects to come home before his birthday. The actual Northfield bank raid by James Gang (September 7, 1876) took place two days after Jesse James's birthday. (Maybe he meant birthday next year.) Later, we see Jesse and his wife move into their home in St. Joseph on a summer day, while Jesse tells her what she's going to do when Christmas comes ... but in real life life, Mr. and Mrs Jesse James moved to this house on December 24, 1881 ... so this scene should * BE * on Christmas Eve! These errors were completely avoidable. <br /> <br /> Some of the fictionalization here do not make sense. According to this film, Northfield's raid failed because one (fictitious) henman was late with the telegraph wires being cut off. If that happened, it would really prevent the escape of James Gang ... but it would not affect the theft itself, which failed for other reasons. <br /> <br /> There are good performances by Jeffrey Hunter (as Frank James), Moorehead, Alan Hale Jnr (as Cole Younger) and stage actress Marian Seldes in a rare screen role. I was disappointed with Robert Wagner, usually an underrated actor. In another place, Wagner proved his impressive reach, convincingly portraying heroes, villains and morally ambiguous heroes. Here he can not decide whether to introduce Jesse James as goodness or evil ... so he does not care too much. John Carradine calls in his performance in the short role of a fictional preacher who baptizes Jesse and his wife during their wedding. In fact, Jesse James was baptized in childhood by his uncle, a Methodist minister ... but perhaps this second baptism is a supplement. <br /> <br /> Jesse James was not Robin Hood. (I doubt Robin Hood was also Robin Hood, but that's another story). There is not a single documented case in which Jesse James would ever share his prey with anyone but his own family. After a few congestions, he did not even share his booty with the rest of his gang. In this movie Jesse is shot just after the weddings to abandon his bandit ways forever. In fact, the night before he died, Jesse James and the Ford brothers stole the horses that Jesse was going to use the next day in the robbery of Platte City. Preparing for most of the attacks, Jesse James stole the horses from the local farmers ... the same poor people who (inaccurate legends) were allegedly beneficiaries of his generosity. I crouched on one scene where fictional Jesse James is so refined that he disapproves of an oil painting that tastefully depicts acts. <br /> <br /> "Real (not much!) Jesse's story Jakub is deliberately dishonest to a thieving murderer, as well as dishonest in a civil war. For a very impressive stunt job, one good editing and some great acting phrases, I will judge this obscenely dishonest movie 2 points out of 10.
