This soap opera from USA "Knots Landing" has all the entertainment value associated with being trapped in an elevator. Each episode contained topics such as rape, murder, kidnapping and drug trafficking, not much different from the threads of other theatrical performances from that period. As for the cast, I've seen better actors on the flake box. From the mid to late nineties, the repetitions of "Knots" stink U.K-Gold like a mountain of bleeding diapers. I regret to announce that I had to suffer because my mother was a big fan of the show and she was religiously watching him. Although there have been few repeats since then (hopefully it will remain so). The only positive thing that can be said about "Knots" is the catchy melody of the saxophone signature, later used as the title music for I.T.V sit "The Upper Hand". Great heritage, huh?
