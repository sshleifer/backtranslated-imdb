... no one is watching the movie. My husband and I went to see him last night. It's just a small theater, but there are usually a lot of people there. Not this time! My husband and I were the only people watching Dragon Wars last night! Now we know why. <br /> <br /> The movie was definitely one of the worst I've ever seen. Yes, CG was good, but that's all. Acting, screenplay and dialogue, direction, editing, etc. They were terrible! Because we were alone in the room, we could talk freely during the movie. I mean, we were talking about how bad it was that it reminded us of The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Godzilla, Mortal Combat and Lord of the Rings. It was as if we were expecting to see Rita and Lord Zed representing the commanders of Sauron's army. <br /> <br /> The creatures were funny. You can not just present legions of things dino / dragon / lizard loaded with cannons without explanation. The Lord of the Rings has a wide spectrum of characters, but introduces them and develops over 3 films, not in one and a half hours. <br /> <br /> Scene transitions are terrible. I did not fall asleep during the movie, but even though it was too simple a story, I got lost in the role-playing holes. <br /> <br /> The characters were Caucasian Americans, but they spoke almost with broken English because of a badly written dialog in the script. <br /> <br /> The last scene that could have used some value of the movie ... did not succeed. Ethan did not cry when Sara died ... though he did not know her for too long in this life. He did not seem too nervous to stay in "Mordor", not knowing where he was or how to get back. We could not know for God where he was and how he got there, but if he was not upset, we should not be too. <br /> <br /> Oh, and why a dress that Sarah's ghost wore a look like she had borrowed from Queen Elizabeth? One more thing ... all three main heroes were reincarnations restored to the end of their work. Sarah does her job and goes into the afterlife. Jack does it too. So why is Ethan fucking? He left alone, without a girl, without a map / compass / helicopter to help him return. What should he do? Send smoke signals? And if he comes home, will he just come back to work? He should have received the same grace to kill from the movie that other heroes had. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time or money on this movie. We only stayed until the end because we paid for it, but as soon as we got credits, we went out the door.
