I just registered to comment on this comment (which basically resembles some of those already here). Acting is worse than below the norm, explaining commonly accepted stereotypes, has one of the worst manifestations of tasteless empowerment of a woman (all bodies without a brain) and has some of the best known lines known to man. <br /> <br /> including, but not limited to, "all right, let's see what these guys can do." I should also mention that when they show accidents involving innocent civilians, you end up feeling bad for innocent people and start to hate the characters themselves. Eddie Griffin's character is also one of the most stereotypical figures of a black guy who simply tears people in the wrong way. He can be a good actor, but this movie does not allow for such a character exploration. Want a movie that leaves the audience on the side of bad guys? Oceans 11. This movie just makes you hate bad people instead of capturing the audience. <br /> <br /> Even cars are not able to make up for this movie. The Enzo that Griffin crashed perfectly sums up this movie. It sucks.
