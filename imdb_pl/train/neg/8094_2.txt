As someone who both read the novel and watched the movie, I have a different view of why the film was such a flop. First of all, all comparisons of the novel and the film are purely superficial. They are two different animals. <br /> <br /> The novel is probably intended as a satire, but instead appears as an intersection of tragedy and polemics. All comedy elements, such as those that later created the stylistic basis of the film version, are only accidental in relation to the artist's uniform cynical thrust. And that the omnipresent author's white suit does not fool you and he thought it was another Mark Twain, think again. A more accurate literary precedent would be the specter of Ambrose Bierce in the cylinder and tails. Tom Wolfe is an equal member of the clown and hack, more famous than the author, he is always looking for a new milling for his self-mending mill. <br /> <br /> It is no wonder that the excellent production skills and direction that the director has given to the director were condemned from the very beginning. Unlike real satire, which translates very well into a film, polemics are based not on commonly available observations on some form or other human behavior, but on a single attack on specific people - real or fictional straw men - who have somehow deserved the anger writer. Any effort to create a successful filmed story or narrative from such a beginning must have a clear beginning, free from the influence of the writer or interference. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I also find fault in the casting. Not only that incompetent people such as Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith could not face it, but that real talents such as Tom Hanks, F. Murray Abraham and Morgan Freeman are either completely wasted or given roles that are mere caricatures. <br /> <br /> There are enough thematic materials for really great film satire, but it has not even been able to get closer.
