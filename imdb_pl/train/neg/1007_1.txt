It was very difficult for me to watch it after the first 5 minutes of the movie. I managed to stomach 45-50 minutes before turning it off in disgust and watching Monster House instead (which is great fun). <br /> <br /> History has huge holes in it. The plot line is enormously declared and boring, the acting is terrible, especially from Justin TImberlake, who should really stick to what he is good at (look stupid and sing like a neuter). Morgan Freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable, especially when he was forced to dance to rock music for no apparent reason in the middle of the movie after he and Timberlake met. Characters of Freeman and Timberlake seem to have some kind of father-son relationship or something like that, which just is not obvious except that; although Freeman's character seems to have only contempt for the ignorant and rather foolish character of Timberlake, he never pulls out all the stops to help him discover a completely absurd cover. unbelievable suspension of disbelief, to fully assign a plot that is simply absurd and completely burned out. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie, it's a waste of time.
