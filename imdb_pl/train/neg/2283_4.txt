Oscar for the most underestimated actor of classic horror goes to Dwight Frye. Seriously, his name should be given with the same respect as Karloff, Lugosi and Price, and this film confirms that. His hero Herman was one of the 2 reasons why I can watch this movie. Dwight gave this somewhat more disturbing misguided, delectable but frightening behavior that led to the hope of a greater role for the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The second reason is the comical relief of M. Eburne. Being in the medical profession, I must admit to experts in the field of hypochondriacs prone to self-pity. Although other "medical errors" gave a short giggle, especially when a good doctor takes samples of drugs from his colleagues ... "Well, keep going, giving it to her". Unfortunately, these two outstanding performances could not wake me up for three attempts to sit through this unbearably slow movie. The plot is predictable with just a few minor twists. Filming, while downloading the legitimate terrible atmosphere was more productive, made me yawn - yes, you can use too much shadow. <br /> <br /> My recommendation - see it once to see Frye and Eburne - but only when you wake up and with a lot of caffeine.
