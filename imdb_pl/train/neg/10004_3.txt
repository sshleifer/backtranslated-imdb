"It seems that many critics consider the idea of ​​Woody Allen's drama unpalatable." And for good reason: they are unbearably wooden and pretentious Bergman imitations. And let us not kid ourselves: the critics mostly supported Allen's claims to Bergman, despite Allen's scandalous accusations. I do not get this: why was Allen applauded for the originality of Bergman, but today's Brian DePalma was excited for "ripping" Hitchcock in his suspense / horror movies? According to Robin Wood, this is a strange form of cultural snobbism. I would have to agree with that.
