This movie is horrible. Not offensive, but very predictable. The film follows the life of a small-town family in the mid-1960s. The father, the headmaster, is going through the mid-life crisis. Go to a cute teacher from a big city who begins to challenge the minds of his students with thought provoking things such as thinking for themselves. The director does not agree with her teaching, but she is pretty. You can connect the dots. His teenage daughter (Winona Ryder wannabe Tara Frederick) has a pretty lifestyle in a small town and wants to live. He gets bad advice, he meets bad boys, and apparently family planning was not taught at her school. Shocking! Seeing that director Paul Shapiro worked mainly on television, this movie plays like an adult version of a special poem or a unique episode of one of the more mundane sitcoms.
