Two types of movies that we like are (1) westerns and (2) films from 30 or 40 years ago. We should like A Man Called Sledge; ALE ..... <br /> <br /> BUT ... this picture is unpleasant, annoying and stupid from beginning to end. Because there is no one in history (good or bad) who could warm up, there is nobody who would motivate the necessary tension to interest the viewer. Lack of camaraderie among guys trying to steal gold and lack of camaraderie among those who try to protect him. Sledge has a beautiful friend, but there is no reason for him to dream about this guy or why he wants to be in the same room with this pig without an account. <br /> <br /> The film also suffers from an intrusive and gawdawful musical score, as well as an exceptionally bad magazine and directed by Vic Morrow. <br /> <br /> Of the last 30 older films borrowed from Netflix or Video Vault, it was the lowest level, the only real dud.
