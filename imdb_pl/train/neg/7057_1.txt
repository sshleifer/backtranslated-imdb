This is one of the most annoying, nonsense movies in which I had the misfortune to sit. Every time it looked like it could be good, there are more sepia-like flashbacks, followed by paranoid idiocy impersonating social comments. The main character, Maddox, is a manipulative, would-be rebel who lives in a seemingly homeless house without parents or responsibility. The supporting staff is much more sympathetic and interesting, but unfortunately it has never been developed. Nor do we ever understand the figure of John Stanton, who allegedly influences Maddox to commit acts of rebellion. At one point I thought: "Aha! Maddox is just crazy and secretly invents all these messages from Stanton's escaping mental patient! but of course, it does not end like this, and the whole movie turns out to be pointless, both from the perspective of Maddox and the viewer. Where is Ferris Bueller when we need him?
