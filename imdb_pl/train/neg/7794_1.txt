This movie is horrible. Not one quality for this movie. One would think that the blood will be good, but it sucks. The effects are worse, and acting, if you can call it, is the worst I've ever seen. This movie was of course shot with a camera and probably has a budget of around $ 500. If you want to watch a good zombie movie than watch Dawn of dead or Day of the Dead. If you want to watch a good cheap movie from Zombie movie this way, but better than watching Zombie Redneck. Please avoid this video at all costs. It is unobservable and pointless. You have been warned. I have nothing else to say about this stupid movie.
