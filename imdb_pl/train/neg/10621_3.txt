I will not add to feature reviews, it is not very good. <br /> <br /> A very unlikely orphanage on Bala. <br /> <br /> Cushing and Lee at the height. <br /> <br /> Nice scenery. <br /> <br /> Good for spotting the face and quote: "look at the lips, or Cassie with Fools and Horses". <br /> <br /> Otherwise, a poor example of the British film industry. <br /> <br /> Fulton MacKay was much better at Fraggle Rock, Keith Barron was better at anything else, and Diana Dors did what she did best. <br /> <br /> Implementation? It was allowed to watch on the Horror channel before going to the subscription. I will not subscribe to this effort.
