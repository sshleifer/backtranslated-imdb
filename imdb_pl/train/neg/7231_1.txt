I saw it in the art cinema, which also showed "Last Days" and some of Charlie Chaplin's films. Based on the quality of other functions, I decided to give the "Immortel" a chance. I almost came out of this movie and I like science fiction! The story takes place in futuristic New York, filled with sky ads in the style of Blade Runner and several similar debates about cloning / synthetic people. Unfortunately, the scenario was not sufficiently condensed into a movie at forty-five minutes. There are three groups in this world: people, artificial people and Egyptian gods. Artifical people seem to have an advantage and control the city's policy. Humans are slaves and they serve eugenics and organ donation. Egyptian gods have a floating pyramid (modeled on the Great Pyramid of Cheops and have a damaged outer surface, leaving a smooth "cap" on the pyramid.) Would a floating futuristic pyramid not be in perfect condition?). The pyramid rests over the city and no one on earth can understand what it is or why. I will not bore you with the so-called story, but there are a lot of unnecessary gore and a lot of disgusting scenes. The film, as I said, looks like the influence of Blade Runner, and maybe also The Fifth Element and The Matrix. At the end of the movie, thanks were exchanged for Great Britain, France and Italy. The film is FRENCH, but uses British actors who do not speak French. Hence, it is obvious that their French dialogue has been named. This is distraction, and I also thought that switching between real people and animations is quite distracting. It does not help that the animations are weak - no better than a video game. Skip this one.
