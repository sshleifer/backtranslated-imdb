I read in the newspapers that W.Snipes was broke, so it's no wonder he would take part in low-budget projects like The Contractor. He is just another action star who will join the growing club: penniless action stars at the soul of the 90s (Van Damme Segal, Lundgren, Snipes). Here he plays the main role in a dance action movie that was filmed in Bulgaria (we should believe that the location is London, as if only a complete moron bought it). History is one of 1000 other films: retired special forces good guy gets re-employed by the government to do a wet job - after the government wants to get rid of him - good guy escapes after killing bad guys (was it a spoiler? Guess, no !) Movie star: little girl (Eliza Bennett) surpasses all other casts !!! One star is for her plus one star for Len Headey's eyes, he makes 2 stars. Only for die-hard Snipes fans! Everyone else: avoid!
