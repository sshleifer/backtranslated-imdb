This movie was exactly what I expected, not great, but not so bad. In my opinion, PG13 films are not scary enough, so I already knew that I would be bored throughout the movie. There must have been horrible things in a hotel room, but nothing that we have not seen before. I do not think I liked it because I thought there were too many twists and turns; it got old and repetitive. I also did not understand whether all the things that Cusack had experienced in the room were true or not. There is no explanation for any of the events that took place. The film just stretches, and when it finally ends, you want the movie to continue moving, because you're still waiting for someone to tell you what the whole movie was about. I liked the special effects. Besides, it was not much fun. Maybe it's just me, but I thought it was below average.
