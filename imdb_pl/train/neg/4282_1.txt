I just can not understand why all those relicts from the Ceausescu era do not want to leave. It is evident how frustrated they were during the communist censorship, which forbade them to show so many things in their films, and now they imagine that it's incredible how artsy-farts of freedom fill the screen of people defecating, urinating, vomiting, swearing and all other types of odor you can imagine. THIS IS NOT CINEMA, FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS! This is simply visual perversion. Forget about Bunuels by Chien Andalou, about David Lynch, about Formanie and neorealism, and about other filmmakers who were able to work with the aesthetics of ugliness. These people have mastered their work - no! Do us a favor, all Daneliucs and Nicolaescus, and Saizescus and Muresans, Marinescus and Margineanus, and others outdated old-fashioned, and leave us alone! It's a while to see some Romanian movies on the screen, enough with your immature horrors! You are not directors, WE ARE EXPERIENCED !!!
