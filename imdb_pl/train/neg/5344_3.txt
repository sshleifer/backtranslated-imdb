You remember the movie Spice Girls and how it was wrong (in addition to the songs), their manager Simon Fuller (also the manager of this band) makes the same mistake putting S Club (another of my favorite bands) in his own film. S Club: Tina Barrett, Jon Lee, Bradley Mcintosh, Jo O'Meara, Hannah Spearritt and Rachel Stevens (what happened to the seventh member, Paul Cattermole?) Basically, they asked their boss for a break, they go on, and when they see you on TV ! Three of them change and vice versa, half discover that they are clones of a greedy scientist, and the other half simply gets into trouble. He also performed Gareth Gates as a clone of himself. This movie may have more storylines than the Spice Girls movie, but apart from the songs "Bring It All Back", "Do not Stop Movin" and "Never Had A Dream Come True" it is not a reason to see this movie. Shortly after the division of the band for good. Suitable!
