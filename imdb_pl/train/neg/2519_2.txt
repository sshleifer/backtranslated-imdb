I really paid to see this movie in the theater. <br /> <br /> I would get a grade of 1, but the battle scenes between robots are fine, and there is a surprise. <br /> <br /> I realize that some movies have bigger budgets than others. I do not have a problem with that. Unfortunately, science fiction movies probably suffer from a small budget for obvious reasons. But one of the ways this movie fails is that almost every element of every set looked cheap and cheesy. I mean, could not they even make it look good? <br /> <br /> Another important reason why this movie is horrible is acting. If I had seen the movie now and knew what to expect, I could just enjoy it for the cheese, but at the time I was expecting a good movie and I had no idea how bad it would end. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the experience was only in 85 minutes.
