He may have an Oscar and a Golden Globe, but this movie shows why she is also an eternal candidate for Razzie. Making a film so bad must indicate that it needs money. She could advertise why you should not talk on the mobile phone while driving, especially at night on the way to the crowded shopping center. <br /> <br /> Susan Montford should stick to the production (Shoot 'Em Up) as he is not very good as a screenwriter / director. <br /> <br /> She's being accosted by four bandits in the mall parking lot, and the first thing they do is tell her they have a gun. What is she doing? He begins to push and curse them, as if he knew martial arts or something like that. She manages to escape, but after the fall she gets lost in the forest. Why did not she run home? We get four thugs with pistols chasing a woman with a toolbox. Of course, their weapons do not match her key. Ha! Of course, he also has a tire iron and screwdriver. Those poor bandits. <br /> <br /> Now she's home for Christmas - and she brought a gun!
