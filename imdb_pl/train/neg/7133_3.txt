I felt like I was watching the Fast and the Furious again, but with different actors and some other plot. I will say that the cars in the film are very cool. So if you like fast cars, this movie will probably be a bit funny. I also liked Nadia Bjorlin because I saw her from the Days of our life. She is a really good singer, but it's a pity they gave her such bad songs to sing in this movie. I mean songs about cars; not exactly what you would like here on the radio. Because this is a Hollywood movie, you have to tell this story a bit, but in real life I do not think any average Joe would meet such a hot girl as Nadia Bjorlin, who can drive a car, repair the car and become the lead singer. It's just very stupid. <br /> <br /> Another note, anyone who wants to bet 25 million for a car race is a crazy man. But in the end it was pretty cool when Natasha stops just before the finish line and turns Michael. Priceless. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: This movie is intended for car freaks. So if you like fast cars, I recommend it.
