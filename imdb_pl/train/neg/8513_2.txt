Horrible! Absolutely terrible! No plot, no meaning, no end. It looks like the director turned on the camera and the whole crew went to lunch. Everyday. I'm trying to reject this movie, but nobody will pick it up. I give him 2 instead of 1 because I like Benigni. Roger, I will have to say my thumbs on it. <br /> <br />
