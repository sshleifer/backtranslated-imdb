Baszki should be congratulated for trying to transform one of the great works of English fiction into a film, and then a stupid cheek for this attempt. The animation was weak, the characters looked funny, the music was on fire, and the movie was a desperate blitz through the first book and half of Tolkien's masterpiece. I still remember my disappointment and disgust at the movie when I saw it for the first time. Now I realize that any attempt to transform a book into a movie will certainly fail in many ways, simply because of the medium, but this movie, regardless of the source, is simply pathetic. Ba≈õki can do much more.
