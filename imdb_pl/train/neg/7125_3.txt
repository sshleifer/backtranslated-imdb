VILLA RIDES (1968) turns out to be a huge disappointment! And even though Sam Peckinpah had his share in the script, along with Robert Towne, he still appears as the main movie written dryly by the not-distinguished Buzza Kulik. First of all, the best announced Yul Brynner as Pancho Villa is wrong! It is not charismatic enough to play the great Mexican revolutionary! His only performance lacks the fire and enthusiasm that Anthony Quinn or Gilbert Roland could bring to this role. Brynner looks just like a Russian aristocrat dressed up as a Mexican bandit who is in the midst of the Mexican Revolution instead of Russian. Also the second announced Robert Mitchum is completely wasted in the picture! His role as a biplane flying ace throwing a homemade bomb out of the air for a revolution is a poorly written modest role that any minor star could play. Mitch does not have a decent line throughout the film and it is reminiscent of his second Mexican revolution, the picture much better "Bandido" (1956), which unfortunately does not seem to be interested in DVD release. In addition to the lack of any style, "Villa Rides" also suffers without the presence of a female star! She is the star of Grazia Buccella as a young Mexican girl who gives Mitchum a happy eye, but her cast is just cursory. Someone like Claudia Cardinale or Jean Peters could add some much-needed cut-outs to the weakening plot. <br /> <br /> There are a few good action scenes in the movie, but a few good action scenes are not a movie robot, and less than the excellent image quality of Panavision plus the repeated thematic melody of Maurice Jarre does not matter. <br /> <br /> Like Paramount, there are no add-ons - even trailers! Yes, disappointing presentation of the film and the DVD, which could have been and should be much better.
