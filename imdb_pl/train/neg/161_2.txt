If you can imagine Mickey Mouse as a New York street pimp or John Wayne as a communist spy, then you can believe that Pat Boone is a juvenile criminal on the uncle farm in Kentucky and you can imagine the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is so stupid that it is not even a camp for a disinterested love story from the mid-1950s. The problem is that Hollywood has taken Ser Boone's refusal to kiss a woman so badly, not his wife on the screen before his release, that the public knows he will not kiss Shirley Jones, so you can not build any expectations of "consuming the screen" love. It's a bit like watching a western, in which cowboys do not have weapons. <br /> <br /> History is pointless. Even the title song is sung with painful enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> April Love is one of the worst film carts along with Ishtar and Plan 9 from space.
