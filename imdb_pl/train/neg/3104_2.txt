I did some reviews on IMDb and this movie is special because I've never seen the whole movie. It was so stupid and ridiculous that I just could not sit down - though I tried. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this and every Mel Brooks movie is called the Mel quotient. In other words, the better his movie, the less you see him in the movie. Think about it - the producers and young Frankenstein were great films and they were almost gone. BUT movies like Life Stinks and Space Balls are full of Mel and they are pretty well filmed movies (yes, I DID NOT LIKE Space Balls - but this is not the place to talk about it). <br /> <br /> Secondly, apart from cancer, rectal itch and mental retardation, I can not think of a less amusing topic than homelessness. It's just a comedy breaker. Think about it, people. THE MOST (?) Scene in the movie has Mel doing whoopee with Leslie Ann Warren in the garbage !! And it's fun how?
