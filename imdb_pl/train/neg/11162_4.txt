Jack Black is an annoying figure. This is an annoying film independent of 14-year-olds. Do I have to write eight more poems? Ana de la Reguera is well-brought up to look at her as a Mexican nun who endures Jack Black's rather forward and rude promotion. This movie is an indie version of the independent PG 13 movie. I really like a movie that has the courage to explore Mexican culture. This film deeply explores Mexican culture. I just choke on with its cultural rudeness: Jack Black is so naughty. A white person like Jack Black is not my most precious messenger in Mexican culture, as it was. Mexican wrestling culture is not the most transparent place where a white guy like me could try. I suspect that Mexico is more culturally opaque than Jack Black has here. <br /> <br /> I think that IMDb changed my opinion. Has anyone changed their review yet? Just a question.
