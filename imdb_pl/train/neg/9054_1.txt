If you can not stand the accents, you hate this movie. And to make it worse, you see Patrick Swayze, who tried to be red. I really can not stand the disgusting accents. I like Billy Bob Thornton, he was good at Slingblade, but in this movie he was annoying. And what is the name of Lonnie Earl? How much more hickish can you get this movie? The plot was stupid. I usually do not judge movies, but I could not stand the movie. If you want a good Billy Bob Thornton movie, visit Slingblade. <br /> <br /> My mother found this movie for $ 5.95 at Wal Mart ... characters ... I think I'll put it down and give him my grandma for Christmas. Maybe I just can not stand the normal accents or I can not stand Patrick Swayze. Maybe if it was not Patrick Swayze. I did not laugh once in the film. I'm laughing at everything that's stupid. If they showed that someone had smashed their fingers, I could laugh. human fingers crashing accidentally always make me laugh.
