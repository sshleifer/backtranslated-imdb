It is difficult for me to understand why this piece of the entire basket was repacked. The only salutary grace in all this is Ariaun's body in her sexy uniform. Her humor should also be appreciated. It is a definite plus, but unfortunately, to save this garbage, a magician is needed. However, it must be positively appreciated for its heroic effort and true professionalism. I can not say the same for your fellow Lilith with her groaning voice that hits your nervous system. He appeared selflessly and gave the impression that her presence on the set was enough. Everyone said that, apart from Ariauna's performance, it is actually a total trash.
