In general, you saw when Harry met with Sally, and then avoid it. This will not only make you hit your table, why Bollywood can not even make a good remake; but it irritates you with so-called funny moments. The film's charm is missing. Ranee looks terrible. Saif tries to act as if he was the hell of an actor. Plots that were selected from the original do not look effective either. The part where they both bring their friends and get in the note, it just does not look attractive. What could be more catastrophic? you want to waste some money, that's what you can get. Otherwise, put in some bucks and look at the original. It's too good to miss.
