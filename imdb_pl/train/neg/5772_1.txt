I just need to add in case someone reads it and has not understood it yet. These other reviewers are not joking, it's really the worst color film you'll probably see. When the movie started, I could not believe that something like that really went out into the world to see. <br /> <br /> They do not just say it when they say it looks like a home movie. It really does. Like the "director", he took the family hi8 camera (in front of DV cameras and nonlinear computer editing), no other equipment (lights, sound equipment, etc.). He did not catch decent actors and did not leave to make a film. No script, just think how he went. <br /> <br /> When I watched it, it was on my mono TV, so I have only one audio channel (left of the right speaker). At first I thought I understood it wrong. The film was silent until someone spoke for a few minutes. I got up and switched to another channel and suddenly I heard music and sound effects, but then I did not hear the dialogue. They recorded sound on various blood channels! I mean, watching movies can be fun, so bad that they're good. I'm not sure if it's one of those. I mean, I'll admit that I'm a bit of a beginner filmmaker. And watching bad movies just makes you want to go and PROVE, you can do better. But watching it just made me feel sorry for who did it. <br /> <br /> The actors, however bad they were, are the only good thing. I thought the chick was hot and I was disappointed with the short bathing scene. A little T and A from her would raise the result from anything to 3 or 4. But unfortunately not. If you want to make a movie but do it shit, put in some free nudity. He worked for Roger Corman.
