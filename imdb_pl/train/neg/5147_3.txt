"Blue Desert" could have the potential to be even a half-sober and more pleasant thriller, in which the main character was Lisa Roberts (Courtney Cox). When he is the victim of another attack on the streets of New York, Roberts moves to a small town in the west. In the first days, he meets the suspiciously crazy Randall Atkins (Craig Sheffer, who plays this part well), who will eventually not leave her side. Fearing about her safety after she was twice in this situation, she is making friendship and connection with the suspiciously friendly city policeman, Steve Smith (DB Sweeny, whose character does not seem convincing enough, leaving disbelief among viewers who otherwise they should be convinced of red herrings thrown by writers). Smith needs Roberts' cooperation because, as he says, Atkins is ex-con and guilty of sexual assault. But the cops lacked evidence to push him away earlier. <br /> <br /> The movie had enough tricks to at least make an interesting movie, because soon there is such a fuss about who Roberts should trust. However, much of the intended tension seems too forced, because Roberts never seems to react to simple things, we think, any sensible person can. And its delayed reactions allow for the occurrence of a large part of this tension in an easy and unconvincing way, especially in the final. Perhaps Sweeny was the wrong choice for this role; too darling faced this kind of evocation, which Kevin Anderson's character was visible in his form in "Sleeping With the Enemy." Or, if Lisa Roberts was written as a stronger character, it might be enough. In the meantime, the movie is not so great, even as a low-cost thriller B.
