Disney people have a lot to explain. Above all, why did anyone think that this smaller sitcom material would ever make a decent film halfway through. In the kooky teleplay, the 60 unique idea of ​​the Martians among us has not yet been subjected to the advanced treatment of X-Files. Unusual visions of small green men have long been dispelled by people such as ET, CLOSED MEETINGS and ALIENS 1-3. <br /> <br /> Every charm that the estate possessed resulted mainly from the captivating relationship between late Bill Bixby as Tim and Ray Walston as an unearthly guest. The self-importance of the Martians in the air seemed stupid. Now it seems positively idiotic. However, Uncle Martin Christopher Lloyd has metal accessories. In the early picture, the antenna on the TV station plate on which Tim works is supposed to make us think about "martian"! When was the last time you saw a TV with rabbit ears, eh? <br /> <br /> Disney does not believe in bizarre relationships and ties with this movie with special effects that contain talk about space Zoot! Yes, you read it well - says Uncle Martin's silver suit. He is going to be a really funny interlude! Drawing again. I have stretchy socks that are more fun than Zoot. Whenever an action lags behind (and still lags behind), computer graphics are used to revive. Tim is played here by a sympathetic Jeff Daniels, who can not (or will not do) anything to save this gloomy mess. Zesty Christine Ebersole brings comical zeal to the role of a neighbor. Even Ray Walston himself is drawn painfully into the procedures - all without success. This newcomer from space does not live on arrival. <br /> <br /> Always talking about comedy series on the screen makes me hope that the I DREAM OF JEANNIE movie will not contain a talkative harem costume. I am praying that Samantha's cat in the film BEWITCHED will not have a line. I live in fear that I LOVE LUCY - THE MOVIE is proud to present CG Conga Drum called Bongo. <br /> <br /> Paging Michael Eisner! Mickey Mouse - take me to your leader.
