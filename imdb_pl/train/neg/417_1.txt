I come to the cinema every week or less and regularly check this site, but I've never felt compelled to comment on the movie. <br /> <br /> To my list of shockingly bad movies - Last Man Standing, Spawn, The Bone Collector - I can now add nonsense that was "Hollow Man". <br /> <br /> From awful opening titles - an absurdly long series of cast and crew combined with alfabetti spaghetti - to an insulting finale - a record number of clichés and some of the most absurd dialogues and activities that have ever arrived at the cinema - this movie it is gloomy, and only impressive computer graphics keep you from going out long before the end. <br /> <br /> This is not just my opinion - it was my friend and everyone around us. When a large part of the audience laughs and groans during and after a serious thriller, it's clear that the movie is hopeless. <br /> <br /> What's more, he was also sick. The director took the action beyond the realistic tariff for a brutal film and the kingdom of the blood-soaked film of B. It is difficult not to imagine a director as some dirty old man because the reach of invisible man from the laboratory and the outside world only reached two attempts to touch some breasts. Perhaps sex can be the first thing in a guy's mind if he becomes invisible, but apart from the aesthetic pleasures of engaged women, he hardly does any entertainment. <br /> <br /> [spoilers track] <br /> <br /> Go through sick films outside, and things are even worse. While Kevin Bacon does a good job more and more twisted as a "hollow man", the rest of them - perhaps handicapped by the horrible scenario - do an even better job as an empty cast. Once a member of the band was found strangled in a cabinet by an invisible man, "He finally broke" moves one colleague without a hint of emotion. This is normal for the course, and the laboratory team is swinging between mere terror and total indifference at such a speed that you wonder how they came to action. They walk through the laboratory corridors terrified, armed with guns, but after a few seconds one of the crew members jumps happily back down the corridor to get blood for a wounded colleague. The main woman treats the invisible man with kindness and good humor, even after he insulted her and mistreated her, and it seems that there is no reaction to his outbursts, even after drowning the Pentagon chief, "Drowned in the pool last night", reports the same woman , she did not put two or two together spectacularly. <br /> <br /> The scenario is full of this kind of badly run pedestrian dialogue, and the rest is just AZ with film clichés that overlap the thicker and faster as the film goes to a point of total disbelief and amusement at the end. <br /> <br /> "Eureka" a moment at the computer, a woman undresses at the window, a looped security film - the list is really endless - a predictable disregard for strength in numbers, the decision not to kill the two main stars, but simply place them in the place of probable impending death and leaving them to their own devices, almost dead good guy who has nothing to save a woman, bomb and omnipresent country tdown timer, explosion of a fireball that just burns before reaching the heroes, falling elevator, which he stops before their hit, and above all the immortality of the evil guy. <br /> <br /> The invisible man is burnt to shreds using a makeshift blaster, electrocuted, struck around his head with a bar that has just cut one of the smaller actors, and then apparently survived the explosion, the fireball and the total destruction of the laboratories , has more than enough life to climb through the fireball for the last movie in the characters of the movies - at which stage the disbelieving audience is cringing and looking at their watches. <br /> <br /> That this exceptionally bad movie actually got to the cinema is amazing. Even the name of the movie is just as hopeless as the movie itself, and even impressive special effects can not save what should be avoided at all costs.
