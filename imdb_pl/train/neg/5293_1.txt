I picked up this movie after reading the text on the box, the story seemed good and had Keanu Reeves! But after 5 minutes of watching, I noticed how terrible his acting was, he goes on and says so stupidly that he is false and unconvincing. It does not stop, almost ALL characters act so bad it's funny, the only acceptable action was Alan Boyce (David), but the guy commits suicide early and you do not see him again, you never even know why he did it! Everything in this movie screams poor quality, I can not believe how this will be spent! I have been tempted many times to stop watching, I actually did, halfway I decided to stop watching and turn off this thing, I came to IMDB to see what others think about it, I found zero comments (not surprised), so I decided to force myself, to deal with the pain and come back to finish it, then come here to comment. The only good thing that happened to me (for me) was the rock band high-school theme, occasional guitar playing and part singing, but that's not worth it. <br /> <br /> Very bad game and direction ... A scary movie.
