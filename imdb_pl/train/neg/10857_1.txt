Check the website of the film, more time devoted to its performance than to write a script for this film. It can not be more intriguing. Original story? Original? They had to find a scenario hidden between the old testament or face the legal repercussions of this corner piece. Advanced special effects? Come on, I could do better with the Atari 7600 and the jug of wax. Stylish cinematography? Oh yes, the funniest American video look at home is still a classic. I'm sure they had little money for this title, so of course sf are not so good, not bad at all from time to time or just fun, but it's history that makes this movie a waste of time and money. 4 stories in one, and all thoughtless fragments of visible ancestors and already done.
