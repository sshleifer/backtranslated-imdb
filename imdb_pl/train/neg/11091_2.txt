Denzel is the only thing that's right in this movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe in the early days it was a better movie. Someone decided to cut out a few action points and the storyline at the beginning of the movie, giving the majority of the plot around the first 5 minutes. This and ruin the pace and rhythm that could have previously in the film. <br /> <br /> So it confuses you first and then discourages you. Dramatization goes beyond the suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is such a feeling of great injustice and anger that these films are potentially able to instill spectators. It's true that if you're looking for it ... get out.
