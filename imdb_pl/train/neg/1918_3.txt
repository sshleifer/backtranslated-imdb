The television version of "Twister" releases some leaks, but manages to keep viewership. My sister bought it at Wal-Mart a few years ago, when it was released, I saw it and thought it was all right.

It all depends on what you want from a movie with twisters: Twisters or a low-budget character study? <br /> <br /> John Schneider and Devon Sawa (this is the reason my sister bought him), the star who went to "Wild America", "Final Destination" and "Slackers", had a great break here.
