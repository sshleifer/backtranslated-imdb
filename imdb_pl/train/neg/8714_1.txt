I just could not stop laughing !! This movie is incredibly funny and stupid! But never mind, it is very fun! In this movie you do not have to pay any attention! Acting is the same - LAME! Dinosaurs are the same - RUBBER (Oh, my, I see a stick that holds T-Rex's head for a moment). The Raptors are the same from Carnosaur 2, T-Rex is also the same, but ... in some scenes they look a bit stuffed and it looks like a kind of project is emerging from kindergarten. The action is fast, sometimes too fast, I'm actually talking about fast editing, they edited it so fast that we can not see rubber dinosaurs, but OOPPS! they are rubber late! It's interesting that we'll see Rick Dean in this sequel. <br /> <br /> What can I say ... do not rent it ... watch on TV, with friends, it's much more fun!
