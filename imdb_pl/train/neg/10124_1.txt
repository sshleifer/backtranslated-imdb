there is no tension in this series! When one episode ends, the game is so tacky, the effects are so weak, and the scenario is so horrible that the last thing you think about is how Batman and Robin save the day. No, in fact the last thing you think about is watching the next episode! This series is so boring that I do not see how it happened, let alone release on DVD! Of course, the effects do not match Batman's contemporary films, but even the script is horrible. Inconsistent mumbling mess about some bad professor and radiant gun or something like that, I'm not sure because it's too scary to follow. Watch versions from the 1960s or 1990s versions, and even Batman Begins, all in this version!
