Awful. I see many users' comments on how great this program is. It really is Wanna-Be-Friends - Made in Taiwan knockoff. The jokes are bad ... and the plot is ridiculous. Actors are apparently fighting to be funny and they are probably hitting themselves when they hit those terrible blows (if you can call them that way). Most of the other users who commented are of course from another planet (or at least another continent). There are of course reasons why TV companies cancel shows ... and none of them are when programs are doing well. Makes sense? Anyway, stay away - even if it's raining and there's absolutely nothing else on this planet ... instead, stand in the rain - more fun.
