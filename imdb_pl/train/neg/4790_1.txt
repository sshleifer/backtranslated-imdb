I hated this movie. The original Phantasm had such a great atmosphere and mystery. Like many horror movies from the 1970s, it looked and looked like some horrifying, unfinished document. Fantasia II, from the late 1980s, stimulated the action, but the mood remained pleasant. Unfortunately, Phantasm III is simply awful. It painstakingly explains all the strange events from previous movies that reduce, and do not expand their power. Shamelessly degrades images from the first Phantasm, like cheap reproduction of the original. In this movie there are so many flying spheres that they seem more like home-made pests than dangerous death balls. Hundreds hang from the ceiling like Christmas baubles swaying in the draft. Has anyone - captain, DP, editor, director - noticed or cared that they look so nasty? To make matters worse, Phantasm III presents one trivial joke after another. How it differs from the intensity of the first movie. The original Phantasm used humor to free himself from the constant focus on death. Phantasm III uses death to set up countless cheap jokes on Reggie's corners: a few refer to the "flying balls" of the movie, ha-ha, oh, I understand, balls. Maybe the crew jumped out of these jokes, but they are on us.
