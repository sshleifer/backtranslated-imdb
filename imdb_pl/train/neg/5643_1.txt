I have 2 stores with home entertainment and I have seen many bad movies in my time, but this one was so bad that he forced me to register here and comment on him. How was it wrong? Let's say that Sofia Coppola deserves an Oscar for the role in Godfather III in comparison to Giada Colagrande in this film. <br /> <br /> It was a job and uninspiring. Her lover had just died a month before coming to the Rubber House, which he gave her. There he discovers that he has betrayed her in all his relationship, but none of this seems to register with her. In one day, he starts a relationship with Leslie, (Dafoe), the home keeper. Although she married Dafoe from the screen, her scenes with him were cold and emotionless. <br /> <br /> If there was a conspiracy, I missed him. Even Willem Dafoe could not save the film from the amateurish cinema of the train.
