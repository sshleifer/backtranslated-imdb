The story and the show were good, but it was really depressing and I hate depressing movies. Ri'Chard is great. He really was at the highest level, and the girl who played his sister was really amazing and great. Seriously, I thought it was Carmen Electra until I saw the IMDb profile. I can not say anything bad about Peter Galleghar. He is one of my favorite actors. I love Anne Rice. I am currently reading the Vampire Chronicles, but I'm glad I saw this movie before reading the book. This is a bit too "real" to me. I prefer Lestat and Louis to witty tiffs from the struggle of slaves. Eartha Kitt was so terrifying and after her character did what she did. The film was ruined for me; I could barely stand watching the rest of the program. (sorry for the ambiguity, but I do not want to reveal anything) Sorry, but this is not my type of program.
