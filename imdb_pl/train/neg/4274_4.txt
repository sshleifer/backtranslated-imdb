We are not in the fairy tale of a naked emperor. We can tell the truth about what we see without being stupid, confess that this show is simply unintelligible in many respects and that it is clear that much of it has been created out of pure intuition without a real concept. <br /> <br /> Well, of course, many people like these things. I do not. I prefer well thought out and planned shows. I also admit that the show is very serious for my taste and nausea ... these stories of love and drugs ... There are so many exciting soaps with a lot of tension (eg Dallas), but Twin Peaks can not catch my attention. I do not care about these people, except for Cooper and Gordon Cole.
