Full House is one of the worst TV series ever! Why? Because all the characters are so annoying that you can not stand it. The best character is Joey, and he is sometimes very annoying. This DJ girl who wrote her character? mention when Danny begins his philosophy. <br /> <br /> Example: A DJ won about ten thousand dollars or more in the casino. However, she is not eighteen, so she should not play in accordance with the law. ready to pay her money, but then Danny, her father caught her and do not let her collect this money, because he is not eighteen. Oh, come on, leave me alone, right? the scene immediately turned the TV off. Some say that even the child would not buy in this series. Who in the world could think that Full House is fun and funny? Except that Shakespere knew how to write and except that it would not be childish and stupid to write something as stupid as they wrote in the Full House script! <br /> <br /> For anyone who has a bad heart or any ill health or any will to live or any sense of the real world, I highly recommend "Do not watch the whole house"! episode as a rehearsal. Avoid this series. Save yourself from stupidity and nonsense. This is the worst TV program ever! I prefer to watch Teletubbies than this.
