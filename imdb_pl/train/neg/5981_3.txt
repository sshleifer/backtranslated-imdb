I just saw this movie (mainly because Brady Corbet is in it) and I have to say that I was not happy. <br /> <br /> Of course, the computer graphics were amazing, but the plot required a bit of retouching. In addition, I think that this film would do much better with more curses and blood, and if it was rated PG-13. <br /> <br /> It would definitely attract more people to see it -> teenagers. What would have attracted more teenagers (especially teenagers) would be a close-up of Brady Corbet on the Thunderbirds poster! <br /> <br /> Although the film had weak spots, I still saw it and thought it was all right!
