As a sci-fi fan, I've been aware of The Matrix since its release in 1999. With a bit of letting people tell me about it, I assumed it was very original and sophisticated. I am also an admirer of Alice in Wonderland. I could never understand how I missed the Matrix when it was released. With the forthcoming release of The Matrix Reloaded, it's time to buy a DVD and watch it. <br /> <br /> The disappointment was too great. The assumption of a matrix (a controlling device as opposed to a film) was clever. The philosophical premise of parallel worlds, alternative reality is bought. However, I could still buy a movie as a science-fiction if it remained in this genre. Unfortunately, it has changed into a standard, "whether they or not, will escape, break through, save those who need help, etc." What is worse, it turned out to be another martial arts exercise. The problem is that science-fiction and martial arts are really two different types. For the purest admirer of one or the other, mixing two does not work. It's like mixing science fiction with romance. You can have one or the other, but not both in the same movie, or at least not in the same movie. <br /> <br /> If there were such problems with the Matrix, The Matrix Reloaded really heightened the problems. At least thirty minutes of the film were sequences of martial arts or prolonged chase. (This observation ignores the question that appeared in any professional negative film review: if Neo could do something with Superman, why try to fight at all? The answer, of course, is what attracts young, male demographic theater.) Then the aspect of "redemption through love" appears. This feature device was destroyed by Richard Wagner over a hundred years ago. The Die Gotterdammerung was better served by him. <br /> <br /> So where it leaves those who have seen the Matrix Reloaded. Fans of martial arts probably groaned through trivial but mysterious science fiction philosophies. Sci-fi fans wondered why they were sitting at the kung-fun festival. Most of the men in the audience are probably bored with the aspect of stupid film romance. <br /> <br /> What should you get for your money when you see movies from The Matrix series: Science fiction, martial art or soap opera? Not every one of them is a lot more of them, or a satisfying film for each of them.
