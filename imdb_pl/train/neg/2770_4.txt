The Hollywood Hotel was the last film musical that Busby Berkeley directed for Warner Bros. His director's style has changed or evolved to such an extent that this film does not include his characteristic shots in advance or huge production numbers with thousands of additions. In the last years of the 1930s, large swing bands recorded the greatest popular hits of the year. The Swing Era, also known as the Big Band Era, was dated to different periods from 1935 to 1944 or 1939 to 1949. Although it is impossible to determine exactly when the Swing era began, Benny Goodman's commitment to the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles in the late summer of 1935 was undoubtedly one of the early signals that the swing enters into the awareness of mainstream American youth. When Goodman presented his swing repertoire, and not the social dance music played by his band, the youth in the audience raged. This was the beginning, but because the radio, live concerts and grapevine were the main methods available for spreading, it took some time for the swing to do enough to produce the big hits that appeared on the charts. At the Hollywood Hotel, the appearance of Benny Goodman and his orchestra and Raymond Paige and his orchestra in the film shows that the film industry was ready to take advantage of the musical taste (the film was produced just a year and a half after the involvement of Goodman's Palomar Ballroom). There are some interesting musical moments here and there in the Hollywood Hotel, but apart from Sing, Sing, Sing, Benny Goodman and his orchestra there is not much to praise. Otherwise, the most interesting music sequences are the opening of the "Hooray for Hollywood" parade and the "Let that Be a Lesson to You" number in the drive-in restaurant. The film is the most interesting to see and hear Benny Goodman and His Orchestra as well as Dick Powell and Frances Langford.
