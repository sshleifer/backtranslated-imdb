It was not nice to watch. Frank puts all his dreams in the backseat and gets a normal (boring!) Job, so his stepson can go to film school, but his stepson decides he will instead do a humiliating documentary about this man. The author of documentaries should direct the camera and just shoot, do not manipulate and comment on using snide captions. The bitterness and dislike of the filmmaker to his stepfather is obvious. And sad. It seems that the goal is to make Frank seem stupid and pathetic, instead it turns out to be the most human of the three presented. <br /> <br /> Essentially, the smear campaign is disguised as something much smarter and sharper it really is. I left me with great reluctance to the filmmaker.
