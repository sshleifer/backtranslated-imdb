Today I found "They All Laughed" on VHS on sale at the rental. It was very old and very used VHS, I did not have any information about this film, but I liked the references on the cover: I was attracted by the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter, and especially Dorothy Stratten, the price was very low and I decided take a chance and buy it. I was looking for IMDb, and a 6.0 user rating was a great reference. I looked into "Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003" and ?? Wow ?? four stars! So I decided that I would not waste more time and see it immediately. Indeed, I just finished watching "They All Laughed" and I thought it was a very boring movie with an overrated movie. Characters are poorly developed and I spent many minutes to understand their roles in history. The story is supposed to be fun (private eyes that fall in love with the women who are chasing), but I did not laugh at the whole story. Cases in a big city like New York are funny. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man with women who fall in love with him like Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the biggest attraction is certainly the presence of the Playboy Center and playmate Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband after the premiere of this film, whose life was shown in "Star 80" and "Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story"; the amazing beauty of sexy Patti Hansen, future lady Keith Richards; always wonderful, even fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song "Amigo" from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos is the most popular Brazilian singer since the late 60's and is called by his fans "The King". I will stop this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (male Dorothy Stratten). My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Muito Riso e Muita Alegria" ("A lot of laughter and lots of luck")
