After Highlander 2 (which I still deny) I thought it was impossible to make a sequel that would make me cry because it was so bad. I was wrong. I loved the original Wargames games, but this movie is inaccurate with computer details and details about the original movie. The original Wargames games had at least a few hacks that worked. Whoever wrote this movie knew NOTHING about COMPUTERS, except how to use a word processor. I doubt he or she would even look at the original movie. Acting is not even convincing. Please, save yourself, under no circumstances watch this movie. I do not care if the channel got stuck in the TV and you can not turn off the TV. THIS FILM PURSUES YOUR LIFE.
