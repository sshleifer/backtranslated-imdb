In the Fiji Islands, the greedy and unscrupulous owner of Valalola Resort Primal Park invites investors and guests to the opening party of his complex consisting of a hotel and a zoo, whose aim is to find partners for his discoveries. When a handful of thieves from small universities puts the virus in the security system to take part in the scavenger hunt, the biggest attractions of the zoo? sabretoothes from prehistoric age developed from DNA found in fossils? escape, killing hosts and guards for pleasure. <br /> <br /> Extremely bad and cheap "Attack of the Sabretooth" is one of the worst movies I've seen lately. The characters are terrible and they are not funny or nice, and history is a terrible rip off in the Jurassic Park with a poor collection of stereotypes. Essentially, all lines and situations are poor and stupid, but the winner is when the guard explains that the sabretoothes are bulimic and they like to kill for pleasure. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "About Ataque do Dente de Saber" ("The Attack of the Sabretooth")
