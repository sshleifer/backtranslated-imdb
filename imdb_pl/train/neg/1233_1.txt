Oh my God. the idea that this movie is a thriller is an absolute joke to me. except that it seems to have been written by a five-year-old. the plot, acting, and even props and filming of this film were beyond disgrace. <br /> <br /> I'm usually not so critical of any movie, because every person has their own style. However, this movie was probably the worst movie I saw in 2008. I can honestly believe that this movie is unknown and I think it should stay like that because such movies make the genre of thrillers a joke. /> <br /> I advise anyone who is a fan of thrillers and even just movies to stay away from it.
