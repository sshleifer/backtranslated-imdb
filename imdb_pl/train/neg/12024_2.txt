Pretty boring nonsense I've seen for a long time. The plot was full of irrelevance, and acting was the worst I had seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> To make it worse, camera angles were used that made me feel bad, accidental music was terrible and drowned out dialogue (maybe it's not bad), and San Francisco shots looked like they were stolen straight from the promotional film of the city's tourism council. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the obligatory sex scene was not even half done well. Better lighting next time, please.
