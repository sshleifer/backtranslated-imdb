Lynne Ramsey takes amazing pictures, and Samantha Morton can bring her feelings with a gesture. What a disappointment to discover that their talents have been wasted on this laid-out, pretentious skylark. <br /> <br /> Ramsey can not bring Callar to life. Her attempts are too artistic and oblique. Many times her camera stays on long silent shots of an agonizing actress, as if Morton's blurred look could provide character. We are in the empty Warholian hell of indulgence: for a film that has a few minutes of worms crawling on the floor, one might think that it will develop its hero. But how will he do it if he rarely speaks? Without an internal monologue, the celluloid novel Morvern Callar is nothing. No wonder Ramsey often dismantles Morton. <br /> <br /> It means that the first ten minutes were so impressively preserved, wound up and edited that my hopes grew. Give the film the following: knows how to make promises, if not, how to keep them.
