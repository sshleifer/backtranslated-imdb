3lbs is of course the self-denial program of Stanley Tucci, who wants to be a producer / moody, deep doctor. Unlike House, there is no personality and, unlike Gray Anatomy, cases of brain surgery are not even interesting. This program is to be set up in the leading center of neurological cases - but nothing interesting or exciting! Even the so-called miserable "feud" between him and rival adds nothing to the show or hallucinations. In the pilot there was a brief look at social life leading as a father - a nap! boring and pointless. <br /> <br /> This program is in trousers, there are a lot of medical dramas at the moment, and it does nothing to stand out as unique.
