It is a worn out story about a man who marries to escape from the hangman's loop and then "tames" his unwilling fianc√©e. He manages to be sexist and racist at the same time. For example, we will never know why a woman who has gained the respect of an Indian warrior is unable to fight her once-ex-husband. Or why the members of her team want so much to get a "real man" in the saddle when it seems that she does it herself. It made sense only in the fifties of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> This is a really stupid scene in which he turns it, and he actually catches the whip - the second time - and then breaks it off the horse. It does not matter that he would probably lose his eye for the first time, which would make it hard to catch that whip! Then she wins the fight with her Indian bodyguard, where she spends the first two-thirds of it to be beaten to the pulp. It's the second wind. Later he successfully negotiates with several bloodthirsty Indians (as everyone is in these films) after they reject her, now he is his "squaw". It does not matter that he has zero diplomatic skills and has been negotiating with them for years. And the way he rejects her attempts to seduce him, only to keep her vigilant and stop her from catching him - yes, right. Just like women, they just throw the entire path at him. <br /> <br /> Finally, none of them is convincing in their roles. Madison is just a moron who has unrealistic happiness. Fleming often turns his hair and frowns, but is completely unconvincing as a fiery boy. The only reason you took her root is that you want to see Madison tied to her fleeing horse and dragged on the cliff before the end of the movie. The way Madison tames Fleming is so predictable and has so few obstacles that he will annoy you if you see a woman as anything other than a broken doll. Even if you see them as dolls, a complete lack of tension will bore you. <br /> <br /> Total waste of time. Even the scenery is boring. Give it a longing.
