With the exception of sound, none of the above is really a critique for this type without budget, (really) independent horror. The effects of makeup and gore are very good, and the main actor was effective, the main actress, although the attractive one needs a bit of coaching, because it was particularly poor. <br /> <br /> The main problem with Frightworld is its length, 108 minutes is half an hour too long to be an effective movie, but only ten minutes of the first fifty is important. <br /> <br /> In places it is visually engaging, and sometimes the lack of lighting works in favor films. However, when combined with poor sound, as with most movies, large sections are difficult to view. <br /> <br /> It can certainly be a fun, though non-original "serial killer from the dead" with some reasonable and ruthless edition, in its present form it plays like an unfinished cut.
