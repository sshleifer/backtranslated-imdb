In a movie called "Gayniggers from Outer Space" how could you be wrong? Just throw a little over stereotypes for the characters, use Village People as the main providers of the soundtrack and cast tons of gay-gags. The plot is invalid. It is a pity that this movie does not contain this, and every joke does not get in place. All characters look similar, except for German gay, one or two jokes, the rest fail. <br /> <br /> The title made me laugh and I was ready to laugh even more about the film. Apparently, my expectations were high.
