And when I watch Sara Silverman, I have the same results. I love bizarre, dismissive humor. BUT this woman is so damn B-O-R-I-N-G, annoying and worth yawning. She also lacks everything that would be humorous. The deadly way in which he tries to pass his poems is dead when he arrives because he is simply not funny. I watched two episodes of her program and I was ready for Novocaine. <br /> <br /> Geez, my child (19) saw her promotions on Comedy Central and said she was a "stupid chick". I thought it was a compliment. The one in which he says, "Watch my program or I will kill my dog" is really credible. I know she wants to be a comedian. It just appears as a crooked nut. I just never want to see her around MY dog.
