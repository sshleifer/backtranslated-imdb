Bruce Lee was a great martial artist, but this movie is still probably one of the worst films ever. Bruce Lee dies as a result of falling from a helicopter after hitting him with some ninja knife in the back of his neck, but he does not explain how he came to the helicopter because the previous scene has him close but not on a helicopter that already has 200 feet in the air. From that moment on, it's almost absurd, like something from a cheap comic book. Perhaps the idea is not so rotten, but it is not performed with any artistic degree from the point of view of creating a movie. There are dozens of such martial arts bombers, usually all produced in Hong Kong. I think that Jean Claude van Dam improved the genre, adding credible stories in his films and having filmmakers who know how to use the camera. Even Steven Seagal's films are much better than 90 percent of Hong Kong junk movies from the 1970s and 1980s in Hong Kong. "Game of Death II" belongs, in my opinion, to the category of garbage cinema, even though Bruce Lee is in it.
