I wondered if I should mark the spoiler box. Because 99% of this show was probably seen by every Scrub follower, it probably does not fit into the spoiler category. <br /> <br /> Clips show. Grrr. We all knew that friends were going downstairs when they started showing clips ... and they went five and a half years into the brush and fell down that hole. <br /> <br /> I have to wonder if the writers just could not worry about writing this week and they said "let's show other funny things". It did not work. <br /> <br /> To start with, showing all the times in which people have fallen is not fun when taken out of context. It is not funny to see Todd hanging by his banana hammock, unless we know WHY he hanged from his banana hammock. <br /> <br /> Secondly, for what was supposed to be a compilation of JD fantasy, one was Turk's dream, another was not his fantasy either, although I forget about it. <br /> <br /> And that's the problem. This episode is completely forgotten. We've seen all these things. And a collection of dancing people? Why? This is not funny. <br /> <br /> At the end I have to admit that two of my favorite moments of Scrubs were shown in the last compilation ... Cox realizes that Ben died ... and JD tells him that he is proud of him. <br /> <br /> But even seeing these moments again did not save the episode. The summary says it all. <br /> <br /> The worst episode in history. Bill Lawrence, PLEASE, do not let your program be the same as Friends, keep it fresh, be funny ... or wrap it up.
