I've seen Gator Bait movies, and that's almost exactly the same. The woman is sexually assaulted by a group of degenerate men and systematically enforces furious vengeance on her. The thing that distinguishes this film from those (though not very far) is that sexual content is not glorified. There are many naked fronts throughout the film, but it is not sexy for a moment. Some rape scenes may seem a bit bulky, but this is only because the film tries to reinforce the need for viewers to seek revenge. <br /> <br /> This is a weak movie, there is no other way of keeping interest other than manipulating our natural desire that this woman would take revenge on the attackers. And Spit On Your Grave is not a kind of movie that you expect to bring a serious moral, but I was happy to see that because it contained a significant amount of violence imposed on a woman, it was not to spoil the Film T & A. <br /> <br /> Movies B are known for being driven by nudity and uncontrolled teenage sexuality, while while I Spit On You Grave is undoubtedly a B movie and contains more than his nudity, nudity does not lead the story. On the other hand, the only thing that drives the conspiracy is the empty necessity of revenge on the group of rapists. These people are evolutionary abandoned, just like they were in Gator Bait movies, and the biggest challenge for writers seems to be coming up with new and exciting ways to kill them, but the reason a movie can never be more than a senseless B movie is because that it does not provide any kind of news, but instead simply satisfies the public's desire that a group of rapists get exactly what they deserve. <br /> <br /> The only problem that goes with it is that we have to sit during sexual attacks. Oddly, the first half of the movie is the part that contains the most nudes (though not too much), but it is definitely the most painful to watch. We are even a little disappointed when we observe how a woman got revenge, because several deaths were so complicated that they were of course impossible (it seems that the guy in the lake at the end felt so overwhelming desire to hug the engine on the boat and press his genitalia to the propeller, staying that way, while the woman yells at him the last words and pulls the string), but again this movie satisfies only the desire for revenge, which the first half filled us with. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) You know it's all that the movie means because it literally ends when the last guy is killed. A woman does not live happily ever after, does not write her book, does not go away and never returns to this terrible place, just gets on the boat and rides on the lake, while the movie simply stops in her path. But hey, what else did you expect? <br /> <br /> Oh, did you read the password? If you decide to waste time watching this, try to find every man who will be broken or burnt. I really could not wait for these events?
