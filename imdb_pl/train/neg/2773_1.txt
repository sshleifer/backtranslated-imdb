Until then, Gentle Rain was the movie that I found the worst in history. He was replaced by this "hit" from Asia. He has one "star" and this is John Rhys Davies. He is out of shape in order to become a wounded, magical flying baddie that he throws here. The rest of these people could not leave the gymnasium. The dialogue did not omit any stereotypes, and the special effects were ringed as often as possible. <br /> <br /> It's easy to see that someone in Asia had some money and had to create a vehicle for some actors they wanted to throw money. Or maybe it was a director or writer who needed a loan. My guess is that every career in this movie is credible. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a great favor and do not watch this movie. One hundred thanks could not have swallowed that turkey. <br /> <br /> One funny scene was unintentional. The brother of the king appears on the stage. King? Handsome, older, short Asian actor. (Bad actor.) Brother? Six feet of Europe. (Also bad actor.) No excuses were invented. They just expected us not to notice that the poor brother of this poor man, Jet Li, was the would-be Pierce Brosnan in the cheap wig "Injun" with the dimestore straight from the old West movie from the 1940s.
