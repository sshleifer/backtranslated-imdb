My dad is a Columbo fan and I've always disliked this program. I always express my contempt for the show and tell him how bad it is. Nevertheless, he still watches it. It's probably his right as an American. But my senses were tuned to the series when I learned that Spielberg had directed the main episode. Then I was grateful that my father bought this program that I really can not stand. I went through his DVD collection and threw it in when I came home for a college visit. My opinion of the series as a whole has not been disturbed, but I have gained respect for Spielberg, knowing that he began as most of the lower level directors. And this is a small dribble until a big fish appears (get a pun, HA, HA.) Like Spielberg, it's like Jesus before he became a man, or at least I think it would look like a Columbo fan you probably liked it, although it does not contain much of Peter Falk, I attribute it to the beginning of the series and nobody knew what to do with it, the perpetrator of the crime instead of the Columbo investigation, as many later episodes will do.
