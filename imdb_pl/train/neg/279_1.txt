Wow, here it is finally; "movie" action without action. In a real low-budget environment (do not miss the funny flying saucers flying a few times) from the future Seattle, we find an brainless person who wants to avenge his childhood. <br /> <br /> There is nothing even the original or interesting plot and performances of the actors that compete only in stupidity with attempts to steal from other films, mainly the "Matrix" without having money to do it right. Yes, we see some on the walls and slow-motion shooters (about 45 seconds), but the scenes are as cool as trying to make stupid hardcore jokes about male incompetence now and later. <br /> <br /> And, yes, we're also served by several leads that lead absolutely nowhere, as if the script was thought through by an invisible cast while shooting scenes. <br /> <br /> Believe me, it's as bad as you can. In fact, it does not deserve to be taken seriously, but maybe I can make some of you not rent it and save money.
