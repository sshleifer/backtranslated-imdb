Invasion of the Star Creatures will certainly be in the category "so bad that it's good" if the movie was not so sexist or racist. Just because it is, it just makes it bad. <br /> <br /> It has the same stiff stereotypical sexism you saw in the Queen of Outer Space, and the kind of racist stereotypes (in this case, Indians) that you would normally find in the thirties and forties b-westerns. When it comes to being un-entertaining, the same gag to walk the cave is repeated well over ten times during this rather short film. Ray makes a good impression on Jimmy Cagney (but can not make him act on Cagney's two impressions in a row, nor can he handle Peter Lorre when he tries). There really are no production values ​​to talk about, because "Star Creatures" make Ro-Man with Robot Monster or Tor Johnson in Plan 9 with Outer Space look like Industrial Light and Magic creations. <br /> <br /> This film was definitely one of the avant-garde of what you would have to call an early independent cinema ... not artistic enough for these theaters and insufficient for anything but the last night of car driving. <Br /> <br />
