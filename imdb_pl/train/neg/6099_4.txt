It was less than an exciting short film that I recently saw between films in Turner Classic Movies. While the film appeared due to the intense color of Technicolor, the film itself was simply not so moving, and sometimes the plot looked quite shabby - as it was done for use in the classroom and attracting attention to a wider audience. attention. In particular, I really hated how many times the film repeated things - for example, when heroes talked to her, they usually said "Clara Barton" instead of "Lady", "Miss Barton" or "Klara". Plus one sickly Confederate soldier said he was "Johnny Reb, the Confederate and the rebel ..." - almost as if he were a cartoon character Mojo Jojo from the Powerpuff Girls. It was just a careless letter - period. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see John Hamilton (later "Perry White" on SUPERMAN TV) on chin as president Garfield. Yes - he is under this beard.
