hg is normally used and never bothered me before - I loved "bloody 2", but I really do not like pseudo-games or heuristics. the whole film is based on a man from esp caused by an electric accident and a witch. I am not against witches and I liked "carrie" (novel and film), but it disturbed me. I think it's because of the main character developing esp from the power line. also a university professor wasting time studying esp cases. in the 1960s I did not live to know firsthand whether esp is a common mistake, but I assume that any theory of such a nature would simply be discredited. I was really worried about the way the police described schizophrenics as ruthless, unpredictable villains who, 99% of the time, may seem like ordinary people, and then just break down. nothing can be further from the truth. I hate such concepts because they contribute to public idiocy. many people still think that schizophrenia is a dissociative identity disorder. whoever wrote this script did not know much about psychology. <br /> <br /> there were a few decent ideas for the movie. I liked the way the witch used men; it was a nice change. I liked how she could become more attractive, but not when she was near her forced lovers. it turned out to be interesting as her second lover also burned his face. if the script had been retouched a few weeks before production, and he did not focus solely on making his audience stupid, it could be a decent movie.
