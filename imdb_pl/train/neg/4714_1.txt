I would like to give this piece GARBAGE zero, unfortunately, there is not, so I had to give him 1 just to warn you how stupid this scam of a known cartoon is! Characters look like they were drawn by kindergarten children, no, wait, I saw that kindergarteners are doing better! I prefer "Misadventures of Flapjack" from this terrible excuse for a cartoon! I probably say what others said, two words: RIP OFF !! Do you remember the episode of Dexter's lab when they raced the go-kart down this volcano? yes, Mister Fellows even invested in this idea and failed! They even snatched Shadow Lugia in this one episode that Pokemon parodied! Mister Fellows must be sued for a statutory violation of this piece of nonsense !! Everyone has their own opinions, but those who like Johnny's (RIP-OFF) test simply lie to themselves. Do yourself a favor, change the channel when this trick tries to disgrace the screen!
