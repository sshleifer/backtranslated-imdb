When it comes to B movies, SCARECROW is one of those that is so bad that the seat is extremely annoying. A lone loser, who is constantly elected by his classmates and rejected by girls, ends up entering his mother-trailer by having sex with a drunk redhead. Then he chases the kid to a nearby cornfield and kills him. Apparently, the soul of the kids was moved to the scarecrow, who then kills the rogues who tormented him, as well as the teachers. This scarecrow, in addition to having a jocular one line for each of his victims, can also perform Matrix-like movements in the air and kill people on the sidewalks in broad daylight. Also, why did he always look like a rotten body? Like the two unnecessary continuations that followed, it is not even worth laughing.
