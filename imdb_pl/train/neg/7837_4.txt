Most of Stephen King's stories are small jewels, with original ideas that do not last long; basically thin and nasty - it sets them quickly on a small number of pages, you read, and you finish before you know that you started. They are like the equivalent of a McDonald's fries carton - they taste really good and you know that there are not too many nutritional values ​​(from a literary point of view do not speak much about the universal human condition), but you will still go down, just do not be a pig and go for extra super-size and fill with too much grease ("too much grease" is a prose metaphor in the king's novels, when you read one of them and say further - with pop-cultural observations or clever Yankee aside - continue the story now! ) He compiled four books with short stories collections. I have read them all - from NightShift to the latest, Everything's Eventual, and they all show the effectiveness of reaching a point that sometimes is very lacking in his volume-sized novels. <br /> <br /> But his stories never overdo the party ... which leads us to the television adaptations of Nightmares And Dreamscapes ... <br /> <br /> How the hell they (the series producers) got the green light to swap stories that usually had an average of 15 pages in 50-minute episodes? I will tell you how - two words - "Stephen King". Stories with his name probably were not cheap, and the hours of shows allow more advertising than half-hour, so ... what should be an anthology of mostly 23 or 24 minute episodes turns into a double length and double the commercial time ... Ka-Ching! <br /> <br /> I do not want to waste time synchronizing threads from these stories - this review assumes that you have read the stories and / or saw the program; what follows is only my reaction to what TNT presented ... From the four previous installments, here is my 10% rating (from the first to the worst): <br /> <br /> Battlefield - this is not a classic way but hey, how could anyone argue with keeping William Hurt before the trap was opened by filming this episode without a single line of dialogue? And the sneering reference and destruction of the deadly Zuni doll from Trilogy of Terror has proven to me that the producers (and the author of the teleplay, who is the son of Richard Matheson - the TOT writer) knew their mission was to make the action deadly and at the same time fun. It took more time to get to the Hurta apartment than it should, but I think it did its job. 8/10 <br /> <br /> Umney's Last Case-- He liked it mainly because of William H. Macy's performance. It seems to me that the screenwriter / Umney should have appeared in the story earlier in the private eye / Umney, because he was the real reality of this story, and anyone who knows King's short story (probably half if not a large part of the audience) knew Chandleresque's setting had to be interrupted by the reality of the writer, so let's get to that and cut out the sweet and clever discreet joke of Dick. But when the writer / Umney's family tragedy began to show up, I thought the program developed an emotional relationship that made the viewer (at least I) feel compassion for Macy's real attempt to escape his sorrows, usurping the exciting art of fictional life. 6/10 <br /> <br /> End of all the mess-- Uh, this title is what I felt about this episode when it ended. After twenty minutes I was ready to shout at the television - OK, we already have it, the younger brother is Mega Mensa Genius Prodigy Extraordinaire! We know from Ron Livingston talking with the camera ("time is running out" - not fast enough, I thought) that the young marmot will discover something really bad for humanity - we know this because the airplane is already built, but he almost died because he could not move it from the tree path; and blew up his chemical lab, learning chemistry (to think that the end of the world could be prevented if only this kid had more parental supervision). So much time was wasted on the establishment of uber-genius Henry Thomas, when we finally come to the solution of his discovery - the end of the world by unintentional idiocy - how much do we get to see the world ", ending? "- cheap video of a reporter who starts to forget about what he is writing about, and short radio programs announcing the day of the court are already within reach. Oh, and my brother's parents are salivating and singing old songs. My point is that if your story is really about the "end of the whole mess (of the world)", I want to see a "mess" when it rises in flames, breaks and burns. Indeed, talk about ending with a whimper. 2/10 <br /> <br /> Crouch End-- This episode completely cut me off. I could live with an eternal exposition of a happy couple coming to their hotel, playing on the cheek, eating lunch and a taxi (it was halfway through this section), if they finally crossed the Crouch End, the episode triggered shivers, but failed. Not only was it not terrifying, it was fun. Ooh, look - kitten ... wait, it changes ... oh my God! Look at this scary eye! UH Huh. They could have gone far in the direction of filming the Crouch End sequence at night, not in daylight. Things that you can accidentally find funny can become more frightening when you see them in the night shadows. But it seems to me that the budget was not high enough to shoot at night with fake sets from London, which they patted together for this. On the site it is a very scary story about tourists wandering in places they should not and about terrible things that may lurk just around the corner. The only horror in this adaptation was directing and acting - these were really terrifying. 1/10 <br /> <br /> Average from the general series (up to now): 4/10
