The premise of the film was decent enough, but it was simply bland and boring with the subordinate action. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS The movie does not work because of the nature of death, it was accidental, so even though it was a murder, it was not like the guy decided to do it. Also, thanks to some retrospection, a mystery is revealed that to some extent makes events such as justice. There is no emotion in this film. The first 20 minutes are just the woman who calls her sister and hears her message. It was boring and boring. <br /> <br /> With a little polishing and better performance can be quite good.
