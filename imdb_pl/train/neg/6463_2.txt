I watched free money yesterday and it was the longest 90 minutes of my life. With such an intriguing cast I really thought that a feast awaits me - especially since I am a fan of Brando. WRONG! What a waste of talent. Sometimes it is quite embarrassing (such as a cattle scene) and there were so many missed opportunities for fun settings (why did not they show Charlie Sheen's character returning to tow a Brando truck?) Ugh. I'm trying to be a slapstick comedy, but I just did not buy it. Skip this one. Only for die-hard Brando fans. <br /> <br /> I give it 2 out of 10, because I still think that Skidoo was the worst movie ever made.
