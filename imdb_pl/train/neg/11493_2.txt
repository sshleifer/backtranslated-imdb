Störtebeker is really one of the worst mini TV series ever made on this planet. <br /> <br /> Acting is unbearable, and the historical background is mostly nonsense: only two examples: Visby was shown as a village of three houses. Instead, it was the main city at the time, the best days have passed. Secondly, Hamburg would never be a city that cared for pirates in the Baltic Sea. Hamburg did not have access to the Baltic Sea, the main city at the time was Lübeck. <br /> <br /> But worse than everything: directing! As a dilettante, how is this guy allowed to direct such a movie? Impossible! There was not one credible scene, the fights were ridiculous and I could not stop the laughter in most of the raw scenes. <br /> <br /> I do not understand at all how a big TV station could be so incompetent.
