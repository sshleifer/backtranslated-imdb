I would leave the movie halfway if I was not with people who liked it. The film is based on real incidents, but it does not seem to be real. I have a psychological background, I meet a lot of psychotherapists and I know seriously crazy people, so it's not like I think that such people do not exist. But in the film, the only heroes who seemed invariably people were the father of Augusten (Alec Baldwin) and young Augusten (Jack Kaedin). (Although Evan Rachel Wood was an intriguing diversion - very sexy with a wicked sense of fun). There were a few funny moments, but the overall tone of the movie was grim, bizarre and nasty. What a waste of a great cast! When I watched them go through their turns, I felt that I was watching acting lessons. It was brought home during the subtitles, when several people were shown, who just sat there, not playing, not talking. These few moments were more fun than the previous 2 hours.
