I watched it on a weekend afternoon, because there was simply nothing else, it would be more fun to chew my feet and probably less painful. I urge everyone to watch it just to see how horrible a movie can be, it was certainly intentional. I cringed at every futile attempt at a sense of humor carried out in such a childish, undocumented, ill-made way that it was unbelievable. This is a movie that makes Spiceworld look like Goodfellas, I think I'm exaggerating? Well, give him airtime and think again. Horrible, completely terrible. If it was not a joke, the director and everyone else responsible for it should be removed and immediately shot after he was forced to watch the movie again.
