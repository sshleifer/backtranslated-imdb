Recreation of the 50s (London) Soho and new people. Based on the cult novel. <br /> <br /> Julian Temple is a video director. No more no less. Give him 15 million dollars and he'll make you a $ 15 million pop movie. Here he forgets that two minutes with people who can not really work is one thing - but two hours? What he was thinking about. Besides who are the audience? Who cares a book that was well remembered when. The usual London chancer history that has a chance. <br /> <br /> What can really drag this movie further? Oh, I know, third rate songs that sound as if they were made up on the spot. David Bowie repeatedly repeats the title of the film, which is the main attraction. The album with the soundtrack is a pigeon material. <br /> <br /> There is one good thing though. Good recreation from the Soho period. It is a pity that they could not think of anything they could put before him.
