"See, this bride is there, and she is being crushed by this statue that falls on her on her wedding day. And then get it, a year later her former fianc√© falls in love with a beautiful psyche? and then, this beautiful psyche is haunted by the ghost of a disgusted bride who wants to stop her from stealing her boyfriend, he will be funny! A polite giggle. <br /> <br /> The way I like to imagine is the way Jeff Lowell, the man who invented "Over Her Dead Body", presented his concept to performers working there in New Line Cinema. The biggest secret is how the same corporate players could turn right and the green light of the project, letting Lowell direct the film, and write a script. <br /> <br /> If you think that no movie can always be as bad as the original premise sounds, then there is another thought. The only way it could work was that the writer simply went crazy and turned it into a satirical farce without any restrictions. Instead, in order to ensure that he delivers a vague, harmless and cordial romantic comedy, Lowell engages in boring half-measures at every step, suppressing the absurdity in favor of gray conventionality. Indeed, "Over Her Dead Body" is so completely inept and indecent that it's hard to know where exactly Lowell thought it was. Virtually every gag in the settings, jokes and sight in the film is flat and poorly made, even the actors themselves realize their situation. How else to explain the irresolute, life-less performances of Paul Rudd, Eva Langoria Parker, Lake Bell and Jason Biggs in their various roles? <br /> <br /> I decided not to blame the actors, some of whom proved their talents in better vehicles in the past (especially in the case of Rudd). But Lowell and those studio directors have some "splain" to do.
