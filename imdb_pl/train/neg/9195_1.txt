I got into a drug and drugged when the kidney stone traveled through happy roads in my scarred urinary tracts, having absolutely nothing better to do than let the painkillers faint in half-oblivion, by chance I caught the film on the cable. I would not want anyone to think that I paid to watch it at the cinema or rent it, or ?? heaven for heaven! ?? that I watched it PROSTO. <br /> <br /> Playing this incredibly macabre video game and greedily walking through the doomed rooms and terrifying passages of the House, fighting with Chariot (Type 27), Hanging Man (Type 041) and other impossible guards, my curiosity aroused it's how the game will move to the movie screen. <br /> <br /> No. <br /> <br /> The banal plot revolves around the group of "crazy kids" ?? a la Scooby Doo ??? going to a remote island to shake the world "rave"? whatever it is. (You kids today, with yours hula-hoopami and mini skirts and Pat Boone?) After bribing thousands of boat captains in cash to carry them there (stupidity, which asks for its own rhetoric network), they find "rave" abandoned. <br /> <br /> Passing mention of the "house" - probably the title House Of The Dead ?? but most of the action takes place on fake outdoor sets and other locations separated from any appearances of a haunted residence. <br /> <br /> A falling video camera acts as a flashback filler, showing Oh, that's it? Oh, so this "rave" is just an "event"? In the great tradition of re-euphemizing "used cars" as "pre-owned" or "shell shock" as "p" ost-traumatic stress disorder ", the word" party "is now too square for you addicted to drugs, silicone implanted, metrosexual jagoffs? <br /> <br /> We learn that the party was interrupted by raging zombies. Intelligent thought stops here? <br /> <br /> I do not think the headers, who are called scriptwriters and directors, understand the myth of resuscitating zombies. Zombies are not dying? are UN-DEAD already. They do not bleed, they do not know pain. Until their bodies are completely destroyed, they will continue to be animated. At least that's what my Jamaican witch-priestess says. <br /> <br /> Which means that a shot 45 in their "hearts" will not stop them or a machete to the trunk. And hitting a shotgun in the chest will NOT cause a shiver of blood. At least in the logic of the video game, the shooter pumps so many bullets into every monster that he is completely decimated, leaving a foul-smelling mush that can not come to life. <br /> <br /> However, every actor-slash model gets their moment with the Matrix camera, killing zombies on all fronts with single crutches and karate cutlets for the sternum. Seriously, these zombies are more ineffective than the Stormtroopers of "Return of The Jedi" who are knocked out when the Ewoks defeat them. <br /> <br /> I suppose the writer of the movie, Mark Altman, wrote a not-too-good "Free Entrepreneur", felt compelled to put Captain Kirk's reference in the form of Jurgen Prochnov, who had to desperately need money from milk to appearance in this aromatic dung. There is also a reference to prochnowska's role in the wonderful "Das Bootie", when one of the untrained B actors mentions that he "looks like a U-boat captain". ". I wonder how many recipients of this movie from square pig eyes chose ANY reference to other films when Prochnow says, "Say hello to my little friend," announcing the moment of the machine gun. /> <br /> Directed to a demographic group that does not have enough resources to understand the Sisyphean vanity of the video game concept (ie the game ends when you die? You can not win), it is just a clich√© for thoughtless people all die at the right time, except for the heterosexual pair of Attractive White People. <br /> <br /> A better way for a modest but overused budget of this movie may be to send a cast by Actor School, although the left breast of Ona Grauer did a good job, like her right breast and slomo running scenes: priceless! I especially liked the last scene in which she tries to act as if she was stabbed, but she looks like she just ate the ice cream too quickly. <br /> <br /> Trying to do something more I constructed my time, I pulled out my Restored, Digital, 35th Anniversary, special edition, panoramic anamorphic DVD "Manos: The Hands Of Fate". Ah yes! ?? the drugs were adequately anesthetics - now there are several high quality films HERE? <br /> <br /> (Film Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)
