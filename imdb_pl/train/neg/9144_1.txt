This movie is just awful, the sweets that play Ben, they can just make up for everything that's wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> Writer / director / producer / main actor, etc. Probably had a good idea to create a film devoted to important issues of homosexual marriages, family acceptance, religion, homophobia, hate crimes and almost any other matter affecting homosexual in these times, but trying to push every problem into such a badly conceived movie is a little justice for any of these reasons. <br /> <br /> The script is bad, very ordinary casting, but dialogue and acting are simply pathetic. Homo-hating brother plays the most camp actor and there is absolutely no chemistry between the two main actors (I think I've seen more passion in the cornflakes advertising). Acting is rigid and forced dialogue (the scene in which the brother feeds the detective, his lines were the main attraction). <br /> <br /> I am glad that the creator of this train wreck has not pushed all the other trash to be distributed, and if I think about it, I have some advice - ONLY NOT TO DO.
