When I create a list of absolutely the worst movies I've ever seen, this movie is always on it. There are no advantages. It took a willingness to sit through the whole thing, and I'd rather spill my own blood than I would have to sit through again. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with her? Let me tell you the story of my journey to see her in the theater. <br /> <br /> I went to the show at midnight on a Saturday night. The only ones in the theater were me and a group of loud, noisy, rather unruly teenagers, sitting somewhere behind me. Apparently, they spent a nice time on Saturday night and came to this "comedy" to laugh a little. Before the film began, during the preview, they laughed and joked and commented loudly about the great old time. It was annoying; If they continued their unbridled enthusiasm in a real movie, I could say something, but I felt tolerant and empathic about their thrilling fun, so I gave up. And they settled after the film started. <br /> <br /> Why am I telling you all this? Because you can judge this alleged "comedy" thanks to the effect it had not only on me, but on this noisy group. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, no one in the theater was laughing. Not once. Not me, no noisy children. Absolute silence, in addition to the soundtrack. And when the movie ended and the lights came on, everyone, everyone, slowly retreated from the theater in a slow, gloomy, absolute silence. It could have been a funeral. <br /> <br /> That was the effect of this "comedy". Not laughter, not joy, but absolute DEPRESSION. It was a depressing, depressing movie, not the least funny. Instructive, indulgent, depressing, but not funny. <br /> <br /> I think Mel Brooks 'Blazing Saddles' is on the short list in the Funniest Movie category. I'm still nervous about the idea that the same gentleman can be responsible for probably the least funny movie ever. <br /> <br /> In short: if you feel too happy, give the film a vortex; Otherwise, do not say I did not warn you.
