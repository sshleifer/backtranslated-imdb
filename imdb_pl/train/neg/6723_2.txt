Charlotte's lethal beauty and deadly kicks make the film cooler than it would otherwise be. I would like someone to say that there is an alternative ending, but I'm afraid not. As for the rest of the cst, well, I would say that they just did not work very well; although blame should be attributed to a weak scenario. This movie reminds me of the rush hour 2, in which Zhang Ziyi dies in an absurd way, because she was the only person who stole the program during the whole movie. I can give this movie 2/5
