The performance on Broadway by Michael Bennett and Nicholas Dante has been going on for years, but evidence of his power and charisma has disappeared in this adaptation of the film, which most probably results from the choice of the director (Richard Attenborough, as far away from the road B). the main actor (Michael Douglas, who plays the director-choreographer like a slimy corporate lawyer). A slender story, about an exhaustive Broadway hearing, which turns into a therapeutic session for singers-actors, is pushed to us, with loud, brilliant talents playing on the rafters. Nothing is modulated or subtle, especially the funny story of a former dancer returning to the theater and striking heads against the old Douglas flame. The hopes are filled with promise and heartache, but their personal stories of anxiety are a bit embarrassing; this, combined with the slow pace of Attenborough, means disaster, and even the now-famous songs do not break the plastic packaging. * 1/2 of ****
