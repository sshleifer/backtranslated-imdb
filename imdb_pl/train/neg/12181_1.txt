Unfortunately, there was no 0 for the assessment, otherwise I would choose it. This film lacks the power of the stars that the original movie had in such abundance. Carol Burnett, Albert Finney, Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters, Edward Hermann, the innocence of novice Aileen Quinn and an expert directed by an experienced pro John Hustin (the father of actress Angelica Huston) made this movie so charming. Even the remake of 1999. With Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, Alan Cumming and Kristin Chenoweth had more to offer than this apologetic excuse for continuing. Before she made the movie, Ashley Johnson was known for her role as Little Chrissie Seaver during the highest viewing time in Growing Pains. She had a few parts in the movies, but I do not know who thought she had enough talent to lead the movie herself. And adding Joan Collins as Lady Edwin Hogbottom, funny! They could not get enough actors to play major roles, such as Daddy Warbucks, Miss Hannigan and Annie, but sign Joan Collins to play a British woman? I'm not surprised that this movie was as bad as it was. The critics were right, disagreeing with this film, even if it was created only for television, it was a bad sequel of an otherwise nice movie.
