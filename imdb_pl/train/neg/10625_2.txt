I'm an eleven-year-old in my high school. In my class of Present World Affairs, a kid in my class had this movie and suggested we watch it. We did. I'm convinced we went to the moon because my father works for NASA. Although I think this movie is the biggest piece of shit I've ever seen, the guy who created it has some serious balls. First of all, he had to show that JFK was shot? And how dare he use all Bible quotes. The only good thing about this movie is that it evokes a lot of debate, which is good in my class, we have weekly debates. This movie did nothing to change your mind. I think he and Michael Moore should work together and make another film. Another film by Michael Moore can be called "A Funny Thing Happened on Spetember 11th" or "Funny thing happened on the way to the white house".
