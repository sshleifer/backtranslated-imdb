If you're watching this movie, you're a fan of Fred Olen Ray, you found him on the shelf for $ 4.99 at Suncoast and thought "what should I lose?" Or you turned around in the video store with your eyes closed and rented the first movie that touched your finger. <br /> <br /> This movie is hysterically bad. It has everything a terrible film needs: a scenario involving a stunning dialogue and surprising storyline tours, crazy science involving the psyche and other dimensions, continuity that seems to travel through wormholes in time and space, actors who are not only wooden, but seem to border with a dull, unjustified nudity (not all that is what you really want), and of course, the monster 5 'played by what I suppose is a child of Fred Olen Ray. <br /> <br /> Underneath, however, it all resembles a heart - as if Mickey and Judy decided to gather all the children in the neighborhood and make a movie about monsters (hey! my dad can guide it! yes! We can use the red paint from my johnny's dad's store store and I know this ex-stripper who can work in it!). <br /> <br /> Watch out for a loan reo blooper - you'll find out why the final version of the movie was such a crap. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, Biohazard II ... Alien Force is also worth seeing, but not having the same nice shit veneer like this one.
