Apparently, "social commentary" on racism and the conditions prevailing in prisons in the rural mid-1970s. "Nightmare" is full of bad southern stereotypes, with false accents. Not only would it offend the sensitivities of most South Americans, but this shoddy work appears as a thinly hidden movie, "love in prison" - especially in its uncut original version. Nevertheless, acting is generally above average, and in particular the late Chuck Connors is doing a good job, forcing viewers to hate it - even if it looks a bit uncomfortable in a few scenes. There is also the role of changing the pace for the late Robert Reed, who appears as a lecherous guard, and Tina Louise (formerly Ginger of "Gilligan Island") has made rather a credible sadistic prison guard. My rating: D. <br /> <br />
