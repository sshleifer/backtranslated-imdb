The only reason I watched the movie to the end was "hope" to see something interesting. The film is really bad, and the performance of the girl is really, very bad, to be honest, I'm not a film critic or an expert, but you just need common sense to notice that this work is incredibly bad. <br /> The first thing that came to my mind when she started to speak was: "She has an affair with Will Dafoe and agreed to help her in the script and appear in her film because she is a brilliant director." .. surprise, surprise, the next day after watching the movie I learned on the Internet that Giada Colagrande is his wife. A horrible story and a terrible performance.
