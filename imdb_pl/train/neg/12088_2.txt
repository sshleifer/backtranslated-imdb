I have read the reviews of this film and were generally pretty good, so I thought I should see it. I am a great fan of French and artistic films, but I believe that this is another case in which critics do something "artistic" or "intellectual" into something that is not. I will be honest: it contains scenes of sexual perversity that I never, never wanted to see. Of course, the piano teacher has some serious psychological problems, but I really did not want them to be displayed so graphically. The film is actually disgusting. I mean, when I saw Requiem for a Dream, I was repulsed by the last type of scene with Jennifer Connelly, but it was not near the disgust and disgust I felt during this movie.
