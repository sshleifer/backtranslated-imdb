Rock star John Norman Howard (Kris Kristofferson) changes the salon singer Esther Hoffman (Barbra Streisand) into a night star of singing. Star Esther grows while John falls, thanks to drugs and alcohol. After about two hours, John does the self-destructive-red-convertible-160-MPH-crack-up-a-desert-highway. The best thing about this movie is music, especially the song "Evergreen." Barbra Streisand sings well, but you can not take her seriously, as a star who is already a star. When he first appears, singing in a bar at the back, he looks like a recognized singing star who sleeps at night, not like a struggling unknown person who is trying to start his vocal career. She's too confident, too professional. Her apartment looks like a page from the "Apartment of Life", not from a flat in a wall where a real fighting singer would live. <br /> <br /> Kris Kristofferson deals with himself - the role of a rock star like ... well, like a singer who tries to become an actor, but does not have too much acting talent. The direction is summer, the story is slow and boring. <br /> <br /> But the worst in this movie is not acting, a bad direction or a slow story. It's hair! After staring at the horrible hairstyles of the 70s Kristofferson and Streisand for over 2 hours, your eyes hurt.
