I saw China O'Brien II before I saw the original China O'Brien. And I must say that the first incarnation is actually worse. But: worse = fun! And funnier = better. If you're a bad movie fan like me, it's great stuff. However, if you're looking for any significant story, acting skills or movie making skills, it's best to avoid it. The best part is how they filmed all the sequences of fighting in stuttering. Fun bad. Look at the laughter, see mindless entertainment, but whatever you do, see it for free on TV.
