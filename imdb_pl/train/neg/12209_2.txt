Years ago, when I was a poor teenager, my best friend and brother both had a policy that the person choosing the movie should pay. And although I would never pay for seeing some of the nonsense they took me to, I could not resist a free trip to movies! That's how I came to see nonsense like Conan's second movie and NEVER SAY NO MORE! Now, despite the fact that it is a wretched movie, in places that are fun to watch - dead in the brain. And technically, stunts and working with the camera are good, so it raises my rating up to 2! So why is the film so bad? Well, unlike the first Rambo movie, this one has virtually no story, Rambo speaks only about 3 words (other than murmurs and screams), is unnecessary and completely irrelevant and undeveloped "romance", and the movie is one giant (and stupid) ) special effect. And what STUPIFYINGLY AWFUL special effects. While 12383499143743701 missiles and rockets are fired at Rambo, none of them has any effect on him, and almost every missile or Rambo shot shoots at the target! And while bad guys use AK-47, helicopters and rockets, in some scenes Rambo has a bow and arrows that look like atomic tips !! A scene in which one bad guy shoots him when he slowly and quietly launches one of these exploding arrows is especially for stupid viewers! He was wonderfully parodyed at UHF with Weird Al. Plus, HOT SHOTS, PART DEUX also makes a funny parody of this genre - not just this stupid scene. <br /> <br /> All in all, a film so stupid and senseless is almost like an auto-parody!
