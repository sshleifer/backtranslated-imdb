Spoilers. <br /> <br /> First of all, nothing really happened in this movie, except the woman bleeding inexplicably. Second, it was not terrifying. Third, he had the worst soundtrack for any movie. Let me develop. The sound was edited by Beavis or Butthead? I'm not sure, so let's just go with Beavis. The film gradually becomes more and more quiet, and people mumble and purr, forcing you to increase the volume (I watched it at home). Then Beavis blows out really loud sounds with supposedly frightening / shocking images, forcing you to quickly lower the volume. It happens so many times until the end of the movie. I can imagine Beavis laughing vulgarly from behind the two-way mirror, while the test group is crazy about the pilot every time. If you have children and prefer to watch scary movies after they fall asleep, this is a big mistake. But it is a big mistake anyway. Here's a thought? if you're going to make a horror film, add at least a gratuitous 19-year-old blonde who screams at her throat before she pulls off her sweater, a shadow on the wall of someone eaten alive just outside the camera range, a cat thrown at the camera to scare the audience, some weird freak from maniacal laugh or monster that looks like the hand of the scene covered with aluminum foil (a la TV's Lost in Space). These people did not even try to scare me. They just wanted to hurt my ears.
