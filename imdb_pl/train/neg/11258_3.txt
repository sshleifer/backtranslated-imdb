I said it in other reviews, without a story, you can give the audience all the smoke and mirrors you want, but nobody will be damned. <br /> <br /> It looks like the director has a great eye on art deco from the 30's (which I love) and I think the idea of ​​using all digital environments can really be a wave of the future in making movies. However, it is obvious that the director was so interested in the digital rendering of his film that he forgot to film many scenes that would greatly help this surprisingly thin film. (SPOILER) For too loud crying they forgot to have a villain! OK, they have one, but he's been dead for 20 years, when the movie is done. Conran longs for having a villain. Regarding the action, let's see, Sky Captain (Law) shoots down ONE robot, two or three of flapping wingers (before Dex (Ribisi) tells him to stop shooting !!!) and some robots, but he usually spends his time looking in a hurry and forcing others to fight for him. Paltrow like Polly or Peggy or Punky or whatever is completely wasted in this film (the reviewer who comments on her and the lack of chemistry in Law is so right), and I was a little tired of seeing repetitive shots of her camera, showing that ONLY LEFT TWO POINTS, both of which are later wasted in the film, one uncomfortable, the other quite funny, although I saw it coming from 70 years. No one except Law and Paltrow has a significant time on the screen, and this is a real flaw in the film. The audience does not identify with robots, it needs a hero to eradicate and a visible, vile villain he hates. Without it, plus a good addictive story, all CG in the world will not help.
