I gave Timecop the perfect 10, I gave 1 <br /> <br /> This story is very boring and has little to do with the original Timecop. Many things from Timecop were liquidated, and instead they introduced new stupid things. This story takes place in 2060. (If I remember correctly), but for some reason traveling is now more dangerous: confused: <br /> <br /> And action scenes are nothing to be happy, and most of them are not ... only the first one is great ... and there are not many action scenes at all, and all are quite short <br /> <br /> At some point in the plot the main character travels around 5 times in a few minutes .. do not wait, twice ... <br /> <br /> In short: do not waste time watching this movie, it's not worth it
