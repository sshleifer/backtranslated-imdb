"The Second Coming Of Suzanne" is another of these surrealist films that try to be extremely sophisticated, but everything he does is put the viewer to sleep. Like other videos of this type, dialogue is limited. Everyone is more interested in the visual aesthetics of the shot. However, the pictures stink, so there is nothing that could catch your attention. <br /> <br /> In the video cassette, this movie is "one of the most exciting visual adventures I've ever seen in a movie." Yes, sure. It is there that you can watch such stimulating events as a bucket of melting ice or a tortoise walking for a mile. 1/10
