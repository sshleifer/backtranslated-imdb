The title creatures are wreaking havoc in a peaceful little town in the desert. It's basically the whole story of this movie, and although the scenes devoted to the Munchies themselves are a bit funny (in a less popular way), the rest is just a filler and a bad filler. From the "hero" who is painful to the innocent Woody Allen, to a stupid policeman from the city, it's hard to choose the most annoying character in the movie. There were times when almost everyone was together on the screen and thought: "OK, at least the girl is cute, but why do we have to bear the rest of these morons?" The film is also filled with pop references (from Ozzy Osbourne to Linda Blair), which probably made it already dated in the early 90's. (* 1/2)
