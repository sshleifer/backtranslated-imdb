The saddest thing is that it's 87 minutes that I will never come back. I knew it was terrible from the beginning, with a man dressed as a mad Indian chief on the roof. (See if they could avoid it in 2008). My 10-year-old boy is now in baseball, so we decided to rent him on a rainy day. Although it seemed that he was enjoying it, I must have flinched when I heard all the unnecessary filthy language. Bad, bad movie. It was a horrible rupture of the Bears Bad News. Completely shameless and completely predictable. I do not mind a predictable movie if it's done well, but it was absolutely not.
