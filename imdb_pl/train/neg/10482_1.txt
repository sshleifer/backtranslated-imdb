One of the worst movies I've ever seen. How to define "the worst"? I'd rather have both eyeballs ripped out and then forced to knock on them than ever before to see that pathetic shudder again. Somehow One-Hit Wonder Zwick manages a film that offends Elvis fans, saleswoman Mary Kay, Las Vegas, gays, FBI agents, and the rest of humanity with any intelligence with a cheap, sloppy mockery that he deserves to abandon. As Elvis Presley Enterprises could allow the use of Elvis' actual songs in the film with the main premise that seems to be "The only good Elvis Presley Imitator is dead", he is beyond me. The worst part of this mess - and this requires a bit of work - is a distorted script: in 1958, Elvis 'words and songs were quoted and performed in the' 70s! The worst special effect? Oskar would go to the moron, who decided that Elvis's grave, potentially the most photographed / recognizable grave in the world, resembles a pyramid with a glued gold plate and is located somewhere in the middle of the park. Potentially the biggest audience of this film will be Elvis fans. However, raging foolishness (Nixon gave Elvis the DEA badge, not the FBI credentials ... and I could go on) actually undermines this conventional wisdom. Ugh. I used the word "wisdom" to describe this stupid movie. It's really a terrible, awful movie.
