If you're a fan of really bad movies and you think it's fun, you'll be a great Shaqa actor. First of all, creating professional players in movies almost never works. Shaq was the worst actor I've ever seen alongside Dennis Rodman, who also did some bad movies. Well, in any case, this movie is also bad because of the hideous kid. I would give it a zero, but it's impossible.
