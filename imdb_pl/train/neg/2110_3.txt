Now I love Bela Lugosi, do not get me wrong, he is one of the most interesting people who ever made a movie, but he certainly did his part in clunkers. It's just one of those. <br /> <br /> Lugosi plays doctor Lorenzo, a doctor who has been fired for unexplained reasons. However, he is conducting experiments to keep his wife young and beautiful. It turned out that he is 70-80 years old, but Lugosi looks his first half of the 50s, so why he is married to this old woman, he is never really explained. <br /> <br /> In any case, these treatments or experiments consisted in giving the bride and groom, who are at the altar, a marriage of some sweet fragrance that makes them disappear. They are believed to be dead. Lugosi and some of his assistants then steal the body on the way to the morgue and take it back to his lab, where it is kept in some suspended animation or catatonic state. Then stolen brides have needles rammed somewhere in their bodies, maybe a neck, and then the needle is stuck in the body of Lugosi's wife to restore her youth and beauty. We never see where Lugosi sticks a needle or what he pulls from the bride, but somehow he restores his wife. Apparently, old age makes you scream in pain, because Lugosi's wife screams until he returns to his younger state. Helping Lugosi in his lab is the only good thing in this movie .... a strange old witch and her two deformed sons ... one son is a large, uneven-looking slow-moving guy who likes to caress slumbering brides, and the other son is small dwarf ... small man, be politically correct in today's world. At night these three simply gather and sleep in the gloomy Lugosi Laboratory below. Who are these three and how they became Lugosi's scared assistant, how many things in this film have never been explained. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the reporter gets a job from her rough editor to find out where all the stolen brides will go. The only common thing among all stolen brides is the rare orchid that's on them. So she asks and says that a world-renowned orchid expert lives nearby, who is simply the one who developed this particular orchid. The expert turns out to be a terrifying doctor Lorenz. He is quickly tracked and annoyed by his little house of horrors. I'm not sure where the police were in all this, but they came to wipe themselves after the reporter did all the dirty work. <br /> <br /> It seems that Lugosi's films have always had some unnecessary stupid storyline that simply made the whole thing stink in the sky. up orchid himself, which is known to have evolved? D'OH! <br /> <br /> And then it turned out that young ladies do not even have to be brides for the procedure to work, so why would Lugosi constantly kidnap fianc√©s from heavily guarded churches to experiment and create all the attention and headlines? Why do not you catch a prostitute from the street, what would an ordinary thug with eccentricity do? This clunker reminded me of many other deaths of Lugosi, "The Devil Bat" .... the same stupid storylines and bad acting and the same stupid "reporter gets a bad guy deal." <br /> <br /> But Lugosi is always good - he is scary and sinister enough to interest you at least enough to keep watching him. The woman playing the reporter was just a terrible actor ... she had no emotions, just released her lines like a machine gun, spitting them out as fast as she could. Everyone else was also very blew when it came to being good actors. <br /> <br /> But this is possible if only for Bela Lugosi fans. intense even when the picture was a dog. He must have known that he was making terrible photos, but maybe he also knew that if he gave him everything, he had some intensity that could shine through all the evil intrigues and bad activities that surrounded him. <br /> <br /> And he was right ---- fans of horror will always love Bela Lugosi. He gave everything he was in front of the camera. We're giving you two fuck, Bela.
