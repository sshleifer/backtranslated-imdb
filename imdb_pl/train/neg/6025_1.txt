There remains a film like "we know what we know because we know" that Christians (and most other naive people) must help them feel like "THOUGHT" and "BELIEVE" (not "I KNOW") well. But at the same time, I feel bad about these little guys because it's not a well-made movie. It does not help ANY message. I work in a video shop and I know that the ONLY reason people visited this movie was religious and they thought it was. EVERYONE on this earth THOUGH THAT they know what will happen in the future is bad, unless they think they know they do not know. I've had enough (but only when I had too many) those people walking with their noses in the air, thinking that movies with the participation of a partially talented television actor mean something above me. <br /> <br /> Please, if you love yourself, stay away. I do not want to go into the details of this movie (not because artificial intelligence did not see it (because I did it), B-it was too shocking for my atheistic self to deal with (because it was not), or not really I have nothing to say about it (because I'm doing it.) The reason (which is a word that no one helped in understanding this movie) is that I want this movie to disappear from my head, I want it to arise from my head, I want you to watch ALL THIS WITH THE OPEN MIND from my head, I want a message that Kirk proudly and trainingly gives at the end of the movie from my head, I just want all the things that were in my head BEFORE watching these movies, anything directly related with this movie that floats in my head, Come on! My calm rage is coming to an end I'm sorry that someone in this world went to the theater to see this movie about what could happen in the future (but not), when they could donate Seven Dollars Plus to any number of charities for people, animals or tropical forests. that then they would not be able to "BELIEVE" in the fact that it is real, they may have to deal with what is. LEWY ZA ZERO (with ****)
