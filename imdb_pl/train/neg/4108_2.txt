Okay, history does not make sense, the characters lack dimensions, the best dialogue is ad-libs with low quality of the film, the photos are bleak, and only the editing saves a bit of confusion, but Sam "Peckinpah has directed the movie. In some way, its direction is not enough for those who appreciate Peckinpah and his wonderful work, this film is a disappointment, and even a great cast can not spend time, which the viewer wastes with minimal effort. <br /> <br /> The right response to the film is the contempt that director San Peckinpah, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Burt Young, Bo Hopkins, Arthur Hill and even Gig Young introduce to their films. Watch great Peckinp movies. Skip this mess.
