I hate to waste the time needed to write 10 poems about this cruelty. Hyung-Rae Shim is fortunate that bad film production is not a capital crime, or he would be twice condemned to death for writing and directing this disaster. I'm amazed that this movie had a budget of 75 million dollars, but in fact it enjoyed the fact that it was such a huge flop that Shim hopes that he will never make another movie for the rest of his life, so he will not waste more time of filmmakers. I think the actors would gather together and lynch him now. <br /> <br /> With the resources of effects available, you could make a great movie from this budget. As always, the failure should have been noticed at the very beginning by a terrible script and story. "Transformers" is another visual feast with a weak script, but it makes it look like "Citizen Kane".
