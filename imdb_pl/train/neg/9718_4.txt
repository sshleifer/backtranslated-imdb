An innocent man (Steve Guttenberg) has a one-day adventure with his boss's wife (Isabelle Huppert). He sees a woman (Elizabeth McGovern) who has been attacked outside but can not call the police because it would result in her marriage to the head of Gutenberg (Paul Shenar). Thus, Guttenberg, an honest citizen, when he discovers that another woman was attacked and killed near only half an hour later, appears and claims that he witnessed the first attack, intending only to communicate the information passed on to him by Huppert. Well - never have a false testimony against your neighbor, they say. <br /> <br /> This simple attempt to help the police catch a murderer is changing rapidly. When he meets his first close victim, McGovern immediately becomes attached to what has happened, but agrees to be silent for a moment. But then Guttenberg is in court, he has to identify a heavy (Greenquist) and we discover that he is close to observation and can not identify objects at a distance, let alone face. (It does not mean that it matters, because he never saw creep.) The story becomes practically labyrinthine. Guttenberg closes the main suspect when Huppert is murdered. <br /> <br /> He's barely escaping from custody and punched by a nice McGovern. Guttenberg and McGovern hatch a plan to imprison the murderer. It will serve as a bait. They will follow the scandalous crawl to one of their dingy hauntings, and McGovern will behave like the one he's attracted to the killer just to try and kill him. But everything will be fine, you see, because Guttenberg will not only watch her closely, and not only will he warn the police a few minutes after he enters the dive, but he will keep the usefulness of the club - just in case. <br /> <br /> I'm asking you, is this an alert browser? Elizabeth McGovern has a curiously interesting bone structure. Sometimes it seems to be a lower jaw and small mouth, but it is full of life. Steve Guttenberg has hair in his row and that's all. Otherwise, he is as helpless as the character he plays. If Isabelle Huppert can work, you can not see it in this movie. The killer is shaped and so well cared for, that it looks like he wears one of these masks of distortion in the Twilight Zone episode of greedy heirs. <br /> <br /> Did the director, Curtis Hanson, not do "Confidential LA"? It was a nice job. Here everything seems clumsy and elaborate, even in small pieces. Just before the inevitable violent culmination, a uniformed policeman is introduced, delaying McGovern's rescue, and watching the scene is embarrassing. Dick Olsen has some time as a late client. He is a shapely guy and always reliable. Paul Shenar as hubby with cuckolds has a striking face that seems to be created on the stage, and he also does a great job. <br /> <br /> It's a loose place where McGovern catches the attention of a murderer, where he plays billiards with several hairy monkeys and was shot dead at a bar in Carolina Beach, North Carolina, not far from where I lived. The way of setting the interior is obvious, it is supposed to be dangerous and dirty diving. In fact, it looks more elegant on the screen than it really is. <br /> <br /> In general, this is the territory of Hitchcock and brings tears to his eyes to imagine what he would do with this story.
