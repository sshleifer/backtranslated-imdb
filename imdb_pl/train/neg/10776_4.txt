When my wife and I decided to watch this movie, we thought it could not fail. I love Billy Crystal, my wife loves Julia Roberts and everyone we talked to said they loved it. <br /> <br /> We were misled. <br /> <br /> On my part I felt Billy. The figure Crystal was unusually one-dimensional and did little for the film. Sure, he broke some good jokes, but as a hero he did nothing but take up space. <br /> <br /> And poor Julia Roberts. In the past, she showed herself well as a strong will, a determined woman. In this movement it seems to be completely suppressed and has very little fire. It's not Julia Roberts that my wife likes to watch. <br /> <br /> OK, if I found one good thing, it would have to be Christopher Walken. Now it's entertainment. But, like Billy Crystal, almost nothing shows his character. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a night of thoughtless laughter with a very low redemption value, go see it. But if you're looking for a smart romantic comedy, this is not your movie. None of the above.
