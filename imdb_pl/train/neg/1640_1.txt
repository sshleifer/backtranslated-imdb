This film lacked ... everything: history, acting, surprise, ingenuity and soul. Fifteen minutes later I stared at the screen saying, "How could all these guys meet and consider themselves friends (even without a girl)? Another fifteen minutes later, I prayed for the most Amanda Peet. When the bad movie silently raises this ugly head, the sweets are a nice consolation. But it was not much! Cheated on all fronts!
