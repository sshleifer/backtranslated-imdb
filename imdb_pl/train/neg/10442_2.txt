Apart from the entire Internet, this movie was awful. I was expecting the film to be more of a farce than anything else. Instead, the creators of the movie tried to create a serious thriller / horror movie, and they completely missed it. There were only a few good parts and a few good lines from Samuel Jackson. In addition, it was a group of gore and a few poorly animated snakes. The whole joke on the Internet was much better than the actual movie. Now that the movie has actually appeared, I hope that this joke will die. Do not waste time or money on this piece of excess junk. If you're looking for something fun and fun, just go to Snakes on a Blog.
