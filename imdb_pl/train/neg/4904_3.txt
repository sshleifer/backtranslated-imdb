Teamo Supremo are three children, which include their leader - Captain Crandall, Rope Girl and Skate Lad, all with their own battlecry (buza! Chika! Woopa!) And dress and moves. They work for the governor, Kevin, and were recruited after they wanted to be heroes and play this game. They also live a normal life, have family and school duties, but most of the action takes place away from school villains. All villains have rather unique and peculiar features, such as Mister Vague and his people who never know what their plans are, but they still work. From the evil robot to the wicked baron, the three must meet them and stop their evil, and often strange, they plan to gain power, get revenge, etc. <br /> <br /> The animation itself is quite nice and smooth, but the style seems to be purposeful . The backgrounds have an overlapping color, and the buildings seem futuristic. The music is quite nice, and the show is not so bad, although the style is not my favorite. <br /> <br /> Plots are almost always pointless and funny, but in the end it's a cartoon and you can not blame them. It will not be the same rank as Fillmore! or Pepper Ann.
