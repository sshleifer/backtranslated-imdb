"Drawing Restraint 9" is a kind of movie that either loves or hates; Fortunately or not, I left it with a strong sense of wasted time and being completely stuffed "whaling killing is bad" propaganda. Aesthetically, the film could be pleasant, especially in its first half, until it is clear that each portraying presented serves as an allegory of various aspects of whale hunting. Until then, watching the daily duties of Japanese employees may be a bit fun, but it later becomes obvious that everything that appears on the screen is propaganda, and no single frame is an exception. I use the word "propaganda" because the film basically uses an old morality play device, where "good" and "bad" are not deduced in action, but are embedded in stone. Probably it's just me, but I think that this type of art is shallow and predetermined, even when it comes to noble (without sarcasm) striving for environmental protection. <br /> <br /> In my opinion this is a main sin when the film material is stretched without any justification, just for the sake of stretching. In my opinion, "Drawing Restraint 9" could easily fit in 75 minutes, but has a tiring length of 2 and 1/4 hours. Yes, there were interesting shots, but there were not enough of them to leave a 15-minute gap of nothingness without notification. The film does not have a standard scenario and there is no evolution of the form, but it is not a documentary, it is rather a kind of conceptual installation. This is an extraordinary form of the film, but it can still be seen as art, even if the concept is as simple and naive as here. OTOH I also believe that the director should have been honest and not pretend that it can be delivered in no less than 135 minutes. <br /> <br /> And yes, the music mostly resembled whale sounds. How surprising. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
