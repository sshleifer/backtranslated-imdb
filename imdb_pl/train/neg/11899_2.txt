Robert Forster, usually a very strong character actor, is lost at sea here cast as a New York family looking for revenge on bandits who murdered his son and attacked his wife in a home invasion. A terrible topic used for the thrill of emotions in the style of "Wishing to Death". It is not difficult to make fun of these disgusting proceedings: the dialogue is full of excuses, crime statistics are irrevocably dated, and the supporting characters are ridiculously overridden (especially the wicked judge who allows the accused murderer to go straight to the courtroom). Low profitability is contemptible because of her hypocrisy, especially as violence in our cities has increased. * with ****
