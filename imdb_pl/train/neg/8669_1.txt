First of all, I loved Ray Bradbury's novel. It is a kind of horror that appears under the skin and is associated with you later. It was one of his best books, you know, Fahrenheit 451 and Dandelion Wine. I hope this movie will be fine. He had many opportunities, with a great cast like Jason Robards and Jonathn Pryce. And Bradbury even wrote the script himself. And besides, he has PAM GRIER! <br /> <br /> How can it go wrong? <br /> <br /> There may be spoilers inside. <br /> <br /> First of all, he was muffled. Most of the horror of the book was lost, because Bradbury had to be forced to reduce violence to a minimum. All visualizations from the book ... disappeared. Everything that made you squirm ... disappeared. <br /> <br /> And then there's acting. Like many movies that Disney threw out in the 1980s, children in this movie can not act. And that eavesdropped on me, none of them looked like 13, but 9 or 10. Their strong friendship was not addressed. It was more like friends. <br /> <br /> You'd think Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce can do it as Halloway and Mr Dark. But here it is as if they just do not care. All they want to do is pay off some mortgage or something. This is far from some of their best performances. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier was okay as a witch, but the charecter of Dust Witch alone was not well removed. It is much less evil and there is no presence like in the book. <br /> <br /> And all that's left of the book. Night of pursuit after the balloon, marking the house of Jim, the real death of Mr. Dark, what happened to Mr. Coogan on the carousel, the fate of the lightning rod seller, the real death of the witch and oh much more. <br /> <br /> And the special effects were bad, even in the 80's. The carousel of doom on one side with the horses put on it was not really scary, and this strange green fog that really had nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> I could still talk about how this movie broke up the original novel, but it makes the blood boil. Do not watch this movie, but read the book. This is the Bradbury classic.
