Wow, I could be such a good movie, The beginnings with Brittany Daniels connected, I think that we will do a flashing, but nothing, the film starts again with filming a kid. This film would probably be better if it were not for acting. My point is that acting was usually terrible. Although with the lines that poor actors had to deal with, I think they did everything they could. some of the actors' skills ... The film stretches behind the alleged shocking conclusion ... All in all, I've seen worse low-budget movies, but given that it was a buzz because of the 8 movies that I died for, I was very disappointed ... By the way, there were some reviewers said it was gore and stuff. Did I see the same movie ... Well, it's 4 out of eight, and so far only one was good ...
