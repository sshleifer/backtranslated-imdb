This film NEVER should have been made. From poorly prepared animation to bad action. I'm not sure at what point the people in the movie said "Ok, it looks good! Let's do it! "I was impressed by how awful this movie really was. At one point, which could very well be the worst point, computer generated Saber Tooth gold falls from the roof, stabbing an idiot creator of cats in the mouth ... uh, ooookkkk. The villain of the film was a paralyzed trackpad that died within minutes of the first appearance. The other two manages to kill a handful of people before they are burned and shot. Then there is a random person waiting for a jungle victim ... who scares me for one reason. Will there be a second part? God, for the sake of people, wherever I have hope. <br /> <br /> This movie was pure trash. From power point power points to the end of the slide show.
