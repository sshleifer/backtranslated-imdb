This relic of a short film starts with a teenager passing through the trial of obtaining a driving license. It quickly gets bypassed by almost every possible topic related to cars. <br /> <br /> Things like buggies, drag racing, custom painting and car shows are discussed. He often tries to be humorous, but instead the movie is boring, stretched out and sometimes sexist. None of the people in the film is heard. Instead, everything takes place in narratives and lecturers. I'm sorry, but I can not stand it. <br /> <br /> There is nothing educational or interesting in "Dad, can I borrow a car?". This is another piece of thoughtless filler who devotes time to the television program "Wonderful World Of Disney". 1/10
