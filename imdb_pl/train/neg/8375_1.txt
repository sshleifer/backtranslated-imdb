America. A land of freedom, hope and dreams. This is a nation that since its independence has been seeking democracy, prosperity and peace for the whole world, for the good of all mankind. However, there are times when you can not help but I want the Americans to simply stay on their side of the Atlantic. <br /> <br /> This "movie" (and I use this word with some reservations) evokes these feelings with intense purity. This vision of hell follows the adventures of Calvin, a strange jewel thief who was created by fixing Marlon Wayan's severed head on the body of a two-meter dwarf. After unintentionally dropping a large diamond into Vanessa's purse, a career woman who does not want to have children, Calvin realizes that to get back the diamond, he has to shrink. So, like any normal person, Calvin dresses up at the age of 2 and parks on the doorstep of a poor woman, where she is discovered by Darryl, the affluent husband of Vanessa. <br /> <br /> Darryl is falling in love with Calvin's disguise, although the "child" has a full set of teeth, stubble, tattoos, knife scars and sex drive for 16 years old. Even more absurdly, Vanessa also does not see wearing Calvin by an infant and is actually trying to feed a small pervert. This unfortunate attack on the soul of humanity tries and fails to find humor in rape, scatology, sexual assault and pedophilia, but in the dishonest attempt to transform into a piece of "family entertainment" the Wayan brothers mix the disgusting amount of sentiment and defective morality. <br /> <br /> The brothers outshone the attempt of the Freudian rehabilitation of the thieving rapist, revealing that he "had a bad father". Repeating Darryl's crotch allows Calvin to develop a loving father's relationship with his son, whom he and Darryl always wanted. As if it was not funny enough, Calvin's attempts to sexually assault Vanessa somehow convince her that the woman is selfish enough to afford a successful career, and instead she should spend her life playing as a small housewife who spends her time on transformation, pushing children and cooking for the husband. <br /> <br /> In this video, Wayan's brothers confused their biting and twisted form of humor with stereotypical sentimentality that attacked most of Hollywood's latest work. In addition, they are typical of the current generation of black comedians who are responsible for transforming Afro-American humor into a poor and miserable shadow of oneself, which excessively indulges in jokes and primitive sexual gags. According to the laws, these two people should be legally forbidden to re-reach for something that looks more like a camera. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the current artistic and moral bankruptcy of American cinema means that by this time next month they will undoubtedly film two parts and earn millions of dollars from cheap merchandising transactions.
