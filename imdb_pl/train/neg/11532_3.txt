I rented the movie that night because neither my girlfriend nor I have ever seen him, although we have heard from a mutual friend how "it was great". <br /> <br /> Now I am quite conservative in my views, but I knew that entering into it would be quite liberal considering who directed it. I came to the conclusion that before the film begins, Michael Douglas will play a sympathetic folk liberal beloved by the masses, and his antagonist will be hardened by a conservative opponent. But I thought that where the political statement begins and ends. <br /> <br /> OK, the story was solid: a single president falls for a lobbyist. OK, it has potential, which I thought was quite funny, because the plot was unique. But then the film became a liberal advertising. The film has become more related to gun control and environmental issues than to the relationship between the President and Sydney (Annette Bening). <br /> <br /> In this movie there were a few ridiculous premises: 1) The character Sydney plays is a six-person lobbyist who is "closer". Could she be more picky? She was constantly disorganized and seemed to be afraid of everything. Almost "closer". I am selling and could not "close" sell glasses of water to a man dying of thirst. <br /> <br /> 2) Second, is there anything more ridiculous than Richard Dreyfuss playing on a right-wing fanatic? He is the most liberal man in Hollywood and she is playing a rightist ideologist. Give me a break. I liked how he took his conservative character and made him as bad as possible. <br /> <br /> 3) The speech at the end was simply absurd. The poem about "I am a proud member of ACLU with cards" was a joke. First, no president would ever admit to being an active member of the ultra fringe group. Second, why even bring something like that. You have simply alienated more than half of the audience who is moderate or conservative. <br /> <br /> I thought that the plot was great and unique. I thought Michael Douglas was a good choice for president. But the film went from the "film" to the political leftist statement, which is why the film failed. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the great plot devastated by Hollywood forced their political views on the public
