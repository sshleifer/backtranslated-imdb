How wonderful. Another film about America authored by someone who visited here probably half a dozen times a day, and is considered an "expert" in the country. Hell. I should go to Germany for a week and then come back and make a film about Germany as "the land of the Nazis" or in some such. Boy Wim IL, you should meet with Lars von Trier and make a ULTIMATE movie about Americans. Of course, we all know that we need a pretentious leftist "we are the world" Europeans to make a "real" film about America. <br /> <br /> Yes, right. For a continent that started not one but two world wars, Europe certainly has many opinions about America's bad foreign policy. <br /> <br /> P.S. Do not worry, boy Wim IL, there are a lot of UC-Berkeley Americans who will love your movie. Of course, these are the same people who think that George W. Bush is the worst of Hitler, and the picture of a can of soup is a "pure genius" !!
