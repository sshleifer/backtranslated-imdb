I can not believe that none of the official reviews of this movie will warn people that it contains two rather annoying scenes of sexual violence. It's as if our culture accepted such behavior as simply sexual, but not violent. My biggest problem with the film is that it does not condemn these attacks - as in the case of a woman who is repeatedly attacked and pressured, she never attracts men to account for her actions or anyone else. One man is stopped from assaulting when someone throws a dagger at him, but he is only admonished "you can not force a woman to love you" and not "you should never force a woman sexually, you moron" ... a feminine point of view, the movie is disappointed. In a sense, he "throws the bone" on women, allowing them to be both qualified warriors and leaders, but the film is much more defined by the romance - which is characterized by the view that human sexuality must be associated with power imbalances, with men dominating women they love. This amazing martial arts fighter does not use his fighting skills to fight off attackers. He never even tells them to apologize - it seems that he apologizes. Generally, a depressing and annoying movie, with some great photos and some cool fight scenes, but not as good as Hero for a long shot.
