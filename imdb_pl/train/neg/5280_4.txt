Chris, the adoptive son of a moral family, a loser who works in a school newspaper with Kate (Christine Lakin from the horrible sweet series "Step by Step" fortunately already liquidated TGIF ABC), learns that he is inherited a porn empire from his biological parents. He lost sight of what true friendship and love is and blah blah other nonsense. He also has to struggle with an uncle who wants to control a family business and a variable lawyer (is not he?) A little below the average teen comedy that steals from better teen comedies (HIGHLY American Pie-esquire is openly), grabs you in the head with any moral opportunity and wasting the only talent he has (Wayne Newton, Lin Shaye and if I really stretch the star, Martin Starr from "Freaks and Geeks", and Justin Berfield from "Malcolm in the Middle"). It's not bad, but it's not good. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: some topk√≥w gets topless <br /> <br /> My class: C- <br /> <br /> Where I saw: Starz on Demand (available until September 29)
