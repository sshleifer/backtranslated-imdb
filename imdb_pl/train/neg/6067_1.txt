SLIGHT SPOILERS (but it does not matter). <br /> <br /> Exercise in a gobblygo of catastrophic proportions, not even worth the 10 line, I have to put these notes on the network waves. This is the only worst episode of the Masters series so far and the first one that qualifies for the non-existent Mystery Science Theater treatment. Even if it took me half an hour to realize the intended ironic angle, it was still a very bad mess. Its only value is the perspective that forces you to realize that in addition to top and ugly masks, this genre is successful only when classic cinematic notions of photography and lighting, dialogue and acting, editing and synchronization are used. They are absent here, and John Carpenter is not a master. Dot. And no trivial analysis of an easy social comment will change that. Oddly enough, Carpenter was never more than director B, but at least movies like "Fog" and "The Thing" had a great atmosphere (the latter is one of my favorite cults). <br /> <br /> Disgusting acting. Camera angles are stuck in cement. Rhythm without stress. Perhaps the most unpleasant part of the episode is the plot, which of course JC can not be blamed (unless the writers were Cody's buddies). The first two minutes of slo-up of a girl running through the woods to be almost the duo of Scully-Mulder, on which she works, is the first and last thing that works in the movie. But give it a rest, a girl rushing through deserted forests nowhere in particular needs a desperately abortion accidentally rendezvous with the fender of a pair of doctors "women's rights" whose clinic is just at the end of the road around the corner. Oh, and I will not even wonder how the case arrives and accelerates from 0 to 60 in six seconds. He wonders about possible broken ribs or concussion. <br /> <br /> Then everything is falling apart quickly. Mindless dialogue "I just want to help you", infinitely slow back and forth movement at the gate, great fighting tactics, like the intersection of the phone line (in the era of mobile phones?), Followed by the shootings: born again Ramboesque clinic director vs Ron Perlman and high school bullpen for a few throws during the Easter break. Another lovely line: "So what do we do?" From the kid who was just sitting on the pile of assault rifles in the back of the van. Ee, no, it's not the pheasant season yet. So who needs these teenage boys anyway. And what about the good old tried and true method of a lonely madman who breaks through the gate with his American SUV? <br /> <br /> As for the exchange of the spheres themselves, the cuts here were as stiff as staccato from DC comics. Only Wham, Bam and Whiz balloon titles were missing. And everything to the rhythm of the soundtrack of the decent old section of Mannix. <br /> <br /> At some point, we find out that Daddy is not really a daddy, but at that moment we were not taken care of anymore. The only source of the drama of this story is the conflict between pro-life father and his pregnant daughter, who is only grateful that there are no twins. However, there is not a single scene, flashback or not in which they have ever been found. They remain only abstractions all the time. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the guard, each character is absolutely disliked. Colorless, hysterical, boring, macho. As perfectly flat as human wallpaper. None of the doctors seems to have anything medical in them. And there is this argumentative father who is struggling with his daughter, as if he was a stressed boy. Fortunately he got him. There are two great comic moments worthy of MST: gusher, when Angelica's hydraulics leave, and then a newborn lobster with a stuck baby's head. The belly of Angelica's rugby was also charming before she finally cast a little monster into the hell. As for this insolent male abortion scene ... well, they should keep the Miike episode and forbid it instead. <br /> <br /> In short, the third rate at Rosemary's Baby meets Alien at the bottom of M.A. episode. The same smelly, visible only to today's permissive generation under 16, will ensure, as someone else said, that this series will not be renewed for the third season. A real shame because there are many great productions, including really decent forgery, like Dante's Homecoming or the wonderfully bizarre "Sick Girl" by McKee. Not to mention the excellent paintings of Malone's "Fairhaired Child". <br /> <br /> I apologize to John Carpenter, I believe your directing days are over. It's time to run after the president.
