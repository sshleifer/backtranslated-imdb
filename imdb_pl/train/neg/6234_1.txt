Even Goebbels would not be able to do a propaganda feat, like what Gore did with this complete fiction. This is a study of how numbers and statistics can be reversed to tell you what you said earlier. "Scientists," says Gore, confirmed the importance of global warming, including social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists. Would you say that a meteorologist is an expert in neurosurgery? Geologists involved in field research and data analysis do not support Gores's alarming claims about global warming. As one of those geologists working in this field for the past 40 years, I have not seen any evidence to support global warming. My analysis of this film and Gores' activities over the past few years has led me to the conclusion that global warming is his way of preserving importance and significance. No more no less. Ask one simple question about global warming or a "journalist" one simple question. Tell me. What temperature should the Earth have?
