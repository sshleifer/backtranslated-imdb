The first glance at the cover of this photo looks like a good rock n roll movie. But do not be fooled by the cover or the fact that Alice Cooper and Blondie are in it. The plot is just awful, just like acting. Plain and simple: BAD <br /> <br /> This is not a roadie movie, it's just a thin love story, so horrible that you see it through it. The only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack. Some good songs and that's why I give 2 out of 10. If it was not music, it would be 0 out of 10. Meat Loaf is a terrible actor (at least he was in 1980), and the girl who plays in the group does not look good! This film was a huge disappointment for me because it contains many good promises.
