The previous comment forced me to write this. He says that Muslims are blond and dark Serbs (because our blood is mixed). This comment simply says that this opinion can be published by a racist. Look, the race is nothing. I am a colorful blind. I look like Pierce Brosnan, but I'm not Irish. So what? I can add that I'm not 100% Serbian, that I have some Austrian and Croatian blood, but what's going on. Anyone who uses racist prejudices about such evil intentions as Lantos (producer9 and director is a racist for me.) Karadzhic, Izetbegovich, Milosevic, Tudjman are all monsters and I blame them for destroying my life, my family, my country, Yugoslavia. that they will be in hell, but it will not return our deceased relatives I am proud of being a Serb and I am proud of my cousins, Austrians, Croats, Muslims, Hungarians, Arabs (yes, I am from Serbia and I have a multiethnic family). Croats in Sarajevo, terrible terrorism of street gangs, Muslim extremism I will add: I am kneeling and praying for all the innocent sisters and brothers of Muslims, Catholics or Orthodox Jews killed in this war, our misery, false humanitarianism that does not help at all, helps Lantos fill his pockets more doe, fine!
