I just saw this movie and I have to say it was a great waste of time. The girl who played Eva (Ellen Fjaestad) can not act at all. She read her poems very naturally and throughout the film she had a very unnatural look on her face. Rosanna Munter, who played Petra on the other side, is something natural. She played her role with great perfection. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS! The story was simple - we've seen it many times. He breaks up, finds another, becomes jealous, breaks up with the other girl and finally returns together. There were no surprises, it was known that Eva would fall apart and that Adam would "connect" with Petra. The only thing that no one saw was that Petra told Adam to follow Eva at the party. She became serious, which is part of Petra, whom viewers had not seen before in the film, and told him to win Eva's heart, which was really sweet. <br /> <br /> Besides Rosanna Munter, a lonely actor who gives an unforgettable performance. <br /> <br /> It's an average movie with average actors, so I do not recommend it!
