The tomb of the mummy begins with a review of the events in the mummy's Hand, and then shifts history forward several years and through the ocean to the United States of America, where the current high priest and mummy of Kharis set off to ravage and take revenge on those who have violated the grave in the past. <br /> <br /> While I absolutely loved "Mumia" with Boris Karloff as the mummy of Imhotep, and I liked very much the "Hand of the mummy" with Tom Tyler as Kharis (which is a direct prequel to this movie), I was not like in " The Mummy's Tomb. " <br /> <br /> It is made in a similar style to the previous film and has a slightly similar plot, though in the new version. Lon Chaney Jr. is okay as Kharis, but he does not really stand out. And I think that's my main critic of the film - that nothing really stands out. There is nothing really terrible here, but nothing extraordinary, so the viewer remains a rather mummy tale of the mummy.
