When I was a child, I remember seeing it while visiting our "uncle" Phil's friend. We came back! And Dinosaur's Story is a stupid cartoon about a dinosaur named Rex (expressed by the wonderful John Goodman). Tells the little dinosaur boy a story about how the dinosaurs came back to Earth to live. He explains that he was part of the thing that brought them along with some friends. I think that the villain of the Doctor / Professor of this film could have been responsible for returning them, but I do not care. Children can like it, but personally it's just too bad. John Goodman was probably the only decent thing. Poor!
