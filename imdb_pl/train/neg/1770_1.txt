He and his wife both agree that this is one of the worst films ever. Certainly in the top ten of those that I watched all the way. At least "Plan 9" was pleasant. <br /> <br /> I really liked Christine, The Dead Zone, Firestarter, Carrie and some of his other movies. "Cujo" did not care too much (just because the sound was so bad in the versions that I saw and often I could not say what people say) or "Pet Sematary (Pet Cemetery)". > <br /> But this mess was a total mistake in every possible way. The "creatures" themselves seemed designed by a 9-year-old. (No offense for 9-year-olds.) <br /> <br /> Even "single-line" made us groan and we were not too funny.
