This is it. This is one. This is the worst film ever made. Always. Everything beats. I've never seen worse. Retreat from the trophy and give it to these people ... there is no comparison. <br /> <br /> Even three days after seeing this (for some reason I still do not know why) I can not believe how wildly the movie is / was. It's so bad. So far from anything that could be considered a movie, a story or anything that should ever have been created and brought into our existence. <br /> <br /> It made me ask if people really are on this earth. Do good deeds. It made me feel disgusted with myself and our progress as a species in this universe. This kind of film honestly hurts us as a society. We should be ashamed. I really can not stress that our global responsibility as people living here and creating art is that we must prevent these glaring distortions of our reality for our own good. It's embarrassment. I do not know how on earth none of the actors, writers or director of this movie sleeps at night, knowing that they played a role in the creation of "Loaded". I do not know what kind of disgusting monsters they like to watch this type of movie. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I love a good "bad" movie. I love Shark Attack 3, I love Bad Taste, there are HILARIOUS. I tell all my friends to see them because they are "bad." <br /> <br /> But this ....... crosses the "bad" line into a whole new dimension. It's awkwardly wrong. This is bad when you know everything that will happen, every line, every action, every death, every sequence BEFORE the event; and not like a second or two, that is, after seeing the first 5 minutes before. <br /> <br /> Every cheesy "effect" of editing is shamelessly used again and again to a sickening point. I really never want to see the effect of a "trembling" camera "drug noise" or a jump in cuts or slant cuts or ANY FANCY CUT EVER. It is very boring, repetitive and it just tortures the audience. <br /> <br /> But ....... and let me be specific here, the most AGAIN in this film is that, considering the production, there appears to be a bit decent to this excrement sum of money. I will personally grab the director's arms if I ever saw him and hug him, surrendering him, demanding that he run home and swallow two gallons of Drain-O, or I will do it for him. <br /> <br /> If we ever needed a new form of inhuman torture for our prisoners of war abroad, just keep showing them this movie in a padded cell. Trust me, I think that they will become more extravagant in the use of suicide methods after the 72nd seat in this place. <br /> <br /> Stop filming these films, they are simply the worst of all aspects of our society. Please. Stop. NOW.
