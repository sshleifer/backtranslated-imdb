I saw the first of dwarven movies and sometimes I did not have the pleasure of watching him. In the first part there are many well-known television / comedy programs, in fantasy costumes, typical small episodes of their Stand-up-Program and this is the problem the second film has to deal with. Everything was there ... nothing new to gain. You know most of the often boring and stupid "jokes" and you always feel that their goal was to introduce every Comedylooser of the last decade who wants to come back to the stage. There is nothing important in this story: the typical fairy-tale story of Rumpelstiltskin, irrelevant. I was expecting something like that, but I could not complain. I'm actually complaining about lazy writers who had the whole story; their only interest was to get many jokes and parody inside, but they did not get them. This crap is beyond the great appearance of Helge Schneider, a total waste of time and money (if you do not like it, remove 2 points of my evaluation). wide casting every Friday evening on SAT1 or RTL for free. I'm sure you'll recognize the "laugther√≥w" that I saw in the cinema yesterday.
