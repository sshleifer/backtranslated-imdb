This movie did not deserve the next few minutes that I will devote to his criticism, but I know that many people like me are on IMDb.com to help make decisions about movies. Only for this reason I am writing this. <br /> <br /> "Live Feed" is like the Asian version of "The Incredible Torture Show" from 1976 (aka "Blood Sucking Freaks") http://www.imdb .com / title / tt0077247 /. Torture, fragmentation, murder, cannibalism ... certainly everything here is with the writing of the third grade, pathetic acting and the perverted attempt of the black comedy. <br /> <br /> The movie takes place in China, but everyone speaks English. There are a lot of girls in the movie who are scared by the dogs being stripped at the market, but they're sexually excited about entering the porn salon. One of the women, who is later disgusted with the dirt in the toilet, still has a boyfriend with her friend (how he got there can be the only interesting thing in this whole movie). for the movie B. Even if you downloaded it for free, it would be an insult to your hard drive.
