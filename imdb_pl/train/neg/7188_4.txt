When I saw the title, I thought we would get another try-hard-slasher, but in reality "7eventy 5ive" is a gentle and almost 80-way turn after the slow pace, which raises the momentum to the last half hour, which leads to a scandalously cheesy climax and even stupid ending. He will not get prizes for originality, because he is as systematic as you can get and steal his thunder in the form of emotions (usually cheap jumping from a jump), location (isolated residence) and motivation from other films. The glittering direction is with the book, and the material is quite broken with ill-made red herring in its sophisticated plotting and weak script. Sometimes funny, but I was still entertained mainly because of his violent and frightening acts of pulsing violence against some unbearably nervous college students by a psychotic assassin with a battle ax. The performances were not bad in the form of a brave young cast, however, the characters portrayed were not particularly tempting. Always presentable, Rutger Hauer appears in a short supporting role as a gray-haired detective. Cleverly made, but shallow and undeniable addition to the folds.
