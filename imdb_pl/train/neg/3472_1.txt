James Gandolfini is a good actor, so he did what he did, he took part in this piece of indecent garbage. Affleck is simply lightweight, which just can not cut it, the rest of the cast is really unforgettable. I saw it in the USA in an empty theater, I soon knew why this place was empty after about 10 minutes. I left before the end, it was so bad, so imagine my surprise when in England I saw that the movie has a great report from this "yoyo" by Paul Ross at one of Sunday's Sunday markets. I always rely on the fact that Ross will save me money on cinema tickets, and if he says that the movie is good, I will go straight to this page to check it out. This movie should be saved on DVD for Â£ 1.99 at the nearest supermarket.
