this movie was banned in England? why? tom savini, george romero, dario argento, lucio fulci and others have done much worse before and since then ... <br /> <br /> this movie has all the basic elements of a decent horror movie of the '70s or early' 80s. good-looking girls (by the way, who can not save their lives), a terrible storm with a torrential downpour, a scythe, a mad brother wandering around the family estate and a really damn good turn at the end. but banned? seriously. when the English parliament banned the film, the Italians probably laughed at their collective donkeys about how real and prudish they really were. <br /> <br /> maybe two minutes of total time on the screen devoted to violence and gore (which was very poor). there was nudity, but there was no sex, although, of course, allusions to sex were referred to. but absolutely nothing worth prohibiting. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see what you could do if the creators had a decent budget. at the moment the movie is funny, but the lack of image and sound quality is perceived as the final result. <br /> <br /> banned ... what a joke ...
