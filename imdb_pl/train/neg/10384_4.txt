... THIS IS ONE! Very nice premise, right by the whip. <br /> <br /> He has a great first stage, I have to admit that credit goes. <br /> <br /> He has solid characters and a decent scenario for a ghost story, but here are the things that worried me: every time ghosts appeared that I really liked; how it was done, what it looked like ... the only thing was the relationship of the spirit. Because of the way things went in the first scene, one would think that their dynamics would be different. <br /> <br /> Things slowed down a bit too much inside, and the crab / spider scene was just not good. BUT then the ending is really very good! Sure, "The Grudge" basically told the same story with a polished lens, but without samurai, and I liked it relatively well in this film. <br /> <br /> Please, someone with a hardened style has made this movie. <Br /> <br /> Fans of "Silent Rage" will surely love this movie.
