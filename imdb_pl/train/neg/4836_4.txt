Let's start with straight lines. On the part of the viewer there are a few good "details of the director", some points of view on movie stages that are nice. Special effects are good enough, good set design also good. But the story is too simple. It shows how the unit of the elite bomber squad lives, it works, and sometimes it dies. Shows the drama of life at war. In my film as a serious action movie "addicted", I missed the click that stuck my eyes and mind on the screen. One of the things that must be present in the film to be considered good is the ability to immerse the viewer in the reality of film and time. It did not happen to me. I remained "aware" throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I think this movie has gained its place in a reputation based on the "subconscious" charm of American patriotism, a healthy and authentic feeling, but not appropriate application as a film fame generator. More than a movie about war, popularity is growing. <br /> <br /> Simple thought: if it was a movie from World War II or me, only a changing time, if everything remained the same, would it be rewarded? Certainly not. Why? Because they are so great that they raise the bar up. <br /> <br /> Compared with rivals in Oscars, I do not think that all prizes won have been correctly awarded.
