This movie is one of the craziest images of history. Extremely inaccurate, this film does nothing to honor hundreds of thousands of enslaved Dutch, British, Chinese, American and indigenous workers whose sadistic Japanese people have killed and tortured to death. The bridge was to be built "over the bodies of a white man", according to the main Japanese engineer. It's disgusting that such unspeakable horrors perpetrated by the Japanese hijackers are the source of the film, in which the bridge itself is not even close to the exact bridge. The actual bridge was built of steel and concrete, not wood. What about the survivors who are still alive? They hate the movie and everything they want to represent. Their friends were hungry, tortured and murdered by cruel sadists. Those who have not died of dislocation, hunger or illness are deeply hurt by a film that makes such light in their dark times.
