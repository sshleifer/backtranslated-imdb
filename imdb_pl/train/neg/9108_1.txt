This so-called prequel is just a bad remake for a better version of Dangerous Liasons. The plot is the same as most of the script. I really liked the book on which it's based, and I loved the first movie, but I will not even bother with the third movie. The senseless teasing of the two main heroes in the prequel was completely predictable and non-original, and ... I just can not stress how bad the movie was. If you do not want to take this word for yourself, just look at it and you'll see what I mean. If you have read the review that says "If you like the first one, you'll like the second one", the only reason is THIS IS THE EXACT PEOPLE! Although the plot is not even that good. They took so many lines from the first movie that it's hard to say which movie you're watching.
