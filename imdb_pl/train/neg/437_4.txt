(Spoilery) <br /> <br /> I was very curious about this movie after I learned he was clever and witty. I had to stop halfway because of the unbearable boredom I felt. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the film would be acceptable: illustrating the way in which the relationship between a man and a woman develops, through all problems and difficulties that two people living in a big city can experience. What made me not like the whole movie is two things. <br /> <br /> First of all, the film was so down-to-earth that it looked as if describing the problems that the couple had to solve during the day, became ordinary and boring. <br /> <br /> Second, general sloppy production, with barely understandable dialogues. <br /> <br /> It's a pity.
