Della Myers (Kim Basinger) is a high-class housewife who lives in a private condominium in the suburbs with her twin children and abusive husband Kenneth (Craig Sheffer). Della devotes all the attention of the twins, neglecting their home, appearance and nervousness of Kenneth. On Christmas Eve, he goes to the local shopping center at night to buy gift wrapping paper and does not find any parking space. When he sees an old car parked in two places, he leaves a message to the owner, calling him "selfish jerk." When the shopping center closes, Delli's car is held by the driver of an old car, and she is threatened by four punks? Chuckie (Lukas Haas), Afro-American Huey (Jamie Starr), Sino-American Vingh (Leonard Wu) and Latin Tomás (Luis Chávez). When the security guard of the shopping center protects her, gets shot in the head by Chuckie, Dell speeds up his car, trying to escape the criminals. However, he crashes his truck near a forest hunted by a gang. He takes the toolbox and hides in the woods, fighting with the gang to survive. <br /> <br /> A few days ago I saw the trailer "While She Was Out" and wanted to watch a DVD. Unfortunately, the trailer is better than the movie and I am completely disappointed with this boring and unbelievable collection of stereotypes. Della Myers is portrayed as an insecure and neglected housewife and non-existent as a wife; motherhood is her only interest in her family concept. It is chased by four criminals, but defeats them with a set of tools that appears to be a Batman utility belt. That is why the plot is so absurd that it irritates. A gang of criminals creates a favorite stereotype of American films, with African-American, Chinese-American and Latin with the American Lord, to be politically correct. Kim Basinger has decent acting, but their children are too young for a fifty-five-year-old woman. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Enquanto Ela Está Fora" ("When She Was Out")
