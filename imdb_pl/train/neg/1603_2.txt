If it were not for the performances of Barry Diamond and Art Evans as unconscious stoners, I would have no reason to recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> The plot focuses on a 10-year high school reunion, which takes place in a supposedly abandoned high school (looks more like a horror prop about a low budget from the 1950s), and a mad class student made a very traumatic joke. This student wants to kill the whole class for vengeance. <br /> <br /> John Hughes falls in love with his characters too, because he kills only one student and also a lady for lunch (Goonies' Anne Ramsey). We are convinced that a horny couple is killed, but I never see a cursed thing! This is a terrible movie that continued the decline of the National Lampoon spiral in the 80's and 90's.
