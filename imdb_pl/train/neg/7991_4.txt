Paint by numbers and mediocre action written by an authentic color - and a few moments that are really wonderful and deeply felt. It effectively reflects the delicate transformation of the girl into adulthood and is very sensitive and clever about the cultural conflict of the main family experiences. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this germ of a good movie is trapped in a purposeless and extremely complicated plot in which there is a religious conflict, a conflict about a road construction project, a sex life of secondary and even tertiary figures, a mysterious man who lives in a forest, a bunch of racist hooligans, at least three different carnivals, intricacies of local ecclesiastical policy, and so on. And all this does not even include the real story, which concerns only the hopes, dreams and frustrations of two girls (and their whole families) at the turning point of their lives. I was really shocked when I realized that the whole thing was supposed to take place in one summer (and that so many films were shot in 1.5 hours!) <br /> <br /> In the end, the movie is melodramatic, each story the point is predictable, important life-changing events happen, and then they are forgotten about 10 minutes later ... and some of these events are extremely unpalatable. The most shocking thing is that one of the characters is involved in a terrible crime (in a completely predictable "twist"), and then it is completely forgiven, and the entire incident forgotten since then. Similarly, the secondary character is introduced only to die a few minutes later and provide another "twist". It's all mechanical, until the end, which nicely connects all the loose ends (not all of them, only those that the film thinks about.)
