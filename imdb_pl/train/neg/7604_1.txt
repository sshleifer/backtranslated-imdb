Of course it takes place in the west, but the title makes it look like a conventional western. Instead, it's the sheriff's movie of a woman. Make no mistake, although it's a bad movie about the sheriff. She becomes a sheriff when her husband is shot; she is just a little nervous about it. Her main goal is to chase a villain who is also a woman, but the villain hires a guy to kill her. That's how it happens, the hero falls in love with the killer and vice versa. It's totally stupid because everybody killed in this movie has a new sheriff who thanks you. She had more than a few chances to kill the murderer behind bars, but I think because she liked him, she would not have done it. The killer is also the mayor of the city for personal reasons, which are rather stupid. This movie is very boring and it's not really worth watching ... it's not one of the better MST3000 episodes they've made. I can not imagine anyone seeing it without them, because it would be much more painful. Corman is a low-budget director, but even he should know better than people go into one place and leave the other.
