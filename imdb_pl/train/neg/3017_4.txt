Now I had the best intentions when watching this. I like some of Tony Scott's works, also my friend told me that this is a great movie, although I have heard it differently from other people. But it was simply hopeless. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, Tony Scott tried too hard. It was all too much. Let me develop. <br /> <br /> Miss Knightley was hyperactive and not in a good way. The people who performed well were Mickey Rourke, Edgar Ramirez and Christopher Walken, but their time on the screen was not able to save the movie. <br /> <br /> There were several scenes that jumped out of their originality, but somehow it seemed that they were written by someone other than the main author. A melody was used about 4 times, which really started bugging a second time. I am a strong advocate of not using the same melody more than once. <br /> <br /> The editing also really worked because the cutting speed is quite high. Oh, and the repeated echo of some lines of Keira sounded simply cheesy after hearing it for the second, third, fourth time, etc. <br /> <br /> Basically, my opinion is that if you want to see the movement of the action, which is fast and "a bit" funny, and you do not care about everything I mentioned above, you may like it. <br /> <br /> (By the way: I'm not Keira Knightley fan.)
