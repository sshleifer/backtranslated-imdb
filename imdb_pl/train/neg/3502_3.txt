Sarah Silverman is now a comic book of the "taste of the month". Is it really worth all the noise? Yes and no. Sometimes it is fun, sometimes funny (her routine work is actually quite interesting, though not always fun). At other times, you feel cheated by the media because you are outmatching the next performer. She is one of those really cute comedians to which men come, saying that they are copying her intelligence and wit. But if you turn them off, most men will admit that they just want to sleep with her, and that's why they watch her. It reminds me why many men came to Margaret Cho and Janeane Garofalo, although none of them are now "hot" in popularity. Sarah does not drink or smoke (at least cigs), so she should be hot when she is 60, so her fans (especially men) can be happy. <br /> <br /> When it comes to this concert, it's like her comedy. When it works, it's fun. When this is not happening, it is full of boredom and very, very boring. This episode of AIDS is the best. It is invariably fun and has a really good satire in it. The character of Brian Poeshna has an unhealthy obsession with Tabu in one episode and it is hilarious that he sees him in a t-shirt with pleats. But they never really go anywhere with it, and it eventually ends successfully. Sarah's character in the show is quite annoying, a gay couple (Brian Poeshn and some other guy) seems to be busy and never really doing anything for the whole series and supporting players (including Sarah's real sister, Laura, who does not look like her ) They're ok. When jokes strike, they are brilliant. When they do not do it, they are terrible and I mean really terrible. There is also an obsession with coprophy (aka poop jokes) that seems to replace today's wit and intelligence in comedy. So you should watch this program? If you have a crush on Sarah, go to him. You can look at her and pretend she is yours. As for her show, it ranges from good to absolute zero.
