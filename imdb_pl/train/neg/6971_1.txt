This terrifying waste of film stocks is Count Floyd appearing every sixty seconds. Somehow, they managed to get together Steve Railsback, Susan Anspach, John Vernon and Joe Flaherty on the set, and they could not reach within five miles, about eight kilometers from the actual movie. BOY does this sucking. There is no single line, thought, shot or effect from the non-cerebral opening sequence to brain-free closure. Magic, ethereal Susan Anspach from Five Easy Pieces - boring. Steve Railsback - boring. John Vernon - boring. Big mistake - boring. If it's a scary movie, Buttercream Gang is a thuglife document. <br /> <br /> Seriously - every bad movie contains its own explanation of its evil. This is usually in the opening credits - "Written, Directed and Produced" by "one guy". Or in the middle of the action is some bimbo so without talent, that you know that there is one and only one reason why this turkey was created. Here you will not find out until the last part of the loan, where the cooperation of about a dozen sub-divisions of the Canadian government is grateful. <br /> <br /> At the moment I'm watching MST on Beast of Yucca Flats to get the taste out of my mouth. Ghod, what an improvement.
