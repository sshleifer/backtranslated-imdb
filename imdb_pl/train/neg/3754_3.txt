As a longtime fan of all Star Trek series, I found this to be a disappointing episode and I wonder if the liberal use of "flashbacks" using Will Riker exploits, both positive (and mainly romantic) and negative (a lot of pain and the death of a crew member) was a money-saving device, as well as many of their "bottle shows" (episodes in which all scenes take place at the Enterprise). Diana Muldaur (who also appeared at least twice in the original series) deserved a better final look than her heroine, Dr. Kate Pulaski. Loyal spectators (in the world of Star Trek, is there any other kind?). They were also shortened. This was the last episode of the second season; in this way the season ended "not with a bang" but "whimpering".
