Dan Duryea, a perfectly decent movie actor B, who made a lot of looking noirs in the 1940s, can not do much about it: a young man is accused of murdering an unhappily married singer; when he is sentenced to death, his wife decides to solve the matter with the help of the husband of the deceased woman. After a dazzling opening shot, quickly move into the formula of film B. It certainly looks good, but the finish is colorless, and the cast (including Peter Lorre and Broderick Crawford) is a bit stiff. Based on the Cornell Woolrich novel and passable for single viewing. <br /> <br /> ** from ****
