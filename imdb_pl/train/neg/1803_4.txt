Here is one of those short educational films whose aim is to meet unknown people about the facts of life. This time the target audience is a preteen girl, the fact is menstruation. This animated film, created by Walt Disney Pictures, apparently with some sponsorship from Kotex. <br /> <br /> It starts with explaining how hormones cause growth and development. Using animation and a female narrator, he shows us how the body works, especially the ovaries, uterus and vagina, and why it all leads to menstruation. It is almost amazing, becoming a comic here, how the topic of sex is avoided. Even the word is never mentioned, although "stolen" will pass once. I really do not know why I saw it, but because it is one of those rare short films that can give the impression of innocent time, it's worth trying.
