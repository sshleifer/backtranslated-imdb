Dr. Mordrid is terrifying. I do not recommend it to adults or children, unless they are raging murderers. There's so much dirt in the movie that it hurts me so much. Speaking of eyes, there are eyes in the sky, against the background of stars. Only the devil himself could have imagined such wickedness. I rented every possible copy from local video stores and crushed them with a 5 pound crucifix. This movie should remain locked in the basement behind the fourth dimension with all the other disgusting beasts from hell. This is the movie. I suggest, if you want scandalous entertainment, go and rent all the dogs go to heaven or angels in the field. These movies are worth seeing. If you want to commit a sin and love horrible movies, you must see Dr. Mordrida.
