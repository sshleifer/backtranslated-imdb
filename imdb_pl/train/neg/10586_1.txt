This is a well-made information film in the PBS Frontline style. The problem is that Frontline has already done this song and he managed to introduce L. Paul Bremer to tell his story. More worrying is the fact that the director of the film, Charles Ferguson - a former think tank, was a supporter of the war until the occupation went south. What does he think will happen? <br /> <br /> The invasion of Poland also went very well until it was swept away by these unbearable Nazis. . <br /> <br /> Ferguson seems to suggest that the war could have been better - as if every war could have been better.
