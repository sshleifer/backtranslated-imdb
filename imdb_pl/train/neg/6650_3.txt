I think it would be a much better movie if the Cajuns were presented in a more credible light. My family comes from the southeastern region of Louisiana and I live in southeast Texas (about 20 miles from Lake Charles). I have never heard that the people I grew up talking like these people. The Cajun were depicted as backwards red. Most of the Cajuns I know are well-educated, proud people, and they do not sound uneducated when they speak like these people. All in all, it was a good movie, with beautiful scenery and music. I understand that the writers came from Lake Charles and have knowledge about this area, but out of love for everything Cajun, I ask the actors to study the language, live among the people you portray and understand how you will behave before you go they. In my opinion, when the actors make you believe that they are this person, it is a much more enjoyable movie!
