Written by excellent McGovern and directed by Frears, this movie was a slight disappointment. It seemed too short. He spent too much time creating Hovis atmosphere and laughed at Catholic demands. Then very soon fascists and socialists fight for family's attention and terrible conclusions. <br /> <br /> My wife still thought that Liam is charming.
