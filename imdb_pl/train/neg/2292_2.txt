First of all, I have to admit that Batman: The animated series is by far the best Batman series. We watched him when he was on TV. I did not realize that it was the fourth season. Actually, it was not. BTAS ends with season 3 and should stop there. <br /> <br /> Why did they have to spoil a good thing. Catwoman and Poison Ivy now have terrible gray faces. The joker looks frightening, it seems that every time they change their appearance, it looks more and more scary. It seems that there are no pupils anymore, and now it does not even look like a human (though it is). <br /> <br /> Bruce Wayne is expressed by Kevin Conroy, who makes the best batman. Although now it looks like a superman. There's nothing that makes him stand out because they both look the same, Bruce Wayne's blue eyes now. <br /> <br /> Night Wing really needs a haircut, please! Alfred just has pupils out of sight, he looks more like a character from the 80s. <br /> <br /> I watched three episodes from the first part of the series and I find that this version is more brutal and graphic (there is blood in every episode). <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Batman: Animated series, there is no season 4 for Batman. They simply included this series as season 4 on the market. If they've just released it as the adventures of the New Batman, I do not think many people buy it. <br /> <br /> Save yourself disappointment and stick to the seasons 1-3.
