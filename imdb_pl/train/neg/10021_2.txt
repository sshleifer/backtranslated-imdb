The worst movie I've seen since Tera Jadoo Chal Gaya. There is no history, no humor, nothing! The action sequences seem more like a series of random Akshay Kumar Thumbs-Up ads stapled together. He strongly influenced The Matrix and Kung-Fu Hustle, but he was very poorly made. <br /> <br /> I have not met many expectations, but watching this movie is an annoying experience that makes you wonder "What did these boys think about ?? !! ". <br /> <br /> The only thing you can remember is anorexic Kareena in a bikini. <br /> <br /> The reason why I did not give" 1 "is that every time I think I saw the worst, Bollywood proved I was wrong.
