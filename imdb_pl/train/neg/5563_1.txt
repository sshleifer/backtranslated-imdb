Dolph Lundgren meditates and grimaces in this incoherent mystery / thriller, which is not as cool as you would have believed. Actually, it's pretty good here, but the story is a mess of B movies (detective, revenge, tycoon, slut, S & M) that looks like it's been made up as it happens. The movie rises slightly in the second half, but for a more decent Lundgren flick, instead, rent a RED SCORPION.
