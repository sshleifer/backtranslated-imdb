The Spoilers of this and The Matrix follow him. <br /> <br /> I really liked the original Matrix. It was not a deep movie, despite Fishfeme's attempts to philosophize, but he was quite good, funny and I have a weakness for fighting in Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> In the original, Neo was the secret life of the rather miserable worker of Anderson's ankle. During the day, a corporate drone, and a brave hacker at night. Ultimately, he is finally forced to choose between these lives thanks to his deeds - whether he becomes an outlaw against the machine, or he returns to the safe, forgotten world in which he began. Interestingly, he discovers that once he is deprived of illusions, life sucks. He has his girlfriend at his side and accompanies favors, but he eats processed foods, gets dressed in sweats and lives in really skungy machinery. Nevertheless, the truth makes him free. <br /> <br /> At least part of the fun of the first movie lay in the questions "what would happen if it was mine" raised in the mind of the viewer. What if I could be impossible? What if I was "One." It does not even matter that you are one example, with such a nice title. <br /> <br /> In addition, Agent Smith created a great evil guy because he embodied all the fear of the authority we carry with us. He was as unstoppable as a terminator and merciless. <br /> <br /> At the end of the Matrix, Neo must return to the Matrix to share his good news about freedom. <br /> <br /> This film does not fully implement the ideas of the original movie and does it with such a lack of enthusiasm, so bad script writing and such a poor editing that I can not believe that they planned these changes. When the dialog box is level five, with various long words dropped randomly, I find it hard to believe that they understand what they are saying. <br /> <br /> My short list of make-up failures: <br /> <br /> The oracle turns from a gentle, although lying to completely obstructive, for no real reason. <br /> <br /> The main "personality" matrix are entered without any need - for example, the keyboard master was a nice idea, but not such an interesting hero. <br /> <br /> Fishburne loses the role of "adviser" and does not receive anything that could replace him. <br /> <br /> The inhabitants of Zion are not particularly liked, nor would you like them to lead the world. <br /> <br /> Problems with special effects: <br /> <br /> Combat scenes are pointless and interruptible. In the Matrix, you felt that Neo could lose, and that he must become something bigger to survive. In "Matrix Reloaded" it is only a point of view of a particularly poorly drawn video game. <br /> <br /> The fight on the highway looked pretty fake, not interesting. <br /> <br /> Stimulation problems. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned, the battle scenes were endless. <br /> <br /> Rave lasted too long - everyone in my theater looked at my watch. Not because we mean good dance and good orgies, but because we did not know about the people in the picture, nor did it bother us. <br/> <br /> Regardless of what hack he wrote, the monologue from the creator should be placed on the company's blacklist. It was spinning, using words that the screenwriter apparently did not understand, and it was a waste of time and a killer. The creator's speech could have been done in a tenth time and with greater danger, because "Zion exists to give the rebels a place to go to, not to destroy the Matrix. There are currently too many people who do not believe; the mother is in danger of breaking up and killing every person associated with her. In addition, the land can not support even people in Zion, let alone these others. You can choose one person from Zion to create a new Zion while I rub the memories of people currently in the Matrix. "<br /> <br /> Instead, we got a long, drawn out package. If anyone claims to be deep, ask for a record and try to break the sentence. Each of them is too long according to several clauses and uses words with lighter, shorter synonyms. <br /> <br /> In summary, it's not worth watching. <br /> <br /> I saw the third one, and despite what some reviewers said, skip this. It does not save this turkey. <br /> <br /> The reviewers who think that the second and third film were "deep" should see really deep films. Perhaps read a book or two about rhetoric and debate, and maybe a little philosophy. This film is simply not difficult to understand, but it is hard to bear. <br /> <br /> Scott
