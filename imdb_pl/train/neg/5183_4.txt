This is the first of these "8 movies to die" collections that I have seen and certainly did not make me want to see the rest ... although I heard that at least some of them are decent. I do not know, it was not terrible, but it did not do much for me. Your basic dysfunctional family of cannibals in the suburbs, mom and dad died, the family sold the farm and moved to San Francisco (?), Wherever possible they continued to bring home stray food sources. The best part of this was the terrifying sister Goth, who of course invites a friend from school who never goes out. In any case, of course, we have a butcher shop in the basement, and so on and so forth. This family is similar to the Sawyer clan version, is nasty and does bad things, but it has no soul. I see a lot of reviews from people who liked it and I think that I do not know what I missed, but it turned out that it is very average and I would not recommend it to anyone, really. 4 out of 10.
