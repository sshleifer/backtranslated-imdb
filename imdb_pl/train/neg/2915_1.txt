It's a bad movie, it looks like there are only 5 policemen in HK, they did not use a gun there, and that makes me feel like in Jacky Khan's movie. They used weapons all the time to indicate only the suspect. When they finally use weapons, they kill themselves, what a funny movie. The movie is as if all good died for no reason. <br /> <br /> Their plot of the movie is also sucking, history jumps here and there and bores people. But if you want to see a damn movie, I think it's just a good movie, I think the zombie movie in the US is more bloody than this
