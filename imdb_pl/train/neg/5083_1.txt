I consider it rather useless to comment on this "film" for the simplest reason that it has nothing to comment on. It's similar to a rotten egg that has nothing good to show the world a piece of it being rotten like other endless numbers of eggs in front of it. But since the commentary is a must for such a great irrelevance ... <br /> <br /> Filth is definitely the right word to describe this film created in the same way as any other Romanian "film" directed by Lucian Pintilie, who insists present the so-called "Romanian reality" after the communist era (from 1990 to the present day). <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances is it recommended for people from outside Romania, as well as others (who have recently found an amateur camera, no plot), lack of quality of the director / actors, etc., noise etc. as fashionable or even similar to the art: watch and enjoy this "movie" (as I know you will), but do other IMDb members have a favor, do not write an online review, because it will mislead, irritate and finally waste your time. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this movie (among other things) has any value, educational for it gives an example for "How NOT to make a movie".
