In 1937-1939, Twentieth Century-Fox produced a lot of Mr. Moto. However, at the end of the series it was obvious that the studio "jumped a shark". This phrase indicates that the television program has passed the root and the management responsible for the decision has decided to revive the performance, changing the formula in general. For example, thanks to "The Brady Bunch" introduced an annoying "Cousin Oliver", and thanks to "Family Ties" they introduced a bizarre child who grew up six years in only one season! Thanks to Moto movies, they jumped the shark, introducing comic relief, because they thought that these intelligent films have to be reworked. In the previous movie Warren Hymer played an annoying wrestler. In this movie, the figure of Archibald Featherstone appears. Featherstone may be one of the most annoying examples of comic relief, because you hoped someone (preferably Moto) would kill him just to shut him up !! Although he is to work for the famous Scotland Yard, he shows all the intelligence and acumen of the turnip of the damaged brain. Time after time his scenes were gruff and unnecessary, and Peter Lorre just looked depressed when he stood there and looked at this "actor". It is so bad that it really destroys what could have been one of the better Moto films because of its clever conspiracy. <br /> <br /> As for the storyline, the Queen of Sheba's crown was discovered on the opening stage. Moto, now a more international policeman than the amoral character he was originally, is on hand to protect a valuable object from theft. In a huge twist several thieves try to steal the crown independently of each other. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is visible, but it is also sufficient proof that the Moto series should end here. With the upcoming World War II, movies could not survive any longer, because having a nice Japanese leading character would simply not be accepted in the United States or in allied countries.
