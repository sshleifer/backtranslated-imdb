Criminally Insane 2 is on the new DVD Black Satan's Black Wedding / Criminally Insane, and that's also a good thing, because when I saw the movie and I know there is a sequel (especially something as unclear as this), I'm always curious. I am now enjoying curiosity and will never see it again. Most of CI2 is nothing but "flashbacks" for CI and photos of Ethel sleeping, I suppose the memories are nice. Thanks to Proposition 13, she was released from Napa State (I wonder if she could see The Cramps play while she was there?) And sent to a half-way home run by a nice old lady who Ethel immediately takes to call her grandmother. Everything is filmed with a video camera, so the image and sound are rather pathetic, and even supplemented with a few "rolls". Of course Ethel does something about sending someone between her and the food, especially a guy who is a witness to one of her acts of chaos and forces her dessert. You should also consider any house for murderers who have a large drawer full of sharp knives in the kitchen and rat poison under the kitchen sink. Guess that this is all a matter of wrong "trust". If you liked or did not like crazy crime, there is no reason to watch it, except for curiosity. One wonders why the creators were teasing. 2 out of 10.
