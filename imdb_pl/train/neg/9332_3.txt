It's not really a scary movie, and Glenn and Keitel are prime actors. What's more, they do a satisfactory job with a very weak script. The landscape is lush, and the plot has several interesting twists. What's more, I understand why these actors and crew made the film, they are professionals and they get paid for it. But I wonder why studios spend time and money to make a film, and then not to release it to the theater audience? Even if the movie is a flop, it will definitely earn some money. If you're a Keitel or Glenn fan, rent a movie or catch it on TV, just like me. It is true that the film will not help to solve the problem of immigration from Mexico, but the experience is much better than 90% of the TV tariff today.
