My commentary concerns the Russian version of Space Race called Bitva za Kosmos (Battle for Space) shown in the first Russian channel on April 10-13, 2006. The bad translation may have ruined some details, but I doubt it will. The number of factual errors is such that it is impossible to mention them, especially in the first episode (developing the first missiles). Even half of the movie in the US contains many errors and omissions. The audience was not told about any V-2 / A-4 starts from the USA. Three different Jupiter C rockets are launched with the same serial number "EU" on board. Apollo 1 is to be fired on the Moon, etc. In the Russian half, each person is ridiculous. Korolev is afraid of the NKVD, Gluszko is a saboteur and traitor, Miszin is an alcoholic, etc. Men as a function; without motivation, without life. Uniforms and decorations are awful. Gagarin sings a frivolous song waiting for launch (I think it was added especially for the Russian version).
