A dedicated TLK fan, the first of which is a milestone and the second probably the best sequel to Disney, along with this movie ... Now I do not argue with animation, voice work, music, but no more than a Timon / Pumbaa screwdriver in the TLK atmosphere. Although it is not bad, nothing adds. Essentially, this movie is one big joke ... and all that saves it. Make a real TLK3, Disney! Potential exists. <br /> <br /> 4/10
