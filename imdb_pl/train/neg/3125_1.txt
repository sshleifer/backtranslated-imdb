Boris Karloff is Matthias Morteval, a dying, lonely old nut who lives in the Morhenge Mansion with several servants and tells his doctor a friend: "Do not try me doctor, doctor! I am sick healthy! "She invites her nieces and nephews to her home and warns them that they inherited a genetic disease that causes madness through" shrinking brain "(?) <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** < br /> <br /> Morteval / Karloff ends in death, and murderous "toys" (designed by his deceased brother) begin to kill relatives. A mini cannon fires real bullets into the face of a guy, a life-sized knight in an armor attacks an ax, and a dancing sheikh stabs people with a knife. One guy is strangled and makes fun faces. Finally, Julissa and her boyfriend discover that Karloff is still alive and hiding in a dungeon, where steel gates close the room. A game of repetitive organ music (a kind of rattle used for homicides), the ghost of a brother begins to say ("The whole house will come with me!"), And the mansion is burning. <br /> <br /> This senseless mess is too dark, boring, and stupid dialogue never fits my lips.
