OK, another movie bought by me and Joe Swatman. OK, this is not the worst movie I reviewed this week, but it still sucked royalty. we had a great time watching this nonsense. <br /> <br /> Monster Jigsaw is a mish-mash of all these dysfunctional ideas of students, you just know the trouble when someone equips him with a buzzsaw sawed by a rifle, the movie was not as bloody as we expected, it means death is a heart attack . Again, I think acting is sucking, the sum of the actors must be porn stars, and one gets into her undies for whatever reason. <br /> <br /> Absolutely the worst part is the ending, it leaves a bit of Jigsaw 2, but it never happened, let's face it. <br /> <br /> My ratings: <br /> <br /> funny mockup 4/100 (how much fun we had from this mock) 73/100 working 8/100 overall 12/100
