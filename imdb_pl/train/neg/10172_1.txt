When I noticed that Noah Wyle and Ricky Schroder were in the same movie, I was like, shoot! I admit that I really wanted to see the movie. And I must say that the first fifteen minutes were somewhat nostalgic. Then everything went down the hill. I did not expect that it would be a heap of politically correct civil rights. They took every possible controversial topic and threw it into one stupid story. I was terrified that Noah was involved in something like that, especially his role. No one with a fully functional brain would accept all this nonsense about the war in Vietnam. If someone really wants to know how communism was, sit down and read a book about him. And not the one who praises or opposes it, only cold hard facts. <br /> <br /> I only watched a few scenes here and there just because I wanted to see Ricky's body, but it interested me. Everything else in this movie irritated me.
