This film is about a group of extraterrestrial homosexual black men exterminating women on Earth in order to create a gay Universe. <br /> <br /> I watched it with the intention of seeing how bad it is. Still, I was shocked at how bad it was. It looked more like a movie made 50 years ago. Action, if at all, is very bad. Sets and props are so absurdly false that every student movie looks mega budget. Special effects are ridiculously simple, and even jaws fall, as others say, but your jaw crushes. If I were from Denmark, I would be very ashamed and humiliated that my countrymen produced such a frighteningly bad film.
