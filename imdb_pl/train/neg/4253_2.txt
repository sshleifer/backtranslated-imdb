It must be one of the worst vampires men ever conceived. How can you turn such a mesmerizing topic into a completely uninspiring story? It is not often a difficult task ... First of all, the conditio sine qua non of any vampire is a dark and dark atmosphere with a nice, sexy accent, all these things are missing ... Too much light - stains! oh my God, why was it like that in the name of Christ / Judas? <br /> <br /> Each time Dracula appeared, he was absorbed by the light (in the scenario to weaken him, for the order: simply weak) There was only one scene that made her worth it watch, close to the end of the movie (beautiful dancingscene with Dracula and his new conquest). I really enjoyed the first one, Judah's turn was definitely original, but this one is not just good, in any way. Let's hope that the third of them will deal with vampire signatures that I like so much in other classics like Nosferatu Herzog, Dracula Coppola and even Interview with a vampire.
