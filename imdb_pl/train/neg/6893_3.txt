I had high hopes related to this film. The theater monologue is great and Nic Balthazar is a very interesting man with extensive experience and knowledge in the field of movies. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of many Belgian films, but this movie is bad. It's totally unbelievable that actors who are 34 years old suddenly play the role of teenagers. "Language games" were hideous and exaggerated. Nothing about the movie seemed real to me. The ending was too deus ex machina for me. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed and I think I've wasted an hour and a half of my life.
