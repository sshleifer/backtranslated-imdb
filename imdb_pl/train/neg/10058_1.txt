I was fascinated by how bad the movie really was. Was the viewer supposed to learn something or think about something here? What was with the pumpkins? Was I to be impressed by the photos from the motel? Is it important that there are garbage bags on the roof on the other side of the hotel? Why is the narrator unsuccessfully mocking the people he interviews with (it's so obvious that he edited really instructive parts of his interviews to make ridicule). The best part of the movie was an interview with a film professor who tells us how bad the film will be before it's finished. <br /> <br /> I am really amazed. I believe that the creator tries to become an intellectual or tries to impress the intellectual community.
