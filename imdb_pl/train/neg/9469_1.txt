Audrey, I know you really value the memory of your husband Ted, but PLEASE do his legacy of justice and listen to his wishes. Dr. Seuss refused to license his characters throughout his life for a very good reason. We ask you to stop earning money on your stories, images, fantasies and characters. They are gutted by the powers of Hollywood and Broadway. The children of tomorrow will be stuck in these histrionic and grotesque interpretations that will forever damage the warmth and innocence of his books. <br /> <br /> It is indeed your property if you want. I just want you to listen to the advice of others for a moment. Keep what's left of Dr. Seuss. Thank you.
