Hey, look, I can handle it, there are much better portraits of Black America's hardships than this. Although I think that this story is weak, my criticism focuses on the bad implementation of the story I mentioned, blows. <br /> <br /> It was made in the mid-1980s and is horrible in the music / scoring department. It is funny to see Oprah as a type of crack in recent days. <br /> <br /> A scene in which the Bigger pushes Elizabeth McGovern into the oven. Clean classic cinema. First of all, I do not care how drunk you are, you will react to the flame of 1200F (no matter how bad you are). But they really did this scene ... it was comical. I will tell you what, however, I was very pleased to see Elizabeth McGovern burn in artificial death; She annoys me.
