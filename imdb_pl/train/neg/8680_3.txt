I just finished watching this movie, and WOW was so bad. Actually, the only thing that watched me was that it was so MONUMENTALLY wrong that it was a bit funny. The action of the heroes is hilarious, from the hyper-dramatic way they fall into shooting, to their incredibly bad acting (were the bad guys pushed off the street or were they actors?), The incredibly bad delivery of the line, their inexplicable actions (if you're going to shoot someone through the door when they come in, it's obviously to shoot directly at the door handle !!). This movie has to break the record for the worst written and delivered lines. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera was also very bad - you can not see what is happening in the fight scenes because of camera angles and shaking. <Br> I would vote for "1", except that I like Chiba and helper Sue Shihomi, and I was entertained by several scenes: 1) breaking the arm of the villain, so that the bone jumps out of the skin (it must hurt) 2) drug stick eating an animal with brown fur (monkey ??), chopping the carcass with a meat cleaver 3) Sonny Chiba performs an improvised eye surgery on the guy with his fingers. <br /> <br /> Actually, I'm a big fan of Sonny Chiba, but he's really not worth anyone. I saw about 7 or 8 of his films and came to the conclusion that the only ones that are worth watching (and they are great!) Are the series Street Fighter and The Killing Machine. I also heard that Kat and Golgo 13 are good. I recommend you stick with these.
