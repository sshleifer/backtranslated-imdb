The role of Buck as The Kahn is reminiscent of Bob Barker (from The Price is right) leading the country in the same way that he runs his show. But there's a lot more chuckles and snorting in this turkey. Kurt Thomas as a "hero" with a child's face has some significant acrobatic skills, but not a little talent for acting. There are some terrible moments (mainly in the Village of Crazies) and some impressive martial arts sequences. But every movie "Ninja" will give you much more entertainment and you will not feel guilty with laughter.
