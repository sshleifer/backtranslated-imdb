I watched this movie only because I was impressed by Oliver Martinez in SWAT. But this is not SWAT. SWAT had a story and some nice characters and made sense. The bullfighter did not have any of them. <br> inconsistent. Another called it the worst film in history. Both gave the film too many points. I'm glad I got it from the library for free, but I still feel cheated. <br /> <br /> IMDb must include "0" in the "rate this movie" vote, only one for such films.
