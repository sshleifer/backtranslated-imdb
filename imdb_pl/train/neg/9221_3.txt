Everything you need to know about this movie happens in the first five minutes: it looks cool, it has a solid original soundtrack that reflects the late 1960s and all but a few characters are dissimilar. After receiving this message, you can also go to another video. <br /> <br /> The hero of Davies ignores his beautiful girlfriend, one of the few people in his life who cares about him. Then, before he gets her advice to join her in the real world - instead of living in a fantasy movie, which he is an imaginary director - he does it, pushing it aside and combining with the actress whom he idealises beyond reason. The couple is laughing, and some thought-out artistic directions are the only things worth seeing here. <br /> <br /> The film is also interesting as a record of the fall of Jason Schwartzman from Mount Rushmore. In Rushmore, Schwartzman's annoying indifference was something to overcome, but here is the only feature of his character. Schwartzman's family relationship clearly landed in this role; I hope his choices will improve.
