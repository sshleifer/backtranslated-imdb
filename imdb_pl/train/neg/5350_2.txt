Yes, talk about bad sequels. Rick Moranis performs in this terrible third part of the sequel of the once fun and funny "Honey I Shrunk the Kids". The concept basically plays in the same way as the first movie, but with adults instead of twisted children and the inner home instead of the garden as a universe for exploration. If you think it sounds interesting, think again. The film is boring at best, in the worst case, embarrassed. <br /> <br /> First of all, the continuity of the series has been completely drained in the toilet. The only other actor in the first movie is apparently Rick Moranis. The actress playing his wife changed, the actors playing the children changed, those who played at the neighbors changed ... you name it. They try to make us believe that it's the same family, but the results are puzzling, to say the least. <br /> <br /> Second, history is the revival of the first, without a little originality. All these jokes (and almost none) and dangerous situations presented in the movie are simply copied straight from "Honey and Shrunk the Kids". <br /> <br /> The third problem, special effects. I am sure that this has been done with a smaller budget, but it is pathetic, much worse than the ones that appear in the rest of the series. You should admire those tiny characters that are exploring a huge home area, but you'll probably be cowering most of the time. <br /> <br /> The fourth problem to locate the action at home is simply boring. There are only a few things going on, and when they happen, they're not exciting at all. The first movie was fun because the children were dealing with nature, grass and the worms living in it. In this case adults (who are more boring than children) are dealing with dust, cockroach and a cockroach trap. Disgusting. <br /> <br /> I do not know why the idea of ​​releasing such a banal continuation of the already weird series appealed to the Disney directors, except perhaps because they had to make money without spending five minutes thinking about something new. I warn you: leave the tasteless garbage in the place where it should stop: dust on the shelves in the store.
