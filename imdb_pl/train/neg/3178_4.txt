In movies like this you know you'll get ordinary jokes about ghosts. Eva as a ghost is quite funny. And other actors do a good job. There is a lack of direction and history. It could have been overlooked if the jokes worked better. The problem is that there are not many jokes. Of course, I laughed a few times. In addition to the talking parrot in the film, there was not a bit of creativity. I blame the director not to use his full potential. Eva certainly has comedy skills to show more, but she did not have the opportunity. In general, the movie is perfect for a Sunday afternoon. In addition, you can completely skip it.
