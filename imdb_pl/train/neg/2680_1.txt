Brokedown Palace is not a kind of movie that I would like to see. I also did not like the movie when an Australian smuggled drugs in Thailand and accused Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale of drug smuggling. I would not go to this country no matter what I saw after this film. In fact, this movie stinks. I prefer to visit Germany to meet beautiful lonely women. Germany is a country that I tolerate. I would also prefer to stick to the United States. After watching the movie in the theater, including a false accusation of drug smuggling, I left the theater and returned the money because I can not stand the movie. If you are going to Thailand to meet someone who may be a drug smuggler, forget about it!
