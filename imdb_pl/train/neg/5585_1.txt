The problem is the role of the characters in the film. Man to Man shows a British anthropologist who kidnaps two pygmies and takes them to Scotland, and then realizes that they are not animals or subhumans, but in fact they are equal. The problem is the role of pygmies in the film - two people who have been kidnapped, treated like animals, and yet have such a shallow, stereotypical role in the film ... Porywacz (British anthropologist) becomes a film hero because he "manages to" refer to pygmies ... He has no idea how these two hostages feel, from their point of view, their torment ... I think that this is a shallow movie, with one, essentially racist view ... he will never be able to leave the view of "white mans" "
