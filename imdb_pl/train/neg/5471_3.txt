The typical Troma-trash, this sad movie from the 80's is considered one of the hits of the famous studio of Lloyd Kaufman, next to The Toxic Avenger released a year earlier. The "Toxic Avenger" is much better if you ask me about it, but this mad flutter is unbearable; just make sure you have full brain capacity in the door. The events take place in Tromaville, a small town that proudly claims to be the toxic chemical capital of the world and certainly not lying. Security measures at a local nuclear plant are, at least, below the standard (even Homer Simpson has never been so nonchalant), and toxic waste penetrates into a nearby secondary school. The first stupid victim is a stereotypical gull who starts to squirt green things out of all the body cavities, but his death is considered an accident because he had no less than two microwave ovens in his home! Oh, humanity! Soon, however, nuclear spills also affect the school plantation of weeds and really begin to make a mess. After smoking at the party, the sweetest couple in the school produces a gigantic worm monster that settles in the basement and feeds on teen scum. "Class Nuke 'High" is the creation of horror films downstairs, with dialogs so stupid that your ears and makeup effects hurt, which give this word a completely new meaningless taste. If you like to watch disappearing faces, rolled or split in half, this is definitely obligatory! Unlike the previously mentioned "The Toxic Avenger", this movie suffers from a few really boring and long moments in which nothing really matters, for example when Chrissy and Warren try to understand what's wrong with their hormones. Raw humor is not as effective as in "Toxic Avenger", and acting performances are unforgivably amateurish. Continue only if you are an avid fanatic of Troma.
