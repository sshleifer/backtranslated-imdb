I never watched the movie on-line, but after seeing it, I felt moved. One does not appear at someone's funeral and does not say orphaned: "My relatives died, so why should I care about yours?" <br /> <br /> Minor propaganda, little, if any, could be called "art". As a daughter of deaf parents, I was particularly irritated by the use of deafness as a trick. Every deaf person who feels the vibration of this magnitude, probably would investigate it and not ignore it. <br /> <br /> The word "chutzpah" comes to mind. As a writer, I have few topics that I would like to stick to: the Holocaust is one; it is different. It is a pity that these filmmakers were not so arrogant (and inept).
