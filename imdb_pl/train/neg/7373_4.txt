I do not know what the rest of you watch Steven Seagal movies, but I watch them because they are stupid, although they are always good for laughter. Why do you rate this movie 1 in 10 based on dubbing, when does it make such a movie become a favorite favorite that you can laugh at with stupidity? <br /> <br /> Attack Force is by no means a great movie, but I felt it was just as valuable a Steven Seagal vehicle as many of his other films; in fact, I did not think it was one of his worst after long throws. In most cases it was a coherent plot, in most cases exciting. The ending was really sucked, but even it had some nice kitschy elements. In the end, the story itself did not provide what it promised, but I actually thought that acting, characterization (if I could use such a big word) and the rest of the production value provided exactly what a real Steven Seagal fan would expect. Seagal himself was, in particular, a man with a stony face, a senseless man whom we expect, and the rest of the cast supported him quite well without ever exhibiting him. This is what Steven Seagal's film does. Deal with it. Or better yet: laugh at it. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
