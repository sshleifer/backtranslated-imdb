There are several previous comments that discuss the abundance of films in this filming - and I agree completely, both in relation to the character and dialogue. <br /> <br /> I've read about the terrible Elizabeth Berkly performance in equally horrible "Showgirls" that I've never seen - and her performance here, though not terrible, barely corresponds to the standards of the worst Lifetime tariffs. Her character had no trace of depth, but it probably should not be. If so, it would cause a total imbalance in the film, because there was not a bit of depth or charisma - no trace - in any form, performer or show. <br /> <br /> The way the director handled Liz's initial complaint after kissed her in the room was ridiculous. Her husband's initial reaction and advice were also similar (Forrest Gump, attacking Jenny's boyfriend in his car, assured more realistic, intelligent action, and, hell, he was a mental challenge). (sorry for superfluity) the father of the lying student did something that deserved praise in his performance: he was both amusing and irritating, no mean feat. Her attorney was a more insensitive nerd, also not known in the profession. <br /> <br /> Finally (and honestly, I liked this part), the police were such a collection of insensitive fools that they would rather rely on Barney Fife, without Andy, to serve all law enforcement and investigation in your community. I know that most real cops have little focus, intelligence and level empathy displayed by most of the heroes of the Law and Order series and the like - but the dolby of this level seems to be an episode in "Lifetime." <br /> <br / > Finally, I found a kind of "history in history" fascinated by Josh's mixture that he is the "victim" of his teacher. This scenario performance in history was even worse than its overall performance in the main story. It was something of an achievement, like the transition from "F" to "F-minus". <br /> <br /> The whole lame situation should be resolved - in real life - in about 15 minutes, after a realistic meeting between the teacher and the school authorities, with a committed husband. But that would prevent the imaginary drama from being realized and leave an hour of empty film in the camera. <br /> <br /> But the writer (s) here proved that their ending, they can do even worse. When the situation was finally "resolved" and "repaired", it was done within about 45 seconds, without indicating what measures could be taken in any context of the "real world" by the perpetrator and his parents, or whether he could find a path to redemption. <br /> <br /> This is a 2 * presentation; the second "*" because it has a mild "fascination".
