I was lucky to meet George Pal (and still have an autograph of DS: TMOB) at the convention right after the premiere and I asked him why he decided to make the film "camp". Before he could answer, two studio sets intercepted and taught me how the studio "knows best" and how "no one will take such a movie seriously". For several years I have read Bantam's reprints thanks to a friend (ComiCon participants from the 70s will remember Blackhawk and his team, I was with him for several years) and I had higher hopes than what we got. <br /> <br /> Flacks insisted that no high adventure will ever be taken seriously, so "camp" was the only way. A few other fans jumped on my side, and Pal listened as best he could. At the end of this small event, Pal approached us and apologized, wishing he could do more and better. <br /> <br /> ST WARS lie to liars, and a year after Kal's death, Spielberg and Lucas proved that Doc Savage could easily be the next film series ... if not flacks. <br /> <br /> Take out the memory or Doc's story, and the movie would be worth a 6/10 rating as nothing more than a mindless popcorn seller. <br /> <br /> But destroying such a heritage was no less an abomination than killing a child in a crib. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage can still come to the screen and survive inevitable comparisons by misinformed Indiana Jones, but it would have to be done with all seriousness and honestly regain the glory we should expect from the First American Superhero. <br /> <br /> SIDENOTES: Yes, there was the second script for ARCHENEMY OF EVIL and it is much more serious. Yes, there was simultaneous recording of the material, but mainly the creation of shots and very few of the actors. And yes, there is one sheet of Ron Ely leaping through the brick wall and firing something over his shoulder using a specially constructed bronze pistol. Ely wears a duster on a white shirt with buttons with a brown tie and the words "DOC SAVAGE: ARCHENEMES OF EVIL ... Summer is coming!" POSTSCRIPT: If anyone knows who these studies were, which accompanied George Pal in 1975 in San Diego at the congress, hit the idiots upstairs and call them the idiots they are. During this time, they did dorkknobs and Fu Manchu in straps and loose canvas pants and wore Paramount wallets.
