It was quite a scary movie; I think that music is effective for this. The photographs taken by Mario from the village were also astonishing. However, I had three problems with this movie. One of them is that the lighting was very dark, so sometimes it was difficult to say what was happening, but it could only be my work. Secondly, the very beginning is not well explained and I'm still not sure what was happening there. The third problem is that I did not understand the ending, but apparently some people do. Of course there are also ordinary problems of people who do stupid things, and the man himself is 70 years old. Generally, it's awesome but not even close to being a favorite.
