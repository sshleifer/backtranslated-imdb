I am a huge fan of a real crime genre, but I could not sit through this rotten piece. It was almost as if Dahmer was supposed to be erotic, to a pornographic soundtrack. There was no look at what made Dahmer stand out, it was not examined who his victims were. Nothing but "Look how scary this guy is." And I have to give the filmmakers so much - their Dahmer is the strangest thing that ever shook the screen.
