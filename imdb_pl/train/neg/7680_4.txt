Śnieżka is, in my opinion, a bad film from an artistic point of view. The plot is quite predictable, the characters are stereotypes, the assembly is too exaggerated. Besides, the film does not seem to have many artistic ambitions. <br /> <br /> Instead, I think it's a simple commercial matter. Including the character from the French part of Switzerland (the actor is the leader of the band with whom he performs in the film - the band is called SENS UNIK) seems to be directed to a larger audience. A simple German-Swiss film would not be sold in the French part - and vice versa. What really worked on my nerves is the distribution of products throughout the movie. Something in the scenes remembered from the advertising clips! <br /> <br /> I also think that the topic of "young people taking drugs without any other purpose in their lives" is a widespread reality in Zurich. Therefore, it should be developed with more caution. I hope Samir will get enough money from Śnieżka to let his next film show his true artistic skills.
