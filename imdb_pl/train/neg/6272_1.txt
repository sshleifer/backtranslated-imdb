This is a piece of the selection that led the evil, fulminant assistant of the famous scientist on his first maid just before he lured three incredibly stupid girls into the residence for modification experiments. Meanwhile, in the local bar, people drink and dance to the rock songs of the 80s. Punk motorcyclist is having sex with a whore on a pinball table in front of a crowd of people and then trying to rape the virgin daughter of a scientist, Jessica (Debra Hunter), who is in love with another motorcycle (Dale Midkiff, with PET SEMATARY) who in turn is in cohorts with an assistant ! After returning home, bobbins from the brotherhood swim, shower, change clothes and have sex with men from the bar. A small silver ball (part of the experiment) flies into the mouths of the victims and turns them into a salivating, deadly zombie! <br /> <br /> If it's not enough to entertain you, there's a funny themed song (Nightmare Fantasy), roller skating, some serious daisy dukes and a mental handler (!?) that warns "DANGER! DANGER! "Just like the robot LOST IN SPACE and recommends hitchhiking as one of the best ways to get rid of people! <br /> <br /> This Florida-filmed mess is so horribly unpleasant that it's recommended to watch it a lot, and do not the detective NYPD Blue Jill Kirkendall change the CNN presenter Andrei Thompson into one of the often naked bimbos? Yes, of course! Apparently it was started in 1982, and a new material was added later for the video release in 1985. <br /> <br /> Score: 1 in 10 (and I mean it in a good way!)
