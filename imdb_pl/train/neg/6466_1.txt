Marlon Brando has long lost interest in acting when he made the film. His performance as "Swede" is the worst of his career and he wanted to do exactly that. He is not abusing. Instead, he simply behaves in a bizarre manner and ridicules his embarrassingly huge circuit. The scene where Brando climbs to the toilet is probably the worst and the funniest moment in cinema history. Because we are witnessing how he falls into the toilet, it's hard to believe that we are watching the same actor who played in A Streetcar Named Desire, On the Waterfront and The Godfather. <br /> <br /> I think the real question is why Marlon behaved in this way in later years. Did he have enough of the film industry? Did he just want to make a complete and complete fool of himself? I do not think we'll ever know. But this movie is a fascinating study of what is wrong acting. <br /> <br /> On this note, watch fellow actor Donald Sutherland, who fights to present his views, ashamed of himself for agreement in this parody.
