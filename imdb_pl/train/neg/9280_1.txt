Honestly, I do not know what's more fun, this terrifying remake or comments on this board. The Masterpiece review had me in tears, it was so funny. In any case, this movie is one of the worst films in history, and certainly the bottom of the barrels for sequels. The name "Omen" on the title forced me to stop and see this morning on HBO, but it's a slap for the other three, especially the original. There are so many classic bad moments, but my favorite guy is a guy catching fire from a juggler at a psychic market !! good times ! This movie is for the Omen series what "The Scary Movie" is for the whole genre. Avoid unless you are looking for a good laugh.
