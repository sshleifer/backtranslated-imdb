The plot of No One Sleeps is not a bad idea, and the subject is quite interesting. But while watching this movie, we were saying aloud: "These filmmakers try to find a good location, lighting is good, makeup and hair are good ... why is the sound so bad?" Throughout the movie the sound was echoed, distorted and most of the dialogues were unintelligible. <br /> <br /> In this movie, there's some good game and I think Jim Thalman is a really good actor. This story, with some of the same actors, would be worth doing as a high-budget movie. <br /> <br /> I just can not repeat enough - if you have a limited budget, sacrifice more for good. The sound is as much a part of the movie as the picture and it is worth doing well. I could earn 6.
