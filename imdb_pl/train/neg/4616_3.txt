This movie has not aged well. Maybe it's just the influence and ingenious characteristics, acting and direction that we saw from The Sopranos, but it was the first time I saw Honor Prizzi on DVD, alone. <br /> <br /> The experience of watching the audience 24 years ago had to be quite different, but I must say that I was terrified at the end. Not only violence, but also the very thought that it would be a satisfying ending in some way. <br /> <br /> I'm enjoying a good shock, but it seemed so weird ... Besides, when was this move supposed to be set? All cars looked as if they came from the sixties, and yet the World Trade Center towers (completed in 1973) were clearly visible in many urban scenes. <br /> <br /> Another way in which the film has aged poorly is the very idea that the passenger can travel the coast with a knife on his person. <br /> <br /> Somehow, the audience from the mid-1980s found the film charming and entertaining. In the mid-eighties, meet with late worries: only you can live.
