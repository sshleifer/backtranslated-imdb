I was subjected to this film for the trade union class at my school. As I expected, it was nothing charming and nothing new. Although he tries to be original, he focuses on the teenage father, not on his mother, showing the problems his father is going through. It had an interesting side, but it just does not meet its originality, because nothing else in this movie was original. We have a main character who has an older sister who, like every other movie, has something against him, we have a mother who expects too much, and when she gives more, she feels offended and leaves him in dust, then we have a father who always he left. Then, on the girls side, we have parents who want everything and expect perfection from it. In this story, as I said, it was interesting, but lack of good acting from the entire cast and lack of good writing or storytelling. Everything that happened in that happened in a clich√© that a small school gull begins to learn with a girl, meet, have sex, and then boom, we have a small child. Perhaps it would be better if writing was better and acting was improved. I have seriously gained more excitement thanks to Leatherface and his football chain than any other actor in this movie, and it is quite bad to see Leatherface films are crappy and frightening. So far, the only interesting movie about the pregnancy of teenagers that I saw was Juno. So far the comic side of this serious situation has proved to be more fun and at the same time it shares the same message. As I said, the idea was original, most of these films focus on the teenage mother, but she did not decide, but focuses on her father's drama, but again the originality does not save this film from mediocrity. I really hope someone will decide to either make this movie with a better cast and a better writer, or just make another similar movie because it was a wasted potential.
