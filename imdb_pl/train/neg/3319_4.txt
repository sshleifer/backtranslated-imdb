I was surprised when I saw this movie. I heard that it was the best ever-made novel. How disappointed I was. <br /> <br /> What a real Jane Austen fan can judge this adaptation is a mystery to me. Screenwriters decided to stick to pieces of funny humor, which are at best embarrassing, but also destroy the atmosphere of this period. As for the cast: Gwyneth Paltrow is doing a shallow heroine (but then any "hot" American star would be dubious in that role), Toni Collette is a loser, and poor Ewan McGregor is supposed to look funny! <br /> <br /> I really could not say anything good about this movie. I think I'm one of the few people who do not judge it, but if you want my advice, see instead a TV production with Kate Beckinsale - believe me, it's definitely better than this superficial garbage.
