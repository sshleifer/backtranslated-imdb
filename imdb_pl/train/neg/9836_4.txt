John Scott (John Wayne) and partner of Kansas Charlie (Eddy Chandler) are buddies who go to the Rattlesnake Gulch rodeo. Scott is quite an honest fighter, but he thinks that if he does not want to take twenty-five cents a dollar in cash prizes from an injured promoter, he will have to collect his winnings at the bow tie. Quite by chance bandits Pete (Al Ferguson) and Jim (Paul Fix) decide that they will like the rest of the rodeo; they shoot Farnsworth's promoter (Henry Hall) and make Scott and Kansas Charlie killers. <br /> <br /> Wayne and Chandler use a running gag in the movie, where they're going to go fists with him on different trivialities. Every time Chandler makes a wild swing, Wayne's foot stamps him and knocks him stupidly. <br /> <br /> If you are very attentive, in one of the scenes in which the love interest of Scott Anna (see Mary Kornman) appears. <br /> <br /> Later in the movie the pals are again framed for stage thefts. By changing his heart and seeing the mistake of his ways, the evil guy Jim wants to clean himself and confess to the sheriff, but Pete shoots him. During patching, Jim tells his story to the doctor and his sister, Annie. In the unbelievable scene, Anne marches into the middle of a shootout between good guys and villains to face the sheriff. <br /> <br /> "Desert Trail" is one of the wisest westerns of John Wayne of Lone Star Productions in this era. Noticeably, George "Gabby" Hayes and Yakima Canutt are absent, one or both of them usually visible in these waters. However, if you're a fan of John Wayne, you have to see him once, but that's probably enough.
