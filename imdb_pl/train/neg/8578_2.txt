One of the stupidest films of the 1940s, an unbearable comedy with a haunted house with music starring Kay Kyser. Kyer, the leader of the orchestra and radio star (and the eternal brotherhood of the college goof-off), was a kind of precursor to Spike Jones, who prepared him for his guests and gladly supported his cheerful band of musicians. He hired to play a birthday party in a dark mansion in which poisonous arrows imported from Africa are framed and hung on the wall. Shindig is harassed by a terrifying judge, terrifying professor, ominous swami, lots of giggling females, and pretty bad jokes to fill three photos of Bob Hope. The songs (by Jimmy McHugh and Johnny Mercer) have nothing to brag about, nor are they too self-confident Kyser, who invented this with a ribbed-ribbed material that comes back to 1940 ten years ago. * with ****
