RUN ... do not go away from this movie !!!!! The movie aimed at very young children bores you to tears. If Gamer's trilogy from the 90s raised the bar, this movie simply lowered it. It's a slow pace and fighting monsters is good but rarely seen. This movie told me to dry in a cat box. Just a very poor offer after the phenomenal series from the 90s. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT !!!!!!!!!!! Here are the 10 most important reasons why Gamer's fans from the 90s HATE this movie. <br /> <br /> 10. This movie is a drama that follows a child who is trying to cope with the death of his mother and is worried about losing Gamer's child to fight after his father saw adult Gamera die. <br /> <br /> 9. You see an adult Gamer for a moment at the beginning of the movie. Gets your ass kicked by several Gyaos and self-destruction? He looks old and lethargic. Plus it does not look like any gamer you've ever seen. His suit looked cheap and fast. <br /> <br /> 8. The young Gamer you see for the rest of the movie looks like Pokemon. Big eyes and sweet ... will remind you about Godzilla's baby from Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla 2. Gamer is too sweet now. <br /> <br /> 7. This movie has the pace of watching the NASCAR race during a 3-hour rain delay. I watched this movie with two other Gamers, and no one was happy with how slowly this movie was moving. I saw an SUV full of fat people going down a mountain road faster. <br /> <br /> 6. Like Godzilla: Final Wars, this movie had very little kaiju time on the screen. Final Wars had much more, and actually better fights, though short. <br /> <br /> 5. Children play the title role. The theme of a friend of all children and poor writing killed the original Gamer series in the 1970s, and history repeats itself in the 2000s. Gamer's most successful films abandoned the atmosphere of Sesame Street and went to a darker place. Why return to the unsuccessful formula? It was supposed to be a new trilogy, and poor ticket sales had killed all hope of continuing this story (thank God). <br /> <br /> 4. Gamera lost his iconic roar. Now it sounds like an elephant with a strep throat. <br /> <br /> 3. This movie can trigger a new Olympic event .... Imagine a relay race that involves sending very small children in danger. You must see the end to understand this point. Where were the parents? Oh, yeah ... all right, sending their children to the Kaiju battle zone. <br /> <br /> 2. Special effects were good, but sub-par for Gamer's movie. Legion and Iris had better results. The best effect was to show the gamer's baby flies about the size of the apple. Not very impressive. <br /> <br /> 1. This movie is not what fans of adult kaiju expect. The director was involved in Power Rangers and it shows. It comes as a cross between ET, Always: Sunset on Third Street and TMNT. Kudos, if you know all three references. <br /> <br /> It's best to rent or watch once if you buy it to complete the DVD series.
