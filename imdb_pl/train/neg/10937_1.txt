Every now and then a movie appears that will be so horrible that I feel compelled to warn people. If I work all days and I can save only one soul before watching this movie, how great will be my joy. <br /> <br /> Where to start my discussion about pain. At the beginning there was music editing every five minutes. There was no character development. Each character was a stereotype. We had a cursing guy, a fat guy who eats donuts, stupid strangers, etc. The script seemed to be written during the filming. The value of the production was so unbelievably low that it seemed to me that I was watching a video presentation of high quality. Are directors, producers, etc. Have you ever seen a movie? Halestorm gets worse with every new entrance. The concept of this movie sounded so funny. How could you go wrong with Gary Coleman and a handful of legitimate actors. But trust me when I say it, everything went wrong, VERY bad.
