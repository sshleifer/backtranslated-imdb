Absolutely funny movie. I live in London, and the plot is so badly researched that it's funny. No one could be terrorized on the London subway. In a short time is not in use every evening there are teams of conservation workers who check the tracks and carry out repairs, etc. Where the homeless are living, equally unlikely. Or that nowadays it is even possible to block out and not have access to a mobile phone ... <br /> <br /> The worst thing that can happen is if someone gets there after the last train that they can spray graffiti. Although it is under control due to the huge number of security cameras in the network, another thorn in the side of history. (Remember that in London as a whole we have more security cameras than in any other city in the world.) <br /> <br /> If it was set up in a city with which I'm not familiar, maybe I would be pleased with the ignorance, but not it's a high quality movie, so I could not bring myself to suspend my disbelief and try to enjoy it from the banal fairy tale it is. <br /> <br /> I would give him 0/10 if that rating existed! Probably the most disappointing movie I've ever wanted.
