From the actor's, director's, scriptual and artistic side, this film is just totally wrong, and the money would be better spent on shoes for anti-personnel landmines. When we were so sad that they had to fill the movie for children with sexual innuendos to keep their parents' attention. <br /> <br /> Dr. Suess is now in the grave, what about "dirty" SHIT "and false assembly scenes, etc., etc. It is shameful, as they trade in the name of Suess, that parents bring the children, throw curses to try for teenagers and some sad parents who will not watch their child's movie if there is no T & A. Greed greed and more greed. <br /> <br /> Compare this with classic movies for children and we can get a disturbing view of the world. These guys should stick to MTV movies. Like, hell, this movie received> 400 votes, and the perfect 10 is beyond me. (unless his family of directors)
