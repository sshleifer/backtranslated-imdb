What a trash ... I can not even describe how awful this movie was. The rating she has here is really hard to believe. <br /> <br /> Avoid ... Especially if you liked the first starters with ginger. The first one was well-written, well-directed, well made .. a brilliant movie with fantastic aesthetics and atmosphere. The second was "alrite" - decent as a standalone film, but apparently not up to level one ... The third one is the insult of the series, the period. I rate movies: 10, 6, 1. It's so bad. <br /> <br /> Oh, and yes, it really is in the past, the sisters are still called Ginger and B Fitzgerald ... all entangled with a somewhat semi-native American mythology. The sisters have no real history or progress or even a clear relationship ... They just try to survive and be "forever". It is as deep as possible. <br /> <br /> He staggered that the girls agreed to be in this shit pile, after reading the script. <br /> <br /> Oh and one more thing, the staging of the action was terrible - people appeared out of nowhere regularly, as the girls turn away and there is a complicated candlestick with a mysterious native American who is sitting there to start speaking. The sets were awful, it could not escape the fact that everything was obviously based on a set, which really did not help. Apart from that, the snow kept unchanged, but there was no trace in the middle (.. on the set). <br /> <br /> Arrghh ,,, so bad! I really hoped it would be at least as good as the other one.
