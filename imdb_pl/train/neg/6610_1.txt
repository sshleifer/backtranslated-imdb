This movie should not be watched because it was supposed to be a flap. Ram Gopal Verma wanted to do a remake of the classic bollywood "Sholay" for the first time, but after the problems with the original creators decided to continue the project and ... I think I leave all the good parts of the movie (acting script, songs, music, comedy, action, etc.) and make a movie just because you've already hired a crew. Losing money, a waste of time. After shooting movies like Rangeel, Satya and the Company, he pulled Coppola (Godfather) on us; What did you think about RGV? In any case, history is, although it is difficult to follow, it is almost like the old Sholay. Ajay Devgan plays Heero (Beeru, Sholay) and Ajay, a new kid in the block playing Ajay (Jay, Sholay). Both "bad, but funny" friends help the policeman first catch the evil guy. Later in the film, now the Retired Cop employs them as personal security and protects against the hands of the most sought after Bubban played by Amitabha Bachan. In case you do not watch Bollywood movies, good guys win in the end. I just saved you 3 precious hours of your life!
