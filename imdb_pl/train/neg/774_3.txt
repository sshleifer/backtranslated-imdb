This movie seems to be made by someone with good ideas, but who never made a movie before, nor thought that the script should be edited or even fun. When I saw this movie, I saw it for John Candy and incorrectly assumed it would be fun. Instead, he was a stupid conspiracy about mind control and so many flat, unhappy moments. And in addition, Candy provided some of the most primitive lines I've ever heard. So, despite the potentially fun idea of ​​cast and story, we still have an amateur and primitive movie that will probably be too stupid for the average adult, although teenagers will probably find some laughter. It is a pity that it could have been much better. I mean, Eugene Levy, Joe Flaherty and John Candy SHOULD be wonderful.
