Raising Victor Vargas terribly disappoints in what he's trying most: to be real. Unfortunately, there is no reality in this movie. Characters and situations are completely artificial and false. <br /> <br /> Reason? Bad direction. Peter Sollett uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal. It seems that Mr. Sollett has read somewhere that not igniting his film will give him an authentic impression. Wrong! It just makes you feel bad. Similarly, shaking the camera does not give the film a documentary style, it simply gives the viewer a headache and limits what is on the screen instead of improving it. <br /> <br /> Of course, what's on the screen is so painfully Fake, as if Sollett wrote a script with the only purpose to try to look "fashionable" on his Sundance buddies and show how "strange" he is . this movie leaves you with what a bad director is, Mr. Sollett. Next time, what about a few writing and directing lessons?
