Prohibited as "Video Nasty" in the United Kingdom, Unhinged naturally gained a lot of publicity. However, the most shocking thing I discovered in the film was amateurishness in all departments. Bleeding I could manage: terrifying acting, tacky editing, horrible direction, bad script and bad soundtrack were much harder to do. <br /> <br /> Three girls on the way to a music festival crash in a ravine during a storm. They are rescued by a friendly stranger who takes them to a nearby home. The owner of the house, an old woman and her daughter-maid, greet the girls, letting them stay for a few days to regain their strength. However, someone does not want girls to leave? One by one they fall victim to an invisible assailant. <br /> <br /> Devoting a lot of time to starting a business and presenting some of the worst performances in horror (and this requires a bit of work), Unhinged is really a terrible movie. Music is a total mess (it sounds as if the three-year-old musician was released on the synthesizer) and as such perfectly complements the film. Only a few bloody scenes at the end and a bit of unpaid nakedness that will save Unhinged from getting the lowest possible score. <br /> <br /> If you are a complete horror movie (and unfortunately I am), you will want to see it to mark it on the Nasty video watch list. But be careful that it is really, very bad.
