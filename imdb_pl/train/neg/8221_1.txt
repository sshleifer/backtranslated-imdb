This "movie" is trying to follow the low-budget, hand-made camera videos that have been very effective and effective. <br /> <br /> Ten, no, and JAK. <br /> <br /> Incredible, how many so-called "rewards" this piece of garbage has been plastered on the cover ..... makes you wonder what the critics were about when they actually sent it ... . <br /> <br /> Words do not describe how terrifying this movie really is. Seriously, THIS IS WRONG. <br /> <br /> I watched them in 20 minutes on a flat, almost constant acceleration. <br /> <br /> From rubbish to terrible directing, grainy visual effects and muffled sound, of course, not forgetting ABYSMAL's acting, it was one completely and completely pathetic piece of so-called film making. <br /> <br /> Seriously, there are no advantages - at all. Save cash and watch a decent horror with a low-budget game, there are many things - Dead End, The Blair Witch, REC, just to name a few. <br /> <br /> AVOID these trash at all costs. Do not waste your money or time on this piece of rubbish that pretends to be a real movie. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to all other comments! You have been warned!
