** May contain Spoilery ** <br /> <br /> Dude in Kong looking like a surly suit (the same one that was used in KING KONG VS. GODZILLA in 1962). Delivers many laffes in this mocking monster. Kong resurrected on the island of Mondo and this time helps the hero lunkhead and other good guys. The vampiric black character is called Dr. Who - funny, does not look like Peter Cushing! Kong finally wins with pride and joy, Who, a gigantic monkey robot that looks like the evil metal sculpture of Gorilla Magilla. As with many Honda films, it can have advantages before the American audience has seen it and added new recordings. The Rankin / Bass entertainment company had its share in this mess. They should stick to the best children's programs, such as The Little Drummer Boy.
