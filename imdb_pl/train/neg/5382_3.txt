Definitely a product of young minds, this song may appeal to the crowd of the 1920s, who are still trying to find their place in the world, obsessively over every neurosis. However, I can not imagine that a large amount of narcissistic looking at navel, trivial humor or trivial topics would be particularly interesting for anyone who is over 30 years old. Another problem is that peripheral characters, whose creators, of course, have nothing but contempt, are excited about such absurd caricatures for the comic effect that they can not be linked in any way. <br /> <br /> However, you have to give style points to the filmmakers who naturally grew up in the video generation, and use every possible trick to edit in the book to create a story that does not exist in a different way. There are 2 points to remember. First of all, beware of the festival's favorites. Second, even though we live in the Youtube era, not everyone is talking about their prosaic life. But these young filmmakers have the right to make their own film, and if the other 20-year-olds find something in it that they identify with, then the better. However, I could not resist thinking about this film, how this latest generation, which is just coming of age, will do well in the real world, which presents so many challenges and complications. In an age in which every child is constantly calmed down, how exceptional they are, and that all deserve 15 minutes of exposure, resistance and the ability to deal with adversities do not seem to be a strong point of this generation.
