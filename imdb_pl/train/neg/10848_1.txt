According to all accounts, it could have been an interesting movie. I have the music of the powerful Cradle of Filth, in which their frontman Dani performed, and who was included as the "future of the British horror", I was expecting the fest of Alex Chandon to make this noise. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is either trivial or inept. The configuration of the story anthology was made to death (and much better) in the seventies and eighties. Admittedly, the idea of ​​"sick room" caused coldness in my spine, but as with most films, I was disappointed by bad script writing and acting. <br /> <br /> Chandon can not write dialogues. Every sentence with the main policeman is full of curses and insolence (a typical "policeman on the edge" formula.) Funny, I'm sure I've seen it somewhere before ...) No Chandon, you're not Tarantino. Or Scorsese. It sounds bad. Add ridiculously OTT by playing with a very suspicious casting (do not get me wrong, Dani Filth is a great singer and musician, but the actor is not), and the performances are out of laughter, until the line breaks. Give me Bruce Campbell every day. <br /> <br /> Visual effects are generally weak, with some terrible CGI, horrible gore effects (for God's sake, Peter Jackson did better and it was over ten years ago with less budget) and editing filters that scream OVER-USE! As for the often misuse of the Cradle Of Filth score ... man, they should sue. <br /> <br /> The basic problem with Cradle Of Fear is that it is taken seriously, trying to build an atmosphere and stir up terror and disgust among the audience. Too many good horror movies made in the seventies and eighties make it much better thanks to much better gore effects (eg maniac, zombie meat eaters, outside, suspiria, etc.), making Cradle of Fear, in my opinion, secondary and <br /> <br /> I hope Chandon will be able to learn from this hideous ghoul of the movie and do something like a horror that really scares. <br /> <br /> Better happiness next time.
