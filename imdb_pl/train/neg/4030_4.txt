I remember watching "Lost Missile" (actually throwing a match, until my brother and a few cousins, in whose home I was a night visitor, did not agree to watch it with me - from time to time I was Eric Cartman from the 60s - sorry guys ) and a bit embarrassed when a continuous wave of millions of degrees of heat appeared as a fictional device - even as a grader I knew that a simple projectile simply could not transmit energy around such a large amount of heat or destruction than more than the duration and limited radius of nuclear detonation. <br /> <br /> My asking this turkey to a loving relative was a self-harming crime. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​of the film were very good. Acting is not bad (apart from the actor's cloakiness, who played the governor's helper, that someone else mentioned here). <br /> <br /> But the idea of ​​a rocket Easily burn the surface of the Earth with the heat of his exhale ... no. <br /> <br /> How do people in "Mystery Science Theater 3000" miss "The Lost Missile"? <br /> <br /> It's a great classic of unintentional comedy - watch it if you want to drink something for a weekend.
