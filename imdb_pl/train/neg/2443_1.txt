this is not just a bad movie, it's one of the worst films ever. it's so bad that I found it quite pleasant. acting, oh my God, screenplay, you have to be joking. As you can imagine a writer who invents things like: - a kid who makes fireworks at school, fireworks SO so powerful that when someone is hit by him, he flies a hundred yards back and explodes. - the girl is trapped in the basement, the killer tries to open the door. it gets a drill, but the wire is not long enough. first he makes an extension, oh a horror, and then, when he's done, he drills through the door and trains the killer through the head. WOW - and there are many such examples. oh yes, and what happened to George Kennedy, he was great (Luke Thunderbolt and Lightfoot / Cool)
