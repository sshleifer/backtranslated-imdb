The "mathematical" aspect is just a trick trying to distinguish this TV program from millions of other police shows. The only aspect of this show is Rob Morrow, although his career must have been (undeservedly) weakening after Northern Exposure if he signed up for this schlock. <br /> <br /> The lameness of the "mathematical" aspect to the series is accompanied by one episode with Lou Louis Phillips (who only confirms that this series is the last refuge of the damned). To catch the escapee, the "mathematician" uses a certain theory about "bubbles". So he gives a long explanation that if we've seen the suspect in places A, B and C, we can use "bubble theory" to calculate where it can be. He does it all on the board, and maybe with a stick in the ground (I do not remember). <br /> <br /> In any case, when you look at the finished product, he basically took three places and chose a point in the middle and said: "Ok, mathematically, here is the place where you will most likely find a runaway." At this point, one other character points to "Oh, this point is also the cabin where the guy lived." Is it math? There is not even a connection ** k ** g-dots !!! This performance reminds me of the mathematics with which I worked in banking, and which had a mathematical analysis that he could do to "support" points that everyone else agreed with a less complicated analysis or basic common sense. > <br /> It just shows - When you are a hammer, everything looks like a nail. I can not wait to apply the NUMB3RS team to OSAMA ... They will use the differential calculus, call the air attack in the middle of the mountains and hit Osama and not even scratch the five children he uses as human shields ... Because hey ... it's about number. <br /> <br /> A completely ridiculous television program.
