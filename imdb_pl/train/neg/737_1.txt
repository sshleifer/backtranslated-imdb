WOW! <br /> <br /> I just got this movie from my friend who bought him for 1.98 in Walmart and felt he was taken! This is not boring, most of the scenes are filmed in front of the green screen, the game is slightly improvised, as if they did not have a script. The Martians are CGIs that look as if they were made by a novice or film made by fans. I can not just stress how bad this DVD is! <br /> <br /> Example: in one of the scenes, Martians torture a local woman. He goes from the woman in front of the green screen to the CGI copy of this woman. The change is completely noticeable, and when it is killed, you can see that it is a computer character, looking like something from the game in 1990! <br /> <br /> If possible, avoid this movie like a plague! You can download two trailers from your website and see how terrible it really is!
