This movie was terrible. At first, I just read the storyline and it looked good, so I looked at it. Acting was terrible. it was as if the actor was almost shy. everything seemed false. I feel bad because of Edward Furlong, terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago ... I watched it at least 20 times ... <br /> <br /> the plot was also nonsense. the writers were probably sleep deprived when they invented the lines. <br /> <br /> on the plus side is a good kind of bad movie. the one you're watching just to see how the worst can happen to later tell others how you could not believe how horrible the movie was. <br /> <br /> I think everyone should watch it, so then we can appreciate other REAL movies.
