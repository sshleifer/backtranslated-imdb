Deep Shock takes place like a TV movie: a whole cast of commercial-quality actors, a poorly designed creature that is supposed to be a "bad man" and a script that is more full of technical, political jargon and more important things than knows what to do with. <Br / > <br /> I checked the movie because of the creation (I love to see what the filmmakers think about their projects in these cheap movies), and I was disappointed immediately because the creation on the box was not the one in the movie. The actors I expected due to the type of film (really quite general and not thought out at some point). Music was a typical, un thoughtful symphonic music. <br /> <br /> I liked the design of computers and technical equipment, as well as the mini-sub project. The film flowed very well, with screens that let you know which set you are watching in which the story unfolds. But there are not too many stories. <br /> <br /> This movie gets 3/8 IMO stars. Boring search and destruction of the mission of blowing up the North Pole and those creatures that protect it ... a little lame. Even lamer is a related love between two characters you can not see. Chalk is one movie that tries to get the careers of actors from the bench and video. Do not worry.
