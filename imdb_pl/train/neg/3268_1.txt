The real challenge is to make a movie about the fact that the child is devoured by wild fangs, and the mother is wrongly accused of murder, but against all odds it is successful. Meryl Streep gives a presentation of his life, melodramatic, overflowing, but with this comic genius that makes you laugh, even when your mother is in the deepest horror. Your cup of tea may be uncomfortable while watching this and, yes, it's a weird selection of the theme for a farce, but really little of the movie has something to do with it, because it focuses on showing Streep its Australian accent and facial contortion. <br /> <br /> Tossing towards media bias and sensationalism as well as disregarding truth or ethics gives the film a chance to say boldly that these things are bad.
