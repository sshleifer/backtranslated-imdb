I wanted to say it was the worst gay movie I've ever seen, but I can honestly say it's the worst movie if I've ever seen a genre. <br /> <br /> You know, You're in trouble when the movie starts with a "personal note" from the director, asking you to "understand" the audience for the "many challenges" facing the first director. The soundtrack is so bad in many scenes that it's almost impossible to follow the dialogue, and it's from the DVD version. Bad lighting, bad sets, bad photography, bad script, generally bad acting - all this makes this "movie" impossible to watch. After a few attempts I got to the wrong end and I immediately handed out a DVD I bought stupidly. I am sure that there are many challenges ahead of the first director. But do not try to repel this lame attempt as a finished product. I see from IMDb the details that it was not only the first directing attempt of Richard Natale, but also the only one. This is the only positive thing I can say about this alleged "film."
