Was it a harbinger when Tori complained that her first boyfriend treated her like a robot, and then her new boyfriend (murderer) turned out to be a designer of artificial intelligence? I think so. Scenes that will make you squeak with delight: lots of photomontages, teasing in kimono (what do you call it when you seductively put on your clothes instead of taking them off?) And the culminating battle of skiing! Definitely tune in to the beginning and the end, but you can catch a sandwich during the second act, when everything is happening. Is it better than CO-ED CALL GIRL? No. Will Tori ever get to paradise or even snow? No.
