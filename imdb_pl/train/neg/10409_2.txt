As if this story was not depressing enough, this movie shows cows slaughtering graphically in the slaughterhouse for five minutes, while the protagonist talks about his early life as a butcher. Strange things. There is also a fundamental premise of the hero / heroine who goes and cuts his dick because he is at work with him and says that he would go with him if he was a girl. Is this person a psycho, a masochist, only a doomed queen who takes things too far? And what traumatic childhood did he have? Only he was not adopted and had to live with nuns who initially loved him and then hated him because he was unruly. He's trying to explain why he did what he did, but it's really hard to get into it. Such sad and unusual self-destruction. Was this supposed to be funny? What was it really about?
