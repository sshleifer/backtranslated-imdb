I have read some good reviews that defended and criticized various aspects of the film. One thing I see over and over again is Megan's irritation, an idealistic political scientist who is trying to change the world. I loved her character. Maybe because I'm a 23-year-old political science student and I think I'm going to change the world too, so I'm referring to Megan. Besides, she's adorable. She is not a super model, but a more charming girl from the neighborhood. <br /> <br /> OK, so she cried and screamed a lot. It is very dramatic and seems exaggerated, but does it fit into its character? He performs in this program with the intention of sacrificing his life to prove his point. He thinks people who like this show are sick. It seems to me that she confirmed it very well. Of course, being a young naive girl, she is terrified of what she is about to face. I think her acting accurately depicts a young girl showing moral courage in spite of her overwhelming fear. What's more, I think she has retained a certain dignity throughout the film, despite the desperate situation she was in. <br /> <br /> As for the film in general, except Megan, it was actually what I expected. He had excellent gore scenes, according to micro-budget standards. The story may require quick thought, almost no contemplation. It's just a senseless, dark humorous movie, as the name suggests. I love the sadism of the doctor. He took off his Megan T-shirt, not only because of madness (though to a large extent like that), but also to torment her before she killed her. Chick with chainsaw was funny. For movie lovers, he was probably the best character. <br /> <br /> I give this film 4 out of 10. It had a good setting, almost no plot and mixed good and horrible acting. I recommend it for a cheap thrill, but rather it is not a diamond that is a horror of micro-budget.
