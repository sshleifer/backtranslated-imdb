I suppose that any novel, which is just as inferior as Moby Dick, would not find great favor among recipients from the era of depression, who had enough of their own problems. But every resemblance to Herman Melville's classic novel is a coincidence. <br /> <br /> In fact, half of the movie is a prequel to the main story as we know it, and not that too much has been preserved for the movie. For the first time we meet Ahab Creely (she has a surname and brother) as a happy soul with two legs and intentions of marrying Joan Bennett, who is the daughter of Father Mapple. This brother Derek, played by Lloyd Hughes, also wants to marry Bennett. <br /> <br /> John Barrymore is Ahab in above-average performance. Barrymore did not quite master the sound cinema and gave it all with histrionics from a quiet era and a stage voice that would shake the rafters of every cinema in which he played the movie. <br /> <br /> We see Ahab losing his leg to the whale Moby Dick and I have to say that the amputation scene was quite macabre. Of course, this was all before the Code. I'm still sure that in 1930 the audience shuddered. <br /> <br /> Then the story of Ahab's hunt for the whale, which he thought made him unsightly in the eyes of Joan Bennett. This is not exactly Melville's motivation, in fact there are no women in Moby Dick, as he wrote. <br /> <br /> One of the things Melville did was to invest the crew of the Ahab ship in Pequod in personality. In addition to Queequeg, the Cannibal harpuner has names there, but no personality. Starbuck and Stubbs might well be Smith and Jones. <br /> <br /> I saw this version of Moby Dick exclusively out of curiosity and nothing more.
