Good Earth follows the life of a slave and poor farmer in China. The film is based on the novel Pearl S. Buck. The story is great, but I hated that they decided to cast Anglos in the lead roles. Walter Connolly is funny as the farmer's father. He has such a heavy American accent as most of the leading actors I could not stand listening to his statements. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that Hollywood can not surpass its racist beliefs to throw Asians in leading roles. Taking the Anglos and making them look like Chinese, is similar to the fact that Anglos puts a shoe polish on his face to play in African-Americans.
