But it has a good action and an interesting plot. Nevsky behaves like a bodybuilder and is not so attractive IMO, he is VERY VERY. (he lacks all his acting skills!) Sascha is very well played by Joanna Pacula, but she needed more lines than she was given, her character had to be developed. There are far too many men in this story, no romance, too much action and too stupid to finish. This is very violent. However, I loved the scenery, this movie will take you around the world, and this is a bonus. I also liked the fact that it has some things about the mafia, not too much or too little, but enough to attract my attention. Actors must have been more handsome ... The biggest problem I had was that Nevsky was just too normal, not sexy enough. I think for most guys, Sascha will be hot enough, but for us who are action fans, Nevsky simply does not do it. In general, this movie was fine, I did not like it or hate it, I just discovered it was another normal action movie.
