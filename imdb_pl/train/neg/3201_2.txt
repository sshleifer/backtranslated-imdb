Joe Don Baker is fine for a good actor in small roles here and there ... he was fine at Goldeneye and made quite a good resident Bond in The Living Daylights and appeared in many other movies. One thing he can not do is wear the movie as the main character who finds himself in this extremely bad film of revenge on Malta. Joe Don's partner is killed, so he kills the assassin's brother and escorts the assassin to Italy, but some guys cause the plane to land on Malta and the killer will run away. The rest of the movie is a meeting with Joe Don chasing a killer here and there, Joe Don in jail times, Joe Don torturing the bartender and interrupting him and so on. The film is pretty bad and you will not find yourself exactly as the hero of Joe Don. You will be amazed at how many times Joe Don the hero will be killed with one blow and how incompetent turns out to be. The crowning feature of the film is the fact that Joe Don is pursuing a murderer in Malta with a murderer in the priest's robe, and then he gets on a boat and chases them all over Malta. This film also contains one of the worst film closing lines in history.
