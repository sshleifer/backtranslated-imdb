I ordered this movie from Korea because I was extra and wanted to see how it ended. <br /> <br /> Looking at this, I can say that I am ashamed to have some part of it. I feel embarrassed not only for myself, but for all others who participated in the creation of this mockery from the British "comedy". <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, the movie is predictable, boring, boring, monotonous and to such an extent that I have actually turned my eyes from the screen to unbelief several times. Until you see the movie, it's hard to imagine how romantic and non-comedy can be a romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> It's not just a bad story, it's a badly made movie. In one scene, you can see a runner or assistant director showing when to clean. I will publish the details of this in the "Goofs" section. <br /> <br /> In advance, it filled me with emotions (disappointment, rage, embarrassment?)
