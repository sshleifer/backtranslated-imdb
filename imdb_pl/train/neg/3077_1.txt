Hobgoblins ... what a concept. Rick Sloan was the master of this film. He had brilliance in making a movie with actors who could not act. What's more, he decided to write a script based on a bad journey with acid, which was seriously bad. Put it together, you'll get a movie that sucks more than a magazine filled with suction cups and vacuum cleaners. This movie was very painful. The pain he caused is more or less equal to the pain caused by sculpting the genitals with a spoon, and then pouring the whole wound with salt and hydrochloric acid.
