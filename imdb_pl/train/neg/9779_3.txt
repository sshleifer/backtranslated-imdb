Inexorably stupid, budgetless "war picture" created mainly to show the attributes of the spectacular Ewa Meyer - this is not a bad idea - but it should be a shame for everyone involved in this. Bold "scenario", performances that will not go on stage in the festive elementary competition, inept action scenes, mixed up by normally-competent documentary director Louis Clyde Stoumen - who apparently is not entirely sure whether he is creating a comedy, a philosophical treatise on the futility of war or T & A stories (according to the early 1960s), traveling around the wonderful body of Ewa Meyer - and general restraint and incompetence. It's worth seeing to see how Eve Meyer does his thing, but that's almost everything.
