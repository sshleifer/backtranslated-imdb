Michael Jackson would make room for the best character in THE GOLDEN CHILD and because he loves children. It did not work (and why?), So instead we have Eddie Murphy, who will save the world by saving "Kid Midas". I would definitely suggest to all future screenwriters to carefully study the audacious actor's dialogue in this bizarre fantasy - an adventure comedy that is one step closer to ISHTAR. Whatever Murphy says or does, he may be the most liked, but do not get me wrong about his great comic talent; does not belong to this movie, and the same applies to DR. DOLITTLE! Combined violence and visuals are the reasons why they can be called the cult camp classic, and that would not make sense when Hollywood and movie fanatics were still making money on this guy. Speaking of visualizations, they were amazingly well done during the presidential fame of Ronald Reagan. Murphy is much better in Coming to AMERICA and 48 HRS, but this old movie is not my touch of golden honey for a sweet crispy flavor.
