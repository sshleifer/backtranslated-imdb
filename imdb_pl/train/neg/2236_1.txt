I really do not know where to start. Acting in this movie was really horrible, I do not remember seeing so many "actors" in one movie that were not able to work. Not only was the acting bad, the characters were incredibly stupid too. <br /> <br /> Then there is the action. I believe that even children know that when someone is shot, blood is involved. But when someone is shot in the Snitch for ten (!!) times, there is no blood at all. Well, I think it's just me. <br /> <br /> To shorten a long story (because believe me, I can talk about this movie for hours) is undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen. This film should be number 1 at the bottom 100 without a doubt.
