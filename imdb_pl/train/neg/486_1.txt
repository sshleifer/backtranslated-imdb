This move was a blow to me. I think that little girls should strive to be nothing more than swimsuit models, home manufacturers or lovers, because it seems that everything will be presented to them in any case. It is sad that the artist's work and life are so unjustly misinterpreted. Unimaginable (or perhaps should have been expected), the entire figure of Artemisia and everything he represents has been reduced to the standard Hollywood female character; pathetic, physically defenseless, helpless little creature, showing no character traits that actually led her to this place in history, which was mutilated here. Even sadder was the fact that a large part of the audience was too badly educated in this field to understand the incredible gap between the message in the film and reality. To present the artist as someone in love with her real rapist, someone whom she actually accused of raping her, even under torture, just pisses me off. If the director had nothing more to say, she should refrain from basing her story on a real person.
