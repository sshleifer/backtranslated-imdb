I thought the movie was a bad document. Nothing was discussed about the substance. It seemed to reduce costs and not provide anything new. The film lacked delight, romance or anything that could lead to learning. Most scientists seemed "stereotyped" and sometimes weird. The woman said her prizes did not matter much, only the children they helped. She said that after the 10-minute scene she explained all her rewards. Are we a "humble scientist"? "I have equations dancing in my head," said another. I do not understand how it explains something to us. It does not include significant effects of science on our culture. The science policy was barely touched. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad move for 10-14 year olds. Besides, I felt it was boring and invisible. <br /> <br /> 4/10
