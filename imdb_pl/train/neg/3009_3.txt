This song is still humming in my head. Not the best song, but the 80's. This film tells the story of a singer who "presumably" is killed while accusing her of murder while following her girlfriend who sings spare vocals in her band. The lead vocalist, whose name is Billy "Eye" (yeah, right) is dead after two years, and his band returns to the concert, only this time the singer is the vocalist. Billy persecutes her and ultimately kills all these people and scares the girl and makes people around her think that something is wrong with her and that she imagines things. In the end, he decides to go to the cemetery and dig his grave to see if he is still there. He sees that he is dead, but he still sees and hears his voice. At the end of the movie, we find out the reasons for all this, Billy has John's brother (again okay), and John admits he was jealous of his brother and that he killed all these people to get back to him and put the blame on him and then take his girlfriend and terrorizing her because she called him crazy. The ending is very shoddy, and the acting is very poor and wooden. But .... I like it anyway. I'm watching this for a song. I would like to have it.
