This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. A movie presenting good actors does not meet expectations. The most dramatic thing in this film is music, which largely sums up the film: compensating for the bad and confused plot thanks to the well-known good actors, loud and dramatic music. It does not change the fact that it is a very boring movie to watch. He scored 1 point.
