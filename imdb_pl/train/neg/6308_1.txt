Full marks for the content of this film, because the Briton did not realize the segregation in the US Navy during World War II. A very courageous attempt to transfer this fact to the world. However, the film is pathetic, the direction does not exist, the acting is wooden, and the script is just one clich√© after another. I can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I sat and crouched from the very beginning to the end, in the very poor way in which it was filed. It could have been a great movie, the story of many of us outside the US was new, unique and interesting. The sad fact is the way it was filed. It is a pity that a real story that could change the attitudes of people has been wasted on a bad budget, a badly wound film. I only hope that some time in the future one of the major studies will deal with this topic and do it justice.
