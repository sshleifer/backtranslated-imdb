Confessing the fantasy about Brad Pitt is quite a difficult confession for a heterosexual. But what can I tell you? Maybe it's the famous extra thing everyone is talking about and make the star a star. It cuts through this barrier. It draws you into the unknown sensual and emotional territory. Brando had it in spades, Montgomery Clift, Gary Cooper, of course James Dean and more recently, Tom Cruise, Jude Law, Johnny Depp, Ewan McGregor and Billy Crudup. Women fell in love with Garbo, Dietrich, Katharine and Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe, Julie Christie, Charlotte Rampling, Meryl Streep, Vanessa Redgrave, Julia Roberts and very recently Natalie Portman. But Brad Pitt himself redefined the concept. It's the only reason to get out, get in a car, find a car park, buy a ticket, popcorn and get to the theater to see "Troy". If you like episodes like "Loving Jupiter", you can enjoy it. But if you do not do it, go the same, we want to keep Brad Pitt in business.
