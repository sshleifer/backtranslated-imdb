A previous reviewer said the film is not so bad. What?!?!?! The film glorifies the child molestation. Oh, but Sylvia Kristel was naked in it, so let's give her 5 out of 10 stars. Why not full 10? Since the filmography was "painful", the child's shock looked "unrealistic" and the fat friend was "irritating." The reviewer does not express any indignation at the fact that the American film from 1981 contained scenes of a child having sex with an adult woman. It happened to me to catch this steaming loaf of film while staying at the hotel that had Showtime. For me, even if a fat friend played a storm and deserved an Oscar, I would still have to give the film only one star. That the TV show Howard Hessman played in the movie at the same time he appeared in WKRP is particularly funny. But do not take my word for it!
