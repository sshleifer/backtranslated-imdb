What was this devilish movie? Bad acting, bad special effects and the worst dialogues / stories I've ever met. The only cool thing was Coolio, who had a nice episode as a crazy policeman. The rest of the movie, however, is terrible and boring. It's not even that bad, you can laugh at it. Just shit. Whoever compares this with the Bad Dead Series might as well compare Tomb Raider to Indiana Jones (well, ok, at least Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider)! 1 out of 10
