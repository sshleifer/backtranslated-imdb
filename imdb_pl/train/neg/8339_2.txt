This movie just goes around and the viewer does not know where it is. Initially, I thought ... mmmmm, it can be a nice movie, but it just stretches and pulls in, and eventually you do not know what's going on. The main woman is a good actress and she played her role well, and the psycho-fella is terrifying, but after a while you do not care what happens because this movie just stretches. It is a pity that it could have been much better. <br /> <br /> I would say, however, that the main woman and psycho fella will have a good career ahead of them, but whether they will remember this movie, for making it known or for the movie they regret for ever having been made.
