This is a good movie, but lacks true depth, both emotional and story telling. <br /> <br /> The story is based on real events, which limits the number of shares to virtually zero. <br /> <br /> Washington is credible at the forefront, but sleeps through it through sleep, there is no possibility of bending any working muscles for him or supporting the cast. <br /> <br /> The story just falls a little flat, even never hearing about the title hero the ending was obvious, but unlike other films about such injustices, this one has no emotional impact, you do not really care about him and the motivations of people from the outside they seem more academic than concern for his good. <br /> <br /> There is an attempt to inject emotions with the boy outside, whose hero loves Carter, but it seems forced. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie, but it's instantly forgotten.
