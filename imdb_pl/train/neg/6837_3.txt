Usually, I do not like revenge movies .... PERIOD. But Double Impact has a little more than the typical assumption of revenge. You see, DI has action, accuracy, exotic locations (eg Hong Kong), amazing battle with weapons and enough martial arts to satisfy your desires for an impressive unarmed fight. Like all videos of revenge, he has villains you would like to throw away from a glass-topped window on the top floor of a 40-story building! However, Double Impact has nothing of the sensational shit that stifles the plot and the elite, racist and venomous social stereotypes that attacked "Eye for an Eye" and "Death Wish 2". <br /> <br /> But in the Double Impact feature section it is as transparent as a saran wrap. Chad's and Alex's parents were killed by a Nazi unit connected to a family friend with money problems, or so I remembered. The explanation of why the boys spoke French accents is poor. It was not the watery conspiracy that made the movie bad, but the use of clich√©d lines and movements from other movies (from Lethal Weapon to The Princess Bride) really made him worse. Nevertheless, Double Impact is still open to watch. But why are these shitty movies having villains (for example, the greedy Briton who killed Chad and Alex's parents and this lethal lesbian redhead chick) that you would like to hate with your fiber?
