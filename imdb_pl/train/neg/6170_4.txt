This film starts very VERY slowly, but when the action finally starts, you have to go for it. I could not understand why some events took place, and many events happened before they were explained, which made them confusing. The only thing he really means is the huge amount of blood / gore he has, although in most cases there are no special effects. Blood looks like a red Kool-Aid. Tearing the skin sounds as if someone has entered a pile of sticks. Again, history has something of an amateurish feeling, as the writer did not need much time to improve it. It seems to me that it can be a much better movie if the effects are done better and more time spent on the script. I sincerely hope that I will not watch it, not because of blood, but because I feel that I have wasted 90 minutes of my life. If you like extremely bloody movies, it's for you, if not, stay away.
