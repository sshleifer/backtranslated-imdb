Continuation (in fact remake) of the remake of the 99th Dalmatian Disney from 1996. Cruella deVil (Glenn Close) is released from prison after she was "cured" by a psychologist obsessed with fur, Dr. Pavlov (ugh!). But the "medicine" is broken when Cruella hears the harvest of Big Ben, and she once again goes on a crazy mission to make herself the perfect mantle of Dalmatian skins. <br /> <br /> This movie is bad for it's many levels, starting with the fact that it's a "Thanksgiving for the Family" movie, the aim of which is to suck every penny available from the Disney marketing machine. Glenn Close over over over works like Cruella. With all that she had to endure in this film - a lousy script, endless make-up, baking at the end of the dough - I hope that they gave her an exceptionally large salary. <br /> <br /> (By the way, where in the world you will find a fur factory, a bakery with the Rube Goldberg assembly line and a candlelit restaurant, all located in the same building - as in the climax of the film)? Of course, real movie stars are dogs. They serve as the "Macaulay Culkin's" of this movie, pulling all the stupid gags of "Home Alone" to villains. (Biting them in the crotch, running around their palms with luggage carts, sprinkling them with icing etc. Etc. Etc., Ad nauseum.) I must admit that dogs were quite good actors - much better than humans. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardieu is completely wasted in this film as a terrified French furrier. Two human "dog lovers" - revived from an earlier movie, but with different actors - are completely boring. When they eat spaghetti in an Italian restaurant, the film cuts between the lovers and their dogs at home, watching the scene from "Lady and the Tramp". I thought, "Oh, please, do not go there!" I expected people to make a satire on the "Lady and the Tramp" dinner scene - as Charlie Sheen did in "Hot Shots: Part Deux" - doing a "spaghetti thread kiss", pushing the meatball nose, etc. <br /> <br /> And do not start my annoying parrot with Eric Idle's voice. <br /> <br /> Costumes were nominated for an Oscar, and the costumes in the movie * are good. But they are the only good thing in the movie. The rest is unbearable.
