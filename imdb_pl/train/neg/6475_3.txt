Although I have not yet reviewed the film in two years, I remember exactly what made my opinion as low as it was. Loving the original Little Mermaid and being obsessed with sirens in my childhood, I decided to devote some time to sit down and watch the sequel. <br /> <br /> Disney, I have a small message for you. If you do not have a handy original director and actors ... you just want your ass to be flashy. <br /> <br /> In the sequel our story begins with a slightly older Ariel and her daughter, Melody. My first big problem was that Eric and the rest of the crew sang. Yes, I understand that Disney is big on singles and dancing, but it really made Eric my favorite prince. He was calm, collected and a real gentleman who knew how to have fun. And he did. NO. SING. <br /> <br /> And then there is a villain. Oh, how could we forget the chills that ran down our spine when Ursula came in and horrified both Ariel and the public around the world? Unfortunately, this gene was not passed on to her seemingly useless sister Morgan. Nothing ever was, EVER said about Morgan in the first movie; jumps out of nowhere, trying to steal the child. OOO .. how sweet. The younger sister is pushed away and instead of going for a trident, she decides to kidnap a monthly child. Gag me. <br /> <br /> Besides being a flat figure without a sense of originality, Morgana was simply very unconventional. The same plan as her sister, the same creatures (which by the way did not scare anyone ... I was three on my knees when I watched the movie and she laughed hysterically.) It did not make sense to be there; I would like to see that my mother is a villain. I'm sure she would do a better job than Little Miss Tish. <br /> <br /> King Triton did not keep any respect, which he got from me in the first movie and did not even get started from Scuttle, Sebastian and FlÄ…dra. Triton was a strict but loving father in the first film, and in the second almost like he lost the will to fear in the hearts of his subjects. Scuttle, once a comical relief that made everyone laugh at their "dingle-hopper" (yes, I'll admit it, from time to time I call the dingle-hopper fork). In this movie, Scuttle is almost forgotten. Supporting the character even in the first, at least he added something to the movie. He was rich in taste that others did not have, and in the sequel everyone took him completely. Sebastian was still the same, but twice as worrying than before. Disney, do not do this. Do not even try to spoil our favorite crab. Or our favorite small fat fish, which becomes a dad and has a lot of very annoying children. He's fat, and he's insipid, and it looks like he's on a flat line every second. <br /> <br /> Walrus and penguin were unnecessary, and after a while you start to get angry. Especially Melody, which has no depth at all. <br /> <br /> And one of those days, Disney, I'm kicking out of my life. <br /> <br /> If I did not love your originals so much.
