With nice actors, I was expecting much more from "Deceiver" than it was delivered. The plot is extremely sophisticated and manipulative. Many flashbacks only add confusion. Credibility pops out of the window and becomes unbearable and almost funny with the end. I would definitely advise anyone who likes their story to be based on something that can at least avoid "cheating" because you will be very frustrated. Maybe I'm just not trendy enough to get it, but I suspect that many others were completely confused by the story, especially the end. The blurring of the boundary between reality and lies simply does not work, because the whole movie did not make sense. - MERK
