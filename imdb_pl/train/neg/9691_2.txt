It is a shallow hedonism and / or social commentary wrapped in a tragic tale of a jealous young woman's scheme to separate her father and fianc√©e. Is it incest, or just a look from your daughter's eyes with the Electra complex? Who cares? All characters, except Anna (Deborah Kerr), are vain and despicable. Seberg is poor (I agree with the commentary of "boys with breasts" earlier review). The plot was going. This predictable material was enough for about 30 minutes of the movie, which unfortunately stretched for over an hour and a half! If you want to see wonderful dresses and jewels on the Riviera, I recommend "Catch a thief" - in which you will receive additional bonuses in the form of a funny story and nice characters. <br /> <br /> I like movies that make me laugh. Personally, I do not care where the film is set. Regardless of time and place, I want a good story - a comedy or a drama. I also want to see some nice characters. It does not hurt if I can relate to them. Weak Deborah Kerr gives a typically good performance, as did David Niven in a wicked role. <br /> <br /> Score "2" only applies to Kerr and Niven, and for photos - rich color scenes dark, sinister black and white scenes. Unfortunately, all great cinematography in the world can not save a poor story with unpopular characters. The sow's ear is still the sow's ear. Therefore, watching this mess was a serious waste of my time.
