Body Slam (1987) is a scary movie. A low budget is receding, the direction is pedestrian (at best), and writing and acting are poor. But if you're in old-school wrestling (around the 1970s until the mid-1980s), you'll be more entertaining than the average viewer. I must warn you that this movie stinks with ice. I gave him two because I wanted to be generous. This turkey was "directed" by stuntman Hal Needham. The stars are Roddy Piper, The Tonga Kid and a group of wrestlers and c-list actors (Dirk Benedict). <br /> <br /> The summary of this "movie" refers to a promoter who wants to combine "rock hair" and wrestling. But these are others who do not want him to succeed. There are more, but I do not want to SUGGEST. If you can handle bad behavior and incompetent storyline, there are several surprises waiting for die-hard stock fans at the end of the game. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this to my worse enemy (and I mean that).
