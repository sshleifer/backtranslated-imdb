It was one of THE MOST MOST and BEST anti-nuclear movies from the 80s. <br /> <br /> The idea that a child and a basketball star can "change the world" is quite far-fetched, considering how many "marches of peace for children" and " protests of celebrities "were and ARE. <br /> <br /> But the idea that the Soviet Union will agree to TOTAL nuclear disarmament, because some apparial children learned of the "silent protest" in the West is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> What ended the Cold War? Difficult America, I dare say "Reaganesque" position and internal failures of socialism. It was NOT peace marches, "dying" or movies like "Amazing Grace and Chuck", "Miracle Mile" or "Testament."
