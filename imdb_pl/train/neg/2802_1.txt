I think if I went to the first school somewhere deep in the countryside and asked the lower English set to come up with the script, it would be more sensible than that. I could go to the first year theater group and they would have played it better than the jokers in this movie. It sounds really serious, but I'm sure they did it as a joke and they are completely aware that they have (see, what did I do there?) Or the ability to act or write anything, never. <br /> <br /> Observe this only when you are incredibly drunk, tall or need a good excuse, why your decomposing corpse has been found with the slashed wrists. I will go to the fish bowl now and collect all the pile at the bottom. Then I shape it into a disk shape and place it on my DVD player, expecting to produce something much better than the trumpers. <br /> <br /> Operation - 0/10 Plot - LOL / 10 Breasts - 9/10
