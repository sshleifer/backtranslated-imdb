This can be one of the worst films ever made in production. <br /> <br /> 1. The most exciting part is the beginning where the guy goes ... and goes ... and walks (spoiler). The walk takes about 15 minutes. How? <br /> <br /> 2. Not to mention that the lighting has many problems and almost like shooting night scenes during the day. <br /> <br /> 3. Acting was terrible. It looks like they found a joint theater (in Mexico) ... and then they took people who were turned away. <br /> <br /> Please, for love of all that is holy, do not rent this movie. If you know someone who owns it, apologize. The director should be punished by the War Crimes Tribunal for inciting the public.
