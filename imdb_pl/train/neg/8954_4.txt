I had high hopes for this movie because I liked the book so much. I do not think, however, that I understand the premise of the film if I did not read the book. The film is a noble attempt to show the despair of people trying to break the bonds of overwhelming government governments, but the book presents suffering much more accurately. The corrupt government officials have a comfortable, almost luxurious life, while ordinary people struggle to get the necessary conditions to survive. Perhaps most people feel this way in relation to their leaders and rulers, regardless of whether they are really oppressed or suppressed. Orwell's dystopia seems to exist in many places in our modern world. It's been several years since I read the book, but often in the media and in casual conversation you hear references to Big Brother, Police Thought and Gazeta. Probably many people using these terms do not realize where the dates come from. I definitely recommend reading the book.
