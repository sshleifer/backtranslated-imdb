I really do not get all the praise that this movie received. It's unpalatable, unnecessarily manipulative and evading many great problems - such as Nash's affairs and his tendency to have sex with men in public places. I suppose in the context of a commercial Hollywood movie it's just passable, but what about the praise for Russell Crowe's performance? The man just seems to shuffle, clutching his briefcase and wearing a grungy hat, and somehow he seems to qualify as a great actor? Anyone who has ever known a person with mental health problems will realize that Crowe's performance is not much lower than the caricature. It is also quite offensive. And, dare I say, on the right side of being really terrible
