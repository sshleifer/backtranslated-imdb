Believe it or not, the "Scavenger Massacre" gave me full-blown gonorrhea! That's right, I have that longing to pour out of me just because a group of kids played with the camera and somehow made a deal with the devil and got a distribution. I do not understand how someone with moderate intelligence would tolerate this video. The only reason I managed to get through the whole case (not without a few suicide attempts along the way) was that, first of all, I was delirious with boredom, and secondly - I think I wanted to investigate this new type of hatred I experienced .. This film is a "horror / comedy" filmed on a video of three siblings who stay on the weekend under the care of their bizarre older aunt. The youngest child accidentally stabs an old woman with his hunting knife for Rambo replicas. Then they tear up their aunt with different tools (apparently she did not have a single drop of blood in her body!) And threw her into the rented wood chopper ... Her condemned son stops looking for his mother and the kids also finish grinding this asshole ... I do not recall that I would ever see a cast of annoying actors who actually made me sick. Seriously, that voice of one blond chick made me hurt all the time. ALL of the actors were cruel - they literally shouted at their false dialogues and jokes, which had to be written by a chimpanzee, who did not care! Now I usually appreciate independent efforts, but only from those who realize that people other than their relatives can see it! I do not need to watch a 3-minute shot of a car driven off the driveway and torturing, painfully long assembly of the lawn with some funny, fluttering music. Plus, why the hell is the box in the movie with a bloody piano ?! There was a piano in ONE stage and no one was killed nearby! I already have memories of this film behind me. If you do not like unbearable nonsense, I would advise anyone with half the brain to avoid this junk.
