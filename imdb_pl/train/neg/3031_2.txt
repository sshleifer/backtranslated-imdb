Tony Scott destroys everything that might be interesting in Richard Kelly's stereotypical, heterogeneous, overgrown scenario. Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) was a model who was eliminated and became a bounty hunter. This is her story ... "something like". <br /> <br /> The problem with this nonsense is that there is no such story at all, and Scott's extreme graphic stylization at every shot acts like a distancing mechanism that makes us indifferent to everything in Harvey's chaotic life. <br /> <br /> You just do not care about Harvey. Knightley plays her as an unbearable, cynical brat who did nothing to guarantee our respect. He hits people he does not like and throws clothes and brakes when the situation demands it, but it is not the least real, and Knightly is not convincing at all. <br /> <br /> The movie is boring. It is also loud and tied up one of the most annoying musical sources that I have heard for a long time. The last twenty minutes are a poor replay of Scott's culmination of "Real Romance" when Domino's gang meets with two sets of feared evil guys who are - a surprise! surprise! - designed to shoot at the top of a Las Vegas casino. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this potentially exciting fire is completely bothered by Scott and becomes a confusing, pretentious, senseless exercise in cellulite masturbation. It is not an artistically courageous or experimental song; it is a failure at every level, because it does not give us a point of entry into life and the dilemmas of its characters. <br /> <br /> Mickey Roarke looks good as a grizzled bounty hunter, but disappears in the background as a "narrative" progresses. Chris Walken turns into another embarrassing episode, and Dabney Coleman, always solid, is not fully utilized. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the multi-layered, artificial surface of this film. It's still turd no matter how much you polish it.
