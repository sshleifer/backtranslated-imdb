A film so uncertain that the creators could have hoped to release the original title of the classic film "Farewell My Lovely" noir, thinking that the gullible would consider it a remake. The characters are so disgusting and unpleasant that they deserve a cold party after the first release. Time only adds her absurdity. Without trickery, cinematography, desperation or the despair of the classic noir, it consisted more in an intricate and senseless crime that would easily lead to several arrests within a few hours. As if that was not enough, he threw himself into a completely sexless attempt of eroticism, in which at least one of the participants did not bother to bathe for a few days. It made this mess even more painful. Find a good classic movie from the forties or fifties instead of wasting two hours on this failure.
