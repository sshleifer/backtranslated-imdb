A teenager who seems to have it all commits suicide. He leaves his family and his best friend (Keanu Reeves) asking many questions ... and blaming himself. <br /> <br /> A good idea, ill-treated. At the beginning it was done before 1988 - mainly in television and special school movies. In addition to some curses and dialogue (hence the PG-13 rating), this did not add anything new. The result is predictable, and Reeve's attempts in action were really painful. It's good NOW, but not in 1988. Besides, his character was dressed like a bat and always looked so dirty that it was difficult to build sympathy. <br /> <br /> Besides, the movie is boring. I saw every upcoming scene and every "surprise" was telegramsed. Basically, I could not wait for this to end. <br /> <br /> I have a dim memory that I saw it in the theater in 1988 and I hated it (bombed BADLY). It still looks poor almost 20 years later. The subject is worth attention, but has been made better (thanks to better performance) in many other films. "Ordinary people" come to mind. You can omit this one.
