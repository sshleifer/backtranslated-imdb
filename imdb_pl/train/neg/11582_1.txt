I am glad that most of the people here do not think too much about this film. There are a few big names in the cast, but that's all. There is nothing else to recommend, except for a few beautiful women that you can do in thousands of movies. <br /> <br /> This story is nothing more than unlikely, egocentric, burning chains, "hip" national film critics seem to like ... and most of the audience can not stand it. <br /> <br /> The accents of Oklahoma are so false that they are funny, racist stereotypes in the south come from Liberal Hollywood 101 and the story is depressing.
