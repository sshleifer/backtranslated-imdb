It's just rubbish like watching dry paint. I am very disappointed because I wanted to see it so much. <br /> <br /> This movie just does not make sense. If it was never done, nobody would notice or care. He is scared because of all the big names, but if no one was inside, no one would give this film any love. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I was at the point, halfway through the movie I would look at Vanessa Redgrave and thought, "Hurry up and die!" It's like "Joy Luck Club" without joy. This is "Ocean's 13" (nothing but a great cast) of mother-daughter movies and completely anti-climatic ... oh, it will end. <br /> <br /> I'm sure everyone will be nominated for an Oscar ... <br /> <br /> - 4 stars for photos and the ability to convince great actresses to commit to this trash.
