Clearly tearing the Ring Hideo Nakaty (Ring, 1998) and Hongurai Mizu no Soko Kara (Dark Water, 2002), with hints Ju-On (The Grudge, 2000), but horribly done up (green corpse with red eyes!) Poor story and a weak subject (it is very difficult to find a frightening picture message). In this movie there were two moments that made me shudder, both because of an unexpected hand, and after Oodishon (another Miike Takashi, the one from 1999) taunted me for hours after watching and all the movies that steal from it were really scary, I do not see this movie as anything other than selling the western popularity of the great Japanese horror movies. Two out of ten.
