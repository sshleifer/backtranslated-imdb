I have to agree with the first commentary: this movie sucks very, very hard. Despite the very large cast of the B list, the cover of this film (for those who do not watch it on Comedy Central on a weekday, which is probably the only movie that this film ever gains) tries to blame Dangerfield in reality is just a payout for every comedian with 80s. Randy Quaid? Check. Ed Begley, Jr? Check. The voice of Lisa Simpson? Now he can say that Maximum Overdrive was not her only terrible move: double checking. And so many, many others. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about this movement is that it was so lazyly written with the jokes that were told. Nothing about the film is funny. You better see how the paint dries up. It's definitely scratching directly on video that still believes in the old video saying: throw an old star on the cover, and get some money from the rental. Considering the changing video rental days, consider this one of the last examples of garbage disposal. <br /> <br /> The only use of this movie if you have trouble falling asleep. It will take you there.
