I love horror movies. I can even appreciate the most cheese (face 9 out of 10 horror movies these days) but it was just ridiculous. Horrible acting, terrible writing, completely empty and unbelievable characters (there are no Meisner actors here!) And a total lack of enough bodies. I would like to SAVE 79 minutes of my life that I just wasted. At least the Crook brothers are aptly named. The only good thing about the whole movie was watching him want to be hit in the face of Alicia Silverstone. As EVERYONE reached Sundance, it is completely surprising to me. Most of the plot was absolutely unrealistic, even according to film standards. Come on! Who will choose a cheap earring 10 seconds after the terrible stalker just leaves their door? Lame.
