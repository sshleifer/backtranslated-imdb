After watching this episode of MST3K, I have to think about how many movies this movie borrows. It seems to combine elements of Logans Run, Farenheight 451, Final Sacrifice and at least several others. At one point, I really expected Cris Makepease to call Lee Majors ROWSDOWER. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the director has any indication of how many holes there are in the story. like the fact that gas is not available, there is plenty of it at abandoned gas stations, and the stations are close enough to each other that the F1 racing car will travel around the country.
