What?!?? Why do people say it's "blowing up thoughts"? Just look at the fact that the ending is one of the worst endings in the history of cinematography! 4 left, and the whole world is over! Not to mention that character 9 was an idiot the entire time he killed everyone. 1 he was right all the time, if he sacrificed 9, nothing would happen. People give life there for a stupid cause and for what? I admit that the film had its parts, and the whole concept was fascinating. But many of them were clich√©s one by one. And did anyone else have this feeling that it is very similar to the "Lord of the Rings"? Characters died for stupid reasons, there was almost no character development and I am honestly asking myself if it is good to have only four guys in the world; its purposeless and stupid. It was one of the shortest films I've ever seen and thank God! How robots are turning against people in any creative way! It has been done hundreds of times! This movie is really stupid, see a movie worth watching like Star Trek, The Hangover or Inglorious Basterds, these were good movies!
