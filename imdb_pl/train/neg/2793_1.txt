It's on my list of the worst movies I've ever seen on Starz on Demand. They seem to pick up everything on the DVD that they can find and put here. <br /> <br /> Why? Who knows! Apparently anyone who has a digital camera and a modest budget can come up with a horror movie and put it on TV. Honestly, it looked awful from the moment I saw the trailer - but I gave him a real chance. <br /> <br /> I always try to have an open mind about low budget movies. Some of the best movies I've ever seen are movies that worked around their low budget or in other cases only required a low budget to be great. <br /> <br /> This is not one of those movies. > <br /> You already know the plot, I'm sure if you're reading this. Either you heard about it on Starz on Demand, or for some reason you found yourself bored on this site. It's about a pathetic and grumpy girl that we meet for 3 minutes in an incredibly bad video called "heavy metal". Whoever put it together had to think that it looks really interesting, but not really. In any case, she kills herself. Then he has someone. Then killing begins. It is really unforgettable and as average and boring as possible. When the first shot fired in her apartment, it sounds quite serious like a piece of popcorn. Was it the best sound effect they could come up with? I could find a better sound effect for free use (without copyrights) on the Internet ... right. now. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by other reviews that claim to be a 10-star movie. They are, of course, distributors of the film, and maybe even a director trying to convince you that this piece of rubbish is worth buying. <br /> <br /> Laugh.
