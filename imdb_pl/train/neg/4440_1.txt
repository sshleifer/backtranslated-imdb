Give me clearly. I've been using IMDb for years. But only today I had trouble with registration on the site, just to give the film the lowest possible rating. I've seen hundreds of movies, some of them bad, some awful. However, I have never seen such a contrast of appearances and incompetence, high intentions and failures. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino is horribly cast as a princess, but completely unbelievable like the young boy Phocion. Fiona Shaw is always an entertaining character, but even the dialogue in the movie is much worse than in the bland French game that is the source (Marivaux has never reached Hollywood before and we should keep it that way). > <br /> To illustrate, for example, that Leontine is a brilliant, passionate philosopher and scientist, he shows himself how he is feverishly pouring chemicals from a beaker into a beaker, shouting names of famous scientists. And the romance between Agis and the princess is even stupid. To this end, the couple should receive the joint "Clair Danes" prize, which in the just world will be rewarded for the selfless and boring reinterpretation of interesting teenagers from literature as brats from the 1990s (see Miss Danes in Les Miserables). <br /> <br /> Apart from the terrible story and dialogue, there are some attempts to introduce artistic clues into filming. For example, there are times when a handful of spectators are faded and invisible to the action, sitting on chairs, watching the main characters. The director wants us to realize that she has adopted art. I understand. But it does not happen that far in the movie at all. At this moment, seeing a crowd of people sitting in their seats for a moment and then disappearing is terrifying and distracting. They are like a terrible crowd of zombies, appearing through the mists, filling us with fear. When you see the horrible frolics and songs that end this movie, you'll want to stimulate your own zombie crowd and kill them all for the serious injustice of poisoning your mind for 112 minutes. <br /> <br /> -Matthew McGuire
