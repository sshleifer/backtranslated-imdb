Filmography: Perfect, nice angles of the camera (I do not remember that I recently watched a film with good close-ups, up to this). It could avoid gruesome scenes with a soft camera. NY is good in the picture. I liked the angles upside down, in particular (different touch). <br /> <br /> Music: not impressive. The songs do not remain in memory even after watching the movie. Perhaps I expected the same quality as "Anniyan". Disappointment. <br /> <br /> Actors: Kamal must slowly withdraw from hard action sequences. His age and stomach are really appearing. He should also avoid close romantic sequences going forward. It was very awkward to see an older / older star who is still trying to play like scenes of heroes over 20+. Love can be expressed at any age; when we age, we can still express love from a distance with love (without touching the woman too much, for example, the love expressed by Rajinikantha in "chandrmukhi"). <br /> <br /> Jyotika only appears for the namesake in the film. I do not know why she accepted it. Well, this is not my problem, I think. <br /> <br /> Others just have a small presence. <br /> <br /> Direction: I expected Gautham to aim (or measure) his second film, "Kakka Kakka." He disappointed me. It took a long time to release the movie due to various problems. He slides in a few scenes. Even the loathsome things got out of control of the famous director. <br /> <br /> In general: just a good movie. Too much graphics. DEFINITELY NOT for children (and adults who expect some kind of "entertainment"). <br /> <br /> Thx
