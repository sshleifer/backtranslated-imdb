That's funny. I have seen several Fassbinder movies and I believe that some of them are extremely creative and interesting, while others are repulsive and complacent - just like this movie. For me it ranges from wonderful to nonsense - without much in the middle. I know that he has many fans among the "sophisticated", but I can not help it, but I think that many of his appeal is a pure buzz. From my point of view (and I know I will get many negative judgments for it), he did too many films too fast and was too indulgent. His homosexual or boring movies (such as this) seem to be really bad - sloppy, sometimes quite boring (such as QUERELLE and THE BITTER TEARS PETRA VON KANT), and sometimes just disgusting (like this movie). Could his message about acceptance of gender confusion be treated better than showing someone pats him or looks at how cows are being murdered? Show me a bit of sensitivity and make your characters more human and pleasant - then maybe I care about the movies. <br /> <br /> I am honestly on the spot after watching this movie, which may not bother with any Fassbinder movies - bad seems to weigh the good.
