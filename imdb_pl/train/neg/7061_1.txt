I am still trying to find out if there is any sense in this movie. <br /> <br /> In the case of content that should be so "rebellious" and "controversial", the things that Maddox distributes to students are terribly bad. Students seem to be easily disturbed by vague anti-authoritarian feelings and fragments of words illegibly written on leaflets. Rebel, everyone. <br /> <br /> I suppose it would be too much to ask for a movie with teen rebellion, in which the school's fire alarm will not move. <br /> <br /> Apparently "A huge fight on football pitches" is a fight that consists of two people. <br /> <br /> Character's personality seems to be very different at random. The football jumper with whom Maddox fought (and who later got the basic face) is all smiles and apologies the next day. <br /> <br /> The fact that there is no real end to the plot makes me feel that the whole could have been adjusted to half an hour after school. If you have cut out most of the pseudo-glitch soundtrack.
