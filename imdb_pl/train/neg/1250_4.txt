I must admit that it was a "re-image" of the original 1968 film. It was a huge disappointment. Especially considering that this is Tim Burton's movie. He is definitely one of the most original and, let's say, cool directors produced by Hollywood. <br /> <br /> I am personally a big fan of his work, but of course something went wrong with his latest film, The Planet Monkeys. I really liked the original movie. When it first came out, people expected another sci-fi movie from the cheesie of the 70s, but very unexpected and completely proved that the theory is wrong. It really had a clear message. Obvious anti-war message. Fear of the Cold War, where he embraced the world and fear of using nuclear weapons played a big role in the minds of filmmakers. These reasons have made the film rise above all expectations and became immediately classic. Although the new movie, "re-creation" or anything else, leaves us nothing. No news, no ideals. This is another summer hit that is focused on money. <br /> <br /> Visually, Tim Burton will not let you down. The dark and scary settings were excellent and of course the makeup was great. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not enough to keep people in the movie. There must be an exciting plot or plot. In this film the plot is very uninteresting and is very badly thought out. The script is very poor and full of gaps. It looks like this movie was written in a great hurry. Explaining why apes are there and why the ruled planet was actually very stupid and proved the ignorance of script writers. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of questions for which there were no reasonable answers. br /> <br /> For example; Why do monkeys speak English? Why were there other species of monkeys on the planet than chimpanzees (considering that only chimpanzees landed on the spacecraft) Where the hell are all these people coming from? How few chimpanzees could turn into a huge breeding of all kinds of monkeys in just a few thousand years. (I mean, the evolution from monkey to human has taken us several million years!) <br /> <br /> And finally, the bad surprise was stupid planes. Probably he was just thrown in because the original movie had such an end, and then felt that the audience expects the same kind of ending. The ending also raises many questions that I KNOW, do not have intelligent answers. Did Theid learn to work on a spaceship? Who was powerless and learned to fly back in time and take control of the land with one hand? And what did he do, multiplying with all women? And let's say it would happen, I have great doubt that history will remain the same, just as Washington would have been built exactly as it is today! (I mean, will not there be a big banana instead of a monument?) <br /> <br /> Well, to say something positive about the film. Part of the cast was great. Helen Bonham Carter's character was interesting and well-preserved, like Tim Roth as Theid. He was very good, a little sated at some moments in the movie. Michael Clark Duncan was fine too. I was not happy with Marc Whalberg. He is not very much an actor and plays a very colorless figure here. Very unbeatable and nothing compared to the Hestons figure in the original. And the main character had no reason or place in the film. It's just been cast on the look. He hardly said a word throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Well, I think in the future, when people think about the Planet of the Apes, they will think about the original. The latest ones will soon be forgotten.
