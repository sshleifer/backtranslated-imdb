The film begins in 1840 in Japan, in which a man cuts his wife and lover to death and commits suicide. It's a very bloody, bloody sequence. Then he jumps to today ... exactly 1982. Ted (Edward Albert), wife of Laura (Susan George) and their annoying little child move to Japan in search of a husband's job. They rent a house and - a surprise! surprise - it just happens that this is the house where the murders took place! Three dead people are like ghosts (makeup is hysterically angry) and make life a hell for the family. <br /> <br /> Sounds good - but it's really hopeless. There is a bloody opening and ending, and NOTHING is happening between. The attack of gigantic crabs is simply noisy! They look so false - I swear I saw strings behind me - and mumble !!!!! In the first 20 minutes there is a pointless sex sequence (probably just to show George's body), another about 40 minutes later (but that was necessary for the story) and a really stupid exorcism at the end. The battle scene between Albert and Doug McClure must be seen as faith. <br /> <br /> When it comes to acting - Albert was okay because husband and McClure were pretty good as friends of the family. But George - as always - is great in a bad movie. It gives the film a much-needed elevator - but it can not save it. I give it 2 just for her and bloody opening and closing. Besides, it's a very boring movie.
