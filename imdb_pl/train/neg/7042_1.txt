It must be one of the worst films ever. Even for a movie about motorcyclists, this is the lowest level. The minimum plot includes a gang of cyclists taking over a small town (like the original!) And attempts of the inhabitants to fight them. Why do not they call outside help? Who knows? The fight scenes are obviously false. Adam West and Tina Louise are in it, but both have little to do and both look embarrassed that they are there (understandably) This movie belongs to the garbage bin!
