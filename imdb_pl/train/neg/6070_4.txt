Tony Scott is in charge of a sports thriller that should attract even sports fans. And some say baseball is a dead sport ... boring ... too fucking free. Okay! Outside, he seems to be a dissatisfied salesman (Robert De Niro), and inside he is a psychotic fan of the San Francisco Giants. A new slugger (Wesley Snipes) is coming and a designated savior is stagnant. Our salesman hides a murderous obsession when a heavy hit of the whole star falls into the worst drop in his career, and the Giants fear that they will fall apart with him. De Niro is the personification of terror. The scraps seem very natural, like a football player. Others known in the cast include: still attractive Ellen Barkin, John Leguizamo, Benicio Del Toro and Patti D'Arbanville. You are a free agent ... so be happy. Expect violence and a very strong language, and you gain your money.
