I liked Batman: Dead End. The dark, sharp film setting for Batman was perfect. Batman: Dead End is good. This is not. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, let me start with acting. None of this is so good. Clark Bartram as Batman would probably be the best. But that does not say much. At first glance, he's good, and then you realize that he is who he is, a bodybuilder who is a tolerable actor. But the main problem is that Batman does not belong to the light of day, he looks like a weirdo running in a bat suit. Instead of a horribly scarred man trying to fix the mistakes made in the past. Daylight also reveals the annoying dorky scowl on Bartram's face, which never leave and are unsuitable for the game Batman: Dead End, probably because of the darkness of the short, so desirable in this trailer. Bartram seems to think that he is overcast and stubbornly shakes his head, he is acting, he is not, he is just the opposite. This is called posing, something that real actors avoid like a plague. <br /> <br /> Something I never understood why Collor was throwing bodybuilders as leaders. It makes a lot more sense to hand over the role to an actor who can deal with it instead of a bodybuilder who can deal with it, but HE HE IS LOOKING AS WELL AS A COMIC! Of course, they could do better if Collory's dialouge did not leave much to be desired. <br /> <br /> The whole trailer (yes, the trailer will not be a full-length movie) is more focused around Superman then Batman. But everything on Superman's side is trivial, bland and amateur. Michael O'Hearn (Superman) is one of the worst actors I've ever seen. He stands around, smiles and speaks. That's it. Although I'm not surprised because he's just a bodybuilder they hired and probably got some acting lessons. Once again I speak to Collory, I am casting ACTORS. Not bodybuilders. Actors will be much more convincing that we will forgive that they do not look exactly like a comic. <br /> <br /> The outfit is what you can expect from Superman. Regarding the Batman suit. Well, I think it looks good only in the dark. I say this because in some shots the suit looks like something you can buy at the Halloween gift shop. <br /> <br /> Superman flies in this movie. But this is not a good thing. These arrows look particularly amateur. This and many of the whole "movie" looks like it was filmed in their yard using a VHS camera. And the last shot of Two-Face and Batman at the very end. For those who have seen the trailer. You know what I mean. If only he could drag this shot through the entire trailer. <br /> <br /> I finally ask. Why, if you're trying to show your directing skills, would you make your trailer a short movie? This does not prove anything when it comes to being a real history of the director's service. My only advice to Collory is that there is a difference between the ability to tell a story and the ability to work in marketing. <br /> <br /> Batman: Dead End did not feel like an amateur. I do not know where it went wrong.
