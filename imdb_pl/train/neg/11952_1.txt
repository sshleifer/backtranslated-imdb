His first film, after the death of a longtime friend John Belushi, Aykroyd shows a lot of fatigue, trying to pull away the figure that would be instant for Belushi. <br /> <br /> Instead, "Doctor Detroit" gives us a book professor Aykroyd, impersonating a strange, brutal pimp that will scares off a rival only known as Mama. It's quite bad, but it also has teaching classes, a school dinner for the host, four ladies of the evening to secure themselves and Pimpa dinner (or something like that) to take part. No wonder Aykroyd seems stunned most of the time. Why should the viewer be alone? <br /> <br /> It was in this movie that Aykroyd met his future wife, Donna Dixon. At least some good came out of this chaotic mess. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars. You want a good Aykroyd, see "The Blues Brothers". You want to go bad, see "Doctor Detroit."
