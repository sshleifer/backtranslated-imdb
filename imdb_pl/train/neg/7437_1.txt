This movie is simply not worth the time or money. Full of stereotypes and story that does not make sense! I can not believe that so many people gave this horrible movie 10. I guess they are the puppeteers of the filmmaker. <br /> <br /> If I could give this movie a zero, I would do it. It is a pity that IMDb does not allow it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I watched him because I went with a friend who really wanted to see him. What is sad is that I have never had great expectations related to this film, and yet I felt a little changed. Take my word, do not waste your $ 8 on this piece of rubbish. The only entertainment I got out of the movie was joking about the name of the directors. All in all, I DO NOT RECOMMEND!
