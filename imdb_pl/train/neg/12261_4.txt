Standard dish "painting by numbers", filled with many routine feature devices from films with large creatures. It is as if someone had a deck of cards with fictional ideas from other films written on them that were shuffled and distributed. Any plot lines and characters appearing in the contract were then thrown into the script. <br /> <br /> Characters are so insane that you can play the game "Guess who will end up as a monster monster" after less than ten minutes in the movie and probably get everyone right - including the order that they will be devoured. Many characters are so unbearable that you have eradicated them to close them. Some of the main characters are: Billy Idol clone, who surfs with sharks, a loud brat who flashes banknotes, Cpt. Ahab with vendetta and Ahab's girl who is doing dingy dances at the bar. Oh, and a great big beast that needs anger management therapy. <br /> <br /> Along the way, people argue a lot, nice girls run with wet shirts, couples look around exotic beaches, bursts appear temple ruins and fall into them with greasy face pirates. <br /> <br /> Mostly funny, but one thing disturbed me: the audacity of the heroes when other people were killed. After one violent fall, they make one-way jokes. I could almost hear pictures of the hoop. <br /> <br /> Generally, OK, if you have 90 minutes to lose and you want to laugh at such a bad-good-movie. Otherwise, you can skip this one.
