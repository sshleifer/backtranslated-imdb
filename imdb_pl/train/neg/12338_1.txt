I saw this movie originally in the theater when I was 10 years old. Even in this age, "humor" was slightly offensive to my teenage intelligence. <br /> <br /> In the past, when I saw Ed Begley Jr. or jeff Goldblum, I would have crumpled and felt very uncomfortable and even a little sad. Until I remembered the existence of this movie today, I was not sure why I felt this way. Apparently, I blocked the memory of this film, but my negative feelings about the two perpetrators remained. Apparently, I forgot that I saw this movie, but I subconsciously mourned the stolen pieces of my soul, not EATEN by the creators of this inhuman work. <br /> <br /> I was not brave enough to try to see him as an adult. I imagine that as part of the healing process I should probably look at the confrontation with this childhood fear, so that I can really * put it behind me. Some regressive therapies and / or hypnosis may not be a bad idea either.
