Of all the movies (and I'm a movie graduate, if it's worth something to you), it's the WORST movie I've ever seen. I know that there are probably some worse ones that I have not seen yet, but I've seen it and it's the worst. A friend and I rented him one night because Denise Richards was on the cover. Talk about being young and delayed. She is invaluable! Her role was unbelievably small! How did she do it on the cover !? IMDb does not even mention it in his filmography. This movie was so bad that when we returned it, we wrote a small note to the video shop and put it in a suitcase. He read something like "please spare your next clients before having to watch this complete and completely bad movie!"
