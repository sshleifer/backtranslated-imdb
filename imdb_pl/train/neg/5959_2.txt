Spoiler. <br /> <br /> What three words guarantee you a horrible movie? Cheap Canadian production. BRAIN perfectly matches these words. A horrible scenario, idiotic acting and funny special effects make it a must for every BAD football fan. Horror is funny. The post-production team seems to have given up. What makes THE BRAIN admirable in the second half is really trying to be good! Will a little ingenuity and consistency save what is already a joke? <br /> <br /> It's around Christmas. Mother and daughter are murdered by one of the funniest villains. A day later, a rebellious teenager gets in trouble that he is sent for a psychiatric analysis. <br /> <br /> If the policeman's head is cut off, and a stranger with blood and a damn ax told you, some of the children did it, who would you believe? What begins as a ridiculous becomes boring and exhausting towards the end when the BRAIN tries to be serious. A child can not be afraid of terrifying moments. THE BRAIN is too fun to try and be raw. The Institute of Psychological Research is larger than the main production plants! Our ugly villain and his cohorts get recognition for drawing out the worst acts I've ever seen. The discretion of the viewer was strongly recommended.
