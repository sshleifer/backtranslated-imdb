The word is pathetic. Bad acting, pathetic script, cheery dialogue and hip hop music and fashion ... what the hell was that with? The director of this movie works as bad as the movie he did. If someone devotes some time and effort to convert the whole thing, he may have a chance. I bet the studios are still trying to figure out how they can fuck so much. <br /> <br /> Absolutely the best thing about this movie was Stacey Dash ... the Asian chick was not that bad either. These too-girls were carrying the whole movie. If it were not for them, I would destroy my copy of the film. <br /> <br /> If any of those who have not seen it yet and had an idea, do not waste time ... later you will regret it.
