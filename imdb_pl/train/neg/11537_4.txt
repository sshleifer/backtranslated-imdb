For some time I have been following the progress of this film, so maybe I expected a little too much. I think that both Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer are good at what they do and are interested in what Dan Reed can think of, but unfortunately it just did not work for me. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the film does not really seem to understand which genre it enters, and as such does not impress the elements of drama, horror and thriller, because instead of focusing on one of them and do it right, it's a bit of a jackpot for all transactions and no master. <br /> <br /> The premise (as in the case of the majority of revenge films) is simple, the couple meet and go out, something bad happens and the revenge is simple, and many directors have been expert over the years. Unfortunately, in this case Dan Reed thought: "It would be great to do one of those revenge movies that goes a little deeper, showing a more human side to all characters and delving into their mental state in more detail. .. "Wrong! There are also a few key elements missing, in this type of film there is generally a warning." Do not do this or an element that increases tension can happen, but nothing is happening. It just happens and then nothing happens happens for an hour, then something interesting happens, and then it ends. <br /> <br /> In this genre there are a lot of really stiff professions, and Dan Reed hats for the test, I have no problem with his directorial skills, but in terms of writing ... I would say next time you should stick to the formula for the type of film you are doing, instead of trying to be too clever and will have a high quality movie on your hand.
