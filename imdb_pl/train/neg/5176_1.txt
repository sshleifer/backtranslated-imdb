When the film is independent and not judged, such as Hamiltons, I expected that the norm would not end, cut violence in my heart. I know good movies do not always contain blood and violence, but I've read the reviews, visited the website, and even convinced some of my friends to pay $ 9.50 to see this awful movie with me. When there is a festival called Horrorfest, I expect a horror movie, not Dawsons Creek with an incestuous tone. My expectations were very low for this film, but the small expectations of the movie were shot to hell when I saw that it was an hour before we saw the first drop of blood from a finger. There were too many holes in the story and left too much imagination. I wish I had seen Happy Feet. I think there could have been more violence and gore in this movie than in Hamiltons!
