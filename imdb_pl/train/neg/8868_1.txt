Absolutely one of the worst movies I have ever seen! Acting, dialogue, manuscript, sound, lighting, plot line. Actually, I can not say anything about it, although I like Swedish films. The battle scenes are so absurd that you can not take them seriously. And when the main character just loses his shirt, avoiding crutches in the strip club, I'm not sure if it's a joke, does anyone really think it's the ingredients of a good movie ?! Regina Lund is the only semi-originating actress, but she disappears in a flood of funny pronunciation and incredible reactions. It scares you that someone has really spent time and money on something like that ...
