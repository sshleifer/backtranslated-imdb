A film about dealing with problems related to growing up and being true to yourself, Blue Juice is a sweet tooth for those who like surfing and Cornwall. Sean Pertwee is the real star of the movie, while the more well-known Catherine Zeta Jones plays his girlfriend, and Ewan Mcgregor plays his drug-addicted buddy. <br /> <br /> For those who do not like surfing or Cornwall in the slightest, you'll find that it's been a long time before the movie suggests it's interesting. The beginning is slow and spends too much time on long shots only slightly interesting landscapes. Plus too many main heroes lead to the fact that most of them are one-dimensional. The plot is an interesting idea, but because of the shallow characters you have no idea why they work in the situations in which they are. <br /> <br /> Only the characters of Ewan, Sean and Catherine make the video worth the attention of the video tape, which is why it was released only on the video tape in the US after Ewan and Catherine achieved the main fame.
