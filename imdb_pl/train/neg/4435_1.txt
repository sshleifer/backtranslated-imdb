Gods, I have not watched a movie so horribly for a long time. Maybe not from "The New Guy" or various films by Freddie Prinze Jr. Yes, it's amazingly awful. Mira Sorvino's empty and wooden play must have been inspired by Freddie. The staging of the film was uncomfortable (like playing, and this feeling of closing does NOT work well on the film). The actors had no idea what they were doing, especially Sorvino. Her accent was terrible, and her sex appeal did not exist here, so it was painful to see how she "seduces" other characters and "falls" on it. And what about the occasional shots of a live audience on the sun loungers? Senseless! I had to turn off the DVD player, end up with this pain.
