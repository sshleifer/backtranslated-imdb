This movie stinks! You will need two plus the time needed to go through it. Sliding Doors, w / Gwyenth Paltrow and director Peter Howit, did what Melinda and Melinda are trying to do much MUCH better. This movie was smart, witty and well made. I took care of what happened to both Gwyenths - or rather to the characters she played - and the performances of the supporting cast were fantastic. <br /> <br /> Where Melinda and Melinda are tiring, dialogue is made up and I could have depended less on any of them - least of all Melinda. One Melinda is so dysfunctional - her first glass of wine is at 10 am - and so melodramatic is ridiculous, not in a comedic sense. Second Melinda is alright but forgotten. <br /> <br /> Previous films by Woody Allen worked because I guess that he spent time on the screenplay and the actors were talented. One of the curiosities for this movie is that he wrote the script in two months: you can say. And although Chloe Sevigny is talented - those around her are not, it is not enough to be the whole presence. The film ends with the fact that he is Chloe Sevigny and a group of other people who you know you've seen in other movies, but you do not quite remember which ones. <br /> <br /> Sad, very sad.
