- A couple of newlyweds enter the home of the deceased husband's ex-wife. Soon the new wife begins to have the impression that someone does not want her at home. He sees skulls in the whole house. But when a husband examines, he can not find anything. Does anyone try to take her to the asylum she has just been discharged from? Or does the ghost of a dead wife try to get a new wife out of the house? <br /> <br /> - This is the first time I watched The Screaming Skull without the help of the MST3K crew. And most likely it will be the last time I watch it this way. Can you say boring? I'm not just boring - I say watching the grass becomes blunt. There are great episodes of the film in which nothing happens. The screen could be empty and I would get so much entertainment out of it. The heroes are constantly talking with the most monotonous conversations you can imagine. Screaming Skull could probably be sold as a sleeping helper. <br /> <br /> - Actors do not help much. Most of them provide lines with the conviction usually reserved for a class at school. I did not check it, but I would be shocked when I found out that anyone who was associated with this movie ever appeared in the film value. I do not even go into the script with which the actors have to work. Let's say that characters get one of the most idiotic lines ever spoken in the movie. <br /> <br /> - You have been warned! Or avoid it at all costs, or at least search for the MST3K version.
