I give 3 stars only for beautiful pictures of Africa. The rest were ... quite boring. For about 50 minutes we have a plot outline ... In the world war the introductory part lasted about 10 minutes? Then there was real action! This is something like: "Let's go to the savannah and let's sip on the beautiful sunsets!". And he can provide a message, eg "Do not kill elephants!". Very ecological. I would expect this to be from the "new" Steven Segal movie, not from this ... The main actress makes me think about artificial tanning, dyed hair and too much foundation! And I did not see one scene in which her hair is collapsed, or she is sweating, or her clothes are dusty. It just does not look like a woman from the 19th century! And at the bar, where they're looking for our hero, Swayze comments on the commander that he looks like Dracula. Hmmm, Bram Stoker wrote his book and published it in 1896 and became famous in the following years. Livingstone and other explorers went to Central Africa in 1840-1880. So if the action does not take place in 1896-1900. Houston we have a problem. :) Swayze makes a nice impression .. as a pill - hard outside, but soft and cozy inside. Not that I would cuddle with a nut, but you understand. He really manages that this beaten puppy looks at his face several times. The movie stunk. Too long and more and more boring. do not watch it! Do not buy it! It's a waste of money!
