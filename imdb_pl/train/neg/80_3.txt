I must say that I am really surprised by the high ratings of this film. I think this is absolutely idiotic. Does the mother get "visions" when she touches certain things or people? And one thing she touched twice, she made her vision last ... It seemed so funny. Pfieffer's Deedee performance was awful, I thought. She was very annoying. The girl who played Lori did a good job and most of the staff supporting what they had to work with. <br /> <br /> I usually love LMN and I am very open when it comes to movies, but this movie seemed to me to have an absurd plot, and above it acting and it was not for me.
