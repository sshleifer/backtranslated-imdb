... but a bad movie. As Maltin says, it was an attempt to make a serious horror by Christopher Lee. Well, it's serious ... TOO SERIOUS! The plot is stupid and slow (something about old people inhabiting the bodies of young children to achieve immortality) ... the movie is everything speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking talking about the same things over and over. I've been napping a few times! The movie is sooooo boring! Lunatic lunatics with the exception of Peter Cushing and Lee ... but it was probably a job of love for both (they often complained about the fact that horror films are too violent ... well, there is no violence!). Avoid at all costs ... unless you have insomnia ... it will put you to sleep!
