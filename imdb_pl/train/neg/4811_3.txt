I watched a Canadian video tape from the movie as "The Witching," which somehow reached New York. The sound was quite bad, I had to pick it up to about 7/8 to hear it, and the soundtrack often overwhelmed the dialog. Orson Welles was a scum, worse than usual, and some of his dialogues and others ran through the echo chamber. The ghastly character who still appears has a distorted voice. Some closed subtitles would really help! <br /> <br /> A group of witches or satanists (end credits say that the group was not supposed to represent any real group!) They have a ritual in which they become naked and cause a miscarriage by stabbing with a doll. The woman who miscarried and her husband move to a city called "Lilith", where he was offered a job at a toy factory. Despite one of the trumps of this film, which apparently is "Fabryka zabawek", we never see it, and we talk about it from time to time. <br /> <br /> On her way to Lilith, her husband is impatient with her questions about what his new boss, Mr. Cato, wanted to know about their religious persuasion. He drives aggressively and causes another car to get out of the way and blow himself up. After the arrival of the police, he takes the doll, which fell out of the car, the second of many hand-made dolls in the film. <br /> <br /> It turns out that Mr. Cato and all the townspeople are witches and that they are the ones who caused her miscarriage, although he does not realize it. They want her because she has an innate talent for necromancy that she was not really aware of. <br /> <br /> Some of the images in the movie have some impact, but overall the movie is not too addictive. The film seems a bit cluttered, and this is undoubtedly largely due to its re-editing and the addition of new material. The original version, according to the final subtitles, was called Necromancy - A Life for a Life. DVD magic may allow us to see both versions on one disk, but re-release of this movie is probably not a priority.
