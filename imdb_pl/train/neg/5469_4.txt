This movie may have poor production values, but it also makes it so good. The special effects are glaring and well made. My favorite part of the movie was Chrissy played by Janelle Brady. It is super hot and has a good naked scene. Robert Prichard as a gang leader is hilarious, as are other members. This movie tries to convince you by saying that nuclear waste is bad. 4/10 Honest comedy, gross movie.
