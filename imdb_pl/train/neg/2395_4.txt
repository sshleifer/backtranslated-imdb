Could it be the same director as "Do not Look Now" or "Bad Timing"? SÅ‚abo <br /> <br /> worked, meticulously edited. Just compare different accident scenarios with similar scenes in Do not Look Now to see how much Roeg lost his <br /> <br /> touch. <br /> <br /> Even generally reliable Teresa Russell (nowadays looking thick, I'm afraid to report) can not save it. The plot is purely pseudoreligious hokum, acting is wooden, and Roeg's attempts at his characteristic dislocation of time are pathetic. <br /> <br /> Avoid this as a plague.
