Most of the movies that I can sit around freely, even if I do not like the movie. I am the type of person who recognizes great movies, even if I do not like this genre. This is the first movie I could not watch. Cat in the Hat is the worst movie I've ever seen - I've seen a lot of movies. Acting is all right (Myers is good as a cat, it's just REALLY annoying). The silly songs that the cat sings were boring and monotonous, even for children in the audience. The plot is continuing, and viewers must suffer from bad dialogue. "Witty" parental remarks are disgusting, not funny (I remember some horrible comment about a garden hoe compared to, well, the type of person that people call "ho"). Although the film is really short, it seemed to last forever. Do not waste your time. I know little children who hated this movie. If children can not stand it, I do not know how every adult can do it. I would like to talk more about this film, but I do not even want to waste more time writing this review on this subject. I HAT THIS! In conclusion, do not spend 90 minutes of your life watching this! See a GOOD movie! <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars - the lowest review I've ever released.
