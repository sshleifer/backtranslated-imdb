Thinking about the discovery that the main character "Bubble" comes to the end of the movie, I remembered the last years of "Machinist" with Christian Bale. The only difference between these two films is the literal physical weight of the character. <br /> <br /> A modest but completely realistic representation of life in a small city. The title is a reason to contemplate. Perhaps we, the audience, are the ones in "BÄ…belek" because we do not receive any awards in films with a short duration of 90 minutes. The reactions of the audience were often satisfied with themselves and judging, clearly showing how detached people can see the threads of humanity in forms so foreign to themselves. These characters are those people call those who introduced George W. for a second term. <br /> <br /> Sober is to consider how the reality of television has ruined our sense of reality when we watch the audience leaping feet to leave as soon as the role of loans. This film has its advantages and deserves attention for things that it does not speak explicitly.
