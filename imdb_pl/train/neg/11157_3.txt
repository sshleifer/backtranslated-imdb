Hi p. Erotyczny. Bad sexy ... whatever. This is "Terminator" with werewolves. <br /> <br /> No, seriously. The policeman rescues a girl (waitress!) In front of the big monster and defines himself as his "guardian". The main actor, Ryan Alosio, copes quite well with the imitation of Kyle Reese ... there is a massacre at the police station ... a bad guy is muscular with red eyes ... and even has a dialogue like "You said it yourself he will never stop. The tragic scenario comes from the first screenwriter who, thank God, has not sold anything since then, and all of this has been combined by the famous evil director Richard Friedman. <br /> <br /> The film opens in the bar (always a good sign) and a malicious cyclist goes in for no apparent reason, chased by three cops. One of them is black and (terrifying shock!) He is killed in the first five minutes. The film goes down for the next hour, and then raises some with decent sequences of actions before rounding it all out with a fatal ending. <br /> <br /> Most casts meet as competent actors doing what they can, with a bad script and director who is ready to settle for less. If nothing else, it seems, they do not learn to play in this film, and Alosio, along with some accompanying casts, shows signs of talent. DarkWolf in his human form is played by Gargantuan Kane Hodder - known from the numerous performances of Jason Vorhees in the films "Friday the 13th". It's decent enough, especially considering he's not used to talking roles. <br /> <br /> It has become famous among groups of horny teenage boys on the stage on the lesbian roof between Andrea Bogart and Sasha Williams, who gets her set several times in the great tradition of former actresses "Power Rangers." And it is disturbingly clear that the editor spent WAY too much time on this stage ... the main advantage is that the physical effects of the werewolf are rather good and the wolf's appearance is not bad at all. But CGI is bad. Just bad. I mean, seriously, if you can not achieve a certain level of realism - why bother? Just put some money into makeup! In addition to the scary script, this movie has its moments, many of which are involuntarily fun. It's good for laughter if you do not have anything better to do, but do not spend any money on it. Please.
