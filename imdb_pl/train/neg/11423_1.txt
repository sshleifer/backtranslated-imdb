What happened during the creation of this movie to end up as a total mess? Just a year after The Breakfast Club, a brilliant film with many of the same actors as in "St. Elmo's Fire "(which by the way looked and acted in the latter more, as if they were still mismatched high school students from the old but without a hug or discipline in presenting their roles. <br /> <br /> Was it directing or writing, because it was it's the same person (Joel Schumacher), it must be both. The Phantom of the Opera, "Phone Booth", "A Time to Kill" and two Batman movies, "Batman and Robin" and "Batman Forever" that have a good good for perfect directing, there is no genius, no comedy worth anything and it is far from what is really valuable in life. <br /> <br /> Example: Wendy's character (a rich little girl with a heart to do well and help the less fortunate one played by Mare Winningham) reveals to Billy (the unruly waiter who cheats on his wife and his friends, drinks too much and there is no sense in the life properly played by Rob Lowe) that he is still a virgin. Billy really sees the challenge and possible conquest, but Wendy is "not ready". Wendy, she is not really ready, it's hard to believe she is in this group of friends. Later, when Billy, whose wife left him, took his child and married another, he somehow pulled some strings of his life behind him. Billy travels to New York, leaving and abandoning all parental responsibility for her daughter, convinces Wendy that her virginity will be an ideal "departure" for her. And Wendy, who works as a social worker helping broken families, it seems that this despot is not graded at all. Give me a break. The only thing he can give only once, gives a loser who leaves his family and friends? Schumacher describes this scene as a wonderful and moving moment. <br /> <br /> There are many other examples where there is a total discrepancy between what is real and the value thrown overboard, and the acts are supposed to look like virtues. br /> <br /> I suppose that some may say that "it was the 80's", but I remember that in the 1980s, people began to be responsible for children who had been born in a marriage or out. /> <br /> I think this movie is so bad because it is not synchronized with what is really valuable and right. <br /> <br /> When it comes to technique (not history), it was awful, okay. It is fragmented and looks like a 3-hour movie that has been edited for 1 hour and 40 minutes. Transitions and jumps in time just do not make sense. Pick up what's on the editor's floor, put it back in, and the movie would probably flow much better ... but it's still a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe Schumacher has become a better and stronger director since 1986 (he had to have), or maybe he was over his head when it came to writing a screenplay for St Elmo's Fire, and maybe this group of actors took over the stage and went your own way - I really think it happened.
