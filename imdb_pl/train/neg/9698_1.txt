There are now many talented filmmakers / actors in Germany. None of them is associated with this "movie". <br /> <br /> Why do producers in the world really invest money in something like that? You could have made 10 good movies with the budget of this trash! It is not fun when seven adult men run like dwarfs, pretending they are funny. The funny thing is that the producer of the film (who is the oldest guy in the group) plays THE SMALLEST DRAGON. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of moments that shout for subtitles saying "You should laugh now! ". It's hard to believe that shit is supposed to be a comedy. <br /> <br /> Many people got up and walked out of the cinema 30 minutes into the movie. I should have done the same, instead of wasting my time ... <br /> <br /> Pain!
