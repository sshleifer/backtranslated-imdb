OK, the movie is good, but I give it 1 because the idea that a computer virus will become an organic virus is a pure fairy tale. This kind of nonsense adds to these paranoid illusions of morons that a computer virus is exactly like an organic virus. First of all, code strings and tens 1 and 0 are the sum of computer viruses. The organic virus is much more complex, even if it is much smaller. Although it is considered one of the simplest forms in the universe, the organic virus attaches itself to the cells and joins the RNA, and then changes its own RNA code. Explain to me how this can be processed from the monitor? Maybe radiation has some effect on the user's cornea, which turns the eyeballs into these viruses? I saw it, but of course the writer did not think about it.
