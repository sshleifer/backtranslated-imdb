I saw this movie at the Toronto film festival with fairly solid expectations. the film has a great cast and closes at the festival, so it must be good, right? how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> I knew we were in trouble when the director talked about directing the episode of wiseguy to meet an unknown actor named Kevin Spacey (director / writer wiseguy who was doing his function debut = blah) ... the director / screenwriter Edison must have some incriminating pictures of kevin who kills the homeless because I can not see how he (along with other actors in the movie) would agree to this misfortune. <br /> <br /> this movie is absolutely scary! it's a mix of every cop who's always been cooked. there is nothing new in Edison. the acting was bad, and the direction was even worse. it looked like the aforementioned wiseguy episode. it was the best casted direct video I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> some examples of bad moments in Edison ... Morgan Freeman dances around his apartment for no reason to rock and roll music ... Justin timberlake gets creative criticism from his belle while his apartment is surrounded by candlelight ... llcoolj running a fiery bird ... three guys shot in the head ... <br /> <br /> this movie is the opposite of good. <br /> <br /> LEFT FROM EDISON!
