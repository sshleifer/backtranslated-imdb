This is another production from north-east Florida, filmed mainly around Fernandina Beach and Kingsley Plantation. I was rather surprised that the company was able to take the main street of Fernandina Beach as long as it was necessary to achieve street scenes. The film is nice and very bad. Tami Erin is sweet but is abusing. Eileen Brennan takes over even more. Good for young children or for those who love fluff in high doses. 4 from the Miller-Movies formula.
