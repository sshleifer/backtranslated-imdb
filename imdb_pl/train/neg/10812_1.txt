What a pathetic movie. <br /> <br /> I will not waste time commenting. I'm still trying to regain the few hours I've wasted on it. <br /> <br /> Let me just leave it - Shaq does not have BUSINESS as an actor or singer. He is completely devoid of talent in both plans. It is a pity that much more talented people are wasting their time in social theaters and karaoke bars, while Shaq uses his name as a basketball player to undeservably throw in films and cut out records. the film was pathetic, without the talent of Shaq.
