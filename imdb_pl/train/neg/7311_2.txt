Okay, I did not hear much about this movie, so when he appeared on television on television, I wanted to watch it, being a lover of horror. I think I can do a collective "huh?" For anyone who has watched it. <br /> <br /> I decided to go to my life, but at the party with my closest friends we saw that coming, and some of us have already seen that we can laugh our way through it, we both announce "this is the stupidest thing that I've ever seen. " It was not terrible; I give it to Roth (who I consider a young burglar); characters change throughout the film, ala "Cube". <br /> <br /> HOWEVER, despite the typical scenario of "rats in a cage" - who turns on, who, etc., it was quite an average horror movie. <br /> <br /> Several points: 1.) What was with this kid? I do not even say that it is strange and biting. I'm talking about the whole "slow kicking of karate", what was it? 2.) Ok, I know that the Rider's character liked Jordan Ladd, but as a young woman I was scared that he just went ahead and molested her during sleep. It's illegal. <br /> <br /> 3.) Roth was in the movie so that Roth could be in the movie. Talk about meaningless writing! 4.) What was with the deputy? 5.) So the dog was immediately pulled down by the dog? And little blood left? Just a piece of her jeans? Anyway, WE WERE our butts and I love to laugh during the horrors (Return of the Living Dead 2, Evil Dead), but I do not know if we were going to laugh here ...
