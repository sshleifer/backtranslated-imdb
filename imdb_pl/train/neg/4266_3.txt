Certainly NOMAD has some of the best riding scenes, fencing and beautiful landscape photos that you will most likely see, but that does not make the film good. It helps, but history must x-ray these things. And that's where Nomad wanders. <br /> <br /> The story is tense, giving the feeling that it has just been combined to create a "cool" movie that "looks" great. Not to mention that many of the main characters do not come from the region in which this story takes place (and this is obvious when it comes to names like Lee and Hernandez). If the filmmakers want to get us into a culture like Jugars and Kazaks, let the actors / actresses have fun looking part of it. <br /> <br /> Fighting tribes, prophecy, brotherly love and respect, Interest in the love that separates our "heroes" is touched, but with such a small impact and time on the screen that most viewers will push them aside for the next sequence of battles, the next horseback riding action or the breathtaking beauty of the landscape. <br /> <br /> It is worth mentioning that during the filming a few significant changes were introduced in Nomad, specifically the director and the operator. Ivan Passer (director) was replaced by Sergei Bodrov, and Ueli Steiger (cinematographer) was replaced by Dan Laustsen. In one respect, Laustsen seems to have a better eye because his visions of the land have made the final cut we see here. Definitely good. However, going to Bodrov as a director was not the smartest choice. From what I see here, I focus on battles, not on the people I sense, come from Bodrov's eyes, not from the eyes of Passer. True travesty. <br /> <br /> The most disgraceful aspect is that it could have been a truly fantastic movie, focused on both character and action. Unfortunately, supervisors apparently decided that the action was what they needed and took a cheap (intellectually speaking) way out. <br /> <br /> Although I can not give this film a positive rating, it's worth seeing it simply for amazing cinematographic work. But that's all.
