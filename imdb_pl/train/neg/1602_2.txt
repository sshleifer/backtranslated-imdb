Anyone who thinks that this film was not appreciated for his comical genius, he had to smoke with two stoners in the film. This film is not underrated ... it's a bad movie. <br /> <br /> There should be no comparisons between this film and a naked gun or plane, because the last two films are well-written and fun. A class meeting is none of these things. The sad thing is that he had such potential (good cast, good stories), but good jokes are few. Scenes that were supposed to be funny were more annoying than funny. Stoners, vampire, blind girl ... NOT FUNNY. The only funny character was Delores (the one who sold his soul to the devil). <br /> <br /> National Lampoon has made really good films (Animal House, Vacation), but this is not one of them. I certainly expected more from John Hughes.
