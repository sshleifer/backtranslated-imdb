I really have no idea why some people consider the Power Rangers TV program to be quite interesting. The costumes are completely absurd, and the people playing in them also look completely stupid. The subject of commandos is quite interesting. It is simply a more expensive TV commercial designed to sell extremely bad plastic garbage for unsuspecting children around the world. From my notes, I see that he has been banned in the country of New Zealand and from what I have seen, I can agree with their decision. Avoid this show at all costs, it's terrible and funny.
