This ambitious film suffers most from the delusions of the writer and director Paul Thomas Anderson. Highly derived from much better material ("Nashville" Altman, "Net" Lumeta), this clumsy elephant takes too long to get to nowhere. A few erroneous detours along the way (embarrassing musical interlude, biblical scourge) does not help. There is also an uneven level of performance. Particularly bad: William H. Macy, whose character and story could be easily eliminated; Julianne Moore, for her unconvincing anxiety. And how many times do we have to see the sad bag of John C. Reilly ("Chicago" and "Hours" enough)? Tom Cruise falls out well by comparison? his misogynistic, hideous Saint Roller was rather amusing. Speaking of a foul mouth, the script was so charged with "F" bombs that they quickly lost their influence. Do not even talk about this awful soundtrack, full of bland and irritating vocals from Aimee Mann. Her prolonged version of "One", a maudlin number for the beginning, led me to distract me at the beginning of the movie. I should have listened to the writing on the wall and saved myself another three hours, after which I was pushed to the edge of hell. One of the possibilities of redemption, which I have not mentioned in other reviews, is the best performance in this group, by the unknown Melora Walters in the role of Claudia, a damaged devil coke, prone to self-destruction. Her credibility definitely surpassed all the others. This film took too seriously and simply did not know when to finish it.
