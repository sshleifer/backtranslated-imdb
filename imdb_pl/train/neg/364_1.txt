Larry Buchanan. Yes, the same guy who did "Attack of the Eye Creatures" and two (count: TWO) conspirational films about Marilyn Monroe. He is guilty, here. <br /> <br /> Adding to the ever-growing pile of folders from "Eh-Ig-out-of-out" Oliver Stone's conspiracy drawer, here's "Down On Us" (ie "Beyond the Doors") which is a working definition of historical inaccuracy. <br /> <br /> Forget everything you knew about Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison, says Big Lar, because it is Yes, the three big names in the 1960s were MANUFACTURED BY THE GOVERNMENT because they were subversive or counterproductive to Truth, Justice and the American Way, or in this way. <br /> <br /> In any case, three people (Chatman, Meryl, Wolf) who look amazing like their real shadows of life (that is, if you close your eyes completely, turn your back and walk away five miles from them) show that instead of recorded deaths, the old, good US A gets on them! Yes it's true! <br /> <br /> Man, I can not believe I watched this movie. the etching of throwing a point is preposterous; acting makes TV commercials look like dramas, and if you honestly watch them to the end, you deserve a "twist" ending. You really do it; I swear. Genius. <br /> <br /> But just like a man said: "Rock and roll is dead - long live rock and roll." <br /> <br /> However, not this movie. <br /> <br /> There are no stars for "Down on Us". And by the way, viewers of the movie describe this film ....
