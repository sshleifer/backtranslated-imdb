I've completely forgot about this movie so far. It was the most glaring and the worst attempt to demonize the hobbies I have ever seen. It looked like: "Do teenagers do not use their imagination, they can take games seriously, go crazy and hurt people." I can only guess that the unimaginable writers of this work thought that D & D style games are a form of evil ritual or secret worship.
