If you want to watch a real "quality" movie, get The Eden Formula. This wonderful movie must cost $ 50. It contains a thin wafer script, pitifully bad sets, lighting and camera work, as well as a cutscene, a paper monster that is completely funny (it looks like he used a guy in a rubber suit and / or a monster's puppet glove - but they were all just as horrible ). <br /> <br /> All actors speak their lines as if they have never seen them before and read the teleprompter. Special effects are ridiculous. The only sad thing is that they abandoned the really cool original title "Tyranasaurus Wrecks", which sums up exactly what you get for a full 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> This is what happens when you scrape the underside of the bottom of the barrel so hard that you break into the crud which lies underneath. <br /> <br /> I loved every minute.
