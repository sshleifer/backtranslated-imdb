A messy staged, thoughtless comedy that supposedly false "classic" movies from the "alien invasion" of the 1950s, but is not really better than them, except of course in the purely technical department (good makeup effects). And any falsehood that is worse than the target is doomed to failure ("Casino Royale", "Our Man Flint" is worse than almost any movie by James Bond). After two hours listening to screeching alien voices, you'll be begging for peace and quiet. (* 1/2)
