It's a fascinating horrible movie. It makes so little sense that it begins to create a strange inner logic. Well, it would be so if he did not jump out of the side streets, until he finally shook under the weight of his own indecision. The film can not decide if it is a quick move. "Man turns into a monster" (like all IN IN MAN MAN films from 1950 "IN INDUSTRIAL insert"), or a ghostly movie about business conspiracy theory or mystical history contact after death, or ... or what? Choose yours. It's just a mess. Grotesquely over the top and shooting in all directions, leaving loose ends fluttering all over the place. It looked as if Tobe Hooper was taking David Lynch's pills. Unfortunately, he did not take enough.
