BE WARRANTED. This movie is such a mess. It's a disaster. Do not waste time on this. I warned you! <br /> <br /> Acting, history, dialogue, music ... basically everything is so exaggerated that it is absolutely irritating and funny. It made me want to quit (if dialogue / acting / history does not do it, everyone is curly). You will feel that you are watching a comedy. The problem is that parts that are supposedly funny are not even funny. Acting, story, photos, you can feel that everything just tries WAAAAY too much - but it never works. Virtually every shot is skewed, but so what ?! This movie is simply a student movie. No wonder they filmed it in HD, because it would be a waste to spend more money on filming. <br /> <br /> If you have fun or you like acting poorly, writing, editing, directing, full of clich√©s, everything that is forced on your face, oh, did I mention weak acting? (Well, it's not all the actor's fault - it's a director!), so I think you'll like this movie. <br /> <br /> I had to watch it during classes. If I could, I would turn it off immediately. If you still can not say that, I hated the movie. I wanted to quit and get my time back ... at least I did not have to pay for this trash. <br /> <br /> Jeff Goldblum, you know ... a guy from Jurassic Park / Independence Day is in this movie, but since then he's definitely dropped - taking roles for movies like this catastrophe.
