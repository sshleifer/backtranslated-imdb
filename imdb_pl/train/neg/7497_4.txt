After watching the trailer of the movie and finding out that Spike Lee is directing, I was excited to hear about this event. I did not live then, I did not live in New York, so I was expecting something more than a history lesson. I got an interesting acting act, a lot of sex and about 30 minutes of film that had something to do with Son Sam. I think the movie was not about Son Sam, but it was a glimpse of the summer of '77. Mark me with disappointment. <br /> <br />
