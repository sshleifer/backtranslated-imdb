Film school academics can salivate with what they want, about the important (imagined) meaning of the film, but it's only: intellectual drooling. This film is creatively bankrupt, and some mistake is endless indulgence as a substance. Yes. <br /> <br /> Of course, Godard was not a Stones fan. It's a pity, because it could be great. It captures the birth of this timeless song and chooses instead to cover the music with some guy reading a book from "The Real Detective" or some kind of shit. <br /> <br /> Then there are endless shots of what looks like a 60-year-old librarian spraying people's cars. And then there is a seemingly endless "interview" in which the actress was superbly instructed to answer only yes or no to all really deep and intellectual questions. In a purple suit is some guy reading more nonsense from the book, which lasts about 20 minutes. And black panthers or something on the scrap yard. <br /> <br /> It sounds almost intriguing? Well, it is not. <br /> <br /> But for unwashed hipsters filmmakers who do not care about squatting about the lost opportunities to get full access to Stones that bring Sympathy for the Devil to the world and prefer to hear some English guy read instead looking at covers of naked magicians, this movie he is a real winner! <br /> <br /> More precisely ... maybe Godard just blows.
