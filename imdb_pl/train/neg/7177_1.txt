Because I loved the original "Caligula", despite all its disadvantages, I must say that this remake trailer was fatal. <br /> <br /> Listening to Jovovich in a lazy American accent "Mmm cuhligyooluh ..." I feel sick. The set does not look Roman at all ... it looks like a Hollywood court of a rich actor, and Roman costumes look like cheap shits you buy in a suburban costume shop. <br /> <br /> This "cute" Adrian Asti looks like a fifty-year-old Spanish woman completely terrified with her mind, as if she did not know it was a movie trailer. <br /> <br /> Acting must be one of the worst I've ever seen, with most lines I hear being random actors screaming "CALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!" as loud and unpleasantly annoying as they can. <br /> <br /> Random sex scenes are also filled with a good 40 or 50% teaser, and scenes with notable actors / actors, such as Gerard Butler (who grabs the screen in the shadows for three and a half seconds) doing nothing, but looking uncomfortable or doing everything with minimal lines, simply pulling it down with the absurdity of their delivery. <br /> <br /> Courtney Love's part is that it looks like her usual, squat egg, which is leaning against the door, mumbling something about the moon or something. You can not say because she is either drunk or tall or just mumbling idiotically. <br /> <br /> Karen Black is just annoying ... he randomly laughs and shouts in a way that annoys you. <br /> <br /> Helen Mirren ... she was in the original, and her return to "Caligula" consists of ... "CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Especially "I love" (and through love, I mean hatred) the Enni line, "Caligola ... it does not make me * something inconsistent * .... * something that sounds like it" *. It was also insanely arrogant to say four Caligula that the year of rule was greater than the birth and death of Jesus. <br /> <br /> To be honest, it must be the worst, most exploiting, self-sufficient arrogant piece of nonsense marked as "art" that I have ever seen. Even if Gore Vidal hated the original Caligula, he should not show up or give his name to that shit stack, no matter how much they paid him (unless it was a billion trillion yen). Worst trailer ever.
