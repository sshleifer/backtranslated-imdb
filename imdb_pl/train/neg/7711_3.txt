The heart of the movie was in the right place, no matter where his brain was. <br /> <br /> "Attack" is basically a parody of "Aircraft!" (two years before the fact - nice.) about what happens when they attack vegetables or fruits, in this case fruits. <br /> <br /> Throughout the magic of film (stop motion, tomato papier-mache on skateboards, reverse filming, people watching off-screen tomatoes, throwing tomatoes into the basketball for actors on the screen), tomatoes actually attack everyone in their leafy grasp . <br /> <br /> Then, it's Mason Dixon (Miller) and a group of spies that I would not like from any government, save this day. Of course, there is a nosy reporter (Taylor) who appears in the worst of times, dances and sings army soldiers, Japanese scientists with dubbed voices, some parachuting man and a samurai sword ... and yes, San Diego Chicken, before he made it big . <br /> <br /> These gags are not that great. In fact, you'll probably get better after watching them. Some dialogues are extremely bad ("Please give me ketchup" - there is nothing to say before the tomatoes.) And when it comes to "Love of maturation" goes ... well, I can not blame tomatoes for shrinking when I hear it. <br /> <br /> What's so good about it? Well, I liked the theme song and the initial subtitles, and the screen was a scene with four people at once, which was quite well made. ... that's it. <br /> <br /> Three stars. Not a comedy "Killer", but trying. <br /> <br /> Rock on, Peace.
