They can only be described as horrible. It's bad to start, and then it's worse. When you start, you really have to watch it because you can not believe it can get worse - but do not be afraid because it is. Another badly written script for the donkey director who has no talent for old movie stars. It's hard to decide if the script is worse than acting or if the direction is worse than both. As for the hero - well, he suits everyone, including one scene where real daylight beats from the tough guy, opening the wardrobe door and hitting him against the window. And in another scene, he is thrown out of the window and smashes 20 feet into the concrete - he does not even blink - then immediately gets up and falls into the bad. It's really a ridiculous movie. Fortunately, the cost of the job only cost me $ 1.
