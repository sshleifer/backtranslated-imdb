You know Jason, you know Freddy and you know Leatherface. Now, get ready for: Killer Security Tacks! That's right, in Killer Workout, a stupid movie, if I ever saw him, an invisible killer sends her (or her?) Victim with an oversized, innovative safety pin. This is a strange choice, certainly one that deserves to be clarified. Of course, the movie does not even try to explain where the killer has acquired such a thing. <br /> <br /> As the title suggests, the aerobics gym is under siege by a crazy killer and everyone is suspect. In fact, the movie gives so little clues about the identity of the killer that almost everyone in the movie is a potential murderer until they are killed. And because almost everyone, but the killer is dead, it's really just a process of elimination. <br /> <br /> Oddly, while the entire cast of the name is killed, aerobic classes are going on for good. In fact, nothing can stop the dance. While three men are murdered in the next room, the training continues. Death is not even a factor; one character dies, but is still visible in later training sessions. Director David Prior knew what he was doing when he called Killer Workout, not Logical Workout. Like a woman caught in a solarium, I felt very uncomfortable at the end of the Killer training. Finally, fortunately, END flashed on the screen. What happened next? You have it, shots of women exercising. Even the end of the movie can not stop them! <br /> <br />
