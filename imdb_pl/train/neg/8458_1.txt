I bought this movie last weekend at my local Film Gallery. I bought 2 I got 2 for free and I needed one more, so I chose this one. A terrible mistake. The box sounds like it's a really good movie. Well, it starts like it's a great movie. That means about 5 minutes. The film tells the story of a young woman, Laili, who is killed, trying to save her bull, Jack, from the bull. Laila's father, Cordobes, is a rancher who is afraid of the city's inhabitants. He assumes that Jack killed Laila because she supposedly was afraid of the bull, and goes hunting to find him. It was the first 5 minutes that are good. What will happen next will be only 100 times worse. Whoever wrote the script, in my opinion, must have been in some kind of sour expedition or something, because nothing else had any sense what ever. Jack is on the run and finds this traveling DJ named Mary, who gives him a ride. I think Mary is to be the type of Mary's virgin. You know, mother of Jesus. But who knows, I could not do it with my heads or tails. When they run ... we see bad guys, magical visions, ghostly meetings, flashbacks, etc ... And all these things are done in such a way that your brain hurts from trying to figure out what's going on. Needless to say, I took the movie and exchanged it for something else. It's awful, I tell you, terrible. In this movie there is absolutely no bullfight. Unless you count the first minute of the movie. I hope that I have helped other people not to waste time on this film.
