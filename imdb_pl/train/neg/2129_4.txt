In my humble opinion, this version of the wonderful musical BDWY has only two things: Tyne Daly and the fact that the version with the original script is now being filmed. (OK, Vanessa Williams is good to watch.) But that's all for me. Most of the actors seem to be going through the show - Chynna Phillips has no idea who Kim really is, and it's no wonder people are following Harry McAfee when he plays George Wendt, who looks as if he'd rather go back to Boston's bar stool. Jason Alexander is passable, but this wig has to go away and I've seen a better dance in Bugsy Malone. As I mentioned, it's good now to have a script version, but I hope that young people who have never seen a musical do NOT judge them all.
