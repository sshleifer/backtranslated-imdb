WELL. A good movie if it comes from the original script. BUT IT DOES NOT! <br /> <br /> Which part of "there are no women in this story, except Foulata and Gagool", introduced by Haggard, did not understand producers, directors and writers? I mean, it's quite simple English. I understood it at the age of 10! The beauty of KSM lies in the fact that it contains a spectacular description of three different worlds, colonial Africa, a merciless desert, and Kukuanaland, a hidden and isolated kingdom. This should be enough for even the most average producers to be able to work. But, nooo, they have to throw in a "romance". Pathetic. A suggestion for all the poor souls who really thought it would be close to the book. Let it go. Until Peter Jackson appears and "does it well", you may as well read the book. BTW, there is a sequel book (actually a pre-quel) called Allan's wife. It gives the background to Quatermain's history. It is a bit scary, but good.
