This picture reminds me of a photo of Keneth More from 1957, titled "Admirable Crighton", while on the boat he was a servant, and on the island he became a master and after he was saved he returned to the servant. Madonna did OK in some movies, but this If there's any picture on which Madonna can not act, that's one thing. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if it was a subtle copy of "The Admirable Crighton", but I definitely like it, and if it is, then Hollywood has to run out of ideas and it's sad to ensure platform for actors to improve their career profile and the fact that it fails in every corner and details. <br /> <br /> The plot is loose, and acting is mediocre. The scenario should be moved to the shredder before taking it back. While many here have kept Madoon for all of her activities, I think that in movies such as "A League of Their Own" was Pretty good and nice, and "Who's That Girl" showed the quirkiness of the Madonna style, which was not shown before or after. Other Madonna's films are not so nice and I would like to see a series of Madonna's animations with the character from "Who's That Girl". I like the music from these two films, but "Swept away" remains at the bottom of the stack and it stays like this. <br /> <br /> they all have a bomb?
