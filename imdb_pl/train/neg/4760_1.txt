This transformation of Anthony Shaffer's classic game did not last long in cinemas. Recently suffering from the cable, I still congratulate myself that I did not waste money on the ticket. Director Kenneth Branagh, writer Harold Pinter and star / producer Jude Law have fooled themselves that their prestige alone can sustain this parody for endless 93 minutes, without the fun and class of the longer original. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine strengthened his reputation playing a second role in the wonderful film from 1972. Now it seems that he intends to destroy it, trying to lead, played in this version by Laurence Olivier. (Both were nominated for Best Actor Oscar, but lost to Marlon Brando in THE GODFATHER.) Looking swollen and washed, Caine slides through the part with less depth than he shows as a Batman butler. He had already dropped to a hospitable performance in the cruel remake of GET CARTER. What next - ALFIE II, or THE MAN'S SON, WHO WOULD BE A KING? <br /> <br /> But nobody benefits from this brazen adaptation of Pinter, who thinks that frequent curses and an additional sexual angle can compensate for the lack of Shaffer's brilliant game. Branagh's direction is based on bluish lighting and soulless scenery that would not survive in the secondary nightclub. Neither shadows nor tight, exaggerated close-ups can help the law to defeat his boring screen. The result is a defeat both as a dramatic drama and as a detective thriller, almost obliterating the goal behind the title. <br /> <br /> Fans of the original stage production (with Anthony Quayle and Keith Baxter) and Olivier / It would be good if Cain's film saw this venture as a bad dream. The late Lord Shaffer, who wrote the script from 1972, as well as Hitchcock's FRENZY and a few adaptations of Agatha Christie, must turn in his grave, regretting that he can not plan a real murder!
