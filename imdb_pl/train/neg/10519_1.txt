I've seen a lot of movies and I rarely rated "1", but this movie was terrifying. <br /> <br /> Acting was terrible, the plot was ridiculous, the effects were unrealistic and the characters were annoying. Usually, when I watch scary movies, I think it's DUMB when the heroes hear noise at home / the forest / school / etc, And then they shout, "hi, is anyone there?" - but at least they are credible when they do. This movie could not even be right. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will do other B-horror films, such as Venom and The Fog, I look like award-winning masterpiece academies. <br /> <br /> I always have an open mind while watching movies and I can only say that this movie was a total waste of time and I am writing this comment so that anyone who thinks about watching this movie will think again. IT'S TERRIBLE!
