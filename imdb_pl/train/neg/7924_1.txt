Film Ted V. Mikelsa Corpse Grinders 2 is 103 minutes of incredible cinematic swill. The plot is a mix of senseless business transactions between people who have a dead body in cat food, while aliens who lose the war with dog aliens want to get some of this cat food. Watching this movie, I began to look for all sorts of distractions, everything to make sure that I was doing something other than losing my mind from the inside. <br /> <br /> Several scenes take too long, as the heroes do simple things. I heard that Mr. Mikels does not like to use jump cuts too often, fearing that they will confuse the audience. I'm not sure if this attitude is "avant-garde" or simply "stupid". Try as much as I could, I could not bring myself to worry about any character in an unnecessarily huge cast, with the exception of any old people who are the caretakers of the factory. Most of the cast is a group of non-talented fans who do not even bother to learn the lyrics for "Amazing Grace" before they have to sing in the camera. Although perhaps the sound quality is poor, because I only heard about 80% of the dialogue when I watched the DVD. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst movie ever made. I listened to the fragments of the comment, and Mr. Mikels is a surprisingly sweet old man, what the hell was he doing doing this kind of rubbish? I would like to hear explanations from old people who had to lie down without a shirt on a metal belt conveyor, waiting for grounding. Movies that I hate for a long time suddenly seem a lot better. I miss the inevitable music of Excalibur and the consistent lighting of Dawn of the Dead. I have to do something, whatever. Do not watch this movie.
