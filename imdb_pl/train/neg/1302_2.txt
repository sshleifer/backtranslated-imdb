This movie is like any other Dutch movie, so if you like movies like turks fruit and de kleine blonde dood. then you can be fine with it (even if the two have much better stories and actors) Zomerhitte starts hard enough, but even this one good scene has nothing to do with the story. There are a lot of nudity (but me and the others just could not find this girl attractive), the dialog is funny (because we did a lot of other movie observers), and some scenes are so completely random that it is more unintentional comedy than any other ( like a random scene in which an owl tears someone's eye ... it has nothing to do with anything and is only mentioned once in the saying "did you hear what happened ... I was there"). The only reason I gave him 2, is that some of the places where they look nice ... that's all, the reason I saw it because we went over to the preview (here in the Netherlands we have a strange system about sneaky previews, you pay less money than a regular movie and you do not know what movie is that you'll only know it's a new movie that's not in theaters yet. My advice is to stay away from the movie if you really want to esz see a good Dutch movie watch temmink or zwartboek.
