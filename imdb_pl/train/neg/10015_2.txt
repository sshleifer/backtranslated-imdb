Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow is a typical teenager from the 1950s in the film of confusion. This is not a movie about horror movies or science fiction. The story is about a group of teenagers who will soon be kicked out of their hot rod club because they can not cover the rent. After being fired, they decide to try the old haunted house. The only saving for the movie is that the "ghost" (Paul Blaisdell in the costume of She Creature) turns out to be a non-working film monster played by Blaisdell.
