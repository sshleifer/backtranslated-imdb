It was all that was not: it had pace, pop and actors who were not afraid of chewing the scenery. He also had a decent script. He told me to scratch my head. If Farrah is not really "serious" in a career, why is he (and why is he wasting his time)? If Kate and Barney are "artists", why are they signing up for "The Mother of All Jiggle Shows" (like the movie "Brady Bunch" in which Robert Reed wants to make Shakespeare, just to be on BB)? They were not industry names, but they were not hungry either. And although they had a good story (the poster was released before Farrah got the show), Silverman rejected the positions for "Funniest home movies" and "American idol" and Spelling, promising his girlfriend Tori one day that he would create a show for her one day. <br /> <br /> It worried me how the role of spelling is distorted. He is shown as a runner and creator when he was not. And when he "appears" with the "idea" on the CA, he's funny! <br /> <br /> How did Spelling and Goldberg allow the execution of an oral contract for Farrah when others were signed? And why did not Farrah or Bernstein tell them that she was leaving not because she discovered her Inner Diva, but because Majors wanted her to do it? Therefore, when trying to create conflict and tension, setting Farrah as a "bad girl" (like Suzanne Somers), it fails because the preparatory work has never been completed - this was the place to take off the "Company of Three".
