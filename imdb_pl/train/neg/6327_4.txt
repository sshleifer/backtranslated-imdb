I thought that this movie would be much better than it was. It sounded like a parody of a spy generator, and the beginning reminded me of Pleasantvil, but this movie was short. <br /> <br /> The plot is simply ridiculous. The KGB and the Soviet Union in Russia set up a spy school to teach their spies how to act like the Americans, but the city they were formed in is somewhat outdated, so they grab two US peaks to spice things up. I do not know, but it seems to me that it is there. It's getting really strange when a Russian city is talking about a Russian accent alongside everyone. Somebody screwed up in the casting. <br /> <br /> Also in the case of comedy, it is painfully dry. There are one, two funny tops and they are nothing to sing and dance. The film will probably eventually fall asleep. <br /> <br /> And as a twisted blow to the face, this movie is so pro-US that it hurts me. The film constantly repeats that the US is God and Russia is the devil. This is a smear campaign that was carried out against the Japanese during the Second World War. Such films make everyone think that the US is full of themselves. <br /> <br /> It gets 4 out of 10, and I'm nice. It really should be like that, but the dance scene was fun, but then it dragged on for a long time to make it really funny.
