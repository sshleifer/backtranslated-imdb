I almost burst into tears watching this movie. Not with laughter, but with the memories of Rodney Dangerfield's great movie. Candyshack was his first and stole the movie, Easy Money had it at its best, and Back To School is definitely a classic masterpiece of the 80s. Then there was Biedronka and then she began to show. Poor Rodney was getting old (Meet Wally Sparks was a little taller than Biedronka, but he did not say much). <br /> <br /> In My 5 Wives Rodney, Monte plays a name (which he must love because it was his name in Easy Money) a rich (not always) guy who loves women and marries like nothing. Well, now he inherits a huge piece of land, and since the land was managed by the Amish, he inherited 5 Wives. It sounds like a great idea for the Dangerfield movie. The problem is EVERYTHING. The scenario is so bad that Rodney seems to say his pictures to the camera, and all the side characters have nothing to do. The film looks like it was filmed on a movie with some really weak stunt sequences, which of course are not Rodney. Andrew Dice Clay plays a gangster who looks like he's dying to say the word "F" (which should be because the movie is rated R, but it plays as if it were PG), and Jerry Stiller has a nice 2-minute scene. Do not get me wrong, sometimes I laugh at Rodney's few jokes, but the poor man gets too old and too slow. We see his jokes coming from miles. And the film becomes too PC, which thanks to horrible nineties, seventies and eighties Rodney is no longer working.
