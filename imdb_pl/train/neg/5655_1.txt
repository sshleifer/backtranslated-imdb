Egyptian films have many films with a high level of drama or romance or comedy or action Even sports ... "Ziab la Ta'Kohl AL lam" was banned in Egypt because it contains content nudity (Full Frontal Female Nudity) And This Kind Nudity is forbidden in Egyptian films ... When I saw the movies that I felt ... Fool Story ... Nude Actress ... Bad action ... Some horrors and horrible colors .. Dear friend ... If you want to see a great Egyptian movie ... Simply: stay in the form of "Ziab la Ta'Kohl AL lam" .. We have great films in Egypt ... We have great actors who have won global victories like: Omar El Sheriff or Gameel Rateb .. We have great directors such as " Yousef Shahin "So Believe Me Pall .. You do not need to watch this movie ..
