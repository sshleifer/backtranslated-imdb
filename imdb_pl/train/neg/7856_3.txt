This movie is sucked. I'm in the army, and the soldiers portrayed in this movie are horrible. If you're in the Army and see this movie, you'll laugh and be upset with the whole movie because of the way they acted as a team. It was funny. They acted like a group of normal people with army uniforms, not knowing what to do. It was quite a bloody movie that I have to say at least. There were several scenes in which they try to jump you. I recommend seeing it if you are bored and want to see a brutal, bloody movie. It will be a better movie if you are not in the army. I must also say that I liked the first one better than this one.
