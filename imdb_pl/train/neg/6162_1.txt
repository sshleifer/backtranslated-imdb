"Smokey And The Bandit" was not exactly Shakespeare, but then nobody wanted it like that. It was a lowdown slapstick, but he had brains. He had a very intelligent script with definable characters and fun packaging. The theater people were smiling. "Hooper" does not provide this. There is no reason to smile. If it's to be a tribute to the Hollywood stuntman, it makes them look awfully lazy, providing only poorly directed battle scenes and one of the most unconvincing car jumps I've ever seen. Everything looks fake, ill-made almost deliberately. Poor Sally Field (as a girl who breaks her hands off the beaten track) has her weakest role, there is no funny or wise line ("If you do, I will not be here when you come back"). Burt Reynolds is still looking at the camera and winks, but the joke is on every audience who sits by the "Hooper". * with ****
