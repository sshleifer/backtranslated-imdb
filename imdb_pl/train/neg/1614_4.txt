The second half of Steven Soderbergh's revolutionary biography about Che Guevara concerns his recent campaign to export the revolution to Bolivia. To keep Che-Soderbergh's holy vision of jumping frogs with massive executions, which he presided after the revolution in Cuba and the madness of his adventure in Congo ("This is a story of failure" he writes in the introduction to his Diary of the Congo)) concentrate fully on Chea's attempt to gather support for an uprising against the government in Bolivia. It would be a disaster and the final act of Guevara. <br /> <br /> What is plaguing the first chapter goes in the same direction as Soderbergh slows down his film to explore the blissful face of contemplative Guevara, who re-plays like James Dean in East of Eden by Bernicio Del Toro. The problem is that Guevara has little success in getting converts and soon discovers that he and his hungry companions are absorbed in the heart of the darkness of the Bolivian Jungle. Unlike Werner Herzog in the wonderful Aguirre, God's Wrath, Soderbergh does not use the metaphorical possibilities of the jungle to increase the desperation of the partisans. He seems to be more interested in keeping nimbus over his head than examining panic on dead ends. There is one moment of Herzogian in which Che sits straddling a stubborn horse, kicking and shouting to move, but Soderbergh's overall scene remains flat, slovenly and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> In both of his films, Soderbergh shows that he is clearly Che's group and that is why his attention remains short-sighted and narrow. He spends too much time building the Che monument and not enough to develop relationships with key players in his saga, especially Fidel Castro. What's worse, he does it with a slow and dispassionate approach that never burns. One might think that he was immersed in enough Eisenstein and Vertov to realize that wide changes are shown much better in a wide style.
