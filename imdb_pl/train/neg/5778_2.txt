Okay, so I'm dying to see this movie. Stunned about "who's who" in the land of horrors that are in the movie ... well, my friend hired it, brought it and we started watching it. It's supposed to be a comedy ... I have not even smiled ONE, up to 40 min. <br /> <br /> Is it related to the budget? In fact, there are no movies that cost CLOSURE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, and they are amazing (and so for me). In addition, while watching this movie, I could not help but realized the similarities (ie STEALING) to the low-budget independent film entitled "ACTRESS APOCALYPSE", read my review on this subject (DOWNLOADS this film BTW). > <br /> This movie ... had the potential that he really had. He had the "power of the stars", the stolen story (allows to film the backstage of making a movie ... IE ... "UPDATING APOCALYPSE" ... seriously, it upsets me, the more I think about it), ... it could really be fun. MUCH, a lot of jokes are falling. Acting is okay for what it is. But it dragged on, it was not fun, and the plot was stolen. <br /> <br /> I gave it two, because there was no SOOO AWFUL, but this is THE ONLY reason.
