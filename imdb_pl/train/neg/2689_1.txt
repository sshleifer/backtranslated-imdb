Now I'm not a film critic, but I really hated the "11th of September". This movie was generally bad. With the exception of the Alejandro González Iñárritu segment, which was the most effective and direct in the subject, short films were boring at best, and in the worst offensive. The worst in my mind was the pretentious segment of Youssef Chahine, in which he compared Palestinian suicide bombers to American soldiers, even going to suggest that suicide bombers fought for a bigger matter. The segment was completely excluded from the subject and, given the apparent lack of decency of Chahine, was a waste of time and patience. The idea of ​​getting eleven different directors from different countries to make a film showing their views on the tragedy was good on paper, but in practice it was tasteless.
