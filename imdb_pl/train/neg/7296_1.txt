Columbo films have been falling for years, this year they could reach the bottom. Peter Falk gives the same unsatisfied performance and comes so horribly in this movie. As usual in this series, the protocols from the crime scene are unparalleled, so there is always a lack of credibility. Brenda Vaccaro chews the set design and draws pantomime faces, and Andrew Stephens is a completely unconvincing man. (His weakness was however hoot!) The script was by numbers and its patronizing delivery. We should never bring Columbo until the nineties, they left us all with one or two happy memories of clever threads, better scenarios and sharp characteristics.
