This movie is a farce! Names are grossly misspelled, and the plot is twisted and turned into something unrecognizable by every enthusiast of literature. And they have bile to give Beowulf an absurd gun weapon / crossbow. Beowulf does not need such a weapon! In the poem, Grendel's hands are torn off with bare hands! And I can not believe that the scriptwriters did something like that. The way Grendel is portrayed, however, is impressive. This and the cast are the only positive sides of this feature. My English teacher would be crazy if she saw this abomination. If you're not an avid fan of the epic poem "Beowulf," avoid this movie at all costs. And even then I would not recommend it.
