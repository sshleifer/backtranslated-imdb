Jean Seberg did not have a single acting talent. Like all her films, "Bonjour tristesse" does not suffer from her appearance at all (although she is probably the first of these modern women whom Tom Wolfe happily describes as "boys with breasts": columnists, of course, use the word "gamine" "), But he suffers heavily from Seberg's dull, monotonous, deadly voice. In all her films, when she had to play in anger, Seberg played it with a clearly audible, distracting, breathy gasping between her monotonously suppressed verbalizations. Oy. <br /> <br /> The adaptation of the plot by Françoise Sagan with the breathtaking, fancy soap opera by Franciszek Sagan is notable only because of its lush cinematography - but then it is difficult to funk on the photogenic French Riviera, or maybe for its accuracy, but certainly not a breakthrough, the use of black and white for today's scenes, from which the monotonous narrative of Seberg provides us with a flashing past. <br /> <br /> Juliette Gréco has a brief moment, as a chanteuse of the nightclub in a black and white spotlight, delivering in the smoky voice of Dietrichesque the gloomy existentialist lyrics of the title song. This moment is now, in retrospect, something more than a small drôle. Except, of course, if you are a Frenchman - especially if you are a French "68-year-old" missing the magnificent barricade days at the Sorbonne roundabout - and your children are rebelling to preserve the lasting sacraments that have destroyed and erased the economy of France: you still believe in Sartre and Foucault and all such secret, irrelevant theoreticians. <br /> <br /> David Niven has the most difficult role, he must play with enough enthusiasm an aging hedonist who will not understand this life yet. t all about Sagan's teenagers about hip, cool, swingin ', "mon copain!" Bye Bye. Deborah Kerr provides her usual, extremely professional presence, convincingly playing a woman who suffers undeservedly the envious envy of teenage Sealla with a furious nose (filling Sagan's shallow fantasies with a classic theme "can only be one Queen Bee in a hive"); in fact, Kerry is the only great and unforgettable moment on the screen. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is unnatural - I agree with an earlier reviewer who said that it sounds "badly translated" from French; combine unnatural scripts with Seberg's incomparably dull, unbearable monotony, and you can save Valium for another night. At the top of it all, the clumsy post-production voice dubbing is almost all the time obvious, and so much more than touchy: this is especially about dubbing for Mylène Demongeot, because it spoils her very nice silly blonde. <br /> <br /> Hunky Geoffrey Horne has a short end here - a very handsome young man who also suffers from a not too charming, dull voice, which in combination with the Seberg drone gives unconvincing scenes of puppy love. (Horne was, say, just enough in "Bridge On the River Kwai", perhaps because his end was stopped by those great cinema professionals William Holden and Jack Hawkins, than not supported by the unfortunate Seberg). <Br /> <br /> In conclusion, "Bonjour tristesse" is nice, but it is shallow, unripe soap: thin gruel with suds.
