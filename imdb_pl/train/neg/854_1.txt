Ladies and gentlemen, do not be fooled by the film label "A Stanley Kubrick". This is a very bad movie, which unfortunately has been hailed as one of the most deadly horrors ever made. Films about horrors should create such a fear that at night people should tremble from the bottom of their hearts, thinking of a real horror movie. There is no real horror in Shining, but what we find instead is simply a naive, stupid attempt to create a horrifying horror movie. they are if they differ from reality. All that is good in the film is the view of the ice valley. The hotel, where most of the actors were put together, also seems good. The word about actors Jack Nicholson looks like a lost, lazy soul who is never sure what he should do. There is not much to say about the bald, colorful actor who, most of the time, is busy spoiling the child actor. You do not have to blame the tragedy for bad weather. This can not be avoided because the film was filmed and poor Kubrick is dead to make any changes.
