This is another of many B minus movies marked as a noir movie in the hope of arousing interest in something that is devoid of it. All aspects of the film - screenplay, acting, directing - are average. The operation of the three leads is wooden. My guess is that John Dall was to go to the film industry, but then someone realized he had little talent and that's why he ended up working on television. Lee J Cobb, who is usually great, can not rise above a bad script and bad direction. Jane Wyatt is supposed to be femme fatale, but nowhere is able to convince viewers. The movie has two strangest cars I've ever seen. The one in which John Dall goes after Lee J Cobb is particularly strange. DVD transfer is typical for Alpha.
