There is only one word for this movie. Frightening. The director clearly has talent, but like his character Robert Carmichael, he throws it all away. <br /> <br /> Carmichael has potential, but like Cray, he can not care. Getting caught up in a minor crime and then going into depravity is a vision of the British youth of Craya. Like the British tabloids, this film presents young people without aspiration and respect. Cray is calling for attention, but he does not deserve anyone. <br /> <br /> I was terrified of the act of violence that Cray decided to throw into the faces of the audience. He assumes that the audience does not know global atrocities. Like a piece of obscene graffiti on the toilet wall, it shows us the masculine depravity with youthful joy. <br /> <br /> Some actors have small parts in this movie. Danny Dyer and Leslie Manville are brief. Acting is differently amateur, young men Joe and Ben are doing behind the scenes. Carmichael played by Daniel Spencer is terrifying. Miranda Wilson plays Monika, the attractive wife of the famous chef Jonathan (Michael Howe); the way she could have tried this test is unbelievable. The film is never subtle, and Monica is treated by the most disinterested violence, which is interrupted by warfare. War images are used to express the idea that young men can not resist that acts of violence will appear even in "civilized" countries. This is certainly true and is symptomatic of our changed society, in which men are becoming less and less important, but Cray goes down to the level of barbaric men he tries to reveal through the use of such brutal and brutal images. Female characters in the film do not give relief. They are either victims, or in the case of Manville, a washed-out mother. The community is represented as dysfunctional. <br /> <br /> This is the first Craya movie. I listened to what he had to say during the Q & A session at Edinburugh, and he is not unintelligent, he simply lacks experience, and his film exposes his naivety. The film is to be released later this year, but I hope that the company will get into trouble because the audience really does not need this kind of mixed up materials.
