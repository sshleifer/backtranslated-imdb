I must admit that I burst out laughing when I saw that one reviewer compared it to LOTR. Well, if you rule dwarves, cast thousands, great special effects, great battles, strong characteristics, decent story, good acting, classic direction and everything else. What leaves you with walking. And boy, does this movie do walks! If Mr. Piano had his way, it would have been an uninterrupted three-hour hike in the Wisconsin countryside, but every forty minutes the unbearable Martians pop in for a few seconds to stop him from moving on to the next trip. You've never seen so much going on in a movie. If it really had a budget of 20 million dollars, most had to go to Mr. Piano's shoes because he had to beat many couples with all the walking. This explains why there is no money for decent results, a decent video camera or the right actors. Honestly, it's like watching a bizarre fetish video for people with something like going for long walks in period costumes. Even with fast scrolling it is a looonnnggg walk. <br /> <br /> As for the sci-fi material, I think it was a mistake to put the Martians in the movie: they only interfere with walking, which is definitely more interesting to the director than history. <br /> <br /> I wonder how much Mr. Piano accuses you of going with dogs?
