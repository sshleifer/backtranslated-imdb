A great example of how Hollywood could (and still can) take the masterpiece of literary fiction and stupidly incite it. <br /> <br /> In the case of "Big Sky" writer Dudley Nichols and the company arrogantly assumed that he could improve the classic pioneer novel of the author of the award-winning Pulitzer, AB Guthrie. In so doing, they removed the soul of the story and any advantage and influence it could have as an adaptation of the film. <br /> <br /> The epic nature of Guthrie's book and the evolution of its main character, Boone Caudill, from a naive Kentucky boy to a hardened and competent survivor / highlander, has been replaced by a reduced river farce that does not really resemble the author's intentions. In the film version, Boone's presence is nothing but disappointment. <br /> <br /> The intriguing and even shocking elements of the plot that give Guthrie's innovative influence and excitement have been removed for no apparent reason. The most striking thing is that the emphasis is on Zeba Calloway, who was a random, small character in the book, dealing only a handful of pages. On the other hand, a very important and fascinating character, Dick Summers, a veteran pioneer, is completely missing! It is also clear that director Hawks decided that Zeb's character in the film, played by actor Hunnicutta, was not annoying enough. So Zeb / Hunnicutt has spent a lot of time doing this unpleasant, narrative narrative, which is a Hollywood acronym for incompetent writing, editing and directing. <br /> <br /> Some movies have actually improved the books they were based on (a great example is William Wyler's "Ben-Hur"). But it is horrible and depressing not only as an adaptation of the novel, but as a film for yourself. <br /> <br /> The story is boring and banal, and the characters - at least those that have not been written in the script - are simply shallow and boring shadows of the literary vision of Guthrie. And, unfortunately, the appeal of Kirk Douglas, who could help raise this film, was sunk by the role of the milktoast he received. <br /> <br /> If you can believe it, the film version of Pulitzer Prize-winning Guthrie, the sequel to "The Way West" in which Kirk performed, is even worse. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, "The Big Sky" strengthens the place of Howard Hawks as one of the most overrated, warm directors in the history of cinema.
