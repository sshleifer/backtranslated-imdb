Wow and I thought every Steven Segal movie was bad. Every time I thought the movie could not get worse, it turned out that I was wrong. The story was good, but the actors could not do it. They also made many mistakes regarding the correctness of archaeological excavations. For example, you do not support artifacts until they are cathodized and cleared. The greatest crime in the casting was the archiologist's girlfriend. She is a weak actress and I felt that her acting really made the movie less realistic than it was. The whole concept of Templars knights who were underground all these years seemed quite stupid to me. I like the idea of ​​how they disappeared and those that seemed depressing. I thought that the characters did not explain themselves well enough. You did not find too much background and it made it difficult to refer to them.
