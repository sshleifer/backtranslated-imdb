I think I agree that many comments here must be false. Even if the film is not necessarily bad, definitely below average. "Dark Remains" is basically a Ghost Movie with the premise that your ghosts and bad emotions haunt you. The film starts with two stories loosely connected with each other, which even later are not related to each other. The couple loses the child who was found cut into the bed. They move to a country house to escape the past and guess what ... the house is haunted. From that moment Dark Remains starts very slowly with some terrible moments (the first appearances of ghosts are nice, and the sequence of flashlights also worked very well). OK, so ... The woman sees the ghost of her daughter, other ghosts of people died in accidents or suicides, the man tries to solve the mystery of houses of the past, the woman falls into depression, strange neighbors appear. Almost everything was there, but the assumption that it is their own emotions is nice, so you are waiting for the return of the action. There is nothing strange, you are just confused by the story of a haunted house, a strange neighbor, a completely senseless terrifying prison and a dead daughter thrown together with an idea for a photo that reminds me of many "Snapshots". The end is ridiculous because when you start and end a movie so slowly and with piano music, it's pretty bad to add some treasure of ghosts that look like zombies, of course, to return to slow stimulation and piano music. <br /> <br /> To make it short ... Dark Remains could have been a cool scary ghost story if the screenplay did not try to reach everywhere and did not get anywhere. sense and contradiction in the basic atmosphere of the film. Except ... please never use abandoned prisons again. It is so exhausted and in this case it does not even make sense. "Hey, there's a terrible prison up the hill, let's shoot there." I think that many ingredients in Dark Remains have been thrown into the mix this way.
