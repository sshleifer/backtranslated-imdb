"Dlaczego?" <br /> <br /> This simple question had to be on the lips of every New Yorker during the 12 months of terror that David Berkowitz created in 1976-77. The same word will certainly become the same embarrassing question 22 years later, when people leave the cinemas, exposing the trivial and exploitative "Summer of Sam". <br /> <br /> Director Spike Lee attempts to convince the story of the bandit with the errors of the bandits seeking a famous psychopath - who paralyzed New York for over a year - with a harsh and graphical representation of the killings, demons in Berkowitz's head and the frustration of fruitless NYPD hunting. It presents a team of wicked losers who hear their own barking dogs because they live without love, honor and humanity - not unlike Berkowitz. Lee looks at the audience in almost every cage, "none of us is what it seems." Often a critic of the white establishment, Lee preserves the stereotype, including the scene in which Mira Sorvino, playing bride and groom with her cheater husband (John Leguizamo), hopes to have oral sex with a black man "on the back of the great black Cadillac" Italian mafioso tells the black detective that the famous the hook from middle field Willie Maysa was "lucky." Lee makes sure even racist considerations of one of the black middle-aged women who declares: "I'm glad that white man kills all these white people, because if it was a black man killing all those white people - it would be the biggest riot race in the history of New York. "<br /> <br /> In addition to the outstanding photo opening the disco (reminiscent of the film" Goodfellas "by Martin Scorcese or" The Third Man of Orson Welles "), the film has no soul, purpose or passion, and characters depicted on the screen deprived of humanity Although we do not learn anything about the real victims of this horrible madness, it seems that Spike Lee says that the city of New York got what it deserved during this terrifying, boiling summer of over two decades ago. <br /> <br /> "How could anyone have wreaked such havoc on his beloved city? "How could someone show such hatred towards others?" <br /> <br /> Are these the right questions for Berkowitz or Lee? <br /> <br /> You decide.
