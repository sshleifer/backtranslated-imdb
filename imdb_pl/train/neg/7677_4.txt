I stopped watching the lost in this episode, because I thought that the death of Ana-Lucia and Libby was unnecessary and really depressing. Then I found out that they were holding Libby around to die in the next episode! Gah! I can not deal with it. <br /> <br /> I liked the show in the first season, but it definitely fell in the second season, thinking that Jack and Locke are not very religious. The death of Rodriguez and Watros was the last straw! <br /> <br /> I give this episode 4/10, because it was the end of my viewing of the previously great series created by Alias, the legend of J.J. Abrams. I hope that his series will improve in the future in this series.
