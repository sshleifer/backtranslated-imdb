This pretty formal sword and flying fist is a decent early talent show by John Woo. The photos are excellent, and some of the work with swords is really amazing. Unfortunately, the movie moves under the weight of boring history and grossly low budget (check some of the battle scenes if you doubt me). Nevertheless, it's worth seeing, especially if you can catch mailboxes.
