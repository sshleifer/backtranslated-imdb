Well, Jesus of Montreal is basically an intelligent movie. The actors are really good and the technical side of the movie is fine. But although I was very interested in the topic and I like to think and discuss religion (I am an atheist), it was difficult to force myself to watch a movie for bitter and in my opinion somehow unknowingly a funny end. Why is this movie so boring? I do not know. It just is and it is not recommended.
