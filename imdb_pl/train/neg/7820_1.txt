or: Is this a bird? Is this an airplane? No, look ... It's a catastrophe! or: There is no need to look at the sky. <br /> <br /> or: (... OK, that's enough.) If the singer tried to make a romantic titanic movie that would have destroyed the cash register, he failed. The SR structure can not do this, a dark and limited color scheme (I would call it "wishi-washi"), boring ordinary dialogues, clown with advanced alien technology, missing play and magic etc. They make the film completely disappointing. <br /> <br /> It just does not work. <br /> <br /> The main thing about characters like superman is that he is a superhero. This is the core, the most important thing. <br /> <br /> Trouble with love and sadly lost supersoft with depression can only be maximal in Superman movie at 2:40, not all the time. <br /> <br /> Because this is no longer a superman or superhero movie. It is like (and in this case, very bad and boring) social study, in which every 30 minutes a person. <br /> <br /> That's a big difference. <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke. Holy skywalker, this is Superman, so give us Supervillains, Superaction and the most important thing, Superfun. <br /> <br /> We want to have some fun! Singer, if you want to do a drama with a soul about love 2:40, a drama about lost and unfortunately people? Then take normal human figures and do remodeling. <br /> <br /> They say: Superman is coming back. And then the supersadlysoftie stands in the door. <br /> <br /> Maybe the singer tried to kill a legend without kryptonite, but one bad movie can not do it. Do not give up, plan a sequel ... <br /> <br /> Next time the singer (and Warner Brothers), will make a movie about superheroes, not a super-soap depression, or so be it. The movie about superheroes is a colorful fantasy with lots of fun and magic. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a cheap chocolate box with a super cover. Yes, there are technically different types, yes, there are a lot of small conversations, there are a few jokes, action scenes, etc. But the only common feature of all these inferior elements is their poor quality. <br /> <br /> It's not just a super boring patchwork and one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> A funny casting strategy (throw them as young as possible, so he can do sequels in the next 25 years) gives the rest. Kate Bosworth plays a 22-year-old reporter, he looks like 19. Superman was full five years ago, so he slept with her six years ago, so she was 16, (she looked like 13) and the daily reporter of the planet, shooting "I spend the night with superman ". Warner Brothers, that's too much. <br /> <br /> Routh is not so bad, he plays a bit wooden, but the whole movie is wooden, so ...?! The temporary good was flooded, and sometimes posey. Rest, forget about it. Even cosmic, it's not his area. <br /> <br /> Reeve / Hackman / Kidder behaved so easily, with fun. What a difference. <br /> <br /> Jesus puts at the end is funny too. What the hell should it be? The problem is that it means serious, not a joke. The next time Spiderman, Batman or Ironman will fall and rise like Jesus or angels? Or they talk directly to God. Why not ? They are superheroes saving lives every day. So at least one conversation with God should be possible every week ... Oh my God. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was not a real movie, instead it comes from a bizarre, boring parallel universe. <br /> <br /> For warner brothers, this superlame depressive film will probably be the biggest disaster in history. Not only because of money. <br /> <br /> I understand how difficult (perhaps) it was to create and transfer some messages or feelings, but showing people who are lonely, lost and unfortunately is not new and thousands of movies or TV programs did it better, in very old or new like magnolia. And the flying frogs were more impressive than the flying superwoman, sorry, superman of course. <br /> <br /> The singer and WB are just nothing. In fact, it is even more than nothing, it's like a black hole that destroys the passion for movies (comics / superheroes) and steals three hours of our lives. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Smilli's younger brother. (Very angry and green like a hull.)
