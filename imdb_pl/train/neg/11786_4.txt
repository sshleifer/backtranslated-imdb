The show had great episodes, it's not one of them. This is not a terrible episode, it's just hard to follow "The man who was death", "Through the whole house" and "Kick this cat, he really went away". <br /> <br /> about the couple who just married Peggy (Ammand Plummer) and Charles (Stephen Shellen). In the first five minutes you find out that Charles married Peggy for money. Two go on honeymoon and their car breaks down a dirt road and they must look for shelter in an old abandoned house. Charles soon discovers the secret of the Peggy family ... <br /> <br /> In my opinion you should watch this episode, but do not expect the same as the rest of the episodes in the first season.
