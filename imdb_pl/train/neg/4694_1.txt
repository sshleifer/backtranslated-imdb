I was interested in the title and description of Big Rig during the participation in the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, Texas. However, I wanted to get out of the armchairs as soon as Big Rig is over. Big Rig consists of several drivers of "large platforms" who set out to deliver goods in the United States. The heroes are great people, but the filmmakers never delve into their complexity as people. Instead, the story revolves around the way the maps in the movie are supposed to lead, but never. At most, we're lost. We - the audience - finish nowhere and, like the direction of the story, finish somewhere, but without direction, location or story. Why are we here? Where are we? How did we get here? The story is sloppy, and the intentions of directors to "humanize" a group of people they consider to be "overlooked" and "invisible" turn out to be unconscious and irritatingly condescending. The problem here lies in the perspective of directors, not truckers. The directors present their own naive assumptions about truck drivers, and then they simply edit the film to confirm these assumptions. In general, the story has no tension, the movie is completely too long (there should be a 15-minute sketch), there is no answer to the big question "So what" and the whole movie is one of the transparent propaganda that nothing could go on. " enlighten "(as the directors say) the outside world with great riggers.
