This film (together with Rinne) are small jewels among tribute photos on the tread, which have so far gone to horror films in 8FTDF "HorrorFest". And yes, it's really poor praise. Because in the film there is nothing worse than would-be authors who think that the atmosphere is a substitute for a coherent plot. <br /> <br /> And that's all you get at The Abandoned. It's a film that was made almost entirely in the director's head. Sure, it would be nice if he moved it to a movie, but it happened instead. This is a very nice movie with some real horror, but the last spinning wheel is only for the latte slurping of the cineaste crowd.
