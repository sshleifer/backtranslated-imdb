Well, Robin Hood is "geezer" okay ... just as advertised! It did not sound very promising and unfortunately it was worse than I suspected. Robinski Robin, which I can take; Robin, who interweaves with the daughter of a shepherd who I can include; but Robin, who mentions not very funny banter with his single henchman, is harder to swallow, and Robin and * the whole cast * who seem to have difficulty managing their lines is a kiss of doom. How could anyone allow such a heavy delivery to pass without re-shooting the scenes? Time after time, Much sounds as if he was fighting with the half-conceived Shakespeare, instead of releasing him with a salty rumble; At the beginning, I hoped that it was just a failed comedy character clearly intended for the role of a comedian midfielder, but then it began to spread to the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> Whatever else you say to Errol Flynn in the role, he had the talent for running dialogues at a high level as naturally as if he just invented it on the spur of the moment ... and as this production shows, it's not as easy as it's noises! If they intended to cast characters as cheeky chappies, the actors in question should get the appropriate lines: they sound as if they had no idea how to deal with them. <br /> <br /> I'm scared For a similar reason, I did not even like the pantomime Sheriff; the lines are not clearly meant to be taken seriously, but delivered (and in this case saved) with a push and a wink to the audience. They are not right - the fourth destructive wall of things - but not really so much fun. <br /> <br /> This promising production reminded me of a limping school game. The only actor and hero I appreciated at all was the one who played Guy Gisbourne, who was the only one who seemed to have any influence on (a) credible villainy and (b) credible characteristics - but to be honest, not I would like to say that this is a very good fortune for the future of the series! At the time of writing this, I will do it again in the hope that the situation may improve and calm down next week, with less required scenario and perhaps the actors will be more calm in dialogue: in the end, the initial episode of "Doctor Who" was not exactly the show, though it was not so bad anywhere. But if I do not see any improvement after episode 2, I'm afraid that the series almost certainly lost one viewer. <br /> <br /> It's a pity, because I have a weakness for "Robin Hood" - a legend on the screen, from the adventures of Douglas Fairbanks to the strong support of Richard Greene. But this Robin does not move my blood in the slightest.
