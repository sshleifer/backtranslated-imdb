Many other reviewers, including many whose opinions I respect, highly value this European horror. Personally, I did not like it. It is an incoherent trial of the cross-period between sex and violence. Jess Franco in his best form creates such kind of films very well. Unfortunately, the infamous creator of exploitation films Joe D'Amato does not do that. The best-known films of D'Amato are notorious due to the high valuation ratio. This early film does not have the usual disgusting scenes that his more well-known "Anthropophagous" and "Beyond the Darkness" did. Ultimately, this is an incoherent movie that does not involve the viewer in any way. Without this factor it becomes very boring. As I mentioned, others liked this movie, but it turned out to be a perfect example of incredibly lazy writing. <br /> <br /> There are several advantages of the movie. There is Ewa Aulin (from "Candy") in her, and she looks quite hot and is often naked. However, the cult icon of the film Klaus Kinski is completely wasted on the story without connection to the main movie. He seems to be bored with the role and the manic intensity he does at its best. Music is fun and there are short moments of unintentionally ridiculous gore. Nevertheless, it is a pretentious and aimless movie that is incredibly boring. (3/10)
