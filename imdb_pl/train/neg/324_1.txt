The worst mistake in my life. <br /> <br /> I chose this movie at Target for $ 5 because I thought, "Hey, Sandler, I can have some fun". I was wrong. In the middle of the movie, all three of my friends slept, and I still suffered. The worst plot, the worst scenario, the worst movie I've ever seen. I wanted to hit my head against the wall for an hour and then I stopped and you know why? Because it was damn good. After hitting my head I got stuck in that damn film in the microwave and watched it burn ... and it was better than anything I ever did. American Psycho, Army of Darkness and Kill Bill took only this. I HATE YOU TO THE PROBABILITY BY THIS AND CONVINING THE ENTIRE DAY OF MY LIFE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
