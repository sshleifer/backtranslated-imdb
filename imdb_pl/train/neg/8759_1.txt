Why? Why did they make this movie? If Timothy Olyphant had not been in him a few times without a shirt, there would be absolutely no reason to watch this movie ever. Um ... Plot? No. Well-defined characters? no. The only time I laughed was when my boy laughed with all of her roar. P.S. Andy Dick? No.
