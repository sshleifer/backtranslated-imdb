Entering a movie like me, I did not expect absolutely anything funny, except for the horde of homicides ... I got even less. <br /> <br /> Christmas Eve 1947 A child is a witness how his parents do it while Daddy is in a Santa suit. Terrified, he runs up the stairs and cuts. The story begins 33 years later, and Harry Stalling is your usual everyday Joe ..... considering that he is obsessed with Nicholas. After his boss makes fun of him, he goes crazy, dresses up as Santa Claus and starts killing non-Santa believers and his boss. An unsettled neighborhood catches up with him and as soon as they set him on fire, he drives off with his van from the cliff ... to the moon. This is not the best ending I've seen, but it was original. <br /> <br /> It was a slow, boring movie that really had no value, except that Harry went to the church appeal. There was almost no blood and even the "sex" scene was subdued. <br /> <br /> Too boring ...... 4 out of 10
