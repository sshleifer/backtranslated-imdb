A small town is attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty vampires. The only hope is the lone avenger and a group of surviving ragtags. <br /> <br /> Released in 1993, "Darkness" gained something from worship after release. It's easy to see why it's loaded (and I mean a crazy load) up, and it's energy and enthusiasm, like in other iconic horror films without a budget, such as "The Dead Next Door" and "The Children of Ravensback", it is rather contagious. <br /> <br /> Although this may be true, unfortunately it is not enough to save it. The film was shot on Super 8, so the picture is grainy and dark, which makes it very difficult to watch (it would be great if it covered the heroes with a terrible mullet). Soundtrack, made of annoying Casio Keyboard and even more annoying Death Metal (seriously, what is with these budget horror movies and bad Death Metal?) While performances deserving of an Oscar are not expected, the game is still a strictly amateur hour, because the actors sometimes they seem almost lost instead of being frightened or threatened. <br /> <br /> In the end you will definitely enjoy fans of unencumbered money. Everyone else will want some more meat on the ribs.
