It is unlikely that anyone except those who love silent movies, appreciate any lyrical work with the camera and the busy (but rough) background music accompanying the 1933 release. Although the sound came into general use in 1928, there are no more than fifty words that tell the story of a woman who is unhappily married and who, after a romantic break in the forest, leaves her husband for a younger man. <br /> <br /> Apparently the photographed scene has a jealous husband raising a young man for a ride to the city, continuing his normal drive until he realizes that the man is his wife's lover. In the madness of jealousy he rides at the highest speed towards the railroad crossing, but at the last moment he changes his mind, losing his nerves. This is probably the most tense scene in a definitely slower moving and of course invented history. <br /> <br /> HEDY LAMARR receives a kind of close-up treatment that Marlena Dietrich offers her discoverer, but her beauty has not been perfected by beauticians, just like when she was transported to Hollywood. Her performance consists mainly in a sad and gloomy look, mourning the loss of marriage, with short flashes of a smile, when she finds her true love (ARIBERT MOG), a handsome young stud who recovers clothes after a naked bath. > <br /> The swimming scene is very short, discreetly photographed and is not worth all the warmth that it apparently generated. The scene of creating love, later, is also ingeniously photographed with lyrical photography visible through most of the film - ingeniously. More imagery is left to the imagination - and this is something that makes others proclaim that the film is a lyrical masterpiece. <br /> <br /> No. It's disappointing, primitive primitive in their sound parts (including arduous symphonic music in the background) and certainly Miss Lamarr is lucky that Louis B. Mayer saw the movie and based on it gave her a career in Hollywood. He must have seen something in her work that I did not do. <br /> <br /> You can see that it was a quiet movie with a camera doing all the work. The shocking "working-class" scene at the end takes too long and is a shocking interference in which no one is needed. It does not end the movie in the right note.
