The worst movie I've ever seen; I was ready to go out after the first ten minutes. The only people laughing in the theater were the tweeners. Do not get me wrong, I love silly, stupid movies, just like the next gal, but the whole premise, writing and humor stinks. It seemed to me that they were going to feel "Napoleon Dynamite" - strange and accidental scenes that will lead to the cult audience. Instead, it ended with coercion, awkwardness and strangeness. <br /> <br /> The only bright light was Isla Fisher and I felt terrible that she (and Sissy Spacek) had signed up for this horrible thing. /> <br /> Thanks, I did not pay for it.
