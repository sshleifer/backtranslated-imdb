It must be the WORST movie I have ever seen. I bought a DVD and it did not work, so the DVD worked well, just the movie does not, in fact it's so bad that I think that none of the actors have been working since then (or before the acting evaluation). There is no real conspiracy and real horror. Production values ​​are nonsense even for a low-budget film, because some outdoor scenes are difficult to hear because of the wind on the microphone. <br /> <br /> In total, the movie was so bad that the viewer might think that it was I'm turning into porn if they do not know better (which was an improvement). There are only two lines in the movie that are fun, they both revolve around a transvestite prostitute. (Although they hardly deserve to watch all 76 minutes) <br /> <br /> When it comes to DVD marketing, I feel completely cheated. I mean reading from the back. I expected it to be bad: <br /> <br /> He chose his weapon. He chose his victims. He raised his nose. He turned into GIRLS! <br /> <br /> But I thought it could be funny. The case also claims to have been digitally mastered, I would like to see it earlier, the print is so grainy that it can be used as sandpaper. The case also says that it is an absolutely disgusting movie, IN WHAT WAY ?, disgusting production, acting. <br /> <br /> This video remains welcome in the first five minutes (if you are considering purchasing this, I would like to say "bad taste" instead it is a much better movie and it is fun, it also has Peter Jackson, director LOTR.) <br /> <br /> By the way, if anyone knows anything about any of the actors (or director Patrick J Mathews) and what they have done since then, please post here, as I would like to know, only after to find out if there's a worse movie there or if anyone in this movie ever took the trouble to learn how to act
