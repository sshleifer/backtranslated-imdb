This film was presented in the trailer as a comedy. This is an extreme tragedy. My stomach was sick. I hated it. I think that if they want to create such a movie, they should be enough people to reflect the real intentions of the movie in the trailer. I would not see this movie if I knew. I think the trailer should reflect the theme and intentions of the movie. I'm tired of it. I really wanted to have a funny comedy and I'm very disappointed. It's been several days and I still have bad taste of this movie. I have never been more disappointed with the film, nor have I written a comment about the bad movie. I really think that the real trailer was involved in a real scam, because if they showed the true purpose of the film, nobody would have seen it.
