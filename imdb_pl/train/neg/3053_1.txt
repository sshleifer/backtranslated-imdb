Wow. Who ever said that Edward D. Wood Jr. never influenced anyone? This steaming pile of donkey droppings is a perfect example; makes "The Violent Years" look like "Casablanca"! "Santa Claus" makes the worst memories of Keith Richards look like my first nightly issue. I knew that I had nightmares, waking up and sweating bullets that would never come close to the inner horror that Santa was discovering from the seemingly pure earth of my being. However, I can think about some events where this movie can end well. Also, if you're looking for a perfect example of a Santa-Satan dichotomy on VHS tape, look no further. Do not check this video because after receiving the notification, the MST3K version is now available. Move on Satan, here is "Santa Claus".
