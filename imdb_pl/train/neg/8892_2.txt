I must admit that this version of Shakespeare's disgrace in advance! No one can work except the nurse who was my favorite! Juliet had good skills as a teenager, but she can not give emotional depth to her lines and we can not really connect with her. It's worse when he makes a scene when he is considering drinking a sleeping potion ... God, stop moaning! I would spill it in her mouth to shut her up! Anthony Andrews ... yikes! Considering his other great films (Brideshead Revisited, Ivanhoe, Scarlet Pimpernel), he's pretty shocking. And do not start me from Romeo ... puhleasssssee! It's still good to see if you're hunting to see all Romeo and Juliet ever made in the history of the movie. The version of Olivia and Leonardo is still the best, followed by the version of Leslie Howard, and then the current Leo and Clare!
