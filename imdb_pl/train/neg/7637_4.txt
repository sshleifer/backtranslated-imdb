It could have been a very good movie if I could watch it. The handheld camera was very bouncy. I was worried about starting credits. At the end, many of us watched this view. But we stayed until the end, because it was a charming and interesting film, giving some insight into young pop culture in South Africa. The black and white film reinforced this artistic feeling. Acting seemed very authentic. Some of the dialogues were a bit difficult to understand, but the theater full of non-South Africa seemed to be funny. If you have motion sickness at all, you can seriously consider skipping this video. It's peculiar but not worth nauseating.
