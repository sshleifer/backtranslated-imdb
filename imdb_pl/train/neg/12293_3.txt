It only gets broken because David Hasselhoff plays. Well, let me hit it. Compared to trash that they call horror today, this movie is not so bad. He has beautiful Leslie Cumming. It's super hot, but it can not speak well. There is a great scene with her when she is raped in a supernatural way. He shows his nice body. Linda Blair does nothing here, like Hasselhoff. 3/10
