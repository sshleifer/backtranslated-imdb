Everyone just raves about the subject and does not notice how the film was made. The deaf guy is okay, the weaker the wins - that's good, the cricket aspect is great, but the movie is generally mediocre. I think it can be done much better than it is. <br /> <br /> The plot is too predictable for a movie that is not based on a real event. I'm sure the movie could have been more interesting. The songs are simply stuffed there and I had to send scenes in which the same thing would be shown in different angles. <br /> <br /> Good game. Watchable.
