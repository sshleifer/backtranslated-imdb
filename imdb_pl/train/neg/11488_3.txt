It is hard to imagine that anyone could find this shortcut as their favorite, if he saw most of his shorts, but I know that humor is VERY subjective. I saw all their sound shorts (definitely the best in their IMO materials) and I found this one of their weaker endeavors. <br /> <br /> This year (1930) Stan and Babe made 15 shorts and one function. They were very popular, and their boss Hal Roach took full advantage of them, constantly working. In addition, it was a time of experiments for writers and Stan. I would say that it was an experiment that really did not work. As someone else said, he does not play by force. Too much dialogue and story. <br /> <br /> The best part of this for me is largely an improvised sequence with Stan as Agnes, a maid and a wonderful Thelma Todd talking about "girls". <br /> <br /> If you really want to see the boys at their most creative and fun checking out Blotto or Brats from the same year. <br /> <br /> They've made so many shorts in such a short time that I think I can forgive myself that I'm going to release a few fewer than a pair of shorts. They made about 108 films in total. Very few (except those made in FOX) were failures, but there are several of them. County Hospital, Me And My Pal, The Live Ghost, The Fixer Uppers come to mind as poor. But besides, in all these shorts I find something wonderful. Nice entry in my book. <br /> <br /> If you saw and enjoyed all their other pants, just check this out, but I would be willing to bet that this one was less memorable for Stan and baby.
