A horrifying sequel to The Howling. It starts with the funeral of Karen White (she died at the end of the first movie). Stefan Crosscoe (unfortunately Christopher Lee) arrives and tells his brother Karen Ben (Reb Brown) that Karen is a werewolf. He goes to Transylvania to kill Striba (Sybil Danning), the main werewolf. Ben and colleague Karens (Annie McEnroe) join him. <br /> <br /> Terrible scenario, wrong direction, inadequate editing and really terrifying acting Brown and McEnroe are singing this one at a time. Werewolf's effects are usually stored in the dark - not without reason! They are awful when you see them. Subpar special effects also - although I liked the lightning from the cartoon that comes from Danning's fingers. There's also a werewolf's orgy, which is particularly stupid, and Danning takes the top off at least eight times while closing the points! <br /> <br /> There are some good things - I found a village in Transylvania funny - it looks like it comes from a universal horror movie from the 1930s! There are interesting tricks with cameras between the transition stages; Brown and McEnroe have good bodies, and Lee and Danning are good at it - but they can not save it. Really - WHY did they do it? Where's hard for money? This is one of the lowest rated IMDb films. Only this should tell you something. Apparently Danning was scared when she saw the movie - I understand why! Miss.
