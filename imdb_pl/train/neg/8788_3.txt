It is a pity that when a potentially captivating and refreshingly low story succeeds in slamming your interest at first, then it gradually lets you go farther and farther, until you remain scratched into your imaginary head until you have reached your exaggerated conclusion . Unfortunately, it just happened to me at the end of WHITE NOISE. <br /> <br /> It was not Michael Keaton's fault; He was pleased to see once again how he returns as a brand new movie, maybe a little wrinkled, but he still manages to give a strong and honest performance. As a man whose wife has recently died, obsessed with her wandering spirit in the afterlife (this is not a new idea), apparently she makes contact with her through this funky electric fuzz that you see on the TV screen when nothing is broadcast. br /> <br /> The idea of ​​ghosts communicating by radio is called EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena) and there are many people who really believe in it, so I'm not going to comment on what I think about it or about them. I'm just saying that I'm behind the suspension of disbelief when it comes to buying such fantastic movies, but I can not stand that I do not understand what the hell was going to happen, namely, where I was left unattended when the loans finally began to roll. Really very static. <br /> <br /> There are sometimes movies that completely surprise me, but if the film is not clear to me, I think it's the filmmaker's fault, not my own (unless I watched it when I was too tired to focus or something). Well, for WHITE NOISE I was awake, with bright eyes and a bushy tail - so guess who is guilty?
