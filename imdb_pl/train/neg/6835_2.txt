I do not understand how anyone who even likes Van Damne could like this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with some promise. I would say that the action scenes at the beginning of the movie are perfect. Action scenes with a family branch that tries to save twins is a great start and a good start to the main story. However, the movie is from downhill. <br /> <br /> It would be nice if the director could stay with the original premise. This means that brothers are born in different parts of the world and thanks to that they learn different skills. One of the brothers should be proficient in martial arts, but the other brother should be skilled in firearms. How convenient, when the time comes, that a brother who has never raised a weapon before is a great sharpshooter, and a brother who has not been taught any martial arts, suddenly makes splits and high kicks. br /> <br /> The plot, action, etc. are just ridiculous. My favorite scenes? What do you say that Van Damne will face an armed AK-47 soldier. The soldier is about 100 meters away. Instead of aiming and shooting at Van Damne, he makes a war cry as if he wielded a battle ax and ran towards him. Van Damne takes a pistol from a fallen soldier and shoots him while he is about 75 to 80 meters away. <br /> <br /> This movie has one of the most disappointing endings. Bolo Yeung is a qualified martial artist. However, instead of choreographing a decent fight. Bolo rolls barrels at Van Damne like Donkey Kong. An absolutely incriminating movie that was so promising. If you're a fan of Van Damne, save time and see Hard Target or one of his earlier movies.
