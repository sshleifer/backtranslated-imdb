Yes, I've been sitting through the whole thing, God knows why. <br /> <br /> It was a long afternoon, I had nothing to do, it was bitter outside, okay, all these are bad excuses, but they are the only ones I have. <br /> <br /> I gave The Darkling 4 stars out of a possible 10 - I've seen worse films, but this one is definitely in the old trash bin of a bad movie - poor script, poor acting, bad lighting and bad special effects. <br /> <br /> A plot that never makes sense, revolves around this simple little family, daddy, mommy and little girl - which I assume the viewer has to be "identifying", all three were boring and annoying. You just want the dark side to get each one. <br /> <br /> Daddy is a chef whose hobby is cars. Daddy meets a wealthy man named Rubin, who collects cars, and also has a creature he bought in a "mysterious" Orient. Rubin holds him in a cage for birds and calls him "The Darkling". <br /> <br /> During the movie, Darkling is translated as about 3 or 4 different things: shadow without a person, inner darkness that exists in all of us, and the Devil. So take your choice, any of these explanations match your taste - because trust me, it does not matter. <br /> <br /> The main problem of Darkling seems to be that he wants to have a companion - he gets a human companion - and ultimately is dissatisfied with the human being. This of course leads to immense wealth, followed by a disaster for a man who joins The Darkling. <br /> <br /> And for the rest of us - it just leads to a very long, boring movie. <br /> <br />
