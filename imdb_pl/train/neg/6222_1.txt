I'm not sure if users should have permission to watch movies after they've only sat for half, but I'm afraid I just could not stand the next minute. <br /> <br /> If this is an extreme justification of the film late, a great GP revolves like a wheel in a grave, and then I doubt if there will be anything. <br /> <br /> The excellent review above "Not a movie for Parsons fans" sums up most of my feelings. How dare you (second step) the director and writer to try something that they are not able to deliver so clearly. What were they thinking? Where to start? <br /> <br /> SCRIPT: I thought I would get a piece of bittersweet Americana. What I got was poorly made, without any banal. Stupid hippie? Check. Stupid fat cop? Check. Horrible plot conspiracies? Check. Embarrassingly written female characters? Double checking. A complete disregard for the story you are trying to portray? Check. <br /> <br /> After a while you realize that what you are watching is soap and it is not well written. A scene from Knoxville. Scene with an Ex girlfriend. A scene from Knoxville that has not changed much. A scene with an Ex girlfriend who was a bit like the last one. And so on ... <br /> <br /> DIRECTION: My friends and I decided, after some thought, that watching it was like watching the bad episode of Quincy, or maybe especially poor Dukes of Hazzard. The direction was so bad. Horrible jumps, horrible camera work, clumsy staging scenes. God, that was remarkable. And then I discovered that the director was an Irishman whose most notable last song is the really bad BBC Sunday Night drama called Monarch of the Glen (trust me, it's the lowest common denominator of TV). And then it all made sense ... <br /> <br /> ACTION: Are we so critical now that if some random TV guy decides to act, if he is not so bad, he stinks, we applaud his efforts? Knoxville, ONLY, manages to go through every scene. Poor Christina A. is not so lucky. Her performance is a car crash (though I do not know what you are doing with these lines). "Hippie" in caravan: oh, dear, oh, honey. Have we not moved from Cheech and Chong? <br /> <br /> I can continue, but I think you will get my drift. I would say that, as other reviews have mentioned, no one in this movie gives a goddamn damn attention to the solo work of The Byrds, The Flying Burrito Brothers or Gram. They did not know anything about the American road movie, and they certainly are damned trying to do anything with a decent story from rock mythology. The film was shallow, he could not find anything, and the jaw dropped unexpectedly from the beginning to ... oh, I was not quite done. And I suggest that you stay away too.
