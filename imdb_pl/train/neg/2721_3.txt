I am a huge science fiction fan of the 1950s, but this is not one of my favorites. While the concept of the film was a natural carrier of the classic science-fiction movie, bopper, the director was too determined to transfer the film. It is clear that he worked without money, because the whole movie is full of bloated dialogue that lasts and lasts forever. I have never seen so much time killing in a movie. <br /> <br /> There is probably less than 60 seconds of footage in the whole film, and the rest is engaging people in many poorly written dialogues. It was nice to see Steve M. and Anita C. together, but good ... how can you think that everyone who is right will believe them as teenagers?
