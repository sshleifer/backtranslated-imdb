Always enjoy great movies that move the super-natural and deep thoughts of the spiritual world. However, this movie just discouraged me when it comes to production and direction. There is nothing to deeply discuss about what this story has to say; all I can say is that putting it on the big screen was a great waste of time and effort. Actors, namely: Mark Addy, Thomas Garrett, gave great performances in their homeland in England and we saw him in the television series "Still Standing". Heath Ledger, he played a real wicked guy and recently we watched him in "Brokeback Mountain", 05, he gave a great supporting role. Shannyn Sossaman (Mara Sinclair) did a good job of seducing a priest from a church unrecognized by no faith. Do not waste time, you will be sorry!
