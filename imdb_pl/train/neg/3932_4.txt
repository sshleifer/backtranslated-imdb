This solid little horror movie is one of Renny Harlin's best films. The story is quite routine, but the atmosphere is what really animates; in fact, the ghost story is almost reflective. The real horror comes from the prison itself, and Renny H. does not spare any details, showing us how bad conditions prevail in this crumbling, old rat, which is leaking with rats (also with a sadistic head!). usually in the main role, supported by very authentic looking prisoners (in the cast there are no nice boys). Horror fans should check it out.
