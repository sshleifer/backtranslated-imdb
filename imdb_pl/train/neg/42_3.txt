Of the three titles of Jess Franco, which are on the official list of DPP Video Nasty (Devil Hunter, Bloody Moon and Women Behind Bars), this is probably the least deserving of publicity, because a terribly boring jungle cluster revived only slightly by a small inept gore, unjustified scene rape and plenty of nudity. <br /> <br /> The great blonde Ursula Buchfellner plays the movie star Laura Crawford, who is kidnapped by a gang of ruthless kidnappers and taken to a remote tropical island inhabited by a wild tribe worshiping the "devil god" who lurks in the jungle (big, naked , a staring native who likes to eat the hearts of female victims). <br /> <br /> Employed by Laura's agent to provide a $ 6 million ransom, brave mercenary Peter Weston (Al Cliver) and his veterinary pilot from Vietnam travel to the island, but they get in trouble when bad guys try a double cross . During the confusion Laura escapes into the jungle, but falls straight into the arms of the natives of the island, who offer it to their god. <br /> <br /> Franco is guided by his usual, poor style and loads this funny effort with his typical scary trademarks: crap, dark pictures, quick zooms, numerous shots in the crotch, blurred photos, horrible sound effects and mounting in braces . The result is a terrible mess, which is a real difficulty to sit down from the beginning (it took me a few meetings to finish this case), and even a view of the luscious Buchfellner in all its natural glory is not enough to force me to revisit this movie in a hurry .
