This film barely followed the plot of the film. All the fascinating points in the book did not even exist in the film. It ended up turning it into the tacky Disney storyline, "Megan" and Calvin. It was so bad that Hillary Duff played this role, or one of those people. This film was just an insult to the book's intelligence and mysticism. I can not believe that Disney could even avoid such a cheap, basic edition. If you've ever read a book, I think you'll agree that it can be easily transformed into the Lord of the Rings movie. This movie has never been able to use the title A Wrinkle in Time. Badly done.
