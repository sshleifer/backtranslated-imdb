Well, everything has been said about this movie and I hate it by writing reviews in which everyone has already said what to say. But the point is that I've seen zillions of movies and I'm working on writing reviews of all the movies I've seen. So I have to write something. <br /> <br /> Acting is stupid. It's really stupid, as the news anchor expresses its sadness at the plane crash. The nun, however, is a nice and professional assistant who comes to take care of the child. The three main killings in the film are so weak that you wonder how stupid the filmmakers can be. Do not realize that even peeling can be frightening. We do not see how granpa is killed. The dentist and his assistant made me feel that they deserve to die, you just do not sympathize with them. And Uncle Tony dies in a garage in a way that could be better. We just hear him scream and see nothing!
