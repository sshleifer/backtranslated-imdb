This hunger-fed action / sci-fi hybrid includes David Warbeck as a Miami reporter who was chosen by the ghosts of Atlantis (!) To stop a bad businessman (nominated for Oscar John Ireland) before using a telepathic fetus using asteroid spores, to rule the world. Do you have all this? Despite such a crazy plot, it is quite boring, and RAIDERS OF ATLANTIS scoff at contempt. To be honest, the most (deliberately) creative thing about this movement is the light transformation of the Herbie Hancock theme, BEVERLY HILLS COP, for opening titles. The most inadvertently creative bit includes a scene in a laboratory that is inexplicably shown twice backwards. Perhaps the director Alberto De Martino wanted to bring us the entire avant-garde in the twilight of his career? I was going to announce the worst movie of Ireland in my life story, but then I saw there a list of Satan's CHEERLEADERS. I would also like to safely state that I am probably the only person in the history of the world who has the dual characteristic of this and VERTIGO Hitchcock.
