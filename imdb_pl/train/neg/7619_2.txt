As a fan of the Mystery Science Theater 3000, I can withstand ANY film that can be imposed, but there is absolutely no reason. <br/> <br /> Rated "Super Action" in the Blockbuster Video section and a horrifying "Limited display of stickers" is given. I assume that these are the only methods that the filmmaker (HA!) Robert Napton could use to get at least 4 , 50 from unsuspecting person. <br /> <br /> Shame yourself, Robert Napton! Embarrass yourself that you have used these poor Mexican actors whom you probably promised great hope to make them great in American cinema. You are a disgrace! <br /> <br /> There is not a single moment in this movie that would have the smallest action. Have you used snots on these people? Oh, look, they have delight in the field! Like all 6 of them. Is not this an Asian guy in the background? Why is it always day? Why showing anything took 1/2 of the movie ... and more importantly, why did we watch the other 1/2? <br /> <br /> PS: You owe me 4.50.
