This amazing story of hope comes. I hope you will not have to endure this terrible again. * kaszel * Razziego * kaszel * <br /> <br /> I did not like this film because it was obscene, predictable and ridiculous. While watching, I felt like I was in a psychological experiment to determine how low film standards can get before people complain. When I asked for a refund at the end of the movie, I was informed that because I watched the whole "I did not have the right to reimbursement". The manager's assistant informed me that several people have already complained and received refunds. <br /> <br /> The summary of the movie is quite simple. The dwarf robber steals a diamond and poses as a child to avoid the police. Under this clever outline, however, lies the repertoire of original, fresh and funny skits. Or not. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself the following question: Do you like to see how people hit pans? Do you like farts jokes? Do you like to see dwarfs posing like children at risk with a rectal thermometer? Do you like tired racial jokes? Do you think that children say "goo goo goo goo goo goo gaa gaa"? Do you salivate? <br /> <br /> If you answered "yes" to any of the above, this movie is definitely for you. Although in some places it was announced as "The worst film of the decade", there is probably a movie or 2 that are worse ... somewhere. I can not say for sure. I gave this film 2 stars, because we all know that a review with one star would indicate the reviewer's bias, and then the review would not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> This low comedy is intended for less intelligent recipients and I can not recommend it to anyone with a clear conscience. Save your money for something funny. <br /> <br /> Respect
