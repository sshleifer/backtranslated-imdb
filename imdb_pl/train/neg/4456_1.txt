This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. The fact that she has a frail story is so bad that they have made her dependent on the subject of violence in football, which makes him 100 times worse. <br /> <br /> I had serious doubts about the premise of the film before I started watching, but I fell into an open mind enough to accept the way in which writers saw that it was worth introducing Eliasz Wood's mother into a hooligan scene. <br /> <br /> But the movie causes inaccuracies after inaccuracy, the point that in the middle of the movie everyone makes you feel harder than before. <br /> <br /> Let's explain a few things: Hooligans do not tend to virtual break up their own pub before the run -of-the-mill league game; they are not going to kill; Do not wear ONLY Stone Island (and others in the crowd, hooligans or not). Certainly they will not leave when they leave the special member of the new company, go to the territory of their competing companies in order to get a cake and mash. And I would love to meet hooligans who would go to the grass and land on the best boy of their company in a competitive company. (Although you can scrape what I said about setting up, kill each other if it exists). <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I will not see a movie about it yet. they contain some whims of fantasy, but it is on par with The Firm for the unconscious. <br /> <br /> I find it ironic that Wood's American nemesis is morally condemned by his character for being a cocaine user, when he is part and parcel of the British hooligan scene. The film decides not to challenge Wood's morality, but instead avoid any of the companies using coke. <br /> <br /> I can continue, but I think I made my point. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it is very unimaginable and I'm sure that if I did not spend the whole movie complaining about the points, and more, made above, I would guess what's going on before. And believe me, I was in the lead. <br /> <br /> I have a clear impression that this movie is aimed at men, with the hope that women will be satisfied with the emotional injections that are being made. <br /> <br /> If I'm right, the creators failed completely. It's unrealistic to be enjoyed by anyone who knows about the scene, and I can not believe that the kind of woman who is looking for emotional movies can be damned worried about any character, given their violent tendencies. <br /> <br /> Are there any good points? Maybe the battle scenes are well choreographed and filmed, but I'm rarely impressed by the slow-mo action, certainly not when the fight is such that ruck is still thrilling enough. <br /> <br /> It is a bit funny, though unrealistic moments. Wood's trip to school made me smile. But a few mildly funny moments rather do not reward watching two hours of completely fabricated slag. <br /> <br /> If you are British, avoid such a plague, if not to further develop misconceptions about the scene, if you do not know. If you are an American, you can enjoy it because it is clearly adapted to the market. But no one can deny that the plot is weak, predictable and ultimately exceeds.
