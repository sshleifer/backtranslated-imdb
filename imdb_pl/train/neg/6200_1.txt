This is the most disturbing movie I've ever seen. This makes "Requiem for a dream" look like a Disney movie. Although it's technically quite well done, acting, photos, music, direction, etc. They're good. However, the final scene of gang rape is the most frightening and brutal thing I've ever seen and I would really like it not to be seen. I'm afraid he's persecuting me for the rest of my life. Although I think everyone will find the movie very worrying, my wife and some of her friends were victims in a very similar way, and I really did not need a clear reminder of the horror they experienced. I saw this movie at the SXSW film festival in Austin, Texas, and no one from the cast or crew was present. I would like them to have the opportunity to defend violence in their film, which I thought was excessive, unjustified and unnecessary. The earlier scene successfully conveyed the mood to which they apparently aspired, but without rubbing the face in extreme and overt sexual violence. This movie should have a large WARNING label. For these reasons, I do not recommend anyone to see this. You have been warned.
