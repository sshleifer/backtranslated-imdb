I only gave this ridiculously titled comedy horror 2 because there are some famous porn stars from the past. A group of tourists, supposedly on vacation in Ireland, but in fact in Canada, is struggling with a cannibal inbreeding mutant, something else or different, and the plot is more or less the same with THE HILL HAVE EYES and WRONG TURN. The only problem is that unless I'm not counting, there is only one mutant on the display, and he is not that impressive. It's a bit like a vomit mummy from this home movie from about five years ago. Bloody but stupid deaths help, but the film is strictly amateurish and boring. The ending is predictable and has been made to death. The word game is not intended.
