This movie is basically about some Catholic girls who get into trouble because they put a red dye in one of their school shampoos and when they get reprimanded for the act, they decide to go to Florida on vacation. Along the way, they meet with several boys in a local restaurant and decide that they will meet in a different place later. The girls end up on the side of the road near the forest and stop for a moment, and while one of the girls decides to walk a little, he sees a murder in which the sheriff is involved. She becomes frightened and runs to tell others what has happened. The other girls decide to look at her, and two kill the killer. Then the other two girls are caught by the killer and placed in the local prison cell. Meanwhile, the deputy sheriff watches over the girls, and despite their insistence that the sheriff is a killer, he ignores both of them and acts as ignorant, and everyone else in the movie, who simply can not combine two and two, let alone a detective job . The best part was the rape scene between the killer and one of the girls in which he decides to rape her in a prison cell and it seems that the girl really WANT to be raped by this man, and the scene of the naked breast I admit was good, but earlier their mouths meet He means other things. This movie reminds me of the low-budget thriller "Bloody song" with Frank Avalon staring at her, the same theme just another part of the character. This is not a movie worth renting even for a low-budget movie from the 80s, and the ending was the worst ending I've ever seen in a movie, and that made me want to get my money back!
