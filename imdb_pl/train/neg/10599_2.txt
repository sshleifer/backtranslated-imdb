** TUTAJ BĄDŹ SPOILERÓW ** <br /> <br /> The government continued the development of the UniversalSoldier program, now called UniSol. Soldiers are now stronger and are able to deal more damage than before. However, the government reduces, the project is at risk, and the supercomputer that is inside feels vulnerable, so it takes steps to ensure its own safety. It activates and controls UniSols and chaos begins. The only one who can stop them is Deveraux (Van Damme). <br /> <br /> This movie is about one thing. Choreographic fights. History is bad and soon drowned in all fights. Whatever happens, and wherever they go, they fight. Unfortunately for this film, it's not fun watching a fight in which you know that one part of it is indestructible. Usually you are sure that the hero will win, but you still want to feel that the fights are between two slightly equal fighters. Not where someone is indestructible and can not lose. Then the fighting became a tool for stretching time. You wait until the final battle, when Deveraux will wonderfully find a way to defeat invincible enemies. To further lower my opinion, a desperate and reliable sign of a bad movie is how scantily clad women are. Well, there are not so many, because the heroes are most men (there is at least one woman UniSol), but almost every woman is unnecessarily shown at least once in a bra. They run women, but we also go through a strip club (to use the computer no less) with a much larger number of undressed women. These moments do not give anything to tell and are just to please the male audience with a young attitude. <br /> <br /> So, boring fights. No more no less. Well, maybe less ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
