It's here. and finally there is a movie that I can honestly say is worse than Larry, who is a guide: health inspector. Still, I am willing to bet that the Wayan brothers (hilarious) earn more money than I've ever earned in my entire life, which will certainly be one of the five worst films of all time, beyond my fifth class beyond the re-enactment of Romeo and Juliet. I mean really WHY anyone would ever see this movie if it had not been paid for. The comedy is weak, and all the funny jokes from the slick plot have certainly been revealed in commercials. The last word to this movie was a terrible disappointment for me. And the ads looked so promising ...
