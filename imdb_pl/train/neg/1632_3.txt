Apparent vanity project for Karin Mani (who?), As a hottie Charles Bronson avoiding the "scum" that attacked her parents, grandparents or something like that, and impressing young boys with their karate skills. In the key scene he intervenes to stop the rape and moron a policeman throws her to prison, so after a few cold scenes with showers and unsuccessful prison and grave imprisonment, he must take the law in his own hands blah blah. I think there were many such films? The script is stupider than usual, if you can believe it. Mani is a type of show business that would co-create her main role in the role of Death Wish, and I consider this type to be occasional, but the film is a clumsy camera. Competent actors would be squandered on scumbag roles here and would actively undermine the fantastic murderous-incompetent DA and referee who must be the uncle of the producer.
