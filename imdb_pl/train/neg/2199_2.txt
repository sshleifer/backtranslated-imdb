I caught Sorrows Lost at the New York Film and Video Festival and I think I had high hopes for this movie. Unfortunately, this is another Visual FX calling card. The story is pretty bad. Poor lighting and working with cameras, together with less than great editing and music, make the film look poor. <br /> <br /> Is it really too much to ask that FX shorts have better stories and have the rest of the technical production is on par with FX! You can not just leave cool FX in shorts, it's been 5 years since "405" made a big splash. At least as short, fast and even a bit funny! Nothing can be said about Sorrows Lost.
