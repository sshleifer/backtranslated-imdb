Let me say that I've always been a fan of Steven Seagal, and his films are usually great, but that does not suit the rest. This, in my opinion, is very stupid. I did not like it all. The biggest reason I do not like it is that it is very flawed and it does not make much sense to me. Acting is very bad, even Steven Seagal does not play well, I see the rest of the actors because they just make films directly. It does not follow a simple plot, everything happens at once, so why it does not make much sense. There is almost no action in it, and to create an action movie, you usually need action in it. The special effects are very bad and it can be said that they are false. In conclusion, he has to play the worst movie of all, so if you want to see Steven Seagal's movie, do not rent this movie, pretend it does not exist. So just avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall result: ** z ********** <br /> <br /> * z *****
