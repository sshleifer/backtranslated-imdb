I give it five out of ten. All five ratings are for Hendrix, who provides a very decent set of his materials from the last day. Unfortunately, the quality of the camera's work and its editing is terrifying! We have countless shots of Hendrix, in which he could almost do everything, perhaps peeing? It's not that his guitar hands make sense! We also have a lot of Hendrix pictures from the back? It looks like there are three cameras on Hendrix, but all amateur fools. The guy in front of Hendrix seems eager to focus on the stage, as if Hendrix on the guitar was just entertainment. While the guy in the back is more focused on putting a few chicks in the stalls than on documenting the incredible guitar work that bleeds amps (sound recording is good thanks to Wally Heider). Vietnam, etc. On tracks such as Machine Gun, a complete loss of the movie! If Hendrix survived two more years, Berkeley is one of those things that would never be seen in the full official release. The only jewel he has is amazing Johnny B Good, but in a pretty bad visual document of a great man and worse than Woodstock and Isle of Wight
