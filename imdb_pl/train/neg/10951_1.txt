I do not know what the idiots gave this Palm D'Or movie at the Cannes Film Festival in 1999 because it was awful! I just watched the whole movie because I could not believe someone would do such a worthless movie. There is nothing interesting about the story, the characters are devoid of depth and there is no attempt to give any atmosphere to music or sound effects. In addition, if you decide to waste 2 hours of your life watching this movie, remember to bring something to do, because pictures are just running with a handheld camera and do not even see the main topics for half the time. This style was much more effectively used in movies such as "Blair Witch" because it creates tension. In Rosetta, there is no plot or tension that this style could borrow. I should have known better when it arrived at 2am that it would be awful.
