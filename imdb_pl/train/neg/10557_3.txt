This is a hideous, small production that can cause nightmares and headaches. It's an unsightly mix of live action and ugly stop motion animation. It is strange, but it is not such a funny, strange trip that any optimist would expect. It's cold, inhuman, unfriendly, disgusting, even a terrifying kind of eccentricity. There is absolutely no reason to watch this movie. Finally, Disney did a fantastic job with the same source material. And Cosgrove-Hall did much more attractive things with time-lapse traffic. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, this is French production. In this way, it reinforces the stereotype that the French have no terrible concept.
