As is often the case, the impressive and explosive trailers of Asian films do not add up to anything more than just nondescript stories. Like Unleashed (which was great), Dog Bite Dog tells a story in which men are brought up as wild, wild dogs that perform their master's bidding. The main characters, undeveloped emotionally, an amoral killer who is compared to an equally unstable policeman, are far from the usual heroes and villains we often see. In fact, to the end, you lose the feeling of who you should feel sorry for, without even feeling the smallest feelings for any of the men? whether it was the director's failure, or maybe the underline he tried to say depends on you. <br /> <br /> Although the beginning of the movie was full of intrigue and unpredictability, halfway through the point where he left himself down to the dark history of survival and revenge. The tension, which was obvious at first, soon disappeared due to the grossly unmatched musical score, which lowered the potentially effective story. In the end, you have the feeling that all the detailed information and introspection of the main characters were in some way very unnecessary. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the transition in history from point a to point b was quite unusual compared to American films? so those who are not familiar with Asian movies and are tired of Hollywood's predictability should check it out. <br /> <br /> White balance seemed to be turned off for most of the movie. It was like looking at a photo taken on fluorescence when it was to be set on tungsten. Maybe I'm the only one, but it has tired my eyes. <br /> <br /> The movie also liked playing on you? an interesting expansion gave me hope for a slow tale, until it was directed to a low-budget low speed pursuit scene. And just when you think that you will get indie with no answer ending in a mix of Shakespeare's tragedy, you will realize that this is not the ending, but rather the transition to a crazy country music montage of peace and quiet. > <br /> Put in a few horrifying strangling scenes, a moment of redemption unexpectedly restored to wildness and back in the other direction, the Asian's fascination with body fluids and terrible music that does not fit the movie, and you get the average bland Asian thriller. <br /> <br /> I just do not understand why each battle scene was covered with lions roaring lions? I thought they were to symbolize dogs? Ultimately, we are finally reminded of a real killer who is still lurking among us? tetanus. <br /> <br /> 4/10
