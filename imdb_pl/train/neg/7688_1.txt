A scary movie with a budget of about $ 9.99. There were very obvious miniature sets, poor acting and a horrible story about aliens who use thrown meat from the butcher shop as fuel for their spaceship. The film contains some blood (insufficient to disrupt) and a figure with an egg replacing one of his hands. (Yes, you read it correctly.) <br /> <br /> One of the salutary grace was the song played on the "talent show" (as it is with irony?) Punk band / new wave, which in my opinion was called "I am a bullet seeking heat ". Besides, it's not worth your time, even at the "bad, that's good" level. Watch if you're in bad foreign movies, but everyone else should steer clear. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 in 10
