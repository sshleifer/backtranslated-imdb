I do not know how to describe this movie. This is definitely one of the strangest movies I've seen in a long time. Sometimes it is very disturbing, but also boring in other places. The scenes of dental torture are very sophisticated and can attract anyone who pops up and splatter. I found that I was holding my teeth during some of the above scenes. The clever thing about the movie is that it plays with our fears, which is why The Dentist is quite disturbing. <br /> <br /> The humor of the movie is hidden in some way and may not be recognized by everyone. But if you're a fan of strange and weird entertainment and dusting your teeth, this is the movie you were looking for. <br /> <br /> If you read the comment and feel somehow attracted by this kind of entertainment, try it! <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10 (maybe a bit strange for my taste)
