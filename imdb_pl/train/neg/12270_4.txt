This Kiyoshi Kurosawa spiritual film is quite wild and had at least one fear of jumping, which surprised me. But all in all, the movie is incredibly stupid, and the detective is trying to track down a suspicious serial killer just to find out he could commit one of the crimes. Then he is haunted by the wonderful spirit of an Asian lady and has no idea why (and does not see). When other murders are committed, he becomes even more confused, because the murderers are easily found, and this ghost is still haunting him for some reason. The conspiracy is not only completely stupid, but the spirit is more fun than anything else, especially when it suddenly passes through the city like Wonder Woman. And the ending does not make sense, in fact the whole movie does not make sense and I can not recommend it at all. If not so seriously, I would think it's a black comedy. In addition to "Bright Future" this is the worst film directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa, which I saw yet.
