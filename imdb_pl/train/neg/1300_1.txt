This film should never have been made. Honestly, I must admit that before I saw it, I had serious doubts. The director is not a great actress, although she made many films in the Netherlands, and the young woman who took the lead role is a TV personality with a permanent smile and a small self-criticism. The actor who played the second main part, which I recently saw in Bride Flight, and although this movie is better, it did not convince me. At the beginning, I have not read the novel on which it is based, but the scenario in which the movie is located is something that can be done with children who have a birthday party on a rainy Sunday afternoon, and not about the same age as the director who likes to watch a good movie. Something really worrying was that the dialogues were exaggerated, most of the time it was spoken out loud. Regards the cameraman, at least he tried to do something about it. It is a pity that the movie is edited poorly, if not, some of the scenes were certainly more reliable.
