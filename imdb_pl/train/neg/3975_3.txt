1st watched 12/7/2002 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Steve Purcell): Typical Mary Kate and Ashley with a few kisses. It seems that the girls are tired of these things and it will be interesting what will happen to them if they ever decide to divide and follow their own paths. In this episode their adventures are trainees in Rome for a fashion designer who places them directly in the magazine to find out what hard work is all about (I think ...). Apart from typical flirtations with boys, there is nothing more than a scenario in Rome, until the film finally comes to light, why it is released, then re-employed, then re-released, and then re-employed. This is certainly done by people who do not understand the corporate world and show it in their interpretation. Perhaps the real world will be their next adventure (if it exists.). Even my children did not care about this boring "adventure" in pretending. Let's see that they probably only have a few years until they reach legal adults. We'll see what happens then.
