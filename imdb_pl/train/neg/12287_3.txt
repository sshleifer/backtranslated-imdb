In the late 1980s, an inexplicable rash of supernatural horrors set in dark penitentiary institutions appeared. Renny Harlin's excellent and atmospheric "Prison" made the entire haunted ball hoosegow; shortly thereafter there was a much worse "Chair", a pleasantly tacky "House of Death" by John Saxon, a tolerable psycho-picture "Destroyer" and a hideously limp boring exercise in a hopelessly coma. <br /> <br /> An ordinary annoying collection of terribly unpleasant college chowders, guided by an unbearable, spineless tormented Alex (extremely uninteresting Nicholas Celozzi), goes to the island of Alcatraz to investigate the bizarre circumstances surrounding the sudden grisly death of a rock star Sammy Mitchell (gently played by Toni Basil from the famous "Hey Micky"). Alex's brother is possessed by the evil, demonic spirit of a cruel, cannibalistic commander of the cavalry of the American Civil War, and continues the expected madness of killing, forcing Alex's wimpy to overcome his passivity and confront this ghastly ghost. <br /> <br /> Though cleverly photographed by Nicholas Von Sternberg, with some decent pieces of a set of gore and a lot of scary atmosphere (the movie was filmed on the site in the gloomy, rusty, ruined ruins of Alcatraz Island), "Slaughterhouse rock" anyway does not cut it as a solid, effective function of fear. This results, to a large extent, from the unpleasantly unpleasant and unlike to a friend of intelligent characters, a tiringly slim group whose unclean comic antics turn out to be rather grotesque than funny. A flat from a noticeably disinterested cast still hurts more, and is accompanied by the once-playboy and undeniable blonde cutie pie hottie Hope Marie Carlton, who makes the particularly annoying personification of Linnei Quigley as a playful nymph bimbo. The direction of Dimitri Logothetis shows a bit of brilliant visual style, but the tone is uneven between gloomy seriousness and stupid, terrifyingly sophisticated foolishness, and the most damaging, messy, incoherent, too complicated and finally misleading scenario of Ted Landon fails to develop the necessary internal logic, which will make the far-reaching story even credible. In other words, this smelly regrettably achieves a modest 90 minutes, which seem to be a terribly prolonged prison sentence.
