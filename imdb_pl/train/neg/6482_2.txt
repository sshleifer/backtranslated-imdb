Disney still has to meet with a movie that would not be able to make at least two sequels. And this one was no exception for Disney people to give a bad story to get a quick reward. Somehow, although I did not pay to see it, I feel cheap watching it. <br /> <br /> Ariel is already an adult and had a daughter. However, he does not allow his daughter to enter the sea because of some inactive threat from the sister of the deceased sea witch. We're going again. <br /> <br /> The daughter is cheated (of course) and helps sea witch. After not so great battle is overcome, and mermaids and people live in harmony. Yawn. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to watch. Return to your life. "RE-"
