TiVo recorded it because of Angelina Jolie. It had 2.5 stars. It seemed promising. It went down quickly. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of taking over, even from Angelina. He is about 20 years old and plays at the age of 16. There are three characters to be Italian. Everyone else is Italian-American. The native Italian accents were good, I thought. The young man leads sweetly, says my wife. Everyone else in this movie is a fat Italian. Even men. <br /> <br /> I should have known that when Dick Van Patten was planted in randy with a doctor, it was a bad sign. Two pairs chasing their children are like four Italian birds. <br /> <br /> My wife did not let go of the remote control. I hope she did not take tips, clothes or decorations. It was a sick and twisted combination of hideous and flashy. It was hidegarishous. <br /> <br /> Cutting the left ventricle was not enough to distract attention from the pain of watching this movie. If this movie appears on the TV screen, do yourself a favor and instead push your head through the TV screen. You'll be glad you did it. The only movie I've ever seen was worse than "Hamburger: The Movie." And maybe "Deadly Friend".
