First of all, I apologize for awarding even 1 assessment of this film (no less than available). The film ends in failure in each section, be it scenario, direction, characterization or acting. <br /> <br /> 1) To start with, the name of the movie is really C (although the movie itself matches the name). 2) Amitabh Bachchan tries to live in accordance with the character, but a weak script combined with a pitiful direction makes him become humorous. 3) In Sholay Gabbar Singh has a prize of 50,000 (which was convincing). Here in Aag this number was 100 crores for Babbana (Amitabh Bachchan, but the poor man was beaten by our so-called heroes and only had a few maneuvers (with all the machines) does not look convincing 4) As for Nisha Kothari, someone must tell her that she does not know the actress. Why is Ram Gopal Verma throwing her over and over again? 5) Mohanlal was good, but there is almost nothing to do. 6) Sushant Singh and Rajpal Yadav, who are great actors, are wasted in the film. 7) The role of Legendry performed by Lili Misra (Mausi from Basanti) in Sholay has been replaced in this movie by a mother named Gang. Ramu, please grow up and understand that there must be an intellect in your movie. Enough stupid characters in your movie like Shiva and Aag. 8) We should not talk about contemporary Jai and Veeru..pathetic to the greatest extent. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I was shocked to see this movie because it looks like a cheap and comic translation of the original classic. Do not waste your money and time on this movie. I think watching Aap Ka Surror (which I thought was the worst movie possible) would be a better idea than seeing this horrible package of stupid characters, bad songs and poor direction. <br /> <br /> Thanks, Saurabh
