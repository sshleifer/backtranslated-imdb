Definitely the most important requirement for any film after cheating trust is that they must, at least from time to time, be able to attract us to themselves, as well as their stupid characters, cops, crowd and (ideally) themselves. But this movie NEVER removes it. Every cheat can be seen, moving away by a mile (especially biggen!). They are also not very interesting, complicated or sophisticated. Perhaps Mammet hoped to compensate for this by quick dialogue and complex psychological relations. If so, he failed. The lines are fine, but they are delivered in such a stiff, unnatural, stylized way that I thought that maybe some smart point was about us all working all the time ... but it was not. As for the psychological complexity, the main character is a bit suppressed and makes some ridiculously forced Freudian mistakes about her father think she's a whore, but she cares. I really liked the street scenes. It looked like a picture of Edward Hopper.
