About her! For the first time, I heard about this bad show when one of my friends shouted like the idiot "JOHNY TEST" while playing video games. I thought he was confusing "Johny Quest" (by the way, one of the best cartoons I've ever seen in my life) and changing "Quest" to "Test". It's strange that I'm wrong, but actually I was wrong, did not change anything, heard about this program. <br /> <br /> One day, while watching TV, I heard that Cartoon Network will be released. What was the story of this series, so I decided to watch it, and here is my answer "I WANT MY HOUR BACK" (Because I watched this nonsense and "My partner in the gym is a monkey". /> This is one of the worst performances I have ever seen, first the beginning, with the stupidest song in the world, then the story Oh, where are my mannerisms? is about a boy who has AMAZING SMART SISTERS who have a lab and experiment with their own brother OHHH, now I see why it's called Johnny TEST, is a test of his experiments siÃ³str. br /> You know, I sincerely miss La Dexter b (before it was transformed into NEW Dexter, it's also a lot of nonsense.) It's a bad copy of this good old program, except that this show is incredibly bad. Do not watch it, create something more productive in half an hour than watch this nonsense.
