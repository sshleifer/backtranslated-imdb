If someone really wants to understand Hitler, read the story of World War I, not the history of World War II. Find out what happened during this war, how soldiers had to live all around the dead corpse. As many soldiers went crazy with what they saw during the First World War, at the time when they called it "strangled", now it is called post-traumatic stress disorder. If you know the true horrors of World War I, you will begin to understand Hitler. You will understand how a man can be anesthetized to death, not because of his evil, but simply because it was the only way for them to deal with the horrors around them. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie will not notice because so many others do. Read a few books on this subject and you should watch the film "glory path", the only good movie from the First World War. You will see the frustration of the soldiers in this film, the sense of helplessness and the complete devaluation of human life, nothing more than the catchers of bullets. <br /> <br /> This is what is missing in this film, it is really the key to understand Germany. A lost war in which millions of Germans lost their lives for no real reason. Then there is a complete economic collapse after the war. These are factors that cause extremism. <br /> <br /> The loss of family members and huge poverty will always lead to extremism. Unfortunately, this movie ignored these factors and became another piece of nonsense that he threw on the stack. There really is no value, there are fictitious videos based on fictional characters that can give you a better idea for Hitler than this. They just put Hitler's name on it to sell more.
