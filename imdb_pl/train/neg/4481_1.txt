I was skeptical when I saw Calvin Kline's ads for the first time, but I thought I would give him a chance. I saw it, and the only thing I can say is bleh. This movie was so bad. It's rare that I hate film so much. Watching this movie reminded me of these funny scenes from Altman's The Player, when the writers present bizarre ideas to the producers. I would like to know which MTV producer decided that an hour and a half adaptation of the Bronte video (but this time Heathcliff is called Heath and is a rock star, and Hindley is called Hendrix) would be a good idea. /> <br /> Even if it was not so bad, if they did not get all the other aspects of the film so badly wrong. The direction had to be "you are lonely, sulk for me". I laughed loudly during all the "serious" scenes and I was bored all the time. Working with the camera was jagged and repeatedly reminded me that I was watching a bad movie, trying to be sharp. My theory is that the guy with the sound got bored and went to the beach for a few beers with a boom - in the middle of the scenes I only heard waves. And in other scenes, I would like to hear all that I could hear. Speaking of sound, what they did with the Sisters of Mercy song, "More," is absolutely unforgivable, it's unforgivable again, what they did with Bronte. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there was one funny scene - specifically the moment when Johnny Whitworth licked Katherine Heigl's face - and if you can tell me what this scene has to do with the rest of the story, more power for you.
