not in a funny way. it's just bad. it's shocking that people have published positive things here. the story sucks, acting is bad, it's not scary, special effects are not special - oh no! the board has his hands! oh, the mirror turned into water! Hair, clothes and make-up in the 1950s scenes are not accurate and prompted a middle-aged man with a receding hairline to play a high school version of the tutorial. it's like a nightmare on the elm streets. I am glad that I can sit down to watch how bad a horror movie, like any other, but there are also better bad ones to choose from.
