I do not remember seeing another movie about murder / mystery so bad. This film about a forensic doctor who investigates his friend's mysterious death in a car accident has complete proof of a bad movie: bad acting, boring history, no tension, bad mood and no drama. I remembered seeing this movie on PAX, a TV station worthy of attention to making low-budget and camp TV movies like this one. Television films, of course, do not have an edge factor or tension like movies from the Great Screen. But this movie certainly hit all the acidic flavors. The creators of this film missed the opportunity to create "Receipe for Murder" as a great television movie; the title offers some tension. <br /> <br /> So if you want a good recipe, do not watch this movie. This movie alone can kill TV appetite. <br /> <br /> Degree F
