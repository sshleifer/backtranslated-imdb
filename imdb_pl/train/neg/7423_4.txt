There is not much to say about the Las Vegas Lady. It is quite harmless, but not much more than a boring movie from the 70's. The film is neither as smart nor as sexy as you want. The plot is a repetition of the historical story of the theft of a tired old casino that was made to die. Except for the Las Vegas Lady, I think the conspiracy was designed by a 3-year-old. The plan includes three women? one to unnecessarily and clearly see the outside of the Circus Cicus building, one to pose as a waitress just to blow her cover off at the first opportunity, and one to stand around showing her cleavage. That's it. Complicated, eh? Other than Stella Stevens and her mentioned breasts, other women involved in the story are not particularly unforgettable. Las Vegas Lady cooperates with Stuart Whitman. When he does not catch Stevens, his participation in the film is emphasized by one of the most idiotic gunfights ever made in the film. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this movie. It's the 70's that I always like and some cool shots from Las Vegas around 1975. But the film itself is too boring to rate above 4/10 ?? and it probably exaggerates. After all, Lady Las Vegas is a loss of a perfect cleavage.
