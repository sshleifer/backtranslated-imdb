I'm a fan of Matthew Modine, but this movie - which I came across on the cable - is absolutely pointless. I see that the screenwriter and director were the same, so there was no one to check her worst instincts. There are no surprises, no original lines or original characters. The goldfish was basically the most nice character. What a loss of all this acting talent. Given how expensive it is now to make a film in New York, I have to think about how it happened. And if you're wondering why I watched him at all, he appeared after the movie I like on the cable and left it when I was working on the computer. This is not a very demanding picture!
