However, BATMAN AND ROBIN earns the budget and the time limits of series production at the very bottom of the "cliffhanger" list, completely devoid of the style, imagination and atmosphere of its predecessor from 1943, BATMAN. <br /> <br /> The producer, Sam Katzman, was known as "King of the Quickies" and, like its director, Spencer Bennett, seemed more interested in speed and efficiency than generating emotions. (Unfortunately, the band also produced Superman's two series, starring Kirk Alyn, with their cheap flying animation, canned music and boring auxiliary players.) Opening each chapter offers a taste of things that will come: totally incorrect titles ("Robin Rescues" Batman, "Batman vs Wizard", mechanical rumble of music, and our two heroes stumble towards the camera, looking around, confused or having trouble looking through their cheap Halloween masks Batman's shield, with devil horns and an eagle's beak, fits so poorly that the stuntman must adjust it during battle scenes: his "utility belt" is a crumpled strip of material without compartments from which he manages to pull out the soldering lamp and oxygen tube at critical moments! <br /> <br /> In any case, the leading players they are poorly manned, Robert Lowery shows little charm or individual talent like Bruce Way ne and does not cut particularly dynamic characters as Batman. It creates the impression that he would rather be somewhere, anywhere else! John Duncan, as Robin, has considerable difficulty in handling limited dialogue. He's too old for this part, with an older stuntman filling him up. In addition to the costume, Lowery and Duncan are as exciting as tired businessmen setting out for a drink, without one ounce of chemistry visible between Lewis Wilson and Douglas Croft in the 1943 series. <br /> <br /> Although the series were not known to develop the earlier form BATMAN managed to present a more energetic cast. This offers the group moving through the movements, not the fact that the filmmakers provide great support. None of the thugs stand out and are led by one of the most boring villains, "The Wizard." (Great name!) In fact, someone leads them with a veil, a shawl and a sack on their heads, with a dubbed voice that desperately tries to threaten. "The main suspects" - an eccentric professor, a radio broadcaster - are simply annoying. <br /> <br /> Even the established comedians of "regulars" are unnecessary. It is difficult to see many romances between Vicki Vale and Bruce Wayne. Despite the dangers she faces, Vicki shows no emotion. Commissioner Gordon is not very clear. Unlike the previous series, Alfred butler is an ordinary walk, whose most important line is "Mr. Wayne's residence". They are props for a dragged, catchy, incoherent plot, burdened with yet inspired, repetitive music and an amateur production project. The exterior of Wayne Manor resembles a suburban middle-class home in any sitcom, the interior of a cheap roadside motel. Batcave is an office that desperately needs refurbishment. (Costumes are rolled up in a filing cabinet!) <br /> <br /> It's a pity that the filmmakers could not invest more in creating an exciting adventure. While the availability of two series on DVD is a plus for any serious "Batfan", you can not be fooled by the perfect illustrations on the box. They capture more authentic comic mood than all 15 chapters of BATMAN AND ROBIN combined. <br /> <br /> Good news now - this is not the 1997 version!
