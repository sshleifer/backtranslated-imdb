First watched on December 26, 2008 - (Dir-Eugene Levy): The secret of comedy murder with few laughs. The film appears to be based on an earlier Italian film by subtitles, but was rewritten by two rather popular American writers of romantic comedies. But this one by Charles Shyer and Nancy Meyers does not limit him compared to other efforts. The story of a few laid-back traveling Americans, played by Richard Lewis and Sean Young, who stumbled upon a lost dog and hope to make a fortune for a cash prize after seeing the advertisement in the dachshund's return newspaper. Trying to return it, they see a hand protruding from the garage door in the lady's residence, which they think is attached to the rest of the dead woman's body to give them money. They rage and instead of contacting the police and telling them the truth they reveal like escapees from the scene, expecting to be made into murder. The other film heroes meet on the train ahead of them and wander around at the Monte Carlo gambling center, doing different things that should be drawn into the story. The other cast members are actors John Candy, James Belushi, Cybill Shepherd, George Hamilton and others. After the police learn about death, they start interrogating the main characters and, of course, have to work in their stupid lies to find out what really happened. None of the actors mentioned before can derive this film from the average state, despite some funny moments, which are usually provided by the pair Belushi / Shepherd. It's not a scary movie, it's just not good. There's a lot of mediocre movies out there, and that's just another movie on the stack. Try it, you might like it, you probably will not.
