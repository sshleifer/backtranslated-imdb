This movie is so bad that you almost feel contaminated with it. Actually, there is a strong sense of relief when it's over, a relief that you can put the tape back into the rewinder and RUSH is back to the video library before it contaminates the rest of the video collection. I jokingly suggested when we rented it, that it looks like a movie in which William Hurt "rings" in its performance. I mean, he will not try very hard. But here in the huge number of scenes in this movie, Bill Hurt is actually ON THE PHONE! Our realization of this irony was the only pleasure that we derived from this confusion. Pictures and editing are muddy and dazed, the story is chaotic, and the soundtrack is barely audible. There is very little resemblance to "Falling Down", but this movie had a bold, disturbing story, great writing and acting, and an engaging soundtrack. A "polluted man" is just some broken old European tourist trap, and watching it is like riding an unknown back way in an unknown country, where you do not speak the language in constant rain just after dark, when the windscreen keeps fogging. Do you get a picture? Do not get it.
