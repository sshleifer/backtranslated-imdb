... when he rewrote Broadway BILL (1934) as RIDING HIGH (1950). The transformation of Bing Crosby into DAN BROOKS did not help in the "outdated" scenario at 34, let alone 50. This sad movie has entire scenes lifted from the original, and many of the cast repeated their roles unless they were dead. Although the older one did not matter to the director. Neither cars nor clothes in the foundations from 1934. They did not match the standards from the 1950s. Even the song "der Bingel" can not make this effort. <br /> <br /> We have evaluated both the original and the remake of the IMDb Four **** Stars. Frank's touch has long passed and only CAPRA-CORN remained. This, however, did not stop Mr Capra. After making several documentaries in the 1950s, he transformed his career LADY FOR A DAY (1933) as POCKETFUL OF MIRACLES (1961). Again a great throw was cast on this effort IMDb Six ****** Star compared to the originals of the Eight ******** Stars. Sometimes it is better to quit smoking when you were before us, right after UNION (1948).
