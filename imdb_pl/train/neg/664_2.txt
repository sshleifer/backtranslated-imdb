I do not like remakes or the theft of modern jargon "retellings", but this movie really pissed me off. The original "Prom Night", although in my humble respect was not a masterpiece, she was still aware of what it was ... a horror movie. There are a few simple things to remember when creating a horror movie. The suspension is crucial to keep the audience interested. I'm sorry, but a white movie that was not! The horrors were cheap and horribly billed. (A good example of the scare that has been made to abuse now is that the cat popping out of the closet, and shortly thereafter, after the movie villain unexpectedly appears), this movie could not successfully break it, so how could I expect that it will fulfill other horror conventions. There must be a nice hero or heroine. This movie does not have one. The person I identified the most was the chief detective. His calm attitude, but the level approach to the murderer's escape was what should have more films of this kind. A healthy approach to the events that occur. (If you run away from the psycho-armed ax, you turn and sprint in the opposite direction. Do not trot, while looking back three seconds, judging the progress of the killer, you only stumble over every branch and inanimate object on your way). If your friend disappears, you are not looking for him alone. And if you suspect that you are playing in an unclean way, you are telling someone and not researching yourself. These stereotypes are tired and well-reproduced. In the genre of horror in general, and in this film in particular.
