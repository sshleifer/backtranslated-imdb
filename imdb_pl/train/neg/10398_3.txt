There's nothing wrong with a popcorn movie to keep you out of the streets. Just some are better than others. This is very weak. Acting is terrible, the script is terrible; and special effects are overrated. <br /> <br /> Why does Hollywood treat the audience with such contempt? And why they created a sequel?
