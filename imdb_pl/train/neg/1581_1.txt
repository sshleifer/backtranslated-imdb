It was a waste of 75 minutes of my life. Acting was awful, and the plot was ridiculous. She revolves around a bad lesbian who gets rich married men to have sex with her and then blackmail them for money. One of the victims is a candidate for DA, which causes problems in his relationship with his wife. Another is a plastic surgeon, also married, and a bad lesbian also happens to seduce this guy's wife! Meanwhile, a bad lesbian girl really does not like her sleeping. It ends with a happy ending where everything is forgiven. Women also get very naked, mainly in situations that stretch reality. bad angry bad.
