I imagine that young people involved in the creation of "Necromancy" (aka "The Witching" plus a few other titles) must have felt a bit strange on the set of a horror movie with a man who: participated with John Houseman in the production of proletarian art ("The cradle will rock "); scared people who thought aliens invaded ("War of the Worlds"); and directed and played in the largest movie of all time ("Citizen Kane"). And now Orson Welles performed in the third film about Satanic worship. <br /> <br /> There's nothing creative about this movie. A lot of nudity, but the background music always turns out to be really distracting. Even if the film was not particularly predictable, it was still not worth seeing. How well Welles sank. Fortunately, during the last thirteen years of his life, he recounted the documentary "Bugs Bunny Superstar" (about the Warner Bros. cartoons from the 1940s) and hosted the documentary "The Man who Saw Tomorrow" (about Nostradamus). I recommend these two, but not this. Just avoid. <br /> <br /> There are also Pamela Franklin and Michael Ontkean.
