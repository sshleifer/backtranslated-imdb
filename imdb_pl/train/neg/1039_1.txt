This "movie" is one of the most terrifying things I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and avoid this incompetent potion. <br /> <br /> Shaking the camera and having actors adopt grimacing does not count as the "direction" that this film needed in the crowd. Not that writing is wonderful, we rather have been with a group of completely artificial characters directed in the most artificial way (pseudo documentary "style" appreciated by those who do not know how to direct). > <br /> This movie gives the impression that it has been made cynically to appeal to critics who do not know the first thing in making movies (which is mostly of them). <br /> <br /> Just horrible. He talks about Sundance a lot and what happened to Victor Vargas was presented there.
