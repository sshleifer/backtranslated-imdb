It is not obvious from watching this film (so I recommend to viewers the study of people who present their case in it), but this presentation on the realities of Islam and its encouragement of violence and intolerance towards all non-Muslims is lacking objectivity, and also completely does not take attention of the human condition. Documenting that the Koran says a lot about how a devout Muslim must interact with non-Muslims is something else, but any realist can understand that not every person who feels a Islamist will agree and I adhere to all the principles of this faith and system. There are many reasons why you can challenge the presenters, so that viewers must see the presentation with healthy skepticism; do not swallow all this, hook, line and weight, without some sort of thinking. <br /> <br /> For example, one of them concerns the study of a person named Walid Shoebat; who claims to be a former Muslim who committed an act of terrorism in Bethlehem. There are many wise people in the world who do not believe in any of these claims. I'm neither a nor a Muslim. I have never read the Koran. I am not a Christian or a member of any faith. But I am an intelligent and demanding man. While the film is quite disturbing, in its presentation, SOME Muslims perceive their commitments to Islam; I remind you that Islam is more than fundamentalist views. Just as they are fundamentalists and evangelical Christians, there are differences in the intensity of beliefs and commitments among Jews and Muslims. <br /> <br /> When you watch this movie, you must have a hand shaker. One grain is not enough, you will need more. Use your own mind and think for yourself, explore what is being presented and evaluate the state of the world and how Islam fits into it, based on more than what has been said in 98 minutes of video. There is a common thread of political affiliation between those who connect this film together, pointing to some prejudices. Be your own brain.
