If you're wondering how many conspiracy theories and paranoid views about the UN, Israel and international affairs come from, look no further. <br /> <br /> This is not a supernatural Hollywood movie loosely based on some biblical passage. Instead, the film was shot by a company (Cloud Ten Pictures) with a political and religious program. As a film, the final result sometimes looks like clips from the televangelism program (along with family prayers and the breaking of light through the church windows while playing the harp). <br /> <br /> For mainstream viewers, it may be hard to believe, but many people believe these things literally, as shown in the movie. And that can make the movie important. You probably will not find a more concise description of the bizarre views of a significant number of your fellow citizens. So if you look at it, look at it as a social / cultural document. If you are experienced in the media at all, you do not have to be warned about insubordinate attempts to propagate and manipulate the film.
