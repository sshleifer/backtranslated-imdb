The first Cruel Intentions, the original, is my favorite movie of all time. It was an absolute masterpiece. So how the devil could make a sequel so bad. Sarah Michelle Gellar was perfect in the first movie. In this case, Amy Adams sucks. It's terrible. Could not they find a chick that would actually look like Sarah Michelle Gellar? At least the same hair color !!! come on. Robin Dunn is not as bad as Adams, but he is absolutely horrible compared to Ryan Phillipe. Sebastian in the first film is cunning, lying and much more evil than Sebastian in the prequel. And what about the story. Basically, it looks so ... <br /> <br /> 1- Sebastian has a bad representative in his first school, says the movie, although he does not mention him or his date and life Girls 2- Sebastian moves to New York and suddenly he decides to turn away. "Falling in love" with Danielle (maybe I remind you that in the original Sarah Michelle the giller says: "you broke up with the FIRST PERSON you ever loved, because I said, how could he be in love with the prequel ???) And he is all nice and charming, and the whole "good man" because he rejects sex from the chick his dad did. three of them at the end of the movie, and then seduce Cherry. <br /> <br /> I mean, it's horrible, and I loved it the first one. I have not seen the third yet. I hope that God will be better than this prequel.
