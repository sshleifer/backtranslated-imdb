I am really surprised that this movie has such a ranking! I have not seen such a bad movie for years. It was a really bad movie. Splatter, it is not enough to describe unnecessary (almost funny) blood scenes). If you do not like hostel2 or Wolf Creek or Halloween (2007) ... is it 10 times worse. The story reminds me of RL Stine goosebumps.! <br /> <br /> I can not say about acting, because the script was so horrible. (why do I have to write 10 lines? I have never understood it.) <br /> <br /> == Spongers are coming == <br /> <br /> The story is about a butcher killing people all the time in the subway. We're talking about thousands of homicides and nobody notices. Actually, people just went missing. And there is a good guy who tries to solve the mystery (well, there's no secret for us because we know the wrong guy from the beginning) and as usual, no one believes him! What a surprise! Finally, he puts on the butcher's clothes and fights to death with a deadly butcher!
