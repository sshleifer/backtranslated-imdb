This film is really ONLY an interpretation of religion by Bill Maher. There are a few funny moments and some interesting points, but do not go in, expecting an equal discussion about religion. What I consider to be the worst kind of documentary - everything is organized in advance and during editing to give you the director's opinion and not let you make your own decision. <br /> <br /> EDITION - It is very fragmented, combined with clips from pop culture and the media to strengthen this point. The interlocutor barely has a chance to finish the sentence before the edition is interrupted. The only people who have a chance to express their mind are those who say what Bill Maher wants to say. When someone departs from the gospel according to Maher, he is assembled. <br /> <br /> INTERVISISTS - They are to represent the absolute MOST extremist religions. From the TV gospel to the ultimate Jewish stereotype, to the TRUCK STOP chapel (SERIOUS AND TRUCK CHAPEL). He chose the worst villains, heavy extremists and those who do not have the budget to say "no" to choose them. And when a good man makes a job interview, he edits the hell out of them. <br /> <br /> STEREOTYPING - All religions are presented as stereotypes. Muslims are particularly hard hit. In the Muslim segment, he hardly gives anyone the chance to speak before he pauses, or by editing himself with suicide bombers. ALL Muslims are portrayed as editors firing a firearm by the editors, and none of the people interviewed are edited in a fair manner. the idea is not presented honestly to countless people who are not religious extremists. Bill Maher explains, while the destruction clips play in the foreground. It gives you literally the message that religion is stupid and dangerous and that it will destroy the world. He also states that everyone involved in religion is stupid. <br /> <br /> With the disadvantages of the movie has some good sides, and humor, although very unfair, is really funny. But know that this is a very one-sided view of religion, according to Bill Maher. He does not discover anything. He tells you what he thinks. <br /> <br /> 4/10 - A few good moments, but hard with an extremely irresponsible documentary style.
