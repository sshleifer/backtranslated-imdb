This movie is absolutely frightening. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. History almost does not exist, characters are full of stereotypes, and special effects only cause laughter. The only remarkable thing about this movie is the guest appearance of Rapper Coolio as a kind of policeman. <br /> <br /> If this movie was to be a comedy, I did not fully understand it. If you want to watch this movie: get drunk first, then get ready for good laughter ... especially when the first special effects appear on the screen. <br /> <br /> But if you like to make cheap junk movies: this movie is compulsory.
