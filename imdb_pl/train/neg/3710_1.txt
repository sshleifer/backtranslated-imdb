King does not live long king! Triada Caddy Shack Two, The Family under the Stairs and Troop Beverly Hills have been associated with the worst film for so long that they seemed to be icons. But there is a new king ... yes ... everyone is welcoming the new king .... "To the ground." But some things, like Little Tim, are so bad that they're good. One day, it could win a unique "Rocky Horror Picture Show" as a cult movie. So go see this ... it ... well, just take it for a word. Go see it. Everyone is welcoming the new king!
