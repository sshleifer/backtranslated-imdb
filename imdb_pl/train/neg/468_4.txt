Before I commented on the movie I just watched on YouTube, I must admit that the reason I checked it was to see what I saw for the first time in TV commercials in 1980: Barbara Bach's neckline. And because the film received the grade R, I expected to see her naked. Unfortunately, there is no bone for her, or any other great actress who appeared here: Stacey Nelkin, who was supposed to be a teenager, but in fact she was 20 when she did. Watching her in a bra and panties, and later in a belly dancer dress was just as exciting as Mrs. Bach. They provide some of the scattered laughter that this movie provides. In fact, I do not blame Ron Leibman for removing his name from the subtitles, because his role as a tight Liceman is quite embarrassing, although I liked the scene of "seduction" which he did with Mrs. Nelkin. It also happens that the debut of Ralph Macchio, who is a loner among maladjusted to an academic school. Others are a black kid who really loves his stepmother, and Mrs. Bach, an Arab who venerates engine oil, and a politician who loves his girlfriend Candy (Nelkin) so much, risks sneaking in the middle of the night, see her at the girls' academy. Among the supporting cast, Tom Poston plays a swishy character named Sisson, which I found partly funny. Written by Tom Patchett and Jay Tarses and directed by Robert Downey Sr. (whose son Robert Downey Jr. has a football scene at the beginning), Up the Academy is uneven with politically incorrect humor, but unless you're really offended by scatological and sexual content, it's actually quite a harmless comedy that Mad Magazine and her son-cover Alfred E. Newman should not be ashamed, although in the past their name and character were removed from the photo. .PS Another "unadapted" was Harry Teinowitz, who was born in my hometown of Chicago, Illinois. He played Rodney Ververgaert. He also says one of my favorite lines: "I'm trying to come."
