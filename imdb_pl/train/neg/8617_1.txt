After watching 10 minutes of this movie I was stunned, watching 30 minutes of rolling my fingers - I just could not believe it: the movie is really awful. In fact, it is so horrible that I had to watch it all to see (!). At the time, I realized that it reminded me of a few Danish so-called comedies from the 60's and 70's. The pattern looks as follows: take one extremely popular comedian, make a scenario in which this comedian will put in as many grotesque situations as possible, add some jokes (especially one-liners) and replace him with beautiful young girls - shoot it and refer success! I would not know if this movie was a success, but unlike the Danish tradition, which died peacefully (with some great comedians), it seems that there is a market for this kind of movie in the US.
