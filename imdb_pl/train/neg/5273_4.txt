*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** When I saw the preview of this movie, I thought it would be at least some admirable plot. But like most of the original superstition movies, I was disappointed. This gullible family travels through this "deserted" city to stop and find this video camera, showing that these people do everything they donig and find out that in the end all disappear, the family goes through all these mysterious stages and never discovers nor does it show the heck of persecution. There are more of them than I can count and they do not explain anything that happens, how or what. It ends when the family gets a car accident and gets a pose or brainwash or something (which will never be explained). The next thing you know, hoping to somehow find out how it all happened, but ends up being completely confused.
