I saw the movie last night here at home, but I thought it was mainly too long. Secondly, the things I saw in the movie were too exhausted to have something that I thought was supposed to be a comedy movie like the rest before. This is not funny in the movie: the fianc√© hits his girlfriend, beats. The film was too long - say that you want to go to sleep and wonder when it will end when you wake up and continue to play! Some things at the meeting were too big to capture - like a lady singing - I felt I was almost watching a spiritual song here! Come on Perry, you can do better!
