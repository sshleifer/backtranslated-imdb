I ended up watching The Tenants with my close friends who have rented the movie solely on the basis of the look of Snoop Dogg (their passionate fetish) on the cover. Understandably, I did not expect much. I thought that the film will contain a typical set of behaviors and images associated with Snoop Dogg, often found in stereotypical rap movies. However, my generalization was mostly incorrect. Unfortunately, it did not make the movie better. <br /> <br /> Most of them would describe the movie as a dark, serious drama, while I would describe it as a darkly seriously boring drama. The film tells the story of two fighting writers (Dylan McDermott and Snoop Dogg) who are trying to create their own separate masterpieces. Their polar opposing lifestyle ends in the creation of an unlikely, but very complex and neurotic friendship. This friendship moves throughout the film like a wild roller coaster - most of them come from the Snoop character - it reminds someone with a severe personality split. And although the movie is a drama, acting - which has a morbid and serious tone - from Snoop and the company was more comical than anything else. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to those who are weakened because it has a lot of dialogue and a lot more dialogue after that. There are some mediocre conflicts, but even they are mostly flooded with dialogue. The end, however, jumped on me with a sudden surprise. It was a bit twisted, slightly unexpected and a great way to end the movie, which had to end. While watching the final credits, I could not refrain from imagining the director thinking, "Oh God, how the hell do I have a nap?" Incidentally, the director laid out carefully planted clues and subtleties leading to culmination - all of which are more visible than Waldo on a crowded street of dwarfs, wearing only black sweaters.
