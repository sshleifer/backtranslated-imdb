I bought the Zombie Bloodbath trilogy, thinking it would be mindless, bloody fun. Yes, no fun. This movie is really thoughtless, there is no story, no character development, no plot. The main problem of this movie is killing and gore. Basically, every murder looks exactly the same. ZOmbies takes someone away from her. Yes, that's fine, but you also need some original killings. I mean, it really happened bad, every murder looked exactly the same, it was shot in exactly the same way. It killed me. I love gore, and the blood in this movie did not do anything for me. It was just boring. No plot, just the same lame scene with another person. I also wanted to like this movie. I love to shoot videos from upstairs ... like Zombie Redneck. But I could not fool myself. This movie has its good sides, but none of them is in the movie. I understand that many "zombies" helped in the flood and there were over 100 zombies, which is pretty cool, where so many people took them and helped them in the world. But overall, it's a horrible movie.
