This film is the announcement of the continuation of The Full Monty, about unemployed men in Sheffield. <br /> <br /> As someone born in Sheffield and still having connections with the city, I was very disappointed with this movie. Someone said it could be arranged in Oklahoma, and that sums it up for me. It looked like a romantic view of northern England on the American market. Probably many Americans - and many Southern English - do not realize that Sheffield is a large city with around half a million inhabitants, with refined urban culture. In "Among the Giants" he was portrayed as a gloomy, blind, half-village town where everyone in Sheffield seemed to drink in the same old-fashioned pub, and the idea of ​​people dancing to a party in a country house looks like. It was a small, compact community, not a metropolis. <br /> <br /> Workers from Sheffield were completely different from their real counterparts who are generally silent and communicate with each other with murmur and brevity of dry remarks. They do not talk, and certainly they do not sing in choirs. <br /> <br /> Even the rural surroundings, apparently in the Peak District, looked alien to me. I recognized several places where I used to go hiking, but some aerial shots of pylons stretching over a bleak landscape reminded me more of Wales. Indeed, in the credits at the end, I noticed a reference to Gwynedd in Wales. The Peak District, in the summer, crawls among walkers and tourists in cars. It is located between two large cities. This is not some wild desert. <br /> <br /> As for the idea that a young woman can fall in love and desire, Pete Postlethwaite, it was ridiculous and could only be a male dream. The reasons why she became his lover were never visible. None of the men were presented as having a partner or family; they existed in a vacuum. <br /> <br /> Anyone who would like to see a movie about the unemployed Sheffielders would be led astray. This Sheffield existed only in the minds of his middle class writers and filmmakers. <br /> <br /> It was a gigantic trick! <br /> <br />
