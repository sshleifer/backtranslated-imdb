I really did not like this movie because it did not really bring the messages and ideas that L'Engle presented in her novel. We read the novel in our English class and I loved it, I'm afraid I can not say the same for the movie. There were major differences between the novel and the adapted version, and it simply did not deserve the ingenious genius of Madeleine L'Engle! This is the reason why I judged him so badly. Do not watch this movie if you're a huge fan of L'Engle lyrics because you will be very disappointed. However, if you are watching a movie for entertainment (or educational purposes, as it was in my case), then this is a good movie!
