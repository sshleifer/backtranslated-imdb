My summary in one line should explain all this, but I will think about it. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning this movie seemed like an exaggerated soap opera and that's all I can comment on. There were some interesting scenes, such as "Great", which hit the middle of the movie, but wait, what is it? The earthquake * puffs *, wait a moment! It's Dante's Summit! Well, some of them have been massacred and slapped. I can not believe how bad the film was made, "borrowing" scenes from other, much better films. One wonders what the director thought the viewers are stupid enough to believe that in the center of LA, al Dante's Peak, there are large, forested mountain landscapes. <br /> <br /> My advice, forget about Bond Wanna-be, Nash, in this movie and go for the real thing (again by chance with Dante's Peak.) <br /> <br />
