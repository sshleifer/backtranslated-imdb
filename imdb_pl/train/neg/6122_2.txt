Certainly one of the most reckless remakes of the classics in film history - especially since the promise of his tag "The most beautiful woman of our time in the most erotic adventure of all time" is not properly used! Although this movie was regularly shown on television on my neck, since childhood, his publicity (for horrors, not erotic content, remember this) kept me away from it so far - and only gave way, because recently I was enjoying Bo Derek, the previous film, 10 (1979), and watched many fantastic things during the holiday season. <br /> <br /> The main actress / producer Bo Derek is rather ridiculous by playing an innocent sexual student (a witness inept banana scene) and, as you might expect, she was forced to take off her clothes several times, but just like a mile these scenes were seen, she left much more sensually than in 10 times; Richard Harris therefore chews the scenery constantly as a father obsessed with Jane, but John Philip Law barely registers himself as his adjutant who humbly shows some initial interest in Jane herself; novice Miles O'Keeffe has the title role and makes his entry into the film takes only 45 minutes, he is completely silent, with the exception of the famous fir tree (which was already removed from Johnny Weissmuller!), and in addition is the same expressive like trees hanging at regular intervals through the other half of the movie! for the recording, he appeared later in two ATOR films (or would-be CONAN imitators) for Joe D'Amato and a set from the era of King Arthur, SWORD OF THE VALIANT (1984). <br /> <br /> When the actor, director John Derek (who also serves as the cinematographer) worked with several good artists (Cecil B. De Mille, William Dieterle and Robert Rossen) and some great (Otto Preminger, Nicholas Ray and Don Siegel), but he clearly learned from them zilch, because his direction is the main responsibility: sometimes appallingly pretentious (a witness of the perfectly awful sequence of Python's attack) with senseless overuse of slow motion techniques and poor transitions; it was the seventh movie of Derek as a director (and his second of four with his wife Bo), and in the end he could do only two more. <br /> <br /> The total failure of the film must be judged only by the fact that the legend of Tarzan was repeated once again in the film - in GRAYSTOKE: TREATEN LEGEND, LIST OF APES (surprisingly, I have not seen) - just three years later !! Nominated for six Razzie awards (including John Derek, Richard Harris and Miles O'Keeffe) and winning one for Bo Derek himself, TARZAN, THE APE MAN co-authored Gary Goddard, future director of another highly anticipated but ultimately disappointing silver screen transposition (this time animated) heroic character, CHAMPION OF THE UNIVERSITY (1987), which I will also visit now (yay)! Despite the charming closing sequence, in which Tarzan and Jane play with the orangutan and the musical score, which is not half as bad and captivating, all good intentions are overcome by extremely stupid backstage with the natives completely painting. White and, terribly, a clear lack of interest in John Derek in the form of Tarzan himself, who makes him an irrelevant supporting figure in his own film entitled !!
