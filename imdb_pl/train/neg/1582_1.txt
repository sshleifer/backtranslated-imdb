argh! this movie hurts my head. and not in a good way. <br /> <br /> maybe it's just my growing hatred for the action genre, but even as a child, when I would swallow guts like Navy Seals, I still considered the movie reluctant. now I despise him completely. <br /> <br /> Take one fairly good story at a fast pace. keep the title and throw the rest away. instead, use the story of future gladiators, which is so full of role-playing holes that everything is in danger of collapsing (why the rebel base is in the middle of the arena and what about the cameras? why do they have clearly marked photos of what really happened in a uneasy bakerfeild?) <br /> <br /> the whole movie screams in the eighties, from a real horrible result to silly shiny costumes. <br /> <br /> do not watch this movie. I know that some people liked it, but some people think they are pissed and I do not understand them either.
