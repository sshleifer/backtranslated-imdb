(In this review, I will point the point where spoilers start.) My dissatisfaction is divided: 30% tonal deafness, 70% poor writing. <br /> <br /> 30%: I agree with the summary of the first commentator on the lack of diversity of the character and scope of the story. I was surprised at how this movie, at best, pitifully changes the real NYC, presenting a collection of people and relationships so narrow that it can be found as if it was inhabited only by the cast of Gossip Girl (it comes from someone who likes Gossip Girl). Several minority characters are included in the stories, but they are covered by duty, while we see the tools under the film so clearly, striving for "diversity", but falling always-so short. <br /> <br /> 70% is the reason why everything falls. All figures, white and a few symbolic minorities, are one-dimensional, cardboard notches of people's concepts. Worse, their interactions with each other are written in such a way that for every vignette in the film the audience is treated as I say, "gag": we get the basic presumption and then some punch line, which is to be cleverly twisted. But even if we temporarily suspend cynicism to say, "Okay, that was a surprise" ... stories are still not that interesting because they are also shallow. When you create stories so that their existence depends only on the unexpected ending, you write jokes. <br /> <br /> Spoilery below ... <br /> <br /> The film tries to tell romantic stories first and foremost. Fine. But the romance is amazing, deep, sometimes complex. Each of these "romantic" stories contains a girl and a boy who at one point share the same location and look at each other. Exchange of words, thoughts are designed by the lector, but they are also able to convey to the audience only that one person is attracted to another. <br /> <br /> It means that there is no seduction (in a broad sense) there is no tension, no confrontation, no communion between the wills of two different people, trying to reconcile their existence to accommodate the Other. The only story with superficial "seduction" is told so that the audience is surprised that the guy (Ethan Hawke) gets upset by the girl he goes to, which turns out to be a whore unexpectedly. Sure, his words when trying to pick her up are interesting, and we are amused as if we were next to them, but there is nothing important in this story except "And then B". So it develops if something similar to a postcard could "develop" with all other stories: And then B - That is, the only thing is that they happen "on set" in Manhattan. By the way, the only Brooklyn we see is the Coney Island sketch; The only Queens is the flickering of a train ride that the hero travels to West Village. <br /> <br /> It's easy to choose movies that play all common stereotypes about race, sex, sexual orientation and soon. _ New York, I Love You_, deserves to be tightened due to its title. We expect to see real New York and real New Yorkers, but instead we showed us a demographic fragment, its heroes came from The OC, and a few others to make them NEED as if we were paying attention to diversity. But when we look closely at who these characters are, all fiction becomes an insult to the very notion of diversity and ethnicity and cultures, which the film does not shamefully portray. <br /> <br /> For example, a Hispanic story with a little white girl in a park who is mistaken for two ladies as her manna (nanny) when she is actually a father. Regardless of the fact that the last scene of this part was unnecessary from the point of view of a dramatic construction (it would be much more interesting to finish it when the mother and boy / stepfather walk the girl away), to be honest is a little disgusting that the scene in which we learn for sure that the girl's father is Latynos, ALSO must inform us that he is a sexually desirable dancer. What, Daddy can not be some South American guy? Now, when it's clearly hot, is the audience better prepared for a party that has a child with a white middle-class woman to a higher? Are we so naive to demand such? As if the Mexican construction worker would be too distasteful, of course. <br /> <br /> This is not my place to dictate where the movie should have disappeared. But in every possible setting and twists of action, the direction in which it is located shouts the status quo, and refers to security. All these stories could become more interesting, even if we had to preserve the one-dimensionality of the characters living in them, at least not choosing standard and obvious stereotypes. An Asian girl living in Chinatown, staring at a skinny old white guy? How about an Asian cougar chasing a white college boy? Again, I am not saying that all conceit must be changed. Just everyone. damn. plot assumption. it's so trite - and that's why they do not give anything away, why anyone could love New York, outside the banality. The real way to improve the movie would be to write a script worth reading. <br /> <br /> I agree with the pleasure of the soundtrack, the good tempo of the film (even if what was happening was, well, dredge) and the general feeling of many scenes. The movie was just fine, and I would not advise against it. It is said, however, that the most important homage paid to non-superficiality is what the old opera singer says (paraphrasing): "What I love in New York: everyone is from a different place". Well, you would not know this from watching this.
