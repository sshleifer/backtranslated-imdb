I believe that Shakespeare explained to me what I read beautifully. I think he (the lady) is protesting too much. The whole thing sounded to me as if the author tried to convince himself! He puts blasphemous literature (letters from the same period, but not related to the Bible) many times, but I can think of at least three references at the head, which give historical accuracy to the events contained in the Bible. Anyone can skew the data and prove anything they like, but that's not true. Duties change, the definitions of words change over time (look at English and German, where it is an obvious common root), nothing stays the same, it always grows and changes. The Bible has many different translations, but the King James version is the best when it comes to any research. In the King James version, you'll notice that there are some words in italics. These words have been added by translators and can be dropped, and the average of the entire poem will change. Writings from the time of Christ were written without spaces, without punctuation, without paragraphs and without numerical verses. These letters look like one long word, and the translators have added all of the above. For example, how would you read this: GODISNOWHERE, do you read it like there is no God anywhere, or do you read how God is here now? The same string of letters has two completely different meanings. That is why many biblical scholars use the Lexicon to help them translate because it provides words for translation from the original Arabic, Greek or Hebrew, depending on the language in which the Scriptures were originally written. It is also worth noting that after translating into symbolic logic, you can prove that God exists, but you can not prove that He does not exist! In the end, I just love to listen to people who think they are so smart that they are qualified to judge the Almighty. Talk about ego! Putting down the soap dish, God Bless Maegi
