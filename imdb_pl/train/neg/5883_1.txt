This film does not contain humor for anyone who has lived with a family member who has a mental illness. So many scenes reminded me too much of my own life experiences. This film was a male version of "Dearest Mummy." It presents both graphically and accurately the life through which many children of a mentally ill parent pass. It also shows how easily psychiatrists become corrupt and behave as if they were God. <br /> <br /> Someone told me it was funny. No way, I say! It's a bad mood at best. <br /> <br /> The movie is so intense and depressing that my son and I had to leave the room. It's best to use this movie for people who do not understand mental illness or do not believe in what we and our families experience.
