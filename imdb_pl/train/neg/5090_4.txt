<br /> <br /> Please consider whether the indictment was intended. If in 2000 there were still discrepancies in the feeling between the Caucasians and Afro-Americans, as shown in this film, there is of course a lot of backward mentality among many people. It is rather hypocrisy, to put it mildly, if everyone loves Halle Berry, Whoopie Goldberg, Beyonc√©, Noemi Campbell, Denzel Washington, Will Smith, et. al., while racial divisions persist in the back room. <br /> <br /> White grandma suddenly gets a black granddaughter on her, only to meet with a black grandfather in a very white social backwater. The story is sweet, there is no shortage of tragic undertones and it is extremely predictable, as in most of this kind of TV movies, although the last scene has guessed ... or not .......? <br /> <br /> Gena Rowlands in its usual style offers honest rendering, and Louis Gossett fits it well; little Penny Bae fortunately does not steal the spectacle. <br /> <br /> A "nice" way to relax after a Sunday lunch, without having to force your mind too much, although you can just find a small siesta in the middle of it.
