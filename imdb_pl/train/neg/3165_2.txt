this movie was awful. I thought it would be better with all those decent actors. do not waste time. Eva longoria parker was terrible. she should stick to desperate housewives. Paul Rudd becomes actor B. the mess he made in a movie that I could never be your woman was the personification of what I say. and the bell on the lake was lovely, but she definitely needed more acting lessons. look like the sky with Reese Witherspoon ... it was a bit better. or another ghost movie. you will be grateful that you have not wasted your precious time. PS I love you, it's also a good man from outside of a serious romance! it's time to start watching movies rated above 7 out of 10 and listen to people who have already seen it.
