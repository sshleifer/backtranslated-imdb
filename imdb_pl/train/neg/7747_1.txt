The mere fact that the cover is a drawing, like the old B films, should give a warning about the quality of the film. However, this is not a B movie. This is a D movie! <br /> <br /> There are no known actors, and animals - WOW - is the worst data animation ever made in the last two decades. <br /> <br /> You almost never see the smoothed SCAAAR shown on the front cover. You just hear people shout, bleed and die, and sometimes you see teeth or a tiger's paw. It's so amateur! Maybee is worth seeing, just because it is so bad. Give it to a friend and say, "This is the best movie I've ever seen and wait for their reaction." He, he. <br /> <br /> The movie is weak to give him a Spoiler Alert! THIS IS A SPOILER.
