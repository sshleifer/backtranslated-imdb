I loved the Batman TV show and really could not wait. But they tried to do too much. <br /> <br /> Why did they have the story of Adam West and Burt Ward trying to recover the batmobile was beyond me. I do not want to knock Burt or Adam in the way they look now ... 35 years have passed since they came to Batman and Robin, but seeing them dressed in costumes and fighting "badges" was a bit sad. I'd just like to see how ex-stars comment. The side story of the Batmobile was stupid. <br /> <br /> Regarding the flashback film, I think it was too short and too much omitted. In my opinion it was a really quick review. I would like more background. They showed Penguin and Joker for about a minute to tell the same things I already knew. Joker had a mustache under make-up, and the penguin had to smoke, although he hated it and was a former smoker. That was on those 2. <br /> <br /> I would like to read a book. I'm sure he has more in it. For example, why were 2 Riddlers or why 3 Catwoman's or 3 Mister Freezes. Where was Commissioner Gordon, Cheif OHara, Alfred, Mister Freeze, King Tut, etc. The list is on. As I said, even those that were in it were barely in it. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing. And really trivial.
