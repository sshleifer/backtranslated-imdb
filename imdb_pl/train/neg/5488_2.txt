Why is Colin Firth on the ground in this senseless movie? Was he really so attached to cash? <br /> <br /> The movie is not clear about what he wants to be, sadness ?, exotic places? ghosts ?, a vehicle for Mr. Darcy? It's a muddy, muddy mess. <br /> <br /> It seems that there is an idea that Italy must be good in itself, and Italy has something to offer as a language - but in the end, I just want to go back to Yankland. <br /> <br /> There are pointless episodes on the beach, in churches, on busy roads - but what it's all about, or why someone should care, it just is not clear. /> <br /> There was also a ragged woman in the film. It was not clear what the task was, but it seemed to be there just to comment on gruesome, inappropriate and bizarre comments. Was it about paedofillia? <br /> <br /> Pretty horrible mess. I gave him 2, not 1, because there is no charm of absolutely horrible movie.
