Keenan Ivory Wayans is probably one of the worst directors, I swear you do not have real knowledge about making movies. created one brilliant movie and this is a scary movie. the frightening movie 2 was also OK, but everything Keenan did was a real catastrophe. avoid such titles as not being a threat to the southern headquarters, drinking your juice in the hood ..... I know what title !!! of course this movie too, just all that is Keenans in the subtitles. <br /> <br /> it was an hour and a half of stupid nonsense that never made me laugh. just trust me, maybe women can like this movie because of some things that happen, but in general this movie will never appeal to anyone who has good taste in movies ........ .... ...
