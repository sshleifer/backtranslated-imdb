Many things become obvious while watching this movie: 1) acting is terrible. Tom Hanks and Wendy Crewson are like this, but the conflict between parents and children borders on the soap opera. The other two boys: an excessively wonderful child and your stereotypical "mom-baby-but-I-really-sensitive-inner-blonde"; 2) the film as a whole is depressing and disappointing; 3) Robbie's dreams and episodes are disturbing (performed by Tom Hanks); 4) incorporating the ballads of initial love is a strange choice ("we are all unique friends"); 5) strange lines and side motifs are no better than horrible action; and 5) is a really bad movie. Expect disappointment - and probably disturbed.
