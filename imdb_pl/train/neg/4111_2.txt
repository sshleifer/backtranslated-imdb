Think about the budget version of the Chinese film-directed syndrome, which loves John Woo, and you'll get "Power Play." The idea was good, but the execution, acting and dialogue completely killed him, not to mention the absurd amounts of violence and disaster sequences that were used to compensate for the lack of content and the development of more interesting parts of the film. > <br /> This is the story of a reporter investigating the disappearance of three members of a guerrilla group who have mysteriously gone missing after breaking into the power plant offices that are suspected of causing the earthquake craze. A fairly nonchalant reporter, opposed to what should be a more ruthless group of company bosses, is hunted down in the city (along with everyone he talks with) to "clean up" any conclusive evidence that may remain from plant errors. br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is no real sense of danger, because the characters interact with great hesitation, combined with idiotic dialogue and many terrible actors. Not to mention that a viewer who can only attract a movie because of his action genre is forced to endure a growing number of bodies and absurd amounts of violent shootings and earthquake scenes. All the stress was put in the wrong place to apologize apologizing for the lack of direction and the more interesting sequence of events that should have fueled this story. It could be much better if the filmmakers focused more on the thriller and paid more attention to the development of the corruption aspects of the story. Horrible villains, naive reporter and those who try to alert the reporter about bad behavior. This is formal, but at least it would be fun.
