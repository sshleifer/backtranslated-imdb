Because Little Mermaid was one of my favorite Disney movies when I was little, I was curious about his continuation. <br /> <br /> The Little Mermaid (one) is a classic animated feature of the highest quality, great music score and excels at the general public. Meanwhile, the Little Mermaid 2 is aimed primarily at young children because it is spontaneous, reflects the child's perspective, the music is more modest and less dramatic, and the ending is like a break. <br /> <br /> The Little Mermaid 2 begins when Melody's baby is presented to the Ariel side. Suddenly, without any visual clues to support the drama, a gigantic tentacle grabs the child. I laughed, wait a minute, it's not funny, the child is under attack! Okay, I'll stop laughing. Morgani's crime in broad daylight and its spontaneity takes away the potential drama because it happened so fast. <br /> <br /> In the whole story, Melody seems superhuman, which I defend, as most children imagine. This feature of Melody's character is clearly towards the end, when he fights with Morgana without a trace of fear on her face. <br /> <br /> As in the first movie, Melody has many Ariel problems, except in the reverse. Queen Ariel turns out to be like her father, limiting her from the ocean, while King Triton reduced Ariel from the surface. Ariel and Melody rebel against their parents. <br /> <br /> Music is more emotionally moving in the first. This sequel includes several songs, but not so many orchestral works. It is great for children because they are not impressed by the orchestra. <br /> <br /> The end of the first movie was strong and uplifting. The continuation ends with a springy song and everyone plays in the water. It's definitely more child-oriented because instead of ending it's solemn and leaving you blown away, this ending leaves you thinking: "It's time for a break!" Ultimately, this movie is fun for kids, so we should let them have fun.
