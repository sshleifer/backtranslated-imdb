I saw this movie last night (about 102 minutes) and I do not know what kept me in my place. I guess I was just expecting the Gere movie to have some value, but nothing valuable ever appeared on the screen. This story is a silly excuse to throw yourself at a shot after being captured and tortured. There is no character in the film who does something similar to real life. The cutting style is based on stroke cuts, mini-flashbacks and overprinting to give weight to this lousy gang system of sadists who apparently have fled for years and SURPRISE that the leader is the "victim" of the killer killed. I do not understand how Gere, a Buddhist, got involved in this brutal, sexist trash.
