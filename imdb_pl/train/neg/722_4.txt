One scene shows the mentality of "Terminator Woman": Karen Sheperd and another woman try to escape from the villain camp. Karen runs through an armed guard who aims at her, but after a few seconds he discards her and challenges her to fight. Karen kicks him into bullets, raises his gun and runs away! On the other hand, when a movie is directed by a martial artist and written / produced by another member of his family, you know that you should not expect too much. Karen Sheperd and Jerry Trimble are making fun jokes in the beginning, and the movie could be better if it focused more on their love-hate relationship. But after about 20 minutes they are separated, and the film slows down to creep, and even in the sporadic scene of the fight to liven up, he lacks emotions. In the final, Trimble fights Qissi in the cave, and Sheperd drives a speedboat against beautiful Ashley Hayden, but the fights are interrupted in a way that interrupts their flow and reduces their value. On the positive side, kudos to the costume department, which gave Karen the chance to show a spectacular neckline throughout the movie! (* 1/2)
