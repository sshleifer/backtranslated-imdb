It must be the worst TV program in the air. This is probably the escape of Jim Belushi and all his bad movies. His brother sucked all talent to his younger brother. I hope that this program will be canceled and will never be talked to again, except for negative use. Jim has to retire or something like that. Let them leave the air. If I am joking about this program, I will vomit and brush my eyes with a toothbrush. I'd rather be taken away from the devil myself than to watch the entire half-hour program. I still do not understand why the show is still in the air and it works. We all know deeply that we want to shoot our TV screens when we see Jim's face. In conclusion, no more please.
