This film was, as Homer Simpson put it, "more boring than the church." Maybe I do not understand it well enough and I thought it started quite well, but after (START SPOILER) Hermann Braun is sent to prison, and Maria starts to work / sleep with her boss, it just started to pull, and I struggled not to sleep. Again, maybe it symbolizes something, but the explosion at the end seemed very forced and out of place. (END OF THE SPOILER). In the end, I do not understand why others think it's so great because I found it very boring. By the way, I did not watch the movie of my own volition because I had to see it at the movie lesson.
