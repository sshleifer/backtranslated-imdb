I think this cartoon is one of the worst cartoons I've ever seen. I recommend this cartoon to people under 5 years of age. I used to be 4 and 5 years old, I liked the show, but I only watched it when there was nothing. Now I'm different and I prefer to do my homework rather than watch. The caricature was once a bit funny, but it was not enough to burst out laughing. I am now an elder I am interested in a witch show that has not been evaluated by us. I started to watch Doctor Who (12A), Torchwood (15) and Sarah Jane Adventures (PG). I'm interested in things related to Doctor Who, so I'm not interested in 5-year-old fairy tales. This cartoon did not last long, it only had six seasons, it was canceled because of the low number of viewers, but some say it was because the writers ran out of ideas, but for most other programs they have at least 8 seasons.
