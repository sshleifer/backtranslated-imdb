First of all, I'm sorry for my English. <br /> <br /> Each of the former Yugoslavia, who is not an extreme Serbian radical, will agree with me. This film shows the Serbian and only Serbian websites. Serbian crimes were not represented. Fortunately, everyone can see that this movie was created by Serbs, so there is no neutrality. All "specialists" interviewed are not professionals at all. A guy only reads a book written by some radical Serbian, the other is genocide, denier etc.etc. <br /> <br /> Even the Slovenians were accused in this film. And the whole war in Slovenia lasted for a few days, and only because the Slovenians were lucky. There were not many Serbs in Slovenia, and YNA could not reach Slovenia via Croatia (after the Croatian-Serbian war began). Each Slovenian is outraged by all the accusations in this film. <br /> <br /> Every reasonable Croat will agree with one thing: independence was too early. Perhaps you can avoid all serious conflicts. However, the memory of World War II and some unrelated things was a really pathetic attempt to justify everything. Imagine that the Japanese are throwing nuclear bombs in Seattle and Washington, and that this is justified by Hiroshima and Nagasaki. You will not find evidence of a strangled YNA soldier and murdered Serbian civilians near Vukovar. But you can find a tape in which the reporter commits that his claims about Serbian civilians near Vukovar were a lie. Throughout the Internet. And the director forgot to mention the whole bombing of Vukovar by YNA (now on the side of Serbian and Montenegrin - and 100% full of Serbs and Montenegro) and let's not start with the Chetnik movement. At the beginning it was simply a resistance movement. But the director somehow forgot to mention the cooperation with the Nazis, including Ustashe, ethnic cleansing and the re-fight against Yugoslavian partisans. There are thousands of other things, but all of this can be easily checked. There are many misleading things in this video. Only a few accusations are true. Every Croat is outraged by this film. <br /> <br /> I believe that I do not have to mention the refusal of the Srebrenica genocide, a genocide that has too much evidence. Imagine a film about Holocaust denial. This movie is the same. And according to this film, Bosnian Muslims in Sarajevo bombed themselves. Every Bosnian Muslim is outraged by this film. <br /> <br /> Some director forgot to mention the Serbian occupation of a small piece of Macedonia (FYROM). <br /> <br /> The Croats, Slovenes, Bosnians and Macedonians have never entered the borders of Serbia. If you're not a Serbian and you've actually started to believe in some of the things in this movie, know that the Serbs have some propaganda that Croats, Bosnian Muslims and Macedonians are in fact Serbs who invented their story. So ... <br /> <br /> Even 50% of Serbs will say that this movie is "a bit" extreme and pro-Serbian. <br /> <br /> Serbian radicals are very, very pleased with this movie (there are about 40% of Serbs who vote for radicals). <br /> <br /> I think everyone understands my points here. In this so-called documentary film there is very little truth, and my advice to everyone is: inform yourself before watching this movie. Then you'll laugh only at all the pitiful accusations. <br /> <br /> Watch real, neutral documentaries about the death of Yugoslavia.
