I had the pleasure to watch this movie early and I must say that I thought it would be boring and I wondered how they could improve the 1984 Bachelor Party version. With Tom Hanks, which I thought was quite good I was right ... To be honest I thought it could have been better ... Sure, there were some funny moments, but it seemed to me that it did not hit me ... Acting was fine, and the story quite well followed the original, but I think it could have been much better ... This movie I would say is for teenagers and young hearts; full of feminine bodies, alcohol and sex ... This is another typical film from the mill evening that has been repeated many times. 4/10 is my vote for this one.
