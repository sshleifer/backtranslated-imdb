Like comments like this, which was the headline of high school students, even on this site, it was the stupidest movie I've ever seen, it was funny how every moron can sit there and say that just because the movie makes it jump is good a movie that may be the most idiotic thing I've ever heard, I could sneak behind you and go "Boo", and that would make you jump, but that does not mean that I'm qualified to write or direct a movie, not to mention "tie up" everything together, "is not a good reason for the film to be well received. What a movie would be if they did not tie everything together, it would probably be a movie, not the whole movie. So basically, this idiot compliments them for completing the film, well, I love how today's young people keep media and production companies at such a high level. No wonder that the political system of this country can escape no matter what they want, we have such idiots who will appear in our country, what would happen if this girl actually did something, it is a terrible thought. Live and watch a real movie one day, try Shawshank Redemption or On the Waterfront, or something like that, and do not comment that it was "boring" after you see it, just use what God has given you to analyze it a little.
