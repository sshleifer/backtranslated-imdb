Absolutely rotting film slasher does not have one saving quality. He has defender of Angela's camp (Pamela Anderson ... not bad as a killer, her jokes when she is wasting people, is not even funny) on teenagers who kill a war that behaves as naughty as possible or resist her pleas for good behavior. We run a range of boring, stereotypical killings, such as slicing one child looking for his clawed Freddy's glove, a kid who gets a chainsaw, one girl who gets drilled, one who is pushed into the basket (filled with leeches)) who's baked , etc. <br /> <br /> There is no one original idea to offer and is just a waste of time. Unless you want to see Valerie Hartmen's tits (who plays the whore Ally). Most of the violence occurs outside the screen, so it will not even satisfy.
