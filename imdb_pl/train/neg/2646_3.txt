When someone enters a film of this type of film, it is not without reason that the abuse of this wonderful apnea medicine of the brain, Suspension disbelief, is very useful. <br /> <br /> Jeanette MacDonald plays two roles: Anna / Brigitta, a woman whom Nelson Eddy has ignored since the beginning of time, but which is also an angel sent to Earth. <br /> <br /> My reaction when I saw that it was a silent sigh "Hunh?" Where did I see it before? It turns out that I have seen it before, but in a film made much later than this one. DATE WITH THE ANGEL, a reckless doll dreck made in 1987, cashed the ethereal beauty of one Emmanuelle Bearta, who did not have a line of speaking, also wore a blond wig and made the hell of life a soap actor Michael Knight. Much worse at every possible angle with ultra-low 80s, but more than likely an updated version of this turkey from 1942. <br /> <br /> In any case, to not work, this is not an unforgettable movie and there is information on the threshold, because it was the last time when MacDonald and Eddy, or very good actors, but great singers, would not be together playing "innocence" and "pure" romance, from which they were known. Then you may need a cold shower, not because there are some steamy scenes, but to get rid of the memory.
