When I watched this movie, I thought: OK, it will be fine at any moment ... I was wrong. The ending was the real best part of the movie. A complete loss of 92 minutes. Aside from all seriousness, it was best that Wendigo finally appeared, who was at the end, and you could not even see him that well. And the end of the tail was really a bit stupid. There were too many sections in the movie in which you thought something was going to happen, but you were disappointed. The worse part, the more they talked about Wendigo, and then Wendigo. To make the creation so bad, you definitely can not say it in this movie.
