Alone In The Dark is one BAD movie and associated with Deuce Bigalow for the worst film of the year. I would like it to be EVERYTHING I had to say, but of course IMDb determines the number of words and so on. <br /> <br /> I have a twofold statement about what a bad movie is inferior type of bad movie. Low budget, like Red Zone Kuba, Monster A Go Go and Manos. Or a huge shame on budget, like Gigli, Superbabies or this guff. You see movies like Monster A Go Go and Manos, because the director has no idea. Such films happen because the director is a stupid idiot who just does not care about the audience. <br /> <br /> It's more shocking if you take into account that Uwe Boll (the master behind this shitty shit has some real trash under him) has created something that only happens once in the blue moon. Really horribly bad horror. Everything in this is a mess. Trashy CGI, bad plot, crazy random camera cuts and a terrifying soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Alone In The Dark is a scary movie that no one should watch. Woo hoo! Review. Give me a donut, drop it for 2006 and NEVER say more about it. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie.
