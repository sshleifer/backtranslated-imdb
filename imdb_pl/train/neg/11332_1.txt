As big as the prairie in Texas and equally boring. Even Liz Taylor, James Dean, Chill Wills and Dennis Hopper can not carry this overcrowded boat. Taylor actually LOOKS bad - bad wardrobe, bad hair and bad makeup - a unique achievement in her extraordinary career. Hopper gives the only credible performance, and Dean in the climactic stage shows unusual talent as something that we usually do not remember - a comics actor. Rock Hudson is his usual prototype for Barbie Doll Ken and makes you wonder what, say, Redford could do with male lead. There is no discernible plot that would provide tension for the last twenty minutes, and only pastiche of milestones that have nothing to do with each other. With the exception of Hopper, there is no character development, just a collection of cardboard cutouts that appear periodically for no apparent reason like random targets in the shooting range. Admittedly, the film deals with racism and sexism at a time when they were taboo subjects, and has SIZE, which makes it a great choice to get rid of unwanted house guests. People with a DVD version can save a bit of boredom, starting with the second disk. There will be nothing interesting.
