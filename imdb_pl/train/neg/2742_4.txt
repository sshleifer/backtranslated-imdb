I just happened to surf the film channel. My first reaction was, "God, not again!" it is so fashionable to play in these days that it has become pretentious and honestly contemptible. but for some reason I stayed and watched him till the end. maybe it was my faith in the actors, hoping that they would give me something to cheer on. <br /> <br /> and certainly ken and helena can work. at the end the film approaches something better and actually makes sense. <br /> <br /> held bonham carter also surprised me with his character. Jane has a mean side that she uses to keep her distance and repel pity. then again he has a soft side that looks for love. the only thing that surprised me even more was Branagh's character ... it was the triumph of acting, the film itself is not unique. <br /> <br /> check if you're an acting student ... if you're looking for pure entertainment you can skip this one. this is a serious sean penn! oh, it was a bit difficult, but it contains some jokes ... not for escapists.
