If it's based on a real-life relationship, supposedly between Mrs. Curtin and Mr. Levinson, I'm delighted that I do not know them personally. It is painfully slow, and both characters take stupid pills liberally throughout the entire movie, while the theme song is played to the ground. Many stupid scenes with stupid people do not create comedy.
