I'm a big fan of Will Dafoe and I was really looking for this movie (I had to get this Chinese DVD Region 5!). But this is really one of the worst I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Acting (except Dafoe) is awful. Dafoe and Colagrande BOTH have written and directed this (though he is not considered a director) and have no discernible talent for writing or directing. (Hold on to the acting Willem, Giada get out of business, PLEASE!) Absolutely nothing happens. With the exception of the completely unconvincing series, completely without credible motivation, the actions of these two people (who have just met) in this house. Colagrande is sleepy, I do not care that less expression is NEVER changed. And the sex scenes are just lame. Actually, I crouched twice in one of them. Yuck! They are certainly not the least erotic, but it is the only moment in which the movie does not put you to sleep. Then he is busy pushing you away. <br /> <br /> Just terrible.
