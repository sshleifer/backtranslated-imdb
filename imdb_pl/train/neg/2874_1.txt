This film starts quite nightmarish, with a woman tied up and mentally tortured. It is full of male frontal nudity, dead animal parts, dogs licking nipples, female losing control of the bladder. All made in a gray, cold color. Effective, but a bit too much. Then we go to watch the youth of the BTK assassin, as well as the present and its history of crime. The tension is completely psychological, and the scenes of the killer entering his victims' homes and talking to them last for quite a long time and this is frightening. Here we do not see fantasies or good photos, it looks as if you were filmed with a home camera. This does not look terrifying, but in a sense, seeing that the criminal is engaging his victims for some time before he kills them, is quite unusual and chilling in his veins. This film has no drama. From time to time there are scenes with policemen, but there is no emotion when it comes to finding a killer. There is not much arch in this story. It could have been an effective psychological thriller, a study of madness. Unfortunately, the film is filled with real materials from the slaughterhouse. It is distracted throughout the movie and appears suddenly again and again. Sometimes you do not know it is coming and you do not have enough time to look away. And I have to reject it. I am for low budgets, but I do not tolerate animal suffering. It was unnecessary, excessive and comes without warning. I am glad that Lionsgate is doing things that no one else does, but they should have passed the movie or edited the animal gore. Stay away from this rubbish.
