Boy, it was one bad movie! Although I have not seen all of Burton / Taylor's cooperation, I can honestly say that it's the worst. This rich, but ill woman (Taylor, of course) has this beautiful island in Meditteranean, ruling the expelled staff when she is suddenly visited by this traveling poet who speaks banality. In fact, the whole movie is just a party where most conversations do not make sense. Even in 1968, no one was able to warm up with this pretentious nonsense, and the passage of time makes it even clearer. If it were not for beautiful pictures and landscapes, it would be a negative evaluation. The only thing in which this movie is good is its unintentional laughter at the expense of the stars.
