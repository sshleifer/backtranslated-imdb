This film wants to develop that criminals are a product of modern society. Are thieves, rapists and murderers (the killer of the film, Carl Panzram (James Woods)) be fully responsible for their actions? Interesting concept, but very difficult to put on the screen in an intellectually and emotionally satisfying way. And here is Killer: A Journal of Murder. Although the film tries to look at Panzram's behavior from the perspective of retrospection of his brutal youth and dysfunctional upbringing, the viewer never knows that Panzram is a victim, not a culprit. Of course, the system is broken, with one gang that occupies the whole room of patients in Leavenworth Prison (where most of the film takes place), most prison guards are sadistic persecutors, and the prison director is something like a megalomaniac despot. But why is the new prison guard, Henry Lesser (Robert Sean Leonard), pitying on Panzram? Even after reading his macabre diaries? The film presents some explanations: the lesser Panzram witnesses are beaten by the most sadistic (and stereotypical) guards and are impressed by Panzram's intelligence (although it is not clear why Lesser thinks this man is so smart). Surely this is not enough to sympathize with a hostile man such as Panzram, although this film tends to underestimate his crimes and emphasize his personality? In the direction of Lesser Panzram is quite loyal, and the viewer has the impression that Lesser prevails all the atrocities he read about in Panzram's memoirs. Does this Lesser man have so few friends that he accepts the values ​​of everyone who seems to be only friendly to him? Perhaps this Lesser is a product of modern society, judging by appearance and not content. <br /> <br /> I can advise Monster, with Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci, in a film that deals more or less with the same themes of integrity and range. <br /> <br /> BTW: The killer looks like he was filmed on TV (not so good)
