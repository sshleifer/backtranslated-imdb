Recently, I watched this movie together with my sister who likes Sophia Loren's performances. I am a person they call the Barbarian of Culture. I hate art in any shape and form. Rambo is more of my kind of film, action, murder, blood, horror. If you recognize yourself in this, avoid this movie like a plague. Nobody dies, no action, no nudity, nothing like that. Let me give you a biography in a few sentences. It starts in 5 minutes in black and white Nazi propaganda. Each Italian in a block of flats participates in a parade in honor of Hitler, with the exception of a housewife, anti-fascist and janitor. A housewife, deceived by her husband, meets with anti-fascists. He falls in love with him, wants to love him, but the anti-fascist is gay. Even so, they love each other. At the end of the day the hostess reads a book from a gay lover, and the guy is deported by agents. End. Do you want an even shorter CV? BORING ... Is it short enough? The guy should have used his weapon at the beginning of this movie and got on with himself to protect the audience from this cruelty. By the way, my sister loved this movie. As I said, I am a cultural barbarian ...
