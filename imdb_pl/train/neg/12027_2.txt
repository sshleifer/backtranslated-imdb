I saw this movie in the middle of the night, when I was browsing the channels and there was nothing else to watch. This is one of those movies where you stop to see what it is - just for a moment! - but be aware after twenty minutes or you just can not turn it off, no matter how bad it is. One of those movies that is somewhere between being so good that it's good and so bad, well, just BAD, it's worth seeing only to experience the confusion of realizing that it's both! A great meal in the middle of the night, if only because of the fantastic tennis wristband. Do not even ask yourself why no one can say that Chad Lowe is such an obvious man because logic does not apply.
