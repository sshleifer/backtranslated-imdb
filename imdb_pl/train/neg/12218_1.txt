Very bad. Very very bad. As a friend who aspires to create, be - or at least smell of a catering table on a film set, it is difficult for me to criticize independent people who got a movie. However, this movie ... oh, honey. <br /> <br /> Realizing that Frightworld is not seeking anything more than primitive exploitation (an honor thing in itself), and trying to adapt it to more common standards is a mistake. To be honest, it's more entertaining than - say, Red Zone Cuba ... but not too much. So I will not try to criticize, let me ask you, throw out some observations. <br /> <br /> 1) If gore is the point of the movie, should not you see it? <Br /> <br /> 2) If you employ three sounding men, make sure at least one knows how to operate the equipment. <br /> <br /> 3) In horror, your main maniac must be more terrible than a smurf doll. Difficult to know, but really ... <br /> <br /> 4) There are many talented cameramen in the Buffalo / Rochester area, most of them can be rented really cheaply. Get someone who knows how to frame the stage. <br /> <br /> 5) Just because you have someone who knows how to use After Effects and other cool programs does not mean that you should do it every two seconds. /> <br /> 6) Kudos for getting girls to take off their peaks, but next time, download the girls who want to see them removed. <br /> <br /> 7) Editing should help tell a story or set the mood. At least in this type of film editing should be sold gags. Chainsaw suddenly appearing in the belly of the character is not terrifying, it is scruffy. <br /> <br /> Some good things. Not all acting was bad. Jack was pretty good and I liked Acid when she started fighting. There were some neat pictures, unfortunately he was thrown onto the screen without rhyme or reason. "Acid Poptart" is a name that deserves a better movie. I also like mxie Frightworld. The next time you have your movie under your belt, I hope they all get involved in something better than Colman Francis. Improve at least Ed Wood.
