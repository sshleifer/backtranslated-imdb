I think I watched the movie, but do not quote me because I could have fallen asleep while watching the movie because it did not "capture the excitement and imagination". At least I know I've watched him enough to know that I will not see him soon. Or ever. <br /> <br /> Jesus, talk about a lame one ... Really lame. Completely lame. He will not like a six-year-old. Basically, it did not have any dramatic impact. Zilch. Nada. Just shuck turned into a dreck. Comedy? It was supposed to be a comedy? You could fool me-ee-ee ...! <br /> <br /> Now, if the aliens were insatiable carnivores, like in the movie "Critters", we could have human characters to do something deeper than to be overly contented with ourselves ... how to shout, scream and run for their lives, not to be eaten, so history can be more exciting than watching dry paint. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about watching this. It is not worth the effort. You can find something more interesting. Like watching dry paint. Or I fall asleep.
