This program is boring, lousy and essentially tearing apart different kinds of things to make it "original". First of all: the animation is so ugly ... Johnny is hideous ... and everyone is annoying. The twins look like Dexters teenagers from the "Dexter's Laboratory", and Johnny is an almost more intelligent man Dee Dee (also from "Dexter's Laboratory"). Second: the plot ... is painfully lame, making it difficult to track. Gags are trivial and nothing really makes me feel compelled to laugh ... especially when trying to be funny. I only saw two episodes, but the same ones pushed me away. <br /> <br /> Third: The whole song starts with breaking the melody on "American Idiot" Green Day. And although I'm not a big fan of this band, I think it's really stupid to take the same opening tune and then subtly change it to make it your own. <br /> <br /> A case in a sense ... it's a big fat ugly bore. 1/10
