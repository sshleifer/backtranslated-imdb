Funny. Angelic 9-year-old Annakin turns into an ugly brat, 19-year-old Annakin, who somehow seems attracted to Amidala, 5 years older. Now the 22-year-old hero of the Jedi warriors, Annakin, has several bad dreams, and so he kills children, his friends and the whole framework of his existence, because the crazy old man convinced him: a) his precious wife can really die, and b) only he can do it prevent. Ludicrosites squared. <br /> <br /> I think people who like this movie do not pay attention to it. The story is funny. Characters are unbelievable (literally, not kinky "fantastic", "wonderful", etc.). <br /> <br /> Obi-wan Kenobi was a wise and kind anchor of the whole series, but in Climax, he cuts his legs off Annakin, lets him burn in the lava and leaves him suffering. Does nobody think that it's a bit outside of character? Not to mention that it was quite stupid to risk life, as it turns out. <br /> <br /> I was expecting at least a story that would show coherent characters with credible motivations. Nothing here. The story could have been written by a 10-year-old. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, CGI is pretty cool.
