This one was disturbed by potentially great matches, which were shortened very shortly. <br /> <br /> The opening match was the loss of the Legion of the Holocaust, but I think the only way to eliminate it by Demolition was the double DQ. Otherwise, Mr. Perfect would have to give up overtime. Kerry von Erich, master of I-C, has been wasted here. This was the third ppv in a row where Perfect jobbed. Remember that you have never lost a match before. <br /> <br /> The second match was very good, probably the best at night. Ted DiBiase and Undertaker were great, while Jim Neidhart had one of his WWF attractions pinning Honky Tonk Man. Koko B. Ware continued the tradition of being the first to introduce a new heel (remember Big Bossman and Yokozuna?). It was the announcement of the career of the single Bret Hart, who came back from the game two-on-one and almost survived the match. He and DiBiase set up a wrestling ward, which made us forget that the goal of the match was DiBiase's boring dispute with Dusty Rhodes. <br /> <br /> Even if the Visionaries were the first team to survive all of their members (and only the second from '87, when he had four survivors, this match was not squash. It was the longest match at night, and Jake repeated his performance in '88, when he was alone against the four men and dominated, I think he could get angry ... Nowadays the match would end differently. <br /> <br /> One of the shortest SS matches was also one of the most surprising. an underestimated wrestler in history, Tito Santana was an inspiring wrestler of the night, putting paint on and pinning Boris Zukhov, Tanaka and even Warlord in the last survival match. Slaughter also worked well, getting rid of Volkoff and Bushwhackers, but it was not a surprise. Tito was. <br /> <br /> M I believe that the only goal of the survival match was to win Hogan and the Warrior at the end. <br /> <br /> This show was boring and the matches were also short. Undertaker's debut was cool, but Tito Santana is the reason I will remember him.
