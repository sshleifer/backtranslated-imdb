Data tries hard and is extreme with all its cry and madness, spilling water on itself and rolling on the floor. Too much. Calm down, get together and make us laugh. I did not fully understand his comparison to comics and rock stars. Only because on stage or something? He said that every comedian wants to be a rock star. I'm sure Rodney Dangerfield really did it when he was alive. He had some good jokes, such as the Burger King joke, in which people shout for passage. I also liked the joke Reese's Pieces. If Dane just did not behave so mentally, he could be more fun and I could give him a higher rating, as high as eight.
