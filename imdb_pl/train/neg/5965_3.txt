In 1454, in France, the sorcerer Alaric de Marnac (Paul Naschy) is beheaded, and his lover Mabille De Lancré (Helga Liné) is tortured to death accused of sorcery, vampirism and lycanthropy. Before they die, they are cursed by the next generations of their executioners. In the current years (in the 1970s) Hugo de Marnac (Paul Naschy) and Sylvia (Betsabé Ruiz) and their friends Maurice Roland (Vic Winner) and his beloved Paula (Cristina Suriani) go to a screening session, during which they conjure the spirit of Alaric de Marnaca. They decide to travel to Villas de Sade, the estate of the Hugo family in the village, to search for a monastery with a hidden treasure. They find Alaric's head, and the devil has it, restoring Mabille to life and performing executions on the local victims. After the death of Elvir's father (Emma Cohen), he mentions that he has the Hammer of Thor's amulet hidden in the well; together with Maurice, they try to defeat the demonic Alaric de Marnac and Mabille. <br /> <br /> Last weekend I bought a box of horror genre with five DVDs by Paul Nascha for 9.98 USD; despite the lack of references, I decided to take a chance. The first DVD with an uncut and restored version of "Horror Rises from the Tomb" is a B (or C) movie that reminded me of Ed Wood right away. This absurd story is revealed by horrible script, directing, performances, photos, decorations, special effects and editing, and many naked women. The result is simply fun and I can guarantee that Ed Wood's style will come back. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
