I usually comment only on movies that I like, imagining "all according to my taste", but here I want to make an exception. The premise of this movie, which somehow seems to get lost in shuffling, is that these two egocentric adults have the perfect right to go to Las Vegas, get drunk, get married and inflict unpredictable suffering on their clutches. Even allowing for the drunken culturally sanctioned, they have neither courage nor a sense of responsibility to wake up the next morning and undo what they have set in motion. After all, "love" is the most important thing, right? To hell with everyone else. Whether things "work in the end" is not really; in fact, it is completely irrelevant. The point is that disrespect for others, especially if they are young people, and especially if they are in a state of dependence, is neglected and thus amplified by this film. There are many more harmless behaviors that these "parents" could do to bring the army of social workers down in the blink of an eye.
