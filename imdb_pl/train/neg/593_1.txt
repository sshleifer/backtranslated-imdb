This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Worse than the most repulsive American slag; worse than Glitter - Mariah Carey in American speedway par excellence. I can only imagine that the screenwriter and producer were taking huge amounts of recreational pharmaceuticals, and when discussing the plot, they thought it was a good idea. This is not. This is very nonsense of the very insults of Satan himself (who probably could have written a better script if he focused on it). Robert Jones as Exce Producer, spending taxpayers' money (people from the lottery) on this nonsense, should be responsible. Who on earth thought that it would be a good idea to recreate Deathline ??? I'm asking you - camp as a Christmas tree, Deathline ... "Mind the doors" is a classic of a really bad British movie, we do not really need a reminder. And certainly we do not need a weak, second rate, badly written, badly developed and so bad. All this from the British funding agency who brought us Sex Lives of the Potato Men ... I am resisting my case. <br /> <br /> I do not pay ANY money to see it. This is absolute and complete nonsense - the only economical treat for producers is that they got a huge piece of cash ... our cash ... for doing it. They should hang their heads in shame. <br /> <br /> I'm stunned by the low, low standard of this movie. This makes the Mgr believe that our national Film Support body really thought it worth supporting. The British film industry has no hope, while idiots run the program. Harvey Wienstein, where are you? Come back, we forgive you !!!
