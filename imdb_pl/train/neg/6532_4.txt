The film begins with the discovery by people on Earth that their rocket to Mars has not been lost, but simply drifted in space near the planet. When it is recovered, one of the crew members is sick, one is alive, and the other two are missing. What happened to them is told by retrospection of a survivor. <br /> <br /> During the stay on Mars, the crew was apparently attacked by a whole lot of very stupid monsters with eyes. Oddly enough, while the sets were quite good, the monsters were the stupidest ones I saw in the movie. In addition, in a strange attempt at realism, production used a process called "Cinemagic." Unfortunately, this great innovation made the movie look quite cheap when it was on the surface of Mars, and the intensity of redness practically made my eyes bleed - it was so bad !! Despite the whole cheese, the film had an interesting plot, as well as good news about space travel. For lovers of this genre, it's worth seeing. For others, you may find that the whole thing is stupid - see for yourself and decide. <br /> <br /> Although, according to today's standards, this is not a particularly good science-fiction film, it does quite well in comparison with the films produced at the time. <br /> <br /> PS - When watching a movie, pay special attention to Dr. Tremayne. It looks like a dripping image of Dr. Quest from the "Jonny Quest" cartoon! Plus, he also sounds and works very much like him.
