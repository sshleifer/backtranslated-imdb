Growing up in Texas and less than 15 miles from what Gilley once was, I can say that this movie is nauseating. Most Texans are dead, as the movie shows. The plot is weak, and the false accents are fun and reinforces the stereotypical image that all Texans drink beer, honky-tonkin ', rednecks. The terribly false accents of Texas are for me what kills. It's true that most Texan accents have a Texas touch, but these people are exaggerating. You can not get someone from New Jersey and Ohio to make accents from Texas. It just does not work. John Travolta should stick to a disco or 50s dance. Debra Winger was more convincing than Wonder Girl than she was as a Texan.
