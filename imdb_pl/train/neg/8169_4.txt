The film begins with a pair of campers, a man and a woman supposedly together, wandering alone across the vast wilderness. Indeed, a man hears something and it hurts so much that he is going to examine it. Our killer welcomes him with a jab in the stomach. Then he chases the girl and cuts her throat. The camera on the opening stage is from the point of view of the killer. <br /> <br /> Then we meet our four main characters, two pairs, one in the rocks. Men joke about how a woman would never be able to cope with a campsite in a double date, triggering the symbolic blonde ambition to leave a week earlier. Unexpectedly, men leave the same day and their car breaks down ... They finally arrive in the evening. When men arrive, they are warned about people who disappear into the forest through the mad Ralph doppleganger. They ignore the warning and venture into the dark night, and the song from the eighties plays in the background with the murdering texts in the dark forest. Men are lost. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, we realize that this is not another clone of The Burning, but a ghost story! Women, frightened and lonely, huddled together by the fire. Two children appear in the shade and decide to play Tom's voyeur. Well, these are of course ghosts, like the echoes of their voices! Their mother appears with blood dripping from the hole in her forehead and asks both ladies if they see her children before they naturally disappear. <br /> <br /> The children run home to their dad and talk about two beautiful women on the river. This causes a lot of confusion and gets up by grabbing a knife from the fireplace. "Dad is on the hunt", the little girl exclaims bad behavior. You can see here that Dad is not a ghost like his children. <br /> <br /> Surprised by something in the forest, a symbolic blonde splits up, running blindly into the night, carrying a knife. He meets his father, who explains that he is dying of hunger and will be fast. That makes no sense because of the snarling of the panther we've heard before (Maybe he's allergic, are the panthers honest even in California?) He ends up wounding him lightly before he gets stabbed. A storm breaks out and men are looking for a shelter that turns out to be where dad lives. Apparently, someone lives here because there is fire and something strange to bake over him. Children appear and warn them about my dad, who appears a moment later. They disappear as soon as it arrives. <br /> <br /> For some reason, our killer only goes for women. He invites men to have something to eat and tells us a story about his ex-wife. We get a flashback that his wife was caught cheating. The old man does not tell them that he is killing her and her lover, but he is dreaming about it. The reason for the death of children is not given. Men go to sleep and remain unscathed. The next morning, men discover the empty encampment of their wives. After a short discussion they separated. One of them is to stay at the campsite and the other to help. The one who returns to his car breaks his leg. Then we reconnect with the children, explaining to the surviving woman that they are ghosts who killed because of their mother's sadness. They agree to help the woman to connect with her friends. <br /> <br /> The following scene contradicts the logic of the movie when dad kills the guy waiting at the campsite. He also dated or married a blonde. Somehow, the children realize that he was murdered and would tell the woman. He decides to see it for himself and of course he hits the killer. Fortunately, the children make him stop, threatening to leave him forever. You know where it happens. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie deserves four stars out of ten, and that's generous. Despite all his fears, the musical score is well done. You can still watch it. There are certain camera angles that look professional and some sets are well made. The story is unbelievable. There is such a thing as a willing suspension of disbelief, but with a toad 6 miles away; I can not imagine this symbolic blonde taking off in the middle of the night. I mean, give me a break! <br /> <br /> - Alan "Skip" Bannacheck
