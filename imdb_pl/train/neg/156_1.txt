Zu Warriors should definitely be an animated series, because as a movie it's like watching an old anime on acid. The movie starts out of nowhere, and people just fly by fighting metal wings and other stupid weapons, until the princess sacrifices herself for her lover on the cloud or something like that. Is this princess a god, or an angel is outside of me, but soon this evil guy in the flying wind enters and kills her, while the guy with wings fights with some other mystic God / Demon / Wizard. The plot is either absent or very difficult to follow , you must be extremely intelligent to get this movie. The plot soon follows the Chinese mortal, whom this god calls to fight evil flying, the princess killing the evil guy, and soon we have a very bad choreography Uwe Bolla like a scene of fighting horrible martial arts on the mountain or something like that. Even if the graphics are strange, some may say that they are stunning and colorful, but I will say that they are a blurry and sour journey like (yes, that's the word!). I watched it both with dubbing and with subtitles, and both were equally bad and difficult to understand .... who am I kidding, I did not understand it at all. watched an episode of 30 anime from the 80s and did not quite notice how the story started, or I began to read the comic series 5 at No. 4, because I had no idea how it started, where it happened, or how it would end . I can honestly say that it was one of the worst film experiences I've ever seen, like watching Inu-Yasha in the episode 134 drunk ... yeah, that's right, you do not know what the hell is going on. the brain is trying to figure it out.
