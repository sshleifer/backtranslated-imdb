First of all, anyone who considers this continuation of William Friedkin's "The French Connection" to be better is totally crazy, stupid or both. The problem with reviewing this movie is this: a.) This is a continuation of a brilliant movie that always makes watching is objectively difficult, and b.) Directed by John Frankenhimer, one of the best American directors in history, so I wanted to like it . William Friendkin was the perfect person to make a movie about drug traffic in decaying New York, because of his documentary approach to action and history, Frankenhimer on the other hand is one of the most stylish directors in history, i.e. "Manchurian Candidate" and "Seconds "And thanks to" French Connection 2 "it feels like someone tried to be forgiving and did not have a real understanding to do it. The fact that Frankenhimer was chosen to lead the sequel of Gene Hackman, really says a lot about Hackman's understanding of the original film as well. It is well known that Hackman hated Friedkin on the set and promised that he would never cooperate with him again. It is also known that he imagined that the character is more one-dimensional, loses weight and tries to play it as a simple character. shows that Hackman, despite being a great actor, had no idea who to make a movie and a great story. Interestingly, Doyle becomes addicted but does not guarantee the rest of the movie. An unfortunate point in Frankenhimer's filmography.
