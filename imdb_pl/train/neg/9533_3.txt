The textual prologue warns us that we should not allow evil to our home, but I think that the more accurate word is "entropy". Good sadness, what are these two females! <br /> <br /> George (Seymour Cassell) is alone in his office in San Francisco and his horribly expensive home in Tiburon, while his wife and child are in San Diego. Two girls (Sondra Locke as Jackson and Colleen Camp as Donna) knock on his door, asking for directions. Well, it's raining and they tremble like two sodden, pathetic kittens and are not sure what kind of address they're looking for, and George from both sides invites them to come and take part in his pizza around the campfire. All three of them end in George's bathtub, and after about five minutes the most undifferentiated nudity in double exposure, triple exposure, quadruple exposure and dodekakuple exposure. They spend the night in a triangle, and the next morning the girls fix him breakfast. But something was a bit surprised, because Georgie's guests devour everything with their fingers, pour ketchup and syrup onto the canvas and - "eat like animals!", Exclaims George and orders them to leave. In his dreams. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong. Sondra Locke is an extraordinary young blond with cobalt blue eyes and Colleen Camp jumps like a superball. You must say that they are very cute in Shelbyville, Tennessee, where Locke comes from, and they also breed with very thin thrusts, because we can not help but notice that after the first five or ten minutes. /> <br /> But when girls get mad, it's a movie. The film is then bathed in bright green light. The couple put on a ghostly make-up and made the faces of the gargoyles in mirrors. They have a boy to give birth and then they drown him to make sure. Storm storm and break windows and furniture. They have one of those scenes where two people sit opposite each other, licking food and then jumping each other. <br /> <br /> And Georgie? First, they immobilize Georgie with a club (which contains nothing that can not be found in the little red bottle of Tabasco McIlheny's sauce in the kitchen cupboard), tie it, pour flour and milk onto it, subject it to a psychotic test, guide it through one of these halfs - Tolstoy's type of execution, count him, dress up in bizarre clothes, then throw on him and his practically destroyed house from the upper middle class, and they will be sent by the supplier from the machine. <br /> <br /> When it comes to acting, it's like someone telling Georgie: "Be polite to these girls first and then act in a panic after you're bound." And to the girls: "First, be shy, do not want to impose anyone, and then act like crazy." And that's all. <br /> <br /> Photography and location are straight from a 1970 porn movie. I'm not sure if this suggests a complete lack of skills. It takes effort and talent to turn San Francisco into an ugly one. The result gives us two themes. Georgie is a bit of a pop with lyrics about "being free" and "giving up". Jackson and Donna are a catchy thing called "My Good Old Dad." <br /> <br /> I agree, however, with the lesson of morality associated with this story. There are a few things you should not give up, even if they may look great at the beginning. Everything is very educational.
