The reason why I wanted to give this film a chance for 2 hours of my life (actually it was only 35 minutes) was my desire to understand and, hopefully, appreciate Indian cinema. I only saw a few older S.Ray movies. <br /> <br /> While browsing IMDb, I came across this one and after seeing the 8.7 rating I came to the conclusion that it is the one that will open the door of the unknown and bring artistic pleasure. Oh, how wrong I was! The only logical explanation for this rating at level 8.7 is that the majority of the 970 people who voted were Hindus, and their only venture outside of production in Bolliwood were Adam Sandler's films. <br /> <br /> Thanks to this assessment, this film would be ranked 9th on IMDb. A list of 250 best films above Citizen Cane, Goodfellas of Psycho! I'm really not in the mood for reviewing or criticizing, because there is simply nothing to remember about this painful experience. I just hope there are many Indians who like me, but this movie is the same - plain stupid, with lots of kitsch and bad music.
