The humor in Who's Your Daddy is such a bad taste that I actually closed my eyes in some scenes. Sperm approximation is not funny! Nobody thinks they are. People are nervous when they see something so disgusting and hide their nervousness, they laugh. Watching Who's Your Daddy gave me a disgusting nervous feeling.
