This movie was like "The Disney Channel after Dark." Choose the language and motives "we are not naughty", and you have a dialogue and story device that offends the intelligence of anyone who does not describe "Saved by the Bell" as high quality television. Dialogue so ridiculously dressed and deliberately dirty, one would think that the scenario was the result of blocking Aaron Spelling and Joe Eszterhas in the room with the order to create an amalgam of every bad script anyone has ever dealt with. If it was Roger Kumble's intention, the mission was completed.
