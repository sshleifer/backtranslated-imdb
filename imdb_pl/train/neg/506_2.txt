(aka: The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance) <br /> <br /> Many naked babes in this one with a few scenes of lesbo thrown in. The film is to be made in Ireland, but it looks more like Rome and Adriatic for me. <br /> <br /> Gothic lesbians are invited for a weekend to the castle on the island of the Count. It seems that they are missing their heads one by one because of a crazy man running. <br /> <br /> It's not too scary or bloody, and the rooms look like they're lit by spotlights, even though candles shine. I go figura ... (sic) <br /> <br /> Dubbing is worse than usual, and the plot serves only as a pretext for eroticism and nudity. This is a snoozer directed by the actor of the horror euro Alfredo Rizzo. <br /> <br /> Pretty boring 2 out of 10
