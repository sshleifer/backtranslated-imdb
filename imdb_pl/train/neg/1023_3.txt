LL Cool J played much better in the movie I expected! He did a fantastic job, acting as a renegade cop in the "renegade" department. From the very beginning, he does a great job, building the viewer's empathy for his character and the situation in which he finds himself. It works as a kind of "gentle giant" - a person whose rough exterior can scare everyone, and whose heart is clearly visible right from the start - and does an amazing job. He was by far the best character in the movie. <br /> <br /> Surely it was a performance that will not win any Morgan Freeman awards. After performing in strong movies such as Shawshank Redemption, this movie was definitely a step down. His role in Edison simply did not allow him to show his true talents as an actor - and as for the character's conglomerate, he unfortunately put it on the back burner. There are so many ways in which his character (Moses Ashford) could play a more central role. That it was not disappointing and a real disappointment. I was hoping to see more from him in this movie. <br /> <br /> Timberlake should stay in the music industry. His portrait of a young journalist was poorly preserved and unconvincing. This film is a typical action movie that (at least initially) is reminiscent of the somewhat corrupt police cases he has experienced in the past. Being a movie of action, he has his share in the scenes of shooting, blood and guts. These scenes are usually unrealistic and painfully predictable. Watching the beginning of the movie is very uncertain about what will happen at the end - think about what you would normally expect in a good conflict between cops / bad cops - and it's not much like shooting with a REAL police -out. <br /> <br /> What irritated me the most was how Timberlake's character behaved during casting scenes. He starts to have a weapon and does not use it. Then, when he finally uses one, he shoots him as if he's been firing a gun all his life. Then he ran out of missiles and no weapons - and 30 seconds later, without moving or anything - he suddenly has 2 more fully loaded pistols and additional ammunition ?! Small fictional mistakes like this really ruined my movie. <br /> <br /> If what you're looking for is a blatantly fictional plot in a fantasy world where everything turns out fine, you'll probably love this movie. Personally, it does not matter to me what kind of film is as long as it is realistic. Let me believe that history is true. This story was so fictional in so many aspects that I left feeling unhappy.
