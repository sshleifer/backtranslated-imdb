This movie was very depressing. <br /> <br /> The characters were so cold. The mother who is his main character is everything but "motherly". OK, she was unhappy in her marriage and always put her husband and children first. Her husband is dying. Then she goes to visit her son and meets this handsome boy who sleeps with his daughter and ends up sleeping with him. This part is fine for this part. It is not perfect, but you can watch it. The guy is charming and who can blame her? OK, this is not very maternal sleeping with your daughter's lover, but blame it for the shock of losing her husband. <br /> <br /> He becomes completely obsessed with the guy. I think this is the part where I started disliking the movie. She always wants to satisfy him in an "old fashioned way" with snacks while he works on her son's house (probably the only thing she learned to do) as if it was the only way she could get his attention. The guy is obviously not very interested (actually he seems more likely to consider sleeping with her as a charity) and instead of insulting him, he still begs him to go to bed with her and be nice to her when he becomes very offensive. "I want to please you," he says in a desperate way, while he insults her very much. <br /> <br /> What irritated me in this film is a total lack of self-respect for my mother. He tells Craig something like, "I'm just a shapeless figure," when they sleep together for the first time. <br /> <br /> This film is an insult to women. If it was me, I would buy a small object that would bring me the same satisfaction and much less emotional pain ... :)
