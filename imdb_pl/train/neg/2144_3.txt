I always thought Cinderella II was the worst movie I've ever seen (followed by Peter Pan 2 and a few other sequels, such as Lion King 2 and The Bellman of Notre Dame 2). All these films are created with the same idea; because the film does not have a story, they try to make up for it by filling it with jokes. I'm not saying that jokes are bad, but they make up the majority of the movie. I saw the movie for the first time, I would give him 1/10. But now I think about it, most children do not care how good the original movie was, they just make it funny. I still think the movie was a bad sequel, but that does not mean it's awful. Now I think it deserves 3/10.
