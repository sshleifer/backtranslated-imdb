These were just two things that interested me in this movie: I've been waiting for the death of Owen Wilson and Catherine Zeta Jones. <br /> <br /> It was basically a program for one woman. Catherine Zeta Jones was just to deliver sweets. Liam Neeson has been completely wasted in this film. Like Jones, he had no role. The film was Lily Taylor (Ransom, ready to wear). She was the only person who had any real involvement in this shitty script of David Self. OK, it was his first and he bought back thanks to Road to Perdition. <br /> <br /> I do not know what was the problem of director Jan de Bont. he did a great job with Speed ​​and Twister. he really fell here from work. Maybe he was recovering from the Speed ​​2: Cruise Control crash. He should thank his lucky stars for Wild West, otherwise it would be the worst picture of 1999. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
