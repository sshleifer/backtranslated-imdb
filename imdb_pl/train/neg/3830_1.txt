I do not know why I take the time to review this movie about wasting time. If you stick to it long enough in the hope of a satisfying ending? good, bad or surprising? no. Finally, it expires after a rigid, formal, predictable dialogue and action. The interior scenes are so sharply lit that if the camera is enlarged a millimeter away, you will see the headlights. Costumes, hairstyles and sets are starched, pressed and pristine. Are we to imagine how ordinary people lived in Arizona in the early 20th century? Comparisons of other reviews with Sam Peckinpah are an insult to Peckinpah: at least this director has woven violence into the context of chaos and chaos. HEAVEN MALE is free blasting bibs from wooden incarnations of bad guys with manicured nails. What? I can believe that Heston thought he could do something worthwhile with this movie. (He catches the gun with cold fingers.) But Coburn? I will never guess why he signed up for this parody. Do you want to see a movie about the end of the West, as we knew it, the end of the westerns we knew? Watch THE SHOOTIST or UNFORGIVEN again. THE LAST HARD MAN is a mockery of the obituary for the West.
