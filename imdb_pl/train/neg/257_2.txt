I love Jamie Foxx. <br /> <br /> And I'm happy 99% of all the movies I see. <br /> <br /> And I left this. <br /> <br /> Now, I admit it could have had something to do with two white middle-aged women at the back of the theater who were laughing at every little thing ("Oh no, knocking Jamie up the door! HEE HEE HEE!" ), But ... It was just incredibly annoying. There could not be any permanent camera shot, and no camera shot from a conventional angle ... everything had to be in your face, loud and annoying. <br /> <br /> The bad guy tried to be smooth and like Malkovich, but at the moment he is just old and tired. He did not bring anything new or interesting. From all the characters, too many lines that you've seen, too many that you've heard before, and too many lines of "hard guys" ... and I do not mind such things, really, as long as there is some originality. Actually, the entire cast was just sucking. <br /> <br /> I love Jamie Foxx and I think he is really funny and I thought he was funny in this movie ... but he's not funny enough, I'm hiding everything else. <br /> <br /> This movie required less shooting, less annoying camera shots, more emotions, more feelings and more Jamie Foxx. I gave him 2.
