After watching about half of this I was ready to give up and turn off, but I survived until the end. It's a movie that tries to be a romantic comedy and fails. Acting is poor - much worse than acting in T & A movies from the 80s. <br /> <br /> There are several humorous attempts that fail miserably and the film is 100% predictable. Perhaps, if you're a teenager, this movie will delight, but for those who have watched a lot of movies, you'll learn how the movie comes out after the first 10 minutes. The rest of your time will be spent in agony, waiting for the credits to end. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time watching this.
