It is quite a boring movie about a scientist who creates a teleporting device and becomes terribly distorted when using a machine to transport himself. A simple plot made in advance and others. Not only is it disfigured, but it can also strike people with touch. What's really stupid about this movie is that we should believe that the place where this guy works is against him. He probably could make millions for the institution he's working in, but the head of the institution tries to sabotage his teleport every step of the way. In the end, the anticipated person infects three people for no reason, and then follows those who have hurt him.
