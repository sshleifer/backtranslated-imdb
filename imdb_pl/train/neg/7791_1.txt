I saw the original German version without dubbing and I was surprised how bad this movie is. Thinking that I saw my participation in bad movies like Ghoulies 2, Rabid Grannies, Zombie Lake and the like, nothing could prepare me for it! Being through this movie was really painful because there is no plot, no good acting, and even special effects are not convincing, especially the so-called. their good set would not be destroyed by stains from ketchup and marmalade. <br /> <br /> If you really want to waste 90 minutes of your life, look at it for everyone else, do not do it because you will regret it!
