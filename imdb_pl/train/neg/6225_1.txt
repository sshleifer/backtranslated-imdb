I doubt if it will ever be a cult movie. I loved Gram Parsons to make sure I did not expect much after this movie and got even less. What could be clever and moving was camps. He was devoid of music that Gram made and had more filler than cheap dog food. There was no background for Gram or colored people of that era. The characters I presented were not even known to me as a Gram fan and all versions of his "adventures after life" that I heard. Rock and roll is full of stories, also good ones, but they should be made with a grain of salt. They can be great stories, even if they are exaggerated. However, this movie had a good story and turned into tripe. Stealing a dead body and the resulting consequences should never be a boring story, but somehow make it boring. I am tempted to steal every copy of Grand Theft Parsons, go to the desert and burn them all.
