Several times I passed this on the shelf, looking at a lot of huge positive quotes (with small names) in the front and wondering if I missed something. One night he was on one of the movie channels and tuned in. I did not miss anything. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I only watched the first 30 minutes. Perhaps the film becomes a comedy gold afterwards. Given the slow pace and total lack of laughter in the first 30 years, I seriously doubt it. <br /> <br /> The protagonist begins the film in the classic style "I do not know how to start my film", with a long, tiring monologue about how he does not want to be sued. It's not funny. It is not even funny. Others commented on the "San Franclisco" bit; ok, a little giggle speaks for the first time. Then he ground him, smiling at the camera as if it was the funniest thing ever written. Finish with yourself. In fact, I think that talking to the camera was the reason why I did not like the movie immediately. Do not assume knowledge of your recipients. Knowledge is 'learned', as is respect. <br /> <br /> From there you basically have a fat, groaning guy talking in a very effeminate way about his boring life. I did not know he was a Jew; discrediting Jewish comedians to call it "Jewish humor". It's just unpleasant humor. Just because you're a Jew does not mean you have talent for comedy. WASP, Spalding Gray, cope better with the sense of humor than this guy, so obviously this is not about ethnicity. <br /> <br /> If one of the pieces I saw worked, I could stay. But some snoring about how much he loves the names of the women he works with, and then exchanges them for five long minutes, does not make a great movie. <br /> <br /> This is an obvious attempt to capitalize on the popularity of "office space". Do not let yourself become a victim of target marketing. Just say "no" to "Haiku Tunnel".
