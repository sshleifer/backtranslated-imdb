I chose "Dead Creatures" because I thought it was a zombie movie, like "28 days" or less ... but not at all. It is not even a horror story. Nothing happens, except for a group of women who seem infected with a strange virus that forces her to eat human flesh to survive. <br /> <br /> This plot causes a series of disgusting scenes of cannibalism ... <br /> <br /> Very VERY FILM. <br /> <br /> * My rating: 2/10 <br /> <br /> ------------------ <br /> <br /> - -------------- ---
