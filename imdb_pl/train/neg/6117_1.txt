I can not say that this is the worst movie ever made, but I personally think about it this way because when it was originally released in cinemas, (1) the initial buzz was positive enough that my girlfriend insisted on seeing it, right STOOD IN LINE to get tickets, and (2) it's still the only "serious" movie I remember when the audience started laughing at some point and basically laughing about the movie for the rest of the way. When we arrived at the infamous (and never-ending) scene of a hose fight, I think that everyone gave up. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can admit is shooting at a lush location. Oh, there are also Bo's breasts, although her acting is so wooden that nudity is non-erotic and does not judge much more than Playboy's pictures. <br /> <br /> "Dramatic tension" in this movie is between Bo's horrible acting and terrible direction of her husband. The serpent's fight must be one of the most incompetent sequences of action ever filmed. However, this is one of those movies that is bad enough, maybe it's worth watching at the level of unintentional humor. By far the worst movie I've ever seen.
