This movie has a few things to do right away. Dani Filth as the main actor will automatically make some people like this movie. I love Cradle of Filth and I listened to the soundtrack for this movie long before I watched it. Dani Filth is a very recognizable character and gives a great advantage. The independent style of filming is great for this terrifying factor. There are some great actresses in this movie. To get a low budget, the special effects were not bad either. The ways of death of people were very creative and nightmarish. <br /> <br /> Now towards defects. There is VERY little talking in this whole movie, which makes very little character development. It is difficult to fear for the lives of inert, static figures. When it was said a little, the F bomb was abundant, appearing in random places. Yes, I understand that people swear, but it looks like the preteen boy wrote it and thought it was cool when it comes to incorporating the whole language. The plot of what I could do with it was quite good, although many parts remain suspended, and the lack of conversation often leaves the question of what is happening. <br /> <br /> In the end, Cradle of Fear is like porn for people who love sex and violence, but like porn trying to pull a storyline, it just does not work very well. Borrow her if you are a sick person who wants to satisfy your blood and body appetite.
