This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Robin Williams fit in a part like a rhinoceros would fit into a tutu, even though his performance was still pathetic. Kurt Russell was more credible, but he was still awful. The plot left a lot to be desired, and the rest of the acting was also terrible. The only thing that happened in this movie was a trailer that dragged me into a waste of 90 minutes of my life, which I'd better spend trying to lick the back of my head. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and record this movie if you have it. If not, just be happy that you do not.
