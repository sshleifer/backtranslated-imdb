This movie was a confusing piece of trash. You never knew what was going on. The characters were poorly written and mostly were completely unfriendly with the exception of Gus (played masterfully by George Eads). I hate this movie, but in comparison with others (Dark Harvest, Dracula's Curse) should get the academy award. It was particularly sad to see a talented actor such as George Eads in such a shameful and shoddy movie. You have been permanently immersed in a completely new state. Someone needs to make sure that this director will never work in movies again. It was also supposed to be a horror movie because it was more entertaining than frightening. For shame Life for shame.
