do not expect much from this movie. In many respects, this movie resembles a movie in which Doris Day played in 1956, the title of Julie. In this movie, Doris, who was a stewardess, a stewardess, landed on the plane at the time after her mad husband, played by Louis Jordan, shot the captain. She did a much better job, more convincing than Kim Ojah, who took control of 747 and managed to land without the help of the control tower. I know about 747 aircraft a bit, I'm a stewardess myself. As I said, do not expect much from this movie, it was done on a cheap budget. Manufacturers were cheap to use an aircraft with the name of the airline. Oceanic is a name used by several movies. The only letter on this plane was the name of the company that produced the plane.
