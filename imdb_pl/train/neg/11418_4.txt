Joel Schumaker manages the script he wrote, and has a group of Georgetown graduates confronted with adult life situations. The plot is a messy mess, but some scenes are really good. There is a lot of wasted talent and time here. The cast is more impressive than the movie. They include Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, Andrew McCarthy, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy and Mare Winningham. The most notable is McCarthy and Moore. Lowe is quite unpleasant. Maturing is not so damn easy.
