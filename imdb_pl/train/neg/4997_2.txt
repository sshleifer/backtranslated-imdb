... but it is certainly not without merit. The writer-director Preston Sturges is experimenting with remarkable cinema effects, telling his stories, creating broadly drawn, but characteristic characters and situations, writing a clever and sometimes unexpectedly wise and compassionate dialogue. (No wonder that the next Coen brothers movie will be a tribute to Sturges.) The main problem is that the plot is not yet in place; he lacks a surprise, unexpected twists and sudden changes of fortune that prevent viewers from guessing. The coffee password is a bad thing to hang out the story, and the ending is completely predictable. Frank Capra does much better. <br /> <br /> If you're new to Preston Sturges, check out "The Lady Eve" or "Sullivan's Travels" or "The Miracle of Morgan's Creek" first. If you've seen them already, look at this.
