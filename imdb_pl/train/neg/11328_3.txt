Every now and then I rent an action / adventure film to relax and take my mind with nothing important. That's why I have a copy of Charlie's Angels (2000) - it's not a high quality movie, but it makes me laugh and let me relax. One day I will probably buy copies of "Princess Bride" and some of Monty Python's films for the same reason. <br /> <br /> In any case, I borrowed this movie because I wanted to play without challenge. Mostly I got what I wanted. The plot was similar to the badly written episode of Xena, and the acting of Kathy Long was a very social theater (not bad for a professional boxer and amateur actress). Cyborgs had several high points. Somehow, they managed to get some good actors to play bad guys - unfortunately most of them die very quickly. <br /> <br /> Like most martial arts movies, the further you go to a movie, the more action you take, and the story (which was not strong at first) worsens almost as fast as acting. However, the more Kathy Long fights, the more time the director devotes to her back. At the end of the movie, I seriously considered watching him a second time to count how many times Kathy Long's tight red shorts were the middle screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there was not enough meat film to satisfy the curiosity of the movie for the second time. If you are a hard fan of Xena, who needs something to break away for a few hours - go to the grocery store and spend 50 cents for rent. There are several strong similarities between the series and this movie. <br /> <br /> Just do not expect anything more than to be slightly amused for a few hours. <br /> <br /> Unless of course you like derri√®re Kathy Long. You can buy a copy later.
