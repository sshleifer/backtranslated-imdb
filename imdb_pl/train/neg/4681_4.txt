We laughed at our heads. This scenario is so amazing that you either move to CNN or go to sleep. <br /> <br /> My father was a sea captain for 30 years, he could not believe his eyes when he saw the movie. <br /> <br /> During his experience as an officer, he once claimed to command a ship, the captain drank 3 bottles of whiskey / day and (sorry) on the desk. Of course, this was not on a nuclear mission. <br /> <br /> For example, fire in the kitchen, fire is the most important thing on any ship, nuclear or not. At this time, giving a drill is just a Hollywood scenario. When the captain is arrested, he is arrested, you take all his keys and you open the safe in which the pistols are kept. It is stored in a well-guarded room within minutes. You CAN NOT escape, it's like in prison. <br /> <br /> It's funny that my father also had a dog on board, but we can see how Hackman let him pee in the control room. It never happens. My dad cleaned up the mess the dog made, wherever he was. <br /> <br /> Hackman and Washington make the three stars to which this film is assigned, the rest is a bitch ** t. <br /> <br /> When we know that 23 people were still alive in Koersk this movie takes on an extra dimension. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a real thriller about renting a submarine: Thas Boat. <br /> <br />
