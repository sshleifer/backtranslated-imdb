I am an incorrigible skeptic and agnostic, therefore I expected to enjoy this film. However, after seeing him, I honestly believe that I could have done a better document myself. His arguments seem to have only four fake sources (despite the fact that he was mentioned in the subtitles on IMDb, I have not seen Richard Dawkins anywhere), he is edited together with roughly amateur computer effects and does not even make the slightest attempt to look impartial. The narrative is permeated by the entire mocking, almost youthful anti-Christian mood, ruining every possibility that the film can actually change one's mind, contrary to the ordinary preaching of the choir (ie Me). Although there is an interesting discussion about the historicity of Jesus, the film hits an unbearable catch when it starts to worry about the Christian school that the director attended as a child, an institution that apparently crippled him psychologically because he obsessively kidnaps him day. <br /> <br /> Although TGWWT had a low budget, of course, there was still an opportunity to make an intelligent comment on the highly dubious roots of Christianity. There is a shortage of skeptical religious documentaries on the market, and this film could help fill the void. Instead, the director decided to insult our intelligence with this piece of trash, which in the end seems to be a kind of therapeutic exercise for him. It is a pity that his Christian upbringing traumatized him, but he does not have to subject the audience to his own coping mechanism.
