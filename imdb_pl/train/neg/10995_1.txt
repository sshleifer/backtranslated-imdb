Anyone who has seen Comedy Central around midnight in the last few years has probably seen the commercials of this movie. I saw the commercials of this movie for the first time in 2001. It looked like it could be fun, but I did not mean to call the number on the TV screen and order it without watching the movie. I thought I would wait until the movie was available for rental at Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> About a year and a half later I was in Tower Records, and on the "DVDs for less than 20 dollars" was a copy of the movie. Seeing that the DVD was only $ 6.99, I decided to buy it. I went home, put in a DVD player and waited for the laughter to start ... and waited a little longer. Laughter never came. <br /> <br /> I would have to agree with almost every other comment on this page when I say this movie was awful. Sick, desperately tasteless and poorly written and directed, THE UNDERGROUND COMEDY MOVIE is a terrible piece of trash and in my opinion the worst movie of all time. No stars.
