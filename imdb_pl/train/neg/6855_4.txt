Why a woman can not be a strong character in the movie without sleeping with the main character? The campaign manager in this film dreams of running Tom Sellick to the White House. That's all he can think about. So why the devil was having an affair with him? This added nothing to the story and only served to demean the women of success. The only value of this taste was the lovely "everyone slept with your husband" scene. <br /> <br /> In addition, did not the people who made this film see the national conventions that they faked? The transmission between the two main political conventions served only to underline their total ignorance of the nomination and selection process.
