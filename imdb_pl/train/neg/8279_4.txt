This film had all the elements to be an intelligent, shiny comedy, but for some reason it took a noisy trail. Perhaps he did not really know who his audience was: but this is not a male film, given the cast and story, but he is too slapstick and stupid-blond to fully appeal to women. <br /> <br /> If you saw Legal blonde and her continuation, it is like a stunningly horrible sequel. Great actors like Luke Wilson should expect better material. Jessica Simpson could also manage a lot more. Rachael Leigh Cook and Penelope Anne Miller go down in supporting roles that are stupid and not funny. <br /> <br /> Many things in this movie were painted with numbers, various uber-clich√© assemblies, misunderstanding of the last minute, "even the party chaos of the children. This simply suggests lazy script writing. <br /> <br /> It should be possible to find this movie enjoyable if you do not take it seriously, but it is so glaring that it can be better than that you will probably feel frustrated and more disappointed when the scenes pass by.
