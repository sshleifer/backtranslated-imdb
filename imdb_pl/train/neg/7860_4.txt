Martin Weisz, who directed the solid "Rohtenburg", will take part in the growth with Wes Craven, in another shabby "The Hills Have Eyes 2". The memory of the legendary original, which boasted an incredible plot and a dog with a retrospection, will be erased forever by this more technically refined remake (only by name). A group of national guardsmen (and women) are sent to a desert research area surrounded by hills filled with mutants. One by one, weekend soldiers are elected. this is it! There is some brutal violence and a rather violent rape scene, but there is still little more excitement. The "heroes" of the film are ordinary clich√©s and mutants, far from the original Craven "family", mostly reminiscent of Brian Thompson from "Cobra" in conjunction with the creatures that Stan Winston left after the "Wrong Turn" session. A large part of the action takes place in caves, ala "The Descent", and is well shot by Sam McCurdy. A funny aspect is the addition of Wes and Jonathan Craven to a sympathetic mutant who circulates around his cave like Leatherface in the original "Chainsaw" Hooper. Weisz will be accused of this boring defeat, but he is not really guilty, because he is doing everything to maintain tension and squeeze some of the freshness out of imaginary situations. Unfortunately, I'm not a fan.
