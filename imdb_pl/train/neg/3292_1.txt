In this review, a list of good and bad points. Let me start with the bad ones. <br /> <br /> Bad points: Choosing casting (especially Burt Reynolds as Boss Hogg), acting of the wrong cast, plot, idea of ​​making a film in the modern world, direction, editing, soundtrack, and above all the whole idea of ​​making a film a feature film from a TV series that was not very good to start with, despite its popularity. <br /> <br /> Good sides: Jessica Simpson in a red bikini ............ that's all! <br /> <br /> Can be done In the scene in which Jessica Simpson as Daisy Duke goes to Michael Weston as Enos, and asks the question: "Enos, where is Boss Hogg and Roscoe?" in her vague judgment tells her , where are. he might as well ask, "Enos, is this a good movie?", a red bikini would cloud his opinion, saying "yes", although in his right mind he would say, "No, not really." when she was looking in a bikini, she might have been naked, and even that would not have saved that horrible piece of film.
