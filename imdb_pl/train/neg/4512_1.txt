Living in Japan for several years this film does not reflect Japanese culture and does not even come close to explaining what it is to be a Geisha. Unfortunately, a great opportunity was missed to bring the Japanese culture closer to the wider Western public and help demystify the country from which Zen, Samurai, the world of geisha in Kyoto comes from. Some of the most moving moments in the film are showing Americans in a Japanese environment. The dances of the geisha were not authentic. Chinese music was used too much. A small but important detail: the use of incense was nowhere to be seen. Sakura's scenes were almost obscenely kitschy! Interestingly, some Chinese actors were quite convincing as Japanese people.
