It was a movie I could not wait for! In the end, I understood this and was very disappointed. At the beginning, the film talks so little about New York, only a few confusing shots of buildings, streets, bridges and cafes. It really does not focus on the magic of New York. movie set in this movie. I know it is a remake, but it is not a French-style remake! Anyway, here you will see elements reminiscent of French films, such as long and sloppy scenes, lack of or little talk, and of course everyone is smoking a French style! The story follows many lives (too much for my taste) and finally seems to be connected. I feel that there was no sacrifice of heroes as much as in the stories. The film was too short to embrace every fate of every happy ending. So we can see about 30 people for about 5 minutes. And there you have 120 minutes! if you like active scenes, dialogues and things, this is not a movie for you! I give it 4 just because I love New York and I loved the cast!
