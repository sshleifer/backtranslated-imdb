The monster from Enemy Mine somehow found its way to a small mountain community where he lived. He is being chased by a doctor-defender woman who is about to exterminate him. This assassin who looks like a refugee from the Motley Crue music video, rides a motorcycle and tries to save a group of kids who decided on a weekend weekend in the middle of a monster. Decapitations and a lot of blood are primarily to divert attention from a story that is limping like an evil version of the island of Dr. Moreau (and yes, it is worse than that of Val Kilmer).
