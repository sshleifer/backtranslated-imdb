It was an impulse for me from a local video store. Do not make the same mistake as me. This movie is boring, unconvincing and generally boring. The dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is particularly badly written and published; I crouched at every common scene. Dennis Hopper has a few rare performances and is his usual chaotic "me"; his role was not too long for him. And although the movie is supposedly set in Puerto Rico, it's more like a Hollywood movie; all main characters are Caucasian, and some of them speak English with pseudo Irish accents. Strange. Anyway, when you see the one on the shelf of your local video store, keep going.
