Georgia Rule must be one of - if not the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The whole film has a very surreal impression that made me gasp "at least" 7-10 times during an exhausting two-hour course. <br /> <br /> Advertised in the trailer as a film about three generations of women - Jane Fonda as a matriarch, Felicity Huffman as her daughter and Lindsay Lohan as a rebellious, exaggerated, scantily dressed granddaughter, the viewer thinks it will be a clich√©, light, giggle about growing up and joining the family. <br /> <br /> Talk about fake advertisement in the worst release. <br /> <br /> After many pictures of animals doing "fun" things in the background of "key" scenes and not to mention the whole five minutes focusing on the old woman who comes to the doctor's office every week to change the diaper, or the fact that this film tells about the character Lindsay Lohan sexually exploited by her stepfather, Georgia Rule creates her own genre of cinema: an unjustified, horribly played, inadequate comedy dealing with very serious problems in the most awkward, surreal, and strange way. If Garry Marshall wanted this movie to be a drama / comedy, he should have watched The Royal Tenenbaums. Sideways. Junebug. And so on. And so on. <br /> <br /> The only way I feel I can get the reader to understand the terrifying genre that Georgia Rule is subject to is to create a hypothetical situation. Let's say that the movie "40-year-old virgin" was about celibacy being the main hero because he was sexually abused as a child. But instead of making the movie more dramatic, there would be laughter and belly comedy, and all the reactions of the heroes were false, dead human beings pretending to care. <br /> <br /> Throw the yellow budgerigar, Dermot Mulroney as the most flat, non-dimensional figure that could be completely cut out of this badly written script, along with the male character who throws away all your religious beliefs and morals to be with a cheap, too tanned girl who does not have the same interests as him, as well as an unnecessary car chase scene, unreal moments of characters trying to relate to each other and you have the Georgia Rule. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is an insult to those people who are struggling with filmmakers, screenwriters, actors, editors, etc. Who have much more talent and do not get noticed. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie: my rule. <br /> <br /> And if you must, get enough drunk before the deal.
