What a scary, scary movie! One of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I usually love movies like this, "The guy meets an eccentric woman who he likes, but he happens to be involved in someone who does not suit him ..." I expected something predictable and it did not bother me. Movies are always fun mixing the right amount of romance with comedy, but not this one! Every joke drops, and the "romance" makes me vomit. The title character is one of the most "killing" characters I have ever seen on television, the "eccentric woman" is not too eccentric, more bizarre and irritating. "Another Person" is the most reasonable mature person in this movie, but it happens to be equally annoying. These films are for nothing, you can not get around, do not waste time.
