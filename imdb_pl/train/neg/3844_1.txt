First of all, I would like to tell everyone who saw this movie that the actor who played Transvestite is one of my friends, he is called Robert Dugdale, he is a great actor, although he does not talk much about his filmography, he was in several plays and musicals. He currently lives in Terrace B.C. I'm there, he comes to our house almost every Saturday * laughs * Okay, now about the movie, I would not recommend it to anyone who did NOT see it because it's not a movie worth watching, The main reason I thought it was a bad movie is that it never stays in place, it's still bouncing back in time, so it's hard to keep track of it in some moments, and secondly, it's really boring * laughs * Although acting is great, the movie simply does not compare.
