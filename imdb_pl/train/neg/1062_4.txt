Ooops! The seat was a bit painful. He has a charming and fun assumption, but everything goes to hell from there. Matthew Modine is almost always pedestrian and annoying and does not disappoint in this. Deborah Kara Unger and John Neville performed in surprisingly decent performances. Among other things, Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly played this path in advance. I know that parts were created and it is hard to blame the actors when the script and the director tell them to do such jerks. If you want to have scandalous characters, that's fine, but you must have good material to make it work. Not here. Run away, shouting from this movie if possible.
