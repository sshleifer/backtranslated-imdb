Well, I have to say that this movie was so bad that I would leave if I did not have to go to work. And the worst part is that I wanted to see it so badly that I traveled around the city, I paid $ 10 for parking twice because the newspaper auctions were wrong. Vince Vaughn plays a guy he always does - the only time I've seen him play someone else in this movie with John Travolta. In any case, the plot has potential - it sounded great on preview, but it is filled with totally ridiculous, predictable, weak turning points of the story. I was hoping it would be one Christmas movie in which Christmas does not have to be saved, and that Santa does not need to be replaced, but no. The only nice part was the sleigh ride, and the little pale kid was I'm sure this movie would be great for young children, but for adults it's so bad that it's hard to sit.
