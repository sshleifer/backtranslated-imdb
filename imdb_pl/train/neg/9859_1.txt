This movie is simply bad. A total waste of time and money. Jokes are predictable, characters are so trivial, and the way it talks about RPG players is also not fun. The problem is that the authors do not seem to know how RPG works, and most importantly, how to make fun of this game. Of course there are a few losers who play RPGs, like crazy supporters and totally losers. But for me, this is not the funniest way to make fun of this game. This story does not make any sense at all. Who cares how long the game lasts? The biggest problem in this movie is that writers and actors have not even tried to figure out what RPG is going to joke about this. I felt ashamed watching this lame movie.
