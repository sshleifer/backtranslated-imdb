The mission of Assassin Hauser (John Cusak) is to whack in middle of Turin an oil minister from the Middle East, whose name is Omar Sharif (Neikov), led by American interests. Hauser poses as a market maker to let him reach Omar. <br /> <br /> Sometimes satire can be so exaggerated that it becomes the most annoying. Here he does it too much: government, politics, music, war, people are not generally accepted by society and whether I have mentioned "war". And this is what we have here - the most annoying movie that borders on a very bad nightmare brought to life. I still wonder why I continued with the DVD. Besides, there are so many members of the Cusak family that John Cusak seems embarrassed by the family just being there, or is it just me? <br /> <br /> It used to be a John Cusak movie, while in the end it was a bit good. Not here. Believe that John Cusak had an influence on writing and creating this mess. Create what you will. <br /> <br /> There is too much going on in the film, which is accompanied by continuous shots from firearms, bomb attacks and screams that you really can not concentrate, or was it? Probably. Setting the hit takes too much time, which has been largely forgotten for the last 15 minutes. In the meantime, we have a senseless banter among everyone in the cast. And the chemistry between John Cusak and Marisa Tormei? I do not think so, but you know: boy? girl ???? and they needed something that would take more time. <br /> <br /> Yes, for what they were supposed to be (unconventional and annoying) Duff and Kingsley's performances were good. But when I saw the character of Dan Aykroyd, at the beginning of the show, sitting on the toilet, dropping the dump, I knew that the rest of the concert would also go to the tank. I was not wrong. I am sure that some will sing the praise of this effort, but if the rose is still a rose under any other name, it is also a mess ?????????? <br /> <br /> Now remember why I continued with the DVD. I hoped that this story would somehow even out and save. It never was like that. <br /> <br /> Violence: yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes.
