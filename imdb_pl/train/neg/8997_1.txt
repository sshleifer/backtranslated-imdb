This is the worst movie I've ever seen, with the exception of the movie "They saved Hitler's brain," the worst movie I've ever seen. When the movie was released, I was a huge fan of SNL and SCTV, so I expected it to be the funniest movie that could be produced, because there are no limits to the TV program. <br /> <br /> The writers had to think that we would throw ourselves at some abomination, some jokes, some cheap sex and hey, we have a risky side sharing a funny comedy. The quiz from the game show is nothing but cheap unimaginable starts in Let's Make a Deal with gross stupid. The seat started with a single girl, and her boyfriend was just plain grumpy from high school. The stun gun was the right humor for Seasame Street. The performance in the subway in LA was a nondescript humor with no blood taste. A French chef who went to the dark, still with a French accent saying "no difference", you understand. <br /> <br /> The only funny sketch was Chevy Chase, which lasted a whole minute. This means that you have 60 seconds of entertainment in this movie. Oh, yes, I've read the comments that the whole country is stoned in the '70s and you'll like this movie if you're tall. Well, most of the country was not stoned to death in the '70s. If inept writers were stoned, it must have been a cure for a sleepy bay. When I saw this movie, there were 4 other people in the theater. Of course, the word has not yet come out how bad this movie was.
