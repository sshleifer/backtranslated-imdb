My friend was in the cast as FEDS agent (part not saying as I remember). He brought it to a DVD, so I could see it. He was "interesting", but he felt very much like an amateur film. A well-made amateur film. Really boring and badly written. Probably it was fun to get involved, but it definitely did not deserve any extensive edition. Maybe in Omaha they will enjoy it, but this Californian girl was bored and honestly embarrassed for the involvement of my friend. <br /> <br /> If this filmmaker did or does more movies, he should really have a really interesting story and GOOD actors. I'm sure it was a great learning tool for them. I wish them luck in the future and I hope that they will be able to improve the film.
