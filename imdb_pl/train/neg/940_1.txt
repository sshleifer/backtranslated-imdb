Okay, we know why we're watching the movie "The Invisible Maniac" (just look at the cover, man!). T and A everywhere (with much more T than A). But ... should not there be a story that could be related to it? <br /> <br /> "Come on", I hear you say - "these are just girls who are naked! Who needs history? ?! "<br /> <br /> Well, if it was called" The NAKED Maniacs ", I would not have a problem. But because these guys are playing in The Invisible Man, they must have some history, you know that your mind is busy. <br /> <br /> However, all they can collect is how a crazy doctor creates an invisible serum, and when it breaks, uses it to spy on naked women and ends up killing a lot of teenagers. And when you see the slender teenagers you follow, you'll be grateful. <br /> <br /> One star, for T and A, but it's a bit too much for skin fans, so keep going with caution. <br /> <br /> TIDBIT - yes, THIS IS SO SAVANA.
