Allen goes to the country (somewhere he hates to walk in real life) and has a weekend with his friends - which is a typical successful white middle class belly in many of his films. <br /> <br /> I usually find something that can entertain in the comedy of Woody Allen, but here it really falls completely on the face. It seems that even the nobles left him. There really is no plot (bar cuts and pieces of Shakespeare's cod) - but Allen seems to use this place to let half the mystical air, which makes the thing even more meaningless and half-baked. <br /> <br /> It just does not work at any level and is just a gigantic hole. The best thing about this movie (except for the upcoming credits) is that bad reviews make you awake and realize that simply dropping the script and throwing your friends into it is not entertainment.
