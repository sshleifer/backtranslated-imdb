For me, it's just a soap opera. I suppose that every image of extravagant people can be considered a "social commentary". But in the end, I just do not care how you characterize this movie. None of the characters is very nice or addictive. I did not feel chemistry between Hudson and Bacall. If there is a love story here, she is lost in a bad mood. And despite the bends ending with a complete and immediate (and therefore incomprehensible) reversal of Dorothy Maguire as a witness, history is insufficient to keep my interest. No matter how freudian symbolism and psychology are introduced, this story is miserable, melodramatic and banal. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson is noble wooden. This is the least engaging role of Lauren Bacall and one of her worst performances. Dorothy Maguire and Robert Stack deliver more inspiring performances, but her character is pathetic and pitiful. Robert Keith, as a loving, absent father of two wicked adult children, is the most sympathetic figure. The most interesting, however, is the seriously looking Robert Wilke in the small role of the bar owner. Best remembered as a nasty supporter in countless westerns, but here he is an honest, nice guy. <br /> <br /> I take my social commentary with an interesting, engaging story and a few nice characters, thank you.
