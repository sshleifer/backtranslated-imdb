Do not be fooled by the premise - it was one funny movie. The problem - it was not meant to be a comedy. The story nicely prepares you for the ending that will never come. What's worse, the setting NEVER been explained. You will leave the theater asking "Is this it?" I rate it as 2 simply because there were a few short moments of promise, but the finish leaves you completely flat. Nicholas Cage did such a good job as you would expect in this role, but he did not have much work. Everywhere there are weird quirks and interesting corners that have absolutely nothing to do with the movie. Let this movie come out on the video before wasting money.
