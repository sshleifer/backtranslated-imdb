It happened in Assault on Prescient 13 in 2005, it happened with The Lost Boys in 2008 and now it happened with another Wargames classic from the 80s ... :( Why, oh, why, oh, why Hollywood will never learn, leave them alone ... You can not convert them ... They suck ... Everyone hates them ...! <br /> <br /> Those of you who do not they saw the original version from 1983. With Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy, go on loan / buy now .... The equipment may look outdated, the special effects are not the new millennium, but they still hit this rubbish ... <br /> < br /> For those of us who survived the '80s, when hacking was sexy, the Internet was something mysterious, and your disks became an 8-inch variation of floppy disks, well, now we have the wisdom to avoid this movie like the War of the Thermonuclear! br /> <br /> Never before has "a nice game of chess" seemed a better option ...
