I had high expectations after "My Beautiful Laundrette", "Bend it like Beckham" and (less) "East is East". The story of British Asians matching their adopted home had many good results on the big screen, as well as a number of great TV and radio series (kindness, kindness, etc.). This one is falling flat. Despite a good start, he quickly went down. <br /> <br /> In the end it was a terribly typical BBC effort, with strong regional accents, bizarre actors, "soundtracks from those days" and many "problems" in the attempt to be worthy. <br /> <br /> I found myself in many points during this movie. The letter is predictable. Every possible clich√© was pulled out and aired. In fact, I have a problem with thinking about any intercultural / intergenerational devices that could be used and which are not. The heroes were slim and confused: an eccentric, non-conformist minister; an old woman well-meaning but ultimately racist; overweight, overbearing aunt; impetuous Indian parents; working-class neighbors; "Wise" deep grandma; motorcycle bandit. The screenplay was weak, with every chance of shocking the public with an explicit racist dialogue with two racist white figures. And why it had to be set in the 70's (except for the need to excuse a soundtrack from the 70's) is a mystery. It probably makes incredible characters a bit more reliable for people born after 1979. I do not know. <br /> <br /> Even for these things, good acting could lead to respect. Instead, ordinary "BBC comedies" suspects were taken away to pick them up. "Bend it like Beckham" had much better comic acting (and serious acting in reality) than that with virtually unknown cast. <br /> <br /> In summary, the lazy cliched script, has stopped working, boring predictable history. Give me a break. <br /> <br />
