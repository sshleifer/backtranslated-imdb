This is a direct continuation of "The Mummy's Hand" (1940), because the main character, Stephen Banning (played by Dick Foran) is now thirty years older and tells the story (using archival materials) to her son's fiance. There are only two extraordinary aspects of the film: Banning's early death and the presence of Turhan Bey. <br /> <br /> Lon Chaney as a mummy Kharis gets the highest bills, although considering the nature of his role, he has little more to do than to limp and throw his hands. There is nothing terrifying in his presence, except Isobel (Elyse Knox), an attempt to escape his fianc√©. Dick Foran gets a second bill, but he died in the first fifteen minutes! We would have to wait until "Psycho" (1960), when the main character (Janet Leigh) dies before the end of the movie! Banning's buddy from the first movie, Babe Jenson (now Henson), appears a little later, looking much, much older, and not doing any of the comics he did in the original. It's hard to believe it's the same actor! Unfortunately, this great acting work is wasted, because he is killed by Kharis after only two short scenes. Then, the son of John Banning (played by the player John Hubbard) who will lead the chase to the cemetery - NO! The sheriff leads the torches holding the crowd to Banning's house to burn him and kill the mummy. Sound commonly known? <br /> <br /> Turhan Bey is presented to the audience as the new High Priest, Mehmet Bey, who cares for Khan and feeds him with dance leaves. With his "exotic" voice and appearance, it's a pity that it's so easy to kill him. A better movie would be if "Babe" took a Von Helsing load in tracking the mummy, in the final decisive battle with him and Mehmet Bay. But instead, we have a transformation of the pedestrians of various sets from previous Universal horrors by the burglar Griffin Jay, who wrote many other Universal gadgets, although he also did "Don Winslow of the Navy" (1942), as well as "Don Winslow of the Coast Guard" (1943), in which Elyse Knox also appeared. <br /> <br /> Elyse Knox starred Anne Howe in six films by Joe Palook (1946-1949) and of course Turhan Bey with 43 films and television credits are great in the title role of "The Amazing Doctor X" (1948). <br /> <br /> Pictures are much darker and climatic (with lots of noisy shadows in the sheriff's office) than the first movie of the mummy "Kharis", but nothing interesting and exciting. <br /> <br /> I'll give him 3.
