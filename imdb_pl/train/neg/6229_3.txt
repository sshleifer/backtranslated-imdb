First of all, let's ask for a few things: a) I AM an anime fan - it was always a fact (I watched Speed ​​Racer all the time in kindergarten). b) I like a few B movies because they are fun. c) I like Godzilla movies - a lot. <br /> <br /> Going forward when the movie first appears, it looks like it's going to be your regular B movie, all the way to the FX shit, but all the sudden BOOM! Anime is coming! This is when the movie goes down to WWWAAAAAYYYYY. <br /> <br /> Animation is VERY bad and cheap, even worse than what I remember from SPEED RACER, for cookies! In fact, it's so cheap that one of the few scenes from the movie that I "vividly remember" is that a group of children ran out of school ... and it's the same children over and over again! FX are terrible too; dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla. In addition, switching to live animation for animation is unorganized, dialogue and voices (especially the English dub I watched) were awful and I begged Dad to take out the tape from the DVD / VHS player; The only thing that allowed me to survive was breaking up jokes and comments like robots and Joel / Mike on MST3K (you choose the season). Honestly, this is the only way you can barely enjoy this movie and survive it at the same time. <br /> <br /> Heck, I'm going to show it to my colleague Otaku, to my Halloween for B- Movie night. Because it is silly, quite painful to watch and unintentionally funny at the same time, I give this film 3/10, an improvement compared to 0.5 / 10, which I originally intended to give. <br /> <br /> (According to my rating scale: 3/10 means both boring and bad.) As fun as counting up to three, unless you find a way to laugh, it will become so funny how to count down to 15.)
