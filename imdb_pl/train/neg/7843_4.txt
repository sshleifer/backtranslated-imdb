It is a poor continuation: he lacks the interest and light touch of the wonderful "Man Called Horse" in almost every aspect, and in comparison with himself they do not seem to be the same genre. <br /> <br /> Return is almost a parody of the first one and tries to summon up various Indian ceremonies, but it turns out to be too difficult to erase the magic of the first one. In this movie, the tribe is lost and abandoned, having lost their homeland, modern life has entered paradise and lives in extreme poverty and poverty. Perhaps this is what it is all about: the first movie took us to the place where we would like to be, a simpler time. This leads us to spoiled Indians in a miserable world, and the White Man is a hero and savior who rather negates the whole idea of ​​the film. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the first consisted in the fact that the white man learned and discovered that true civilization lies in values ​​rather than Western materialism. In the second movie, all of this is missing, so we end up in a weak film. <br /> <br /> A huge disappointment.
