Trust me, it's one movie you want to avoid, and it comes from one big fan Denzel Washington. The frustrating part is that it is 1/3 of the GREAT film. The first part of this movie is a unique work of creating characters and new relationships between Creasy and the girl he paid to protect. All the trailers of the movie mention that she was kidnapped. So I do not betray anything when I say that after the abduction the film turns into an almost unbearable mess. Whatever the director has tried to achieve, everything he does, makes the audience literally bored. Fast, crazy and uncertain cuts follow the next half hour while Creasy is tracking the perpetrators. These cuts are so unnatural and bland that everything they do is get you out of history. I'm sure the director thought that this disturbing way of presenting this story meant a change in Creasy's character and meant that there would be a different movie. Well, he was right. The film, which followed, was complete and unsatisfactory. The result is a depressing ending that destroys even the first forty minutes of the movie.
