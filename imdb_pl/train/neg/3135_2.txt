What piece of rubbish was this movie. The assumption was fine, but even at the beginning, with the shitty effects of mixing with a giant of normal size (even the effects in Hercules were better) I knew it would be bad. But dialog boxes are really a terrible part of the movie. He is completely inconsistent, stupid and stupid. I felt it was written by the ninth grader in the creative class and I got D-. I want to hit Casper van Diem and other actors for following this film. <br /> <br /> I had my share in bad and bad movies (I love the series of shakes), but this ... I do not recommend it at all. It's stupid, and completely stunning bad dialogues will make you flinch.
