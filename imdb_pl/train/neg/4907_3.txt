SPOILERS THROUGHOUT ALL !!!! <br /> <br /> I have read the book "1. die "and I wanted to check if the film follows the book, so I watched it. In most cases it happened. There were a few minor differences (for example, the location of the last brutal scene), but not much and most of the time the movie remained faithful to the book more than most movies. <br /> <br /> It could have been a mistake - although the film was perfectly manned, especially Pollen and Bellows - the book was not impressed. Or let me take it back. I started to be very impressed, gradually becoming more and more disappointed, and at the end I was completely dissatisfied and I felt almost dazed. No difference with the movie. Here's why. <br /> <br /> There is no "payout" in the book or in the movie. I rarely read who did this thriller, which created such a profession with its final resolution and I was hoping that the movie will change a bit. <br /> <br /> The whole - (he did it, she did NOT do it, they did NOT BOTH) - it was not interesting, not fascinating and more confusing, annoying and depressing than anything else. Let's add that Lindsay's love for life dies at the end (after her illness brightens up and cries at his grave) ... and then he cuts himself to the place where he is considering suicide ... and then he suddenly fights for her living with a TRUE villain who has been cleansed after being arrested ... but it turns out that he and his wife were together this time ... HELL !!! It all became "GENERAL HOSPITAL" now instead of a good old thriller. I felt cheated and deceived by the book, and watching the movie (I must admit that it caught my attention nicely - acting was very good for a television movie) he hoped he would not follow the book he made. <Br> <br /> I still think that the movie is possible to watch and for some reason it does not leave such a bad taste in my mouth as a book (or maybe I just knew what would happen) But I must say that the story did not go away .
