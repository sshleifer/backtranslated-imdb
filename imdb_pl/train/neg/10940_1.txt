First of all, let's all agree that Lorenzo Lamas could never be considered a qualified actor, barely even decent, sometimes simply bad. However, in this piece of @ *! ^ The SnakeEater film industry as a whole sank. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the story. Vietnamese veterinarian named Jack Kelly, also known as the Soldier (who is supposed to be as hard as a leather strap, and then a little who can be believed when he pushes the palate of the two men's feet and sticks them to the floor), knows that his the family was killed and his sister kidnapped. That's why he goes on a solo mission to save his sister. It had a certain potential, but at the beginning quite thin. <br /> <br /> Now acting. Being an actor, I am qualified to say that these were some of the WORLD actors in the history of art !!!!! The lamas are, well, themselves. Jackas playing Clampets / Deliverance rejections should be suspended and shot for their so-called performances, which offend actors all over the world, especially talented ones who never have a big break! <br /> <br /> Finally, the action. Fighting with weapons is so best at BEST, and fistfights are deplorable. I saw more real fights at the Renaissance Festival (and these were pretty fake)! <br /> <br /> Readers, listen to me: AVOID THIS SUBJECT CACA AT EVERY COST! IF IT WAS THE ONLY FILM EXISTING, YOU WANT TO AVOID this! Due to the number of brain cells, DO NOT watch this!
