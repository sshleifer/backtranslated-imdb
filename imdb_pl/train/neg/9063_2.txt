The fact that most of the budget supposedly hit the list of heavy throws should not have been important if it was exposed with cunning and imagination and with sympathy for the original satirical designs. Instead, we get incredibly bad song and dance sequences with picturesque beggars and whores, and the last alienation is achieved by retreating to reveal that the action took place on the music scene, respectively for production that is more Lionel 'Oliver' Blair than Brecht. The acting talent is shamefully misused: Migenes and Walters are good, but they do not have to try hard: Migenes at least has a great voice and a sense of material. Julia looks perfectly like Mack, but struggles with the figure, tied up with an artificial, lovely accent. Harachowski Peachum is embarrassingly brought up and Polly is terrible. Adaptations of texts, scripts and music are often awkward: a bad move was to base the movie on the Bowderised version of Marc Blitzstein on Broadway, but at least his words were singing, unlike most of what was interpolated in gestures of fidelity. And the attempt to overcome the low budget by shooting in claustrophobic corners on fog-covered sets illuminated by bright blues and oranges, as if by some bargain basement Vittorio Storaro completely fails - the movie simply looks cheesy and tacky. Shameful.
