"Happy Go Lovely" has only two things. And these two things are Vera-Ellen's legs. This is the British (Excelsior Films) version of the musical M-G-M with the stars of the second level. I imagine that Vera-Ellen took on this role, thinking that she could eventually lead her to the rank of the main music star. But, I'm sorry to say, Mrs. Ellen's chance did not pay off. <br /> <br /> Starting with a horrible Scottish number and stumbling through a horrible dialogue to the next boring tune, this movie seems very heavy messy. The predictable misconception of identity is very thin, with the exception of David Niven, Cesar Romero (who is first in the role of producer) and Bobby Howes (who is completely wasted in the role of nothingness), the rest cast is completely forgotten. <br /> <br /> Choreography is boring, but Mrs. Ellen gives her everything. She has never been as famous as most other music stars (and should not be because she could not sing or even "dance" in a few of her photos. "But when she danced, it was just enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that this movie, which could make it a star, did not give it the tools needed to shine. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
