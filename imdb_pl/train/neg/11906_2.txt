Watching "Der himmel Ã¼ber Berlin" as a teenager in the late 1980s was a deep experience for me - "that's what films could be like". Together with "Paris, Texas" and "Until the End of the World" it still holds a special place in my heart and mind - witness of the genius of Wim Wenders. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately later years The steady decline in the quality of his work with the "Million Dollar Hotel" and "Land of Plenty" hit a terrible low point. The captivating photos or music have disappeared. Do not look or show great insight. Only the characters and weakly hidden political statements remain, which only boil down to stereotypes and quite frankly mock the intelligence of a mature audience. <br /> <br /> Is the well dry? Whatever the reason, it's time for Mr. Wenders to get up or stop altogether.
