Okay, I remember watching the first one, and the boy was sucking. After watching it, I just laughed and said to myself: "Oh my, just another low-budget movie B. I will never see part 2 for this." Then, about a year and a half later, came the second part. It sucked even more. But I just laughed again and said, "There's no way I'll ever see part 3 for this." Then about 1/2 a year later the third part appeared. I was stupid enough to rent him and boy, I just burst after seeing. God, I've never realized how many movies can suck these days. Just save $ 7.50 and do not borrow the whole series. Trust me, it's worth every penny.
