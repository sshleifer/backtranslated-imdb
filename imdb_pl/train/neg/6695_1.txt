For some time I had something for this hatchling of Kari and no complaints about what she looked like in this movie. But after catching him last night in HIGH DEFINITION, I'm sure: this is the only thing in the movie that is not below the standard. The script is awful, the acting terrible, the direction is terrible. In another comment I saw someone commenting on how great the sex scenes were ... what? Not at all. When a movie is so bad, you might as well turn it into a softcore porn, but instead I see a white, sticky guy blocking me from seeing Wuhrer's body and scenes that give me nothing but malice. They should just go to the movie theaters so that the film is not a complete waste of time, but not. This script is so horrible that they should use the Wuhrer's appearance, because it is the only professional of this film. 2/10, just because it looked so hot.
