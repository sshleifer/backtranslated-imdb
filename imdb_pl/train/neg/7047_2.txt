I warn you: Neither Zeta-Jones nor McGregor play the main role, because the poster would like you to believe. Their roles are in fact minor. <br /> <br /> The movie stumbles badly between exaggerated comedy and realistic drama, and none of them is really addictive. Especially, I think that it's impossible to gather sympathy for the main character, not to mention his friends with turns and fiance obsession with sex. The plot goes awry, and I turned off this one by two-thirds - which is unusual for me because I like to finish what I start. Good game and beautiful surroundings takes from 1 to 2 stars. <br /> <br /> 2/10
