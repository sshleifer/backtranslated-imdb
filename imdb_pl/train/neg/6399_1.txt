First of all: Richard Pryor and Jackie Gleason, two big comics have turned into juices for a bratworm child. They both sold in a worse place than Pryor. Two: A horrible, exaggerated sentimental scenario that could be used in the film by Harold Lloyd. Three: Choosing a black actor as a toy; the racial subtext of this is unbearable because it has never been touched. There is no news here, part of Pryora could be played by any comedian. Four: This kid ... I would like to be able to go back in time and prevent him from performing ... which would mean such films as Kid Co. about their strength of mind. So if you want to watch some great comics that stick to sick sweet baby flutter, go ahead. If you want to see them in something good, see old standby Pryora and Gleason in something better, such as newlyweds.
