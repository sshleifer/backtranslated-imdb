Granting credit where it is necessary, only technicolor, costumes and sets deserve any honorable mention. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly the lowest point in the long career of BING CROSBY in Paramount. The script is more or less as clumsy as you can imagine, neither ordinary Bing, nor William Bendix, nor Sir Cedric Hardwicke can do anything to fix it. <br /> <br /> Bendix looks extremely stupid in a wig wig. And poor Rhonda Fleming has the role of a heroine of costumes, which requires her to look with admiration for Bing and a little more, except for distorting a few inspired ballads in a voice probably named for the occasion. <br /> <br /> Just awful! Marek Twain's wit is not visible in any of the scenarios. Only die-hard Crosby fans can appreciate this mess in the film, considering the bad direction. Even the stats look like they do not know what to do. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: Boring as a dish. Not recommended, even for children.
