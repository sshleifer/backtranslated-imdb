Spoilery <br /> <br /> Well, the summary of one line says it all. "Le samurai" Melville is the original and there are elements of "Leona". And they are better - much better! <br /> <br /> In "Samurai", Alain Delon is a lone warrior / professional assassin who keeps a bird in a cage and steals cars for his tasks (with so much tension in the scene!). Even the end is exactly the same: the samurai is looking for death with dignity and is shot with an empty weapon in his hand. The world has changed, it realizes and there is no place for samurai in it. <br /> <br /> Delon does not kill as many people as a Ghost dog. But I think Jarmusch really liked Leon and even Rodriguez's Desperado. So he added it too. And let me guess: the girl will become a professional like a Ghost dog (like Natalie Portman in "Leon")? <br /> <br /> So what did Jarmusch think eventually? Where is the unique, original thought in this film? <br /> <br /> I do not see the point in creating copies of carbon (celluloid). <br /> <br /> 4/10 rating by Macaulay Connor
