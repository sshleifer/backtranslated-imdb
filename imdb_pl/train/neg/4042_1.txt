This movie is beautiful, but it's like watching a really bad experimental theater. The plot (if there was one) does not make sense. But this is very "artistic". A lot of shots of half-dressed actors struggling and staring deep into their eyes. Many artistic shots through windows and people outside the frame. Mumbles and people wander longingly. Long close-ups of faces and bodies. Before you reach the triangle on the roof with your cat, you will be ready to drop a bottle of KY onto the screen. <br /> <br /> It's supposed to be a father and son relationship, but you just want them both to have f * $ and each other and end up with it. If you always wanted to see bad Russian gay porn without any money, your wish was granted.
