Veteran director and producer Allan Dwan, whose enormous series of films includes both completely forgotten and repeated (for example, John Wayne in "Sands of Iwo Jima"), he tried his hand at the great musical "I Dream of Jeanie". Using the main cast of singers with little film experience and, as it turned out, practically without a future, he told fictional, and not the least offensive story about the great American songwriter Stephen Foster. <br /> <br /> Bill Shirley is a young, in love Foster, whose goodness for the slaves involves transferring the money saved to the engagement ring to cover the hospital costs of the injured little black boy. His intention is Inez McDowell (Muriel Lawrence), whose unbearable little sister, Jeanie (Eileen Christy), slowly realizes that she is in love with the almost uncompromising blacksmith of song. Foster is in love with Inez, who is rebellious by the number 1 composer on the tune of Levee Hit Parade, "O Susannah." Enter the minstrel of Edwin P. Christy (Ray Middleton) to help start the career phase of Foster's career. <br /> <br /> This is, according to the standards of a music film from the early fifties, a large production. Sets are rich in this special Hollywood way that presents counterfeits with all the additions. The singers are not half angry, and Foster's songs are almost impossible to ruin. <br /> <br /> But it is also the literal whitewashing of the pre-World South. The largest number include a black face for everyone on stage, a historical anomaly and a modern fragment of thoughtless racism. If these images of black people were somewhere nearby, the abolitionists would be rightly convicted for interfering in such a charitable institution. <br /> <br /> "I Dream of Jeanie" apparently sank into the treasury of the studio with barely a whisper of death. Now revived by Alpha Video for just $ 4.99, it's a song from the era with cute songs and repulsive sentimentalists about the victims of America's great crime, slavery. <br /> <br /> It was Hollywood that was released two years before Brown v. Education Council. It had to warm up the hearts of some moviegoers who wore linen for the theater.
