There are times when the movie ends, which wants to get a refund for the time just spent. It was one of those times. I almost gave up only 15 minutes to withstand ... and I regret that I did not have ... <br /> <br /> The rate at which a person goes from simple, controlled life to full invertebrability and irresponsibility can never be so fast . <br /> <br /> From the celebration of graduation to the predictable ending of Tristana Price (Jesse Metcalfe), a man of privilege and culture allows himself to be seduced by a woman, violence and mind-changing substances. Of course, the female part is understandable when we observe the talents of beautiful April (Nathalie Kelley). But you can not understand a penny for the pound aspect of drugs, violence and dedication to the person he has just met. <br /> <br /> To be honest, besides being able to stare at Nathalie Kelley and Monika Keen, this movie has no advantages. Save your money, save time ... do anything else ...
