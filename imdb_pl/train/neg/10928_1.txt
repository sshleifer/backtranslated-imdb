I just saw this movie and what a waste of time. The film was predictable and slow. Essentially, this is bad news from the Mormons that play basketball sanctioned by the church. Instead of watching this movie, I should have a root canal. Of course, episodes were driven by sponsorship / financing. This movie had potential because of the scandalous behavior that the Mormons show when they play basketball sanctioned by the church, but because it is rated as PG, the real nature of this performance can not be transferred to a movie. Acting is awful, with the exception of Clint Howard and Fred Willard. The appearance of Thurl Bailey in the film was completely unnecessary.
