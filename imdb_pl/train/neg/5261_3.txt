I have read some other comments and I have to agree with those that have not reached the end. I thought it would be good ... until the end. He kept your mind moving and then splashed. I have no idea what has happened in the last few minutes of the movie, except for the complete mess. It seems that they did not have enough money to come up with a good ending, so they improvised. At first they had a mysterious thing that made people disappear, and then they had a guy talking about Zone 51 (which makes you think about aliens), and then, after it happened. I thought that actors and actresses are doing well because the script is over. In any case, if you watch this movie, be prepared for disappointment at the end.
