My complaints concern the stimulation of film and material at your fingertips. While archival film and letters give the film a fresh and interesting perspective, too often the material selected for distinction is not very interesting (for example, when Goebbels complains about this or that ailment, or tc., Or the advertising material of his nausea) . small German hometown). In addition, the film crawls along. 1920-1939, and then steamed through the years of the war. In conclusion, the movie is a bit better than the History Channel documentary, except that the filmmaker has a slightly greater sensitivity than the average documentary editor from the History Channel, and therefore can more cleverly organize the details of Goebbels' life. Even so, I thought I wanted to.
