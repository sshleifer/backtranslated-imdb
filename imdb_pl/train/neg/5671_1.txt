If you like to see how animals are skinned, their heads are shattered, the dogs are slashed, and my people stamp on them, this one is for you! But if you are a little normal and you do not need to see real material depicting animal cruelty, give it. This movie is trying to shock the viewer and certainly yes. With snuff for animals at the beginning, and killing children in the film (at least false), it was enough to turn it off. I have seen movies like this before showing footage from slaughter (BTK movie) and this type of recording should not be allowed in horror. We're watching gore and horror, because we know his make-up and special effects, so we should not sit down and watch the movie and see the real killing of animals, not what we've rented the movie for. If anything, there should be a large warning label on this type of junk movies to make people win, do not be surprised. As a very passionate horror fan, he turned my stomach away. The whole cast of the film and the film crew have to check their heads.
