When I was in school, I made a film about a couple wandering through trees and talking, and I realized that in the middle of the edition it was not just a failed aesthetic strategy, but the stereotype of Canadian cinema: soaked lyricism marrying an empty metaphor burdened with knife stabs in social commentary. But no matter what the errors of my film are, I feel much better after seeing this ... this ... something. First of all, mine ran 20 minutes, not 85, and had more content in it: every pointless matter here is spoiled for four, five, six unmerciful minutes. The male advantage is simply an unbelievable, frightening, loud creeper that gives off explosions of dramatic improvisation between the philosophical insights torn out of the U of T pub, and he gets plenty of space to hate us. It must be admitted that if it were not such a hole, the third act would make less sense because a pair of snark dudes appears to provide distant and utterly useless echoes of the value of "exploitation"; but it does not make it easier to watch the sizzling curses "please" in zoom-in until the magazine runs out. I'm taking back what I said about the AUTUMN FAMILY, who at least had the courage of his own misbegotten lechery: this cinematic crater is and will remain the worst Canadian movie of all time. At least I really hope so.
