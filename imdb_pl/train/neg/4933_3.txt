This movie was not so bad compared to the first two sequels of the original. The director is Martin Kitrosser from Friday, 13th. The operation is very bad, but gore and special effects make it interesting. This is one of the things that I like about Screaming Mad George (the artist from the effects of make-up in the movie), its effects are so bizarre that they will watch you in the bad movie just to find out how crazy they get. The movie is not really so bloody, but inside there is an incredibly nasty scene of chewing eyeballs with a toy larva (what!?!) Mickey Rooney appears as a guest, probably not too enthusiastic, but maybe you need money? If you liked the fourth round of freaks (my favorite of all 5), you'll probably like this one. I liked it better than the Matrix! Enjoy.
