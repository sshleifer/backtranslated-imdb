I will not care about the plot summary, because you know what the film is about, and besides, there is almost no plot. I have seen several reviewers calling ISOYG a film "against rape" or even a feminist statement, and I just have to interfere in the shocking hypocrisy of these claims. <br /> <br /> First of all, what do we see on the cover of this film? That's right: there is a shapely woman behind them. Regardless of whether it was an attempt by Zarchi to make a rape statement - and I absolutely do not believe it was - it is completely irrelevant. The film is marketing sex and excitement of sexual assault, and the material is so graphic (everything is shown, but actual penetration), THAT ONE, but the crowd of indigenous supporters will enjoy it. ) in the film is uncomfortable, brutal and difficult to watch. There is something that can be said about the presentation of a terrible crime in such a brutal light, but there was no reason for this scene to last for 30 minutes, none. There was not much development of the victim's character, and only one of the rapists is slightly developed (just a few moments before the murder), so the stage does not engage at the emotional level. Really, it's just presented to show extreme sexual violence and can be said after films related to ISOYG on IMDb (Caligula, Cannibal Ferox, etc.) That attracts only a crowd of exploitation. <br /> <br /> In the end, several reviewers praised the so-called Zarchi documentary style and lack of soundtrack. But considering how inept everything else is in the movie (acting, script, etc.), I suspect that these were financial decisions, and the film looks like a document because it literally created the camera and let its actors do their own. <Br /> <br /> I do not intend to get stoned on my tall horse, talking about the ISOYG content. I am an advocate of exploitation / horror and love for video. In fact, I give this movie only three stars because it really moves the envelope much further than other movies. However, it is also poorly made and after the rape, just completely boring for the rest of the movie, when we watch a few noises, usually without murders, and we wait for credits to be written. <br /> <br /> It's probably worth a look once, if you're a hardcore 70's fan, but I'm telling you that the movie is generally pretty bad and not worth your famous reputation.
