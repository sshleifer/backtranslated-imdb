The comedy power of Pryora and Gleason could not save this dog from a plot like a plot, a weak script, grim acting and a funny continuity in editing this mess together. He has several unforgettable moments, but the well dries quickly. As a child, I remember it as a warm Luke vehicle for two comedian actors, but there was always something weird about the flow and feeling of what was conveyed in each scene and how it relates to the plot. Watching him again after many years, he shouts schlock-a-mania. I do not care so much for racial controversy, because I would not mind that the film would take this problem with disdain. The most obvious disadvantage for me is that the scenes are arranged like a confused, unrelated series of 2-minute comedy bits of the situation (not the very good ones) that have been linked by the editor to a completely new local waterhole. Characters change feelings and motivations on cents, without rhyme or reason, between scenes and scenes, which makes you feel like no one had any idea what to get out of the script. Not that it was a gem to start with. I feel bad because of two actors whose legacy is disturbed by this disaster, which should never happen. Maybe my sense of humor has become too sophisticated ...
