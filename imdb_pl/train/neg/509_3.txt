This film is about British prisoners of war from World War II fleeing from the camp in Germany. <br /> <br /> I consider the "Wooden Horse" to be boring. The subject could be exciting, tense and full of adrenaline, but the "Wooden Horse" is told in a very simple way. It is a collection of simple and badly told events, without suspension and emotion. The first half clearly says how prisoners of war dug a tunnel, but the events are so simple, with an insufficient number of errors and close shins to grasp me. The other half of the movie is even worse, they simply move from place to place without chasing after the cat and mouse. And if the characters can speak a little less and have more action in the action movie! I am disappointed with "The Wooden Horse", who wasted the potential to become a great movie.
