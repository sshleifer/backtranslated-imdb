This false journey never comes close to matching the wit and madness of the perfect adventure that your friends took on their first movie. This part tries to move away from its prequel to capture some new blood from jokes, but it is not a good round and travel anywhere interesting or fun. <br /> <br /> It's almost half an hour of losing guys doing a rock concert (and many people are watching on "free TV" - since when is this happening?) Surely the screenwriter could have done something more creative; Look at how all the random elements of the first movie have been carefully related, combining them in a scientific presentation. Not in this movie that almost ended the Bill & Ted series. The joke is over. <br /> <br /> Grim Reaper is thrown into the mix for any reason. This infusion, like the entire story, is poorly made and lacks sparks for comedy or audience involvement. There is the impression of ZZ Top, driven for no reason. There are lights, smoke, mirrors, noise. But nothing really creative or funny. <br /> <br /> Skip this fake thing.
