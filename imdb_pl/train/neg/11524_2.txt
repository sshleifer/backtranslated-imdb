Quite an inconsistent film about a man who belonged to and left a superficial hippie religious cult of the 1960s who fights them sixteen years later. The man has a child with one of the other cultists who, during a police raid, is hidden and taken by another man named Hawk who lives in a small hut by the river. Cult kills some of its followers or some of the city's residents. It is difficult to keep track of who the characters are or in which time the scenes are to take place. The leader is released from prison sixteen years later (I got it from the box - I missed the time in the film). No one is older, not noticeably. <br /> <br /> One murder is carried out with a large circular saw, others are done with knives or crossbows. I have never heard the name of the hero mentioned in the movie, but he is the one who breaks the most, hooting and hollering. <br /> <br /> The movie is patched rather weakly, with the help of the reader (little) to explain what is happening. Some sound effects were very bad. The man punches a fist and we hear the crack of a cracking whip. The woman shoots a gun, and we do not hear the fire, but instead we hear a ricochet! It seems that this has not been done for the comic effect.
