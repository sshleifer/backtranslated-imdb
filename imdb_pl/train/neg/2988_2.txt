First of all, I really liked Zombi 2 Lucio Fulci. This movie was a complete trash. I could not stand it. The plot was a joke, acting was a joke, and the fact that Zombie 3 has nothing to do with Zombie 2 is even more of a joke. <br /> <br /> We are jumping from Voodoo to DEATH 1 HARMFUL AGENT AGENDA People BACK TO LIFE. Regardless, this movie is not worth $ 1.00, which costs it to be borrowed. I really liked lucio fulci, but this one was awful. If Zombie 3 is an indicator of what the zombie 4 and 5 will look like, I think I will simply skip it. <br /> <br /> Zombi 2 is an amazing flique tho.
