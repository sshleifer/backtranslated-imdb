MONSTER - He was great; I loved the special effects that created this monster that looked like the updated version of the "Black Lagoon Creature". Scenes with this beast wandering the land and catching people ranged from good to falling. <br /> <br /> SOCIAL COMMENTARY: A significant part of the story takes place in the quarantine area as physicians (at the government's request), I conclude that there is a disease similar to SARS. In short, we get a familiar government history. You know, I expect this liberal paranoid way of thinking with Hollywood movies to always paint our government as corrupt, but it looks like the Koreans are copying this format and it's very tedious. Here comes the excitement and tension of this "monster". It just pulls the movie down. The main family depicted in the film must be watched from a distance, while a young girl from their family, presumably dead, was dragged away by the creature. <br /> <br /> MORAL: Typical "do not pollute the water" message, because it can happen - terrible mutant monster. It used to be a message about anti-nuclear bombs from 1950, when radiation caused giant ants, spiders, fish or anything in these science-fiction movies. Now they focus on "environmental problems". <br /> <br /> HUMOR It was stupid. I usually laugh at a slapstick, but it was not funny. I do not know if the Korean sense of humor is so pathetic, or whether the film deliberately tried to be very modest, taking into account the old films "Godzilla". Let's hope it's the other one. <br /> <br /> TRANSFER - Video transfer was good. It was a picture with a sharp appearance, and the sound was decent, with a lot of noise from the crowd at the back of the speaker. I watched it in Korean with English subtitles. It could have been a mistake, because after half an hour the Korean throat voice sounds annoying. <br /> <br /> OVERVIEW - it had a promise, but it turned out to be a big disappointment and even boredom in too many places that is unforgivable for the modern monster movie. Two hours were too long for this story. As this film attracted record-breaking crowds in Korea, I do not know. They can not have too many movies to enjoy and support.
