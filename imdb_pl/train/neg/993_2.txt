I'm going to write about this film and the "Irreversible" scene in it. So you are warned if you have not seen the movie yet. These are just my thoughts, why I think the movie will fail (after all, the game is intended). <br /> <br /> Acting sensibly, Rosario Dawson is really good and almost conveys a portrait of a younger person for almost a decade (a teenager in other words). The villain guy is good, but he loses his "bad" touch just before the end. If it never really changes, why did he let the woman tie him? He did not want to, dot. Then we also have a bartender / second rape Dude. Actually, I do not think you need him. At least not for the second rape, but more on that later. <br /> <br /> Let us repeat this story. The figure of Rosarios is sexually insecure, she may even have lesbian tendencies (see her scene with her friend). It was not intended, as Rosario herself says, but there is sexual tension between them. Character Rosario meets a guy who is a sexual Predator in all his evil senses. But he makes an impression on her. <br /> <br /> Rosario said her character had a boyfriend before. I beg to differ. Because it works as if it was her first boyfriend, which also emphasizes her telephone conversation with her mother. Speaking of the mother, we have another problem. After the first rape, Rosarios does not tell anyone what happened. Saying that her relationship with her mother is very close, nothing will be investigated later. If Rosarios did not call her mother or act strangely, her mother would be worried about being crazy. There was so much potential here. Also her friend: We see her at the party, it is obvious that something is happening and the "boom" she disappeared. <br /> <br /> The first rape is almost unbearable. But it feels like a pinch when it's compared to the end (rape), which gives the impression of being hit by a sledgehammer! After the rape, no. 1 we get too stretched scenes. Threads are opened (eg her construction works indicate that she can be a lesbian, as one guy who tried to hit her ...), but left in the open. No real social contact if you leave a bartender guy who is involved in the second and last rape scene. It is obvious that he is not a "nice" guy, and his character is developing a little. But when the character Rosarios again meets his rapist in the classroom, his presence in the film seems pointless. We realize that the figure of Rosarios is no longer the same, that she went "bad" and is able to hurt people. (Too) Many scenes show exactly that he is emotionless, he only does drugs and other things. Returning to Rapist # 1, who cheats the test, gets caught by the character Rosarios and decides to meet together again (really?). As it sounds absurd, the guy meets her, not without seeing him earlier, with another girl (very likely he was also raped, although fortunately we have not seen it) and his football career. Well, the career is long and is persecuted. It is an attempt to give your hero a certain depth and almost works, but on the other hand it is too banal to stay with you. So Rapist # 1 surrenders to Rosarios ... why exactly? Because he promised her, it was her day? Again, really? Such a guy never loses control, especially with the woman he raped earlier ... I think it's going to show us how stupid he is. The bartender guy would be working as someone who could hit him on the head or something like that, but letting him feel that way, he just feels bad. Another possibility would be a drug in his drink. <br /> <br /> So the rapist # 1 undresses and has blindfolded, and the figure Rosarios ties him on the bed ... seriously, it's just crazy! But what's next is even crazy. First, he talks with him and then "closes" him and punches him. It is as difficult to see as the rape number one scene. It's not about what this guy deserves or not, it's just intense. And of course they wanted it. Now, when it's "finished", the bartender enters and rapes ... the rapist # 1. If it really was to act as a revenge movie, it would be better if the Rosarios figure did all the "revenge". Having a henchman and taking everything that's been built. <br /> <br /> It should not be fun / nice, it's a heavy watch and it's Art-house. But the 10-minute (not counted) rape scene at the end just breaks everything down. The figure of Rosarios is more or less, just watching what is happening. Which brings me to the biggest disappointment. <br /> <br /> Irreversible comparison: "Irreversible" had a rape scene, but the movie lasted (even if it was back in time). Rosario finally looks at the camera and says something about having to overcome this. First of all, it comes a bit too late, it should be seen after the first rape. Second and most importantly, the Art-house movie should appear here. More interesting is that Rosarios will play after the second rape scene and how he can handle what she did. But on the other hand, she did not do it really physically (see above) ... a broken character that the film cuts off ... <br /> <br /> Good intentions (Talia and Rosario worked before), but not passing most things , they decided to do it (even if you can see what they mean, it must be convincing, otherwise it will not work) ... not to mention too long scenes of rape, what are ...
