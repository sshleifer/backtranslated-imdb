I have a rule of 5 minutes (sometimes I leave the road for 10). If the movie is not good in the first 5 or 10 minutes, it probably will never get better. I have not experienced any film yet that would prove that it challenges this theory. Dan in Real Life is definitely no exception. I watched this turkey and thought; wow, it's not funny, it's not touching, it's not sad, and I do not like any of the characters. <br /> <br /> A story of a columnist / widower who raises three young daughters who gets love with his brothers' girlfriend. I suppose the slogan would be "a council columnist who could use advice"? I do not know. Dans's character did not strike me as someone qualified to give advice. I guess it's irony? I do not know. I'm going to see my parents, brothers, sisters and their children at some kind of family retreat, which seems very sweet and potential for good comedy, storylines ... none that will never appear. The main story is basically how she loves this woman, but she can not have it. Anyone who has a pulse will understand that he will eventually get it, but you must suffer through a painfully hilarious, trivial, life-long network dialogue "murderer of love" to reach the inevitable happy ending. <br /> <br /> This is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
