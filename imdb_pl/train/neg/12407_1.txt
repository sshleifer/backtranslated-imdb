Alicianne (Laurel Barnett) becomes a live babysitter for Rosalie Nordon (Rosalione Cole), who recently lost her mother. But Rosalie very often misses her late mother and constantly visits the grave (conveniently located in the cemetery just behind the house) late at night ... where she also meets her "friends" ... it starts well with a really amazing sequence in the cemetery ... then it falls apart . The story is thin and there are plenty of tones to make the film last 85 minutes. Acting is awful on the whole planet (Cole is easily the worst). Poorly directed by the WORST part of the editing I have ever seen in the movie. Scenes (and sound) are simply cut off without rhyme or reason. Also the movie has a horrible (and obvious) sound of post-production. <br /> <br /> Regarding blood and violence - forget about it! There is very little and that is incredibly false. I've never seen such artificial-looking blood - it looks like ketchup! Boring, pointless - rightly forgotten movie from driving a car. You can omit this one.
