It does not really match the Castle of Cagliostro. Lupine is not so funny, crazy or hyperactive. Scenery and music are not very inspired, and the plot is not interesting. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this is nudity (only in the uncut version) provided by Fujiko. It helped to spice up some boring scenes. CoC had a powerful villain and made a film with ingenious sets. Locations in TSoTG are not very lively or engaging. <br /> <br /> Zenigata, Goemon and Jigen this time do not provide decent entertainment during the shows. It is as if they were simply fulfilling a contractual obligation, appearing. <br /> <br /> The DVD is in full frame with Dolby Stereo sound. It has a decent number of accessories, including a lot of trailers. But one interesting thing. There is no choice of the chapter on the disc or the time code displayed on the player after insertion. However, you can still go to the next scene number with the remote control.
