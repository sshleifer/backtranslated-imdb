I am glad that I can watch this movie free of charge, because I work in the hotel industry and this movie has recently appeared in our movie library. Nothing against low-budget movies, but this movie has terrible acting and directing. How can you create a movie like this one. The director should be inscribed on the black list, and for all the poor actors it is certainly not a skipping rope for a career. Make sure you do not watch this movie, the acting is bad, the camera and it's terrible. There are still a few films that deserve the name "LOW 10". Another example is "Dracula 3000". People who make money in this movie should give it to charity, so at least it's for a good reason. <br /> <br /> In this case, I would watch it for 10 more (or at least once more).
