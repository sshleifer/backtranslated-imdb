The "ghost house" is awful. I live in South America, a country that has suffered a military dictatorship, like the one the film tries to describe, and although everyone knows that movies can be far from reality, this particular film treats viewers as both ignorant and foolish. Things are not as simple and linear as it seems, and of course the political process is much more complicated and interesting than the plot in "Home ...". If you can not show that the complexity on the screen is better, do not make any movie. There are many examples of how politics can be taken seriously in the cinema without so many ordinary things. In some parts I felt that Carmen Miranda can appear in parrots and palms. When you talk about certain things, you must not only consider but also respect public intelligence.
