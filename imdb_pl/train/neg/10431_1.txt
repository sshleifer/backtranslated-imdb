I loved the first season. The quality dropped slightly in the second season, but it had a great measure (Pegasus!). The third season was quite innovative and original and it was OK. The fourth season began to fall quickly, because they never began to give us any explanation when we really started to need them. What the hell was the Cylon plan? Why were there two Cylon factions? What was the point of Angel-Kara leading the fleet to the devastated Earth-1? What past had the last five Cylon and how they survived, or were they reincarnations? Questions everywhere, nowhere. <br /> <br /> And then the end is coming. Earth-2 (our Earth) in the past. Okay. But destroying the fleet ?! Opting out of technology and giving up all kinds of urban life and spreading several thousand people around the world on paper ?! It's not just anti-science, it's anti-reason and anti-life. And the philosophy of the performance seems to be that humanity is forever imprisoned in a cycle going from a romantic character to a decadent capitalist society that devises a destructive A.I. it spoils everything. It is without a vision, without hope for a better future for humanity and is contrary to the proper science fiction. And do not even start with angels! The religious spell of the worst kind! Final disappointment !! <br /> <br /> The whole "everything that happened before and repeats" should be related to the previous incarnation of the series, not only on Earth as we know it. Making a new performance in some way consistent with the old would be the final stroke of genius. Shame Frakkin. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10.
