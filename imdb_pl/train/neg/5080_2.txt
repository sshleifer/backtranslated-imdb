This is a wizard review that should not be confused with Wiz or Mr. Kreator. Wizard is a movie from the late eighties, telling about the boy's serious impossibility to play video games and walk through all the initial subtitles. Wiz is an unnecessary update of the Wizard of Oz, and Mr. Wizard is the guy who joined 100 straws and drank a drink for him. <br /> <br /> Now that we've done all this in the margins, let me say it: there really is no reason to watch this movie. It's just a 100-minute Nintendo ad created to use Powerglove, Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Brothers 3. I use the word "designed" in the weakest sense, because it seems that this movie was written over the weekend by a team of people who they never played in Nintendo and were directed by people with a lower sense of style than my grandmother. Maybe if the screenwriter and the director sat together and played some games together, they would realize that they are going to film complete garbage and instead go to vocational school to learn how to install car stereo sets. <br /> <br /> I hope this was an educational experience for you. It certainly was not for me. To tell you the truth, I think I could have lost some brain cells while watching this movie and writing about it. The next time you're in the video store and you see The Wiz, The Wizard and The Wizard of Oz, everyone is sitting there on a shelf in a nice little row, give them all to miss and play Duck Hunt.
