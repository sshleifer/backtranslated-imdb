There are really two parts of this movie. First of all, it's a funny prologue to a movie that's so hysterical and cornball-like it would almost feel right to make Troy McClure "The Simpsons" narrate. <br /> <br /> Then the rest of the movie starts (starting with the title track that really does not match the rest of the movie), which, technically in order, is killed by a vague, inconsistent and unconvincing story, not just uninteresting characters, but characters that do not make sense. br /> <br /> This is especially the case with Spiventa Mickey Rooney, who was all the time supposedly on the plot and part of the "organization", but what would happen if Hackman made a seemingly arbitrary decision to take him with him when break out? In that case, he would be a completely unnecessary and unnecessary figure who is still in the end. <br /> <br /> The general problem with the movie is that it does not want to give any details about who or what is behind this conspiracy. It is as if the filmmakers did not have the courage to suggest that a specific part of society would be able to create such an organization, and instead would hope for the lack of explanations enough and the audience will form their own conclusions. br /> <br /> Put simply, the movie fails on all levels.
