The original version of Man On Fire, heavily modified and often misleading, was out of date at least ten years when it was made, and the passing years have not improved it. It's a kind of movie that producers with too much money and too little experience are trying to attract attention, and everyone else simply repays their outstanding alimony or drug dealer, and bodyguard Scott Glenn goes out on the limb to save his 12-year-old . annual plea, kidnapped daughter of a rich Italian family. An interesting cast - Joe Pesci, Brooke Adams, Danny Aiello, Jonathan Pryce - everything went better, the action is slow and rare and only the exceptionally good result of John Scott (part of which appeared in the last movie Die Hard) makes a positive impression. One case in which the remake (made by Tony Scott, the original choice of the director for this version) is an improvement.
