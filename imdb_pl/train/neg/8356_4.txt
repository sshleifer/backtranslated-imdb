Peter Fonda is deliberately deceived as an actor, that his lachrymos line readings abolish all irony and humor in dialogue. He trades with colorless hooks and not too witty partners with Brooke Shields, as if he was a wooden block with receding hair; even his smaller accents (like fingering a non-existent mustache on his gray face) do not reveal the characters as much as the uncertain actor of the uncertain filmmaker who is directed by him. In the southwest around 1950. A poor gambler (not above cheating) wins an orphaned, unsuccessful teenager Lolita in a failed poker game; after getting a treasure map of promising gold in the Grand Canyon, the quarrels of two become seekers. Some beautiful views and a strange but interesting episode by Henry Fonda as a gray canyon man are the only compensation in a tired comedy drama, with two leading cartoon killers who will stop at nothing until they get the map. Shields are very nice, but - although the camera loves its nice, shiny beauty - there is no screen (and its metallic voice has no reach); every time she opens her mouth, she is inclined to either curl up or hide herself. * 1/2 of ****
