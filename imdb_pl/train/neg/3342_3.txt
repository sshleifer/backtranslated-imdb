I did not expect much from the film directed by Sidney J. Furi, in which he played Dolph Lundgren, but I certainly expected something more. The comment of one user - the action film of the second degree - did not seem to me too disrespectful for the film Lundgren. On the other hand, I would not bother watching the movie if its rating was lower than 5.0, but hey, the movie was 5.9 out of 10, which seemed quite acceptable for this kind of production. <br /> <br /> Now I understand that 37.5% of people who rated this movie as being (excellent) were clearly an advertising feat, because DETENTION is just an ordinary Nu Image trash that you've seen before, over and over again. <br/> <br /> Lundgren is not convincing as a former soldier that he addressed the history teacher assigned to primary school. His acting is simply awful, devoid of emotions and invented. Lundgren's inability to act becomes more apparent in scenes with juvenile delinquent children. Either they are great actors or, in comparison with Lundgren, they seem like great actors - just because they seem natural and credible. <br /> <br /> DETENTION contains elements that could potentially be of interest to this low-budget movie - closed - for a high-security weekend high school, four teenagers in prison with a war veteran teacher and a group of ruthless criminals trying to get inside - but history (such as the BREAKFAST CLUB meets DIE HARD, or is it PANIC ROOM?) is full of incredible situations, many stereotypes and stereotypes. And let's not forget that Dolph Lundgren is the main actor. <br /> <br /> Alex Karzis and Kata Dob√≥ play the couple in love Bonnie and Clyde and provide the most acceptable performances, even if it seems that there is a low budget version of Sam Rockwell and her, wants to be Milla Jovovich. In a film where everything fails, their madness and style provide enough fresh air to prevent the interest dropping to zero.
