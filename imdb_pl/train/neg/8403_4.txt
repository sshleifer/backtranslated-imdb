I gave it four from purely historical context. For many years he was considered lost, until in the early 90s he appeared in blue. <br /> <br /> Moe is a simple man, and Larry and Curly play a duet. Spade Cooley has a few numbers. I think it had something to do with working on the ranch. I'm not entirely sure, because the plot was so minimal that nothing really stuck in my memory. I do not remember that it is a western musical comedy. Even Stooge seem to go through movements. Generally, nothing here. <br /> <br /> If you're not a Stooge fan, do not worry. If you're a Stooge fan, stick to shorts.
