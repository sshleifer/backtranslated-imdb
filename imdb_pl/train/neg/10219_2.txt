A blue soldier is a film with a grudge: a grudge against being a deep statement of human inhumanity towards a man, the exploitation and brutality of white people against the indigenous people; a biting, unwavering and sardonic commentary on the horrors of Vietnam. Well, sorry, but unfortunately this is not one of those things. What really is Soldier Blue is a disastrous, trite, ill-made, dishonest trash. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer hit the nail on the head saying that it seems to be a hybrid of two completely different films. In fact, it is a lame, stereotypical, poorly preserved romance of a "strange couple" - Strauss and Bergen overcome their prejudices about the lifestyle of the other person and fall in love (ah, bless) - frequented by two disgusting massacres that would not be out of place in splashes Lucio Fulci. <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for a hideous, mild, blood-soaked climax in which the sweet, small, indigenous children of American children are variously shot, cut, dismembered and driven into love and graphic close-ups, and the native American women large breasts are molested, raped and stretched - this is no excuse, with the exception of cash registers. (The massacre itself, though repulsive in its wrong intention, is very badly staged and shot, a group of actors lying around with bright red paint smeared on them, crosses with some special cutting / dismembering sequences - dismemberment, incidentally, that used real amputated Now, I call it wyzyskiem. <br /> <br /> Forget everything you have heard (including the absurd comments that start and end the film) about the fact that it is a "protest", an accusation of American brutality towards indigenous peoples. This film does not present things about the difficult situation of Cheyenny; If that happened, there would be a few characters in it with the participation of Native Americans that would lead us to know and care for nameless, nameless innocent people who were murdered at the climax. Instead, we get a stupid affair with bread from Bergen and Strauss (disgusting actors, at least in this), with a lot of blood, guts and severed heads thrown in to attract the curious. <br /> <br /> Which is a terrible shame because there is a film about the Sand Creek massacre, about all the real massacres in the United States and Great Britain and all so-called "civilized" nations over the centuries (Iraq?). This is not the movie.
