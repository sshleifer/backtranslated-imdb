This is to be the worst movie I've ever watched. During the first 15 minutes there was nothing that could interest me in this movie. I was on vacation and I had a lot of time to devote myself to the film "just for fun". The flat we lived in had this movie in stock - they had to have it in the store for $ 1 or something like that. <br /> <br /> If you like Adam Sandler, this is not another movie he has done. It started with a bad premise, and then it got worse. There is nothing strange about this. <br /> <br /> I watched a lot of movies, including some that I did not care about. But if you decide to waste time on this movie, do not say I did not warn you.
