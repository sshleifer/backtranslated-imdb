Jonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton) suddenly becomes a widower when his wife dies. Soon afterwards, Dr. Price, an expert in the field of electronic voice phenomena (EVP), said he was receiving messages from his late wife Jonathan Anna via various electronic gadgets. Is Anna trying to say something to Jonathan? Is it just a hint of something on a larger cosmic or other scale? It's good to see Keaton in the lead role, but the story he's stuck with is intricate and absurd in points; It's as if the movie did not know how to answer any of the questions that it raises, so it simply distracts the viewer with new, unrelated questions. <br /> <br /> Keaton himself is quite good, convincingly tossed as a rescue widower desperately trying to communicate with his dead wife. He matured quite a lot as an actor, leaving behind his brother-friendly roles that he played 15 years ago. It looks a bit rocky, maybe with a few other wrinkles than you'd expect, but it has not lost any of the cunning and momentum it showed in a quarter of a century in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> So it's not like Keaton turns around in the average performance the script is below the standard. Written by Niall Johnson, the story becomes more and more complicated because each winding path ends with another winding path. Everything is good and good, if the path leads to some kind of acceptable solution, something that binds more or less everything together and explains ... something. But not white noise; I knew less about what had happened to Jonathan than before, before I saw him for the first time. <br /> <br /> Keaton is really the only reason to watch this trash, although he gets great support from Ian McNeice (as Dr. Price) and Deborah Kara Unger as a required interest in love.
