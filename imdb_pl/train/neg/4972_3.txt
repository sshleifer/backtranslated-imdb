It's hard to say what was the worst in this series: bad acting, poor acoustics of different parts, bad CGI, bad sets during this period, bad script. It would be nice if the scenario followed the original story a bit closer - in Beowulf there is enough tension and good material to provide a lot of good material and a better story than the screenwriters could come up with. /> <br /> And why introduce a strange new weapon, such as a crossbow, that fires explosive bolts? <br /> <br /> I see that this movie was made in "only" 21 days. It shows the lack of quality. I'm starting to think that this is the general (weak) attitude of the Sci-Fi channel (and others) when it comes to making films from classic tales over the past few years. <br /> <br /> What a waste!
