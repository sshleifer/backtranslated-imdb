In the last film, which is to transfer Asian films to America, this is LAST movie, which should be released here. Being a big fan of Asian films from all genres, I was browsing the web and came across this commercial, which is to be re-released in the US market, so I decided to check it out in advance and rent it at a local video store. br /> <br /> Trust me ... the action scenes are incredibly disappointing, Crouching Tiger and Iron Monkey completely blew this movie out of the water. Jet Li fell asleep watching the battle sequences. If you are looking for entertainment in martial arts, it would be better if you lost to Jackie Chan !!! <br /> <br /> In addition ... you think that you will watch martial arts with a girl absorbed in revenge for the death of her parents BUT NOT SUCCESS !!! The good hour of the film inside is filled with dialogue, absence of action, lack of passion for the tangent plot, basically NOTHING has anything to do with the premise we are exposed to. It has more to do with the relationship between her and the boy, and the boy with his underground group, in which the producer / director did not spend time inventing, and yet devoted part of the film by dragging the problem. It would be much better if they just cut out the whole hour and developed the story itself by means of a different film and focused on the aspect of martial arts. <br /> <br /> Speaking of which, I really do not believe the choreographer Iron Monkey, he made the sequence of actions in Princess Blade. I was totally offended by frequent use of slow motion and quick changes in the camera to show the physical speed of the killers. I just did not buy it. <br /> <br /> Please ... I warn you not to waste your time / money on this movie. The premise is intriguing, and the trailer may even tempt you, but I'm convinced that this movie is NOT suitable for the public (maybe in Japan, but not in the States) and will be the worst film transferred to countries from the Asian film industry.
