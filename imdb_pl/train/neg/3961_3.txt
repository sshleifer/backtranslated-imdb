What a dog from the movie. Noni Hazelhurst's performance is quite good, but he is sitting in the midst of a jungle of hideous script, mediocre direction and wooden acting from most casts. Many characters are pitifully misdirected, especially in the story of the overrated Colin Friels. <br /> <br /> Very little works in this pretentious garbage. Much of the "character development" takes place through a stupid, controlled voice and often completely denies the behavior of the characters on the screen. In fact, it's hard to even find out who the people are talking about because they describe such different characters as we see on the screen! How do we know that Colin Friels (Javo) is supposed to be an unpredictable, brutal and unreliable junkie? One of those silly speeches speaks to us. To loudly cry, the character of his character is half the size of the movie, and the only thing that lets us know is a perverse voice! The real killer are the characters. Everything about them. Their clothes are perfectly maintained and look fresh from the wardrobe, despite the fact that we are constantly reminded that they are to be artistic paupers. All are ridiculously well pronounced for "junkies". It seems that none of them has a real understanding of life on skids or smack, but this is to be the case for most of them. <br /> <br /> Monkey Grip does not deserve more attention than a daily TV movie. A crud like this, perfectly filmed and technically presented, but driven by clich√©s, a dramatic drama that revolves so widely that it is credible and writhes for hours without going anywhere. At least Noni gets into his birthday suit at every opportunity. There is no other reasonable reason to endure this trash.
