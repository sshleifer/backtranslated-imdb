Incredibly bad acting, lack of good, obscure history and flashy images and slow movements where they are least needed: Adrenaline is everything a film should not be. <br /> <br /> Georgina Verbaan, a Dutch soap actress who did not attend English lessons, plays rich girl Freya who has the habit of "searching for emotions". Which basically does dangerous tricks, breaks things and upsets people. And not in a funny way Jackass. Then there is Dracko (Rivas). He runs the group, but he has other illegal activities on the side. Then there's Freya's dad (Lockyer), who also plays a dubious role. And finally, Jason (debutant Fyall), boyfriend Freyi. <br /> <br /> One day Freya will disappear and everyone seems to be involved, but we, the viewer, really do not care if no cast is either nice or credible, and history does not make sense. <br /> <br /> Why did this happen? 2/10.
