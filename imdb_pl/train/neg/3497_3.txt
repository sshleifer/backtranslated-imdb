Unfortunately for Sarah Silverman this performance does not compliment her at all. The character is not even nice and it is not a situation in which you think "oh, she is like that I love her" only "she is so abbot". This character is just ordinary, old, just, which means b * Sarah seems to be fighting to bring this performance, because she is the only half-amusing person. Mood, dialogue is as damn boring and dry as listening to your grandfather, continue and talk about the balls he collected as a child. <br /> <br /> The Sarah Silverman program is so unbelievably boring that I thought about changing the channel to see the old replays of Married With Children. it's funny because characters are so "immoral" and "naughty". I'm sorry, but I can not find a show filled with dry humor and bored with a story about walls with bad, embittered, lost, angry, bitter lives with her annoying hellish sister and gay friends who sound like Keanu Reeves with cold everywhere close to ridicule. I can not stand this show, although I usually think that Sarah Silverman is "I love her because she is so abnormal" as at School Of Rock, and most of them get up. boring with characters who think they are wicked and talk and do things for a shock value, for example, constant laughter, diarrhea and a blow at all for laughter. Sarah Silverman's program tries to be funny and fails, or she needs a path of laughter or better writers. Someone compared it to South Park, but it is not even close. opinions about the Sarah Silverman program and will not become an annoying troll, which means you will not see me as an abbess and I still publish things like "This show sucks" and "Why it has not been canceled yet". e.g. The Sarah Silverman Program, if you like.
