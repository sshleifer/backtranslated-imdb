This movie is awful, but I have some interesting information about it: <br /> <br /> The film was shot in 1976 at the University of North Arizona in Flagstaff, AZ, as well as at Oak Creek Canyon near Sedona, AZ. A large part of the extras in the film are students of the drama of NAU. I was a freshman there, working in the theater, but for some reason I did not get involved in production. However, I knew a few people who did it and can provide this rather strange fact: <br /> <br /> In this movie there is a scene in which the two directors, as part of their dark ritual, must run naked to the Forest. They are seen from behind in the movie, doing just that. The point is, these are not actors, but two guys I knew from the theater department. The identity of these "stunts" will remain anonymous, at least on this page, unless they decide to "love" themselves!
