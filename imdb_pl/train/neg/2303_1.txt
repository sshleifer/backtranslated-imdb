Only people apparently buy this garbage! As demonstrations like "Moral Orel" showed, even if you tried to do the most scandalous, exaggerated parody of evangelism that you could think of, it would not come close to the fun of the show. It's hard to say what happens when you watch it. Is this news? Talk show? Who knows!? They start with coverage of various international press reports, but at seemingly random points, the message is interrupted by this strange, trollopodobnego little man with a forehead bigger than the whole face, mumbling and laughing and generally terrifying. > <br /> Pat Robertson does not look like such a bad guy even at first glance. It just looks like an old but harmless old bald stuck in its archaic beliefs (like most of our grandparents). But this is the man who called for murder, who befriended and offered help to not one but two murderous dictators who illegally used money from donations to run diamond mines who SUPPORT forced abortions in China and who regularly suggest that Caucasians (in particular American Caucasians) are better than all other breeds. <br /> <br /> Still, everything would be fun, except that he apparently has enough fans to keep his little show up 40 years later (or that or enough money to bribe some television directors who they do not do what they show). The idiocy of the show becomes alarming when you realize that some people have to watch it somewhere and stick to every word. Even when Robertson repeatedly showed how corrupt he is, people still listen to him. I do not know if it's funny or scary. I think a healthy mix of both.
