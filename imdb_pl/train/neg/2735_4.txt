I thought it was not the best episode I saw (although my partner handed me a handkerchief awaiting the moment of Brendan Fraser ... * sigh *). It was nice to see Cox outside the constantly fragile "Coxist state" he is in these days, even for a short time. I also liked trying to place the episodes included in the length of the hair of the character (or height, in the case of JD) and the youth of the earliest episodes. I can also see how Zach can be well on the way to the very Chevy Chase / is it Matthew Perry? chemical preparation caused by prat-fall (already confirmed in Conan). By the way, the song (now stuck in my head) from the assembly of the dance caused by the caretaker was Martin Sexton's "Diner".
