I do not believe they did this movie. Completely unnecessary. The first movie was fine. But there was no need to continue, certainly not after the TV series, which was already the continuation of the first movie. This movie is like a soap opera. Writing is so bad that it is completely straightforward. Jokes do not appear, the game is flat, it is shot like soap, there is no direction. The first movie had a good emotional backbone. Each character had a small bow. It was very simple, but somehow it worked and I could see the advantages of this movie. But this time there is no consistent plot. Characters are boring stereotypes and nothing interesting happens. One good thing: the Brazilian boy who plays Axel Daeseleire's son is pretty good. It was their only moment of creative success in this film. I heard that they have already made the second television series as a continuation of "Team Spirit 2", but please God, do not let them make the third part ...
