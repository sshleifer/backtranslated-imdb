Wow. Some movies just stung me. It was undeniably one of those movies. When I left the theater, there was not a single word in my mouth. All I had was an incredible desire to hit my head against the theater wall to help me forget about the last hour and a half. Unfortunately, it did not work. Honestly, this movie has nothing to recommend. Humor was on the first level, at best the game was too stupid and the plot was astronomically stretched. I hear a promise that I will never see another movie with Chris Kattan or another member of the SNL cast.
