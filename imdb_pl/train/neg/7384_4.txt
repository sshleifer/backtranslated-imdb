RATING STARS: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Marshall Lawson (Steven Seagal) is assigned to France on a reconnaissance mission together with three new young recruits from the strike team after not following a direct order in advance. However, the night before their attack, all of them were killed by the killer with seemingly inhuman force. Because the French police revolves around their own investigation, they are looking for those responsible to discover a corrupt military faction that deals with a deadly new drug that changes the person's DNA and gives it a frightening new strength. > <br /> Bad cover. Bad title. Poor post-production manipulations. And the wrong trailer. A very bad movie. But I must say that I do not think that the strength of the attack is its worst. I know it will make me unpopular with most other reviewers here (maybe not for Steveday!), But I think a lot of criticism was due to all the bad news that came before the movie, not the quality itself. <br /> <br /> I have to say that there has not been so much dubbing or editing of ropey, it was thought. Dubbing was (which made it sound like Martin Sheen with groin problem!) It was quite awful and quite frequent, but it was not used in such a large movie segment as I thought. The plot flowed equally well, taking into account all the confusion associated with the original, completed film Harvester. Also, as another reviewer has noted, the film has a nice, Gothic look, a new accent for the movie Seagal. <br /> <br /> However, the absolute deadly point was a complete and complete lack of an exciting action, with just a few weakly filmed battle scenes for any kind of fun. <br /> <br /> I have to be honest, however, I'd rather watch it again than Flight of Fury, Today You Die or Out for a Kill. **
