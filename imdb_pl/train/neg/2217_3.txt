Like a faux-Russian scientist, he says two-thirds of the way to the film: "I came for learning." This largely sums up the reason why I watched this movie - everything about the semi-semi-shark shark definitely deserves a serious empirical study by an unbiased aspiring scientist. Or, as they say in biz, my girlfriend's brother had a pilot and the rest is history. The statement that the special effects were bad would be unfavorable for the field of special effects. This is 2005, it is not so difficult to film a car scene without a tacky blue background. Yes, it was cute and cutting-edge when Hitchcock was shooting "Birds", but in 2005 it looks like a low budget. Save me a cheaper attempt at Sci-Fi and do me an attempt to try to stop disbelief. <br /> <br /> However, I have seriously defamed the overall concept of this movie, let me tell you again, however sad it may sound, it is probably worth your time. If it's nothing else, this is a bad Sci-Fi tour game - well worth the education for lovers of the new movie and definitely worth a course for those who have seen several films in their time. <br /> <br /> Crazy mad crazy scientist with a hammer transmitter who thinks that it is a good idea to spoon blood containers into nearby water, it makes me question not only the intelligence of humanity, but also the ability of filmmakers "B" to invent remotely believable plot lines. <br /> <br /> This film largely meets one of my many years of bad film ideas - bad guys always wear sunglasses. <br /> <br /> If it was not in 2005, be dead in the fact that this movie was some extremely weak metaphor of the Cold War. I mean, you might as well have Khan on the bridge of the Klingon Bird of Prey, putting leaks into Chekhov's ear. <br /> <br /> One of the most moving lines of the movie is that the chick without a bra insists that Charlton Heston like "wait for Tom" when trying to pick up the helicopter from the ground. The point is that Tom wastes bad guys with sunglasses with his endless banana clip attached to his Kalashnikov, aka AK-47, in terms of a layman. <br /> <br /> As the crazy scientist says at the end, the film "my goal is the evolution of the human genre" - it suffices to say that this film only contributed to the devolution of humanity. Poor Freudian references spoken by a mad scientist who prepares a female heroine to connect with a hammer shark are a simple reminder that even in the worst sci-fi genre, we can find something to laugh at.
