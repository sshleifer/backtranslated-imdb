Will an A-Pix ever, ever, ever do something right? This film was to be watched on TV in letterbox format. Because A-Pix does not even believe in panning and scanning, we see whole scenes in which the arm on the left side of the screen speaks to the right shoulder. Of course you do not lack much. This movie is incredibly bad. It is very difficult to enjoy a movie in which characters shout at the whole throat during 80% of the movie for no reason.
