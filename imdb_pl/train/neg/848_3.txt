OK, if you're looking for another Bastketball diary, this is a completely bad movie. <br /> <br /> I turn around two brothers. Max, younger, has a serious addiction to cocaine. Adam, the eldest, is a doctor. This movie is supposed to show a drop from reality to extreme holes that drugs allow. However, it is not. It shows that cocaine can be fun no matter what the situation is. Most of the film focuses on Max and his parting. Ultimately Adam, he can no longer take stress from his work and he also begins to use (prescription drugs). <br /> <br /> This movie has almost no climax. It does not go away from what the real cocaine is doing to you, it has boring and low-budget scenes, and the action of the eldest brother, Adam, is terrifying. <br /> <br /> I have no idea how this movie was made to pass and receive prizes, it is not my heart. If you want a clear and real feature film in the extreme world of drugs, if not, buy "Basketball diary". And notice the difference. <br /> <br /> Try to avoid this movie, but if you think you'll like it. Try it and see for yourself ...
