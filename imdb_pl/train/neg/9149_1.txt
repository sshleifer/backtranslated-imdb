There is absolutely nothing in this movie that shows even the smallest bit of talent. Nobody tried to play it before, even the extras in the cafe look as if they were stuck on the spot. Nothing looks like a try. The quality of the film is terrible. Most of the "action" takes place in narrow aisles or flats, where the operator spins over thoughtfully, moving the cheap camera back and forth between the "actors" as they deliver their lines. Without a stand and without a proper microphone, the sound quality is terrible. Even "Manos" performs better, at least they had the right equipment. What plot is simply lost in the production mess. <br /> <br /> Stick to your home movies, preferably made by a 5-year-old child who tests the video function on his new daddy camera. You will be looking for a long time to find a movie more inept than this one.
