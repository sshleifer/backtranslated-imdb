I am a fan of Shakespeare and I can appreciate what Ken Branagh did to restore Shakespeare's new generation of viewers. However, this movie does not reflect the general intentions of playing with absurd musical sequences. Let's add that Alicia Silverstone stumbles on a dialogue (reminiscent of Keanu Reeves in Much Ado About Nothing) and other poorly cast roles, all of this equates to the terrible endurance of watching.
