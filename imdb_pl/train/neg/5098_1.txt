It must be one of the most-overrated anime programs ever made. And yes, I was even shown "End of Evangelion" and it hated me even more. Not to mention the countless rip offs of this show! <br /> <br /> I do not mind psychological and philosophical untertones, but Evangelion pulls him in the mud like nothing else! Few characters seemed very interesting. The only thing that seemed interesting was Asuka, Misato and Pen-Pen. Besides, most of them were a bunch of stupid sages. They must go to a psychiatric center, not piloting giant robots against aliens called "Angels". <br /> <br /> Even fighting mechs and strangers did not help at all. Goes like this: <br /> <br /> "Well, there are such robots and they are really cool because they bleed (!), When they are hurt, but they are not really down but captured angels, so they sometimes go crazy and do not do it what juvenile pilots want, and they need to be better controlled ... blah blah blah! "<br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I can not recommend Evangelion, an otakus or not to anyone. For those who really like this series, it's good that you have the right to this opinion, I respect you. But for those who have Obsessed with the idea that everyone will love this series, you are more egotist. <br /> <br /> I prefer "Macross", "Mospeada", "Run-Dem" and "Robot Taekwon V" alone.
