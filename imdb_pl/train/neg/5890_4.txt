This romantic comedy is not so bad. Here and there are some funny things happening, and there are rather unforgettable characters in them. <br /> <br /> However, the game is amateur (with the exception of a banker). While some scenes are fun, others are simply embarrassing. In particular, I think that the "romantic" part of the story is weak. <br /> <br /> In total, it's probably worth seeing if you like football and romantic comedies. It really is not a bad movie, and the ending was pretty good. Just do not expect anything extraordinary. Good enough if you have an hour and a quarter to kill.
