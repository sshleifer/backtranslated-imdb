... and * in no way * as clean, logical and understandable as in the picture in this pathetic sum of tired Hollywood cliches. <br /> <br /> I am 27 years old and I have spent 16 years of my life struggling with delusional fusion and paranoid hallucinations. Like the main character of the film, I was successful mainly thanks to logic: because I was constantly thinking about getting away from reality and knowing what is really going on and what is not. In the end, by the way, I was really successful with medicine, but I certainly avoided madness because I knew that before I took the medicine, the difference between what was real and what was not. <br /> <br /> So, I have the right to say that this movie is a total scam. Not only did he cheat in the story of the main character (who was not faithful to his wife who was bisexual - something really important here), but above all shows a comforting, familiar view of schizophrenia - which does not make sense at all. <br /> <br /> Schizophrenia is a structure of the mind, not a disease. Schizophrenic * is not a "normal human with illness", it is someone who perceives things differently from the early years than most people: for him, things like time, space and personality of people are not solid. He feels he can bend, he can change, he can mutate, and maybe even disappear. To deal with it, the schizophrenic has a rich, very imaginary inner world that "normal" people do not expect - but he's trapped in it because he can not refer to most people, and his world becomes poorer and poorer until he's finished in an empty, illusory dead end. <br /> <br /> It is very different from what was presented in this funny "medicine", tearing the tears of the film. It should be terribly frightening. People other than the main character should look strange, strange and absurd, as in Lynch's "Eraserhead", for example. They should be * really * impressive, strange, great hallucinations, because that's what schizophrenia is all about. It's not about * details *. <br /> <br /> I mean, watch "Naked Lunch", "Lost Highway", read P.K. "Martian Time-Split" or "Ubik" Dick, watch "The Cell", "Perfect Blue", "Dark City" or play "American McGee's Alice" on PC, or maybe you have a vague idea of ​​how it is. Do not watch the movie "feel good" in a month, with trivial situations, cleaned figures and visuals, and stupid plot tricks. "Cell" is the most accurate film about the mind of a schizophrenic, his visions and internal consistency - he is brutal, strange, confused and very, very scary. <br /> <br /> Once again Schizophrenia is not about details, it's not a nice, tamed trick. He jumps into your face and does not let you go: the walls fall apart, people turn into strange enemy creatures, feel that you are going back in time, you are not sure who you are, you are, everything feels. .. strange, unnatural. Believe me, it's much more than what has been presented in this soap-like melodrama
