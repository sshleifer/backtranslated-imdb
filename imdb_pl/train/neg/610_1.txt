I bought this movie cheaper on sale, after reading the back of the DVD cassette and assuming that I could not lose it anyway if it was rubbish, without loss, if it was good, to bargain ... <br /> <br / > Then I watched ... <br /> <br /> I'm usually a fan of Christopher Walken, but in this movie he commanded a very small presence on the screen, seemingly not doing too much, even the death of his friend at the beginning, which triggers "action "In the story, it seems to have a very small impact on him, and his final revenge is simply boring and laid back. <br /> <br /> Usually a movie that has topics as grand as revolution and revenge are able to capture the audience and entrap them to feel something for the characters, but watching the movie more like a series of confused and almost random events that I was crying loosely ... <br /> <br /> I thought that this movie is the most frighteningly painful part of watching that I've given to the stage in which the pilot is sacrificed, refusing to jump out of an explosive truck, because he does not want to kill any civilians, is not as tragically sad as it is horribly terrible and painful, though not as bad as an emergency operation on an injured girl. Acting was poor, the script and history were weak, the "action" was even weaker, and the "visuals" were, but not entirely, visual. In summary, there are good movies, bad movies, movies so bad that they are good, horrible films ... <br /> <br /> And on a completely new level is "McBain"
