<br /> <br /> Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes is a "parody" of bad movies about monsters that end up inferior to counterfeit movies. (Very modest) story tells about tomatoes that rebel against those who treat them badly. Basically they spin and growl (yes, growling), and the next thing you know is that the person is covered with ketchup. Actors are not names who have never made films before, so there is no point in calling them. There's a guy who's been hired by the government to try and stop the threat of tomatoes. He is accompanied by a black guy who is a master of disguise and a girl and a guy who dives. In any case, there is another woman who is spying on the first guy who works for the government. if it does not make much sense to you, you understand. This movie would never be too good, but it lacks even joy from stupid attack scenes. The film is terribly sober, which, after all, is really painful, which could have been (reasonably) a funny movie. At one point, the giant tomato wax "slides" on an uncracked wooden board with wheels! Maybe I would recommend a movie if it would have a nice camp value, but it's even missing in this awful movie. 2/10
