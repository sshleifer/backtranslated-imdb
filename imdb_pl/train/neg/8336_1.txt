How the hell did they do it ?! Presenting itself as a caper comedy, the erroneous "$" is basically two hours of people mumbling fragments of sentences. Usually, a reliable Warren Beatty looks drunk, and usually fun Goldie Hawn behaves like a depressant. As for Gert Frobe, his most famous role - Goldfinger - was infinitely more admirable than his character here. Even a guy with a bottle of LSD champagne can not save this litany of worthlessness. <br /> <br /> Do I compare this movie to "Plan 9 from space"? I would not do anything like that, even if someone paid me. "P9FOS" was created idiotically, but ended up funny; it has been done idiotically and makes you feel that your brain has just melted from your ears. Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn made up for it when they performed in "Shampoo", but then they played in the terrible "Town & Country". Maybe they just should not play in movies. In total, I would prefer my skin to be broken than to be seen again. Terrible. <br /> <br /> Maybe they should do it with Jackie Chan. Then I would pay to see it.
