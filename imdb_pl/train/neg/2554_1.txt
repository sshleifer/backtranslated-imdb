Honestly, I'm not even kidding when I say it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen! This film does not have a bit of originality in its frail dialog box or grossly plagiarized plot. I can not even start counting things in this movie that are obviously torn from The Omen and other similar films. For example, the nanny "Lucy" in this movie is actually one of the devil's servants sent to lead and protect Satan's spawn ... does that sound like Mrs. Baylock for anyone else. Another thing is that the orphanage burned the child for the first time only a few months after it was adopted, as in "Omen". Fortunately, one priest survived the fire and escaped with severe burns all over his body ... another coincidence ?????? And in addition, the burnt priest is in the hospital room with pictures of Jesus on the walls, as well as the priest in "Omen" who have Bible cards plastered on the walls like wallpaper. Please, do not even make me start drawing comparisons between you and the end of the movie for you, because, as I mentioned, there is far too much to mention.
