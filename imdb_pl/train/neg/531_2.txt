With a list of casts like this I expected a lot better. Venessa Redgrave spent most of the film lying in bed. The best actresses in the world can not do anything very interesting when their acting is limited to lying down and falling asleep throughout the film. The storyline says that daughters reveal the secret when their mother approaches death. The thing is, he never tells his daughters anything but a mysterious advice to be happy. All the relationships in the film are poorly developed. I also felt that back and forth between the past and the present was unnecessary. It seemed that the idea was stolen from the book "Da Vinci Code", in which the device was used to increase tension, or from "Notepad", in which the device was used to create a never-ending affair of the main characters of the story. Anyway, it was a cheap device in this movie because it did not work to create anything. It was a way to try tension in a movie that has none. I went away wondering why you can not write good movies for women. It was really a disappointment.
