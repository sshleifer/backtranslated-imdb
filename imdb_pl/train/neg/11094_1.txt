This movie is another on my list of movies with which I do not have to worry. I saw it 40 years ago as a teenager, I was late to do it, he was very annoyed when it turned out that it was about 95% romance, 4% everything else, 1% history, if so. What I call a bait and switch movie, with an interesting title, the real movie is a scam. It is a topic that deserves good filming, this film is almost an insult to those who have served. The actual members of Lafayette Escadrille did not run away from the law and were not products of offensive houses, they were actually idealists who wanted to do something to help France. I suspect that many of them came from a higher-class background than Tab Hunter. The flying school is not meant for intelligent guests and everyone knows that a person like this one here would not survive two days, it would be either a palisade or infantry. Discipline of the French army was often quite fierce. In short, another version of Hollywierd's historic episode that deserves to be treated properly.
