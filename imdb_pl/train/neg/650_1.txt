Why does Hollywood feel the need to remake movies that were so magnificent in its heyday (The Texas Have Chains), but is it much worse why Hollywood feels the need to rework those horrors that were not brilliant at first (Prom Night, The Amityville Horror) Like their originals, remakes fail to create atmosphere, character or any real horror. The night prom is so flat and uninteresting that it's hard to watch, but for all the bad reasons. <br /> <br /> It's a poorly acting, massively uninteresting and ultimately boring trip that fails in everything it has to do. Sure, the Hollywood horror is dead. Even similar to The Hills Have Eyes and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, they managed to ruin their style in style with blood buckets and a decent story. The night prom is virtually bloodless and I will not even mention how bad this plot is. His inability to seal the identification of killers makes it the least tense horror of the erm ... original. <br /> <br /> One of the best known slasher movies from the 80s returns to terrorize filmmakers with this remake, which only proves how terrifying dances in high school can be. Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow) has experienced a terrible tragedy, but now is the time to give up the past and celebrate her style ball. <br /> <br /> When the big night finally arrives, Donna and her best friends are preparing to enjoy their last great break in high school, playing and having fun until dawn. But while Donna is ready to look beyond her nightmares and for a brighter future, the man she seemed to escaped forever returned to the last dance. An obsessive killer is at large and will kill anyone who tries to stop him from reaching Donna. <br /> <br /> Who will survive to see the day of graduation and what will Donna do to confront the greatest fear? Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup and Dana Davis interact in a remake slake, in which teenagers dressed in a tux will look nervously at their arms as they get off the dance floor. A plot that will probably discourage you from seeing it. Witch, if you ask me about it, it's a good thing. <br /> <br /> Without much effort, McCormick tries to drink the tension from the most banal situations. At some point, the girl returns to the lamp standing on the floor (lamp!), And McCormick tries to pump it out in a moment of fright. Desperate times really require desperate actions. Since the last IKEA catalog, there have been so many photos of wardrobes. <br /> <br /> In the era of The Hills, My Super Sweet 16 and To Catch a Predator is probably a bizarre, frightening movie to be extracted from the commodity of glamor and the frightening obsession of society with youthful beauty. This is not the movie. <br /> <br /> My last verdict? Avoid at all costs. Nobody will like Prom Night, it's even a disappointment for those who usually use hack-job revisions. Given his absolute lack of blood or terror. You're in a hurry to forget at night.
