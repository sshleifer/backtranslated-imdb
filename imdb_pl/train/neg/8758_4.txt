Not a film, but the lip has synchronized the collection of performances from acts that were part of the British invasion that followed the Beatles' dynamic entry into the world of music. Some of these acts did not make a big splash on this side of the pond, but many of them did. There are Hermann Hermits, Billy J. Kramer and Dakotas, Peter and Gordon, Honeycomb, Nashville Teens, Animals and of course the Beatles. <br /> <br /> It's very funny to watch these young acts polishing and honing their deeds.
