At what point is a good movie bad? When the movie goes from "observable" to "where is this & ^ @ _ + #! * OFF "? Thank God for DVDs, such as the one you can borrow from the library - for free! Similarly, thank God for the "fast scroll" switch on the DVD player. I'm sorry about the people who were cheated at the box office. <br /> <br /> At some point (I forgot exactly when all is now just a blur), our "hero" Luke Wilson begins to run through traffic; I think he was looking for a taxi. At that moment, I gave up, realizing that I did not care if he found his ride or drove through the garbage truck. <br /> <br /> The last time the movie was interesting, when Luke Wilson climbs from the trash, hair dryer in hand and meets the "heroine" Umea Thurman for the first time. This scene ended when a forensic criminal hanging helplessly from the fire fled far away from Luke and Uma. This was the last time the movie was funny and when was the scene? Ten minutes for the movie? <br /> <br /> Every time a movie tried to become "funny", he could not. Each time the film approached the "excitement", it went out, heading in the opposite direction. When the musical score helped to squeeze life from this duller, the soundtrack remained empty and silent. <br /> <br /> Sex scenes were not needed and were unthinkable; damage to unnecessary and childish sets and props. When Uma turns into a crazy ex-girlfriend, I felt that I was watching "The 40 Year Old Virgin Meets Pulp Fiction"; Then I realized that there was no turning back, because I completely disliked the "40-year-old virgin" and "Pulp Fiction". <br /> <br /> Helper Luke Wilson, Rainn Wilson (also seen in the gloomy "The Last" by Mimzy ") adds nothing to the insult in this horrible movie. Rainn Wilson, the king of television boredom, should remain at the same horrible medium. Hey, Rainn Wilson! Leave movies full-length themselves! Every time Uma's rival, Anna Faris, came to the screen, I expected Jason, Freddy or some horror to jump out of the landscape; When you see Anna Faris in "The Scary Movie", that's all you see, regardless of the movie, no matter what the medium. The character played by Wanda Sykes was simply horrible and did not fit this movie.
