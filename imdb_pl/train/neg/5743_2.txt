Yes, I know that I am one of the few people who want to trample this film into oblivion. So let me tell you why I feel this way. To tell you the truth, if it was advertised as a Zombie or similar movie, I might like it. But now I am completely speechless. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ... Although I'm not sure what to mess up * Let's start with the first HUGE defect. If I did not know that the movie is called "Darkness - The VAMPIRE Version" and if I did not see sequences in which some people seem to suck blood, I would not see a relationship with vampires. I mean, UNEMPLOYED ??? Give me a break !!! <br /> <br /> The second wrong point: what about Metal? It seems that all young people, but mainly you so-called "vampires", are in different types of metal, judging mainly by their shirts! Do not get me wrong, I've played in more extreme music forms for almost 15 years, but no one will scare me by showing me funny teenagers in Iron Maiden (from all bands !!!) T- shirts run, pretending to be vampires! "Pathetic" is the only word I could use here. <br /> <br /> Third weakness: actors. Wait a minute. WHAT actors ?! You mean the director's wooden friends! Words would be a loss here. <br /> <br /> Yes, all right, the movie is very bloody, but what's the difference? It would be a strong point and something that would have been enjoyed if the "genius" director had not decided to create the theme of the ARTIFICIAL vampire in this film. I wanted to see the vampires, but I was treated with some stupid kids that I would like to use on a baseball bat. The creators of the film should simply announce a movie saying "cheap class B horror without plot, but a lot of blood" !!! <br /> <br /> This movie is blasphemy against the whole concept of vampirism. And that makes me sick.
