As a film critic for several Dutch websites, I have to see many films, not all very good ones. Some movies are so bad that you will not be surprised that they are released directly on the video. From taboo I am surprised that it is released on video at all. It's really a bad, badly written, bad budget. <br /> <br /> A group of young people play taboo. They write their most disgusting thirst or deed, and then people are murdered behind taboos. The question is: should we believe in what we see? <br /> <br /> The film has a potentially interesting storyline and I will not give it here. But what could have been interesting remains stupid, bad and for no reason. <br /> <br /> Some actors have played in bigger titles before, so why the hell did they sign up for it? If you see it anywhere, try to avoid it. In this film there is no logic, no human sense of quality.
