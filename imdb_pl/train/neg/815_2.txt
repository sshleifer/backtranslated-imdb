I just got a 4-disc special edition of Superman 1 in the UK for about $ 5. Additional elements include the function of Superman and the Mole-Men from 1951. Yesterday I hit him with a DVD player yesterday, and here are my discoveries. <br /> <br /> Initial disappointment - I did not check and I think that it was mentally marked as one of Kirk Alyn's series. I'm not a huge fan of George Reeves as Superman, and I did not see anything but the weird clip of Kirk Alyn - but hey ho, it does not matter. <br /> <br /> This black and white production lasts for less than an hour. It resembles several episodes of one of Reeves's two-part television series, prepared for the premiere of the cinema, although IMDb says it was filmed as a cinematic premiere before the first television series. In any case, this is a strange choice for reasons that I will learn later. I am in an age in which I mention TV and film productions that are limited to one or two locations and sets, so there were no major surprises. Despite this, in the case of a low-budget film, this REALLY is a low budget. <br /> <br /> The story is about the small town of Silsby - 1,430 inhabitants - which, surprisingly, is also home to the world's deepest oil well (6 miles). The story begins with the foreman brigade taking steps to close the well. This conflicts with the arrival of Metropolis Kent and Lane reporters to the report on the well, at the request of an oil company. Because Clark sniffs the fact that the drill emerged in a radioactive cave 6 miles down, a few strange boys (small size, large in the head, black in coveralls and bushy eyebrows) emerges from the closed space of the drill and start to move around the city with puzzled facial expressions. <br /> <br /> Now a deep breath, this is the rest of the picture. Little boys scare some children, so Jeff Corey (playing crazy xenophobe in the city) encourages some buddies to kill these "creatures". Superman comes in (moderately inefficient) and grabs one of the guys who have been shot and takes him to a local hospital. Coreya's buddies burn a hut in which another little guy hid and assume he was killed, but he runs away and puts him along the shaft. Corey persuades the ruling crowd (despite the sheriff who arrests him) to suspend the hospitalized Mole-Man. Superman stops them from entering the hospital and takes the wounded chappie to the shaft to return him to his companions. A total of 4 Mole-Men emerge with a weapon they shoot at Jeff Corey (I call it Aargh's gun! Because his only effect seems to be making Corey "Aargh!") And Superman saves him. He immediately changes his behavior because of the amazement that Superman saved him after he behaved. End. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film lasts only an hour, there is a huge amount of creep, being attentive and prosecuting - I've forgotten the whole "Mole-Man 1 creeps from A to B, looking to make sure no one else is follows. " Mole-Men are never involved in any way - they have no dialogue - they just appear, persecute and come back. They look a little scary, but they are not monsters with eyes that suggest the city's reaction. <br /> <br /> Reeves is a pretty good Clark Kent - a very hard reporter, far more than Phyllis Coates, rather indifferent Lois Lane. But he is a terrible, terrible Superman. Not only does it not look like a part (at least his hair is dyed black, which is an improvement compared to the rather light hair he wore in some episodes), but the way he plays it all is bad in my book. I'm sure he was told to "hit the pose" (which Superman does constantly), but someone should tell him that he should be fists on his hips, not fists on his ribs. And he plays Superman as a rather raw and irritable teacher - he does not actually wave his finger in remonstrance, but he could do it as well. <br /> <br /> And Superman is doing a huge amount of walking (And let's say a huge amount - it's not really all that) and a bit of running. It starts and lands several times, but it is not visible in flight at any moment. Oh, some bullets are bouncing off him, and he uses telescopic vision as Clark, but without the accompanying visual effect. In fact, visual effects are visible due to their absence, and the few that are present are not very good. <br /> <br /> I tried to consider this effort by reference to the standards of those times: but even according to these standards, I think it is quite a challenging effort. Fortunately, the production standards in the TV series were higher and at least they took the trouble to come up with stories that were a bit more for them. <br /> <br /> Something out of disappointment - I will not watch it again.
