This movie is really scary. terrible, because it is a waste of 84 minutes of your life. The special effects are so horrible. Acting was not convincing. <br /> <br /> It's about a crocodile who attacks tourists who are making a documentary about "blood surfing". Bloody surfing takes place while surfing the sharks, but it's awful when the 31-foot crocodile breaks the holiday there. Sharks do not look real. The crocodile is even worse and becomes even more pathetic when they run away from the creature, but the crocodile gets stuck and the 2 females flash. Deaths are false, and pirates are there to fill time. <br /> <br /> A senseless, awful movie that is not worth seeing !!
