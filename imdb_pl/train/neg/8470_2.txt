I watch a lot of scary movies (or at least try to be), and this must be the worst, if not the second, worst movie I've ever had to force myself to try. I never knew the depths of masacism until I rented this moldy cheese covered with the used latex contraceptive. I am a fan of Julian Sans, but it is worse than I would hope for him. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the story was promising and I was intrigued ... for the first and a half minutes I took out loans and I have not seen the first-hand pain. Perhaps there are some viewers who like this and they can show me the right direction, but on the other hand I know those viewers who understand, if they do not remember me, especially when we had to turn off the video, and this is NOT just our watching (of course we had to make one exception). <br /> <br /> If it was a remake, I would give it a chance, if they would have at most 1% of the original fragment. That's all.
