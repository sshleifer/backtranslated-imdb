This movie raises a series of urgent questions in my mind. First of all, how did Jennifer Tilly manage to keep her acting career through all these years, based on this ridiculous, creaky voice and the very limited range of facial expressions she uses? Second ... what the hell were the people responsible for offensive and deeply repulsive thinking about the movie? And thirdly ... given that people were distorted enough to opt for such a dreck, should there be someone in the system - studios, distributors or somewhere - healthy enough to prevent it from being completed and spent. You really need to look for a very, very long way to turn up another movie as nasty as this ... and it's not even called a horror movie - which, as it can be seen as belonging to any legitimate movie genre, it certainly is. The film plunges from the beginning to the end in the worst kind of madness, violence and abuse, and basically does not have any functions of redemption. Actually, I do not support censorship (which I do not believe) ... but I really can not see how anyone could imagine something positive about watching such a movie.
