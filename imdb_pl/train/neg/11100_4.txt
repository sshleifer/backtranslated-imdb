I loved the original story, I had very high expectations for the film (especially since Barker was delighted with this in interviews), I finally saw him and what can I say? It was total MESS! Directing is everywhere, acting was terrible, flashy visuals and choreography were just flat, empty and totally unnecessary (what about general video techniques, such as nonsense of fast forwarding? It was stylish, but it is not needed in this film and lowered the climate to the stupid music video MTV Marilyn Manson / Smashing Pumpkins / Placebo). While some of the killings are pretty cool and brutal, some are just ridiculously ridiculous (the first murder of a Japanese girl was fun, and Ted Raimi's death was just stupidly ridiculous). It simply runs everywhere with zero tension and tension, completely moving away from the original story, and then returning to it in the final, which at the moment just feels depressed, to further ruin it. No explanations were given, that is to say I knew what was happening only if I read the story, but for people who did not have more confusion because sometimes I did not even know what was going on and what it was trying to go all the time. <br /> <br /> God, I really wanted to like this movie because I'm a big fan of Barker's work and I loved the story because it has huge potential for the movie I used to be in the hell, I even liked some of Kitamura's movies as fun comedies, but this movie just stank of amateurishness and stupidity from beginning to end. the real source, turning it into something completely different. Granted that it was bloody, and Vinnie Jones played a great badass, but everything else was everywhere, more than disappointing. gutted
