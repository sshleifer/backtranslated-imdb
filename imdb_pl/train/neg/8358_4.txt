This is not one of Arbuckle's or Keaton's better films, that's for sure. Fatty's wife is tired of his heavy drinking, so he takes him to a sanatorium, where a psychiatrist (Keaton) claims he has a guaranteed remedy! Once Arbuckle accidentally eats a thermometer and is taken for surgery. Then he runs away and chases after the place where he meets a charming girl who also wants to escape. In the end, despite their chasing staff, they run away, and then it turns out that the girl is crazy, and Arbuckle is soon caught. However, he wakes up and everything after the surgery is a dream - there was no sexy crazy girl, and Dr. Keaton is not as incompetent as it seemed in his dream. <br /> <br /> Lack of humor is the biggest problem in the movie. Of course, joking about mentally ill people is quite low, but in his day laughter was guaranteed. I would also laugh if something was fun! A lot of energy and that's it. <br /> <br /> FYI - during one of the chase sequences, Fatty is considering a race for men weighing over 200 pounds (wow, what are the chances?). Shortly after this, he returns to the post on which the number 5 was just freshly painted. As a result, five are now in the back of Fatty's shirt and he looks like an ordinary participant. HOWEVER, the number SHOULD be visible on Fatty's shirt, but it came to the fore - a mistake, because they should have realized that the mirror image would be reversed 5.
