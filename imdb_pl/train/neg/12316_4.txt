Director Jonathan Lynn has made several unsung comedies in the past, such as "Greedy" and "Clue". This is not one of them. More akin to the movie "Police Academy" than his inspiration, he plays Steve Martin in the old role of Phil Silvers as an army sergeant who always pulls fraud under his manager's noses. But the idyllic life of Bilko and his lazy platoon looks uncertain when the old enemy visits the base determined to catch Bilko in the act. Nothing really happens. Everything is quite boring. This is not funny. Martin, Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman squeeze a few clean efforts out of laughter, but all are better than it is and it is painful to see how they work with such a thin material.
