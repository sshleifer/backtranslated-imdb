Liongate has yet to check. Every single movie from Lionsgate was terrible. I tried and tried to give them more options, and they constantly pat me over and over again. And Cabin Fever is definitely no exception. <br /> <br /> I could not even pay attention to the majority of this movie, it was so frustrating and bad. <br /> <br /> Here is the plot. The guy cuts a dead dog for some reason. It infects itself with an accidental virus, passes it on to children in the camp, children start to get infected and die, the city learns about it, it does not help, it kills it. then the water is infected and everyone dies. end. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this is the whole movie. <br /> <br /> all characters are completely delayed, you do not care about any of them, and one child should get stuck with the boy meets the world. My friend and I said that talking about how fat and strange our classmate was was much more pleasant than paying attention to this film. We managed to reach the end by shouting $ @ t bulls, because this movie will make you do it. <br /> <br /> and I'm still confused with random karate moves in slow motion, the only accidental child and apparently everyone in the country is completely delayed and hickish. And again, why did this dog attack the girl? Why would the kid he tried to kill sit in a chair waiting for him to kill him? that was part of their two plans? Wow. the best plan ever. I can not believe that this movie has a cinematic edition. I could barely bear the DVD, let alone sit in the theater without moving for an hour and a half. It was not scary, neither funny, nor cool or anything. it's just a waste of 90 minutes you can use to ... I do not know, plant a tree or something. is more productive than this piece of garbage. Acting, special effects and scenario are a joke. never lift it. <br /> <br /> The cab fever gets one nasty leg shaving scene, from 10
