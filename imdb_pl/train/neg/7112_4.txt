I must admit that it was one of my favorites in my childhood when I watched it on a home projector as a super-8 reel. Now there is not much to offer, except for the inherent value of the actors "terrified" by replicas of human skulls. Special effects are quite stupid, mainly consisting of skulls on wires and imposed images of "ghosts". <br /> <br /> But there is something to say about the sets. The large residence in which it is held is quite frightening, especially since it is mostly unfurnished (probably for budgetary reasons?). <br /> <br /> Certainly, it inspires more laughter than screams. Just try not to giggle when the wife (who is doing more than her share in the screams) goes to the greenhouse and faces the spirit of her ex-husband.
