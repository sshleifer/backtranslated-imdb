... from this awful movie! With this movie, acting, writing, directing, editing etc. There are so many things that it's amazing that something rises to the top and turns out to be the worst. Music! I noticed that there are two composers on the film. This must be the reason why every single frame has music, absolutely the worst in the style of "D". They have never heard of the phrase "less is more". Listening was so painful that I would mute the sound whenever there was no dialogue and not that the dialogue was so good. You must sympathize with Robert Wagner and Tom Bosley, I'm sure they have not seen such roles in the gloom of their career. See it at your own risk.
