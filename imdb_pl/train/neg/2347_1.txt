First of all, let me say that I'm a big fan of Ashley Judd; that's why I was curious about her debut role. There is no argument that her talent is visible and her performance is excellent. I think I can also see how professional critics liked the aesthetic content of the story. However, I like to think that movies are supposed to entertain us, and this is the movie that fails. <br /> <br /> Halfway through I thought: "How much more do we need to watch a bored shop girl, standing idle in an abandoned souvenir shop, changing the goods? It seemed to last forever! <br /> <br /> Then, I thought, maybe it's one of those movies where the director tries to put the audience in a state of relaxation in a relaxed state before he hits a dynamic event. There is no happiness. The film continues its bland, boring, eventful story to the end. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying this because I'm a junkie. I like all movies, especially romantic comedies. But I expect entertainment. <br /> <br /> Add the fact that the photos and sound quality are comparable to the neighbor's bad home movies. Depressing! <br /> <br /> I just do not understand how anyone can like this movie. The value of zero entertainment. The longest 114 minutes of my life. <br /> <br />
