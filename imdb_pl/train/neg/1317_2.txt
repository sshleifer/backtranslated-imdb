When people from Kino Video collected their great collection of "Slapstick Encyclopedia", the choice of many comedy cartoons, someone decided to start the first part of ONE TOO MANY (1916), a little-known farce in Florida with the participation of very young Oliver Hardy. Just as everything is pleasant, this decision was unfortunate, because ONE TOO MANY is a very weak film that almost discourages the viewer from continuing to watch. Like any typical farce, this is associated with a fraud inspired by greed, panic, when plans are ruining, and complications escalating to absurdity, but unlike good ones, ONE is too incoherent, indecent and even annoying. At this point, it is difficult to say whether the hopelessly misleading plot is the result of a lack of footage or inept film making, but no matter what the reason, half the way even the most vigilant viewer has no idea what character relationships are or what is happening and do not care us this. <br /> <br /> The only interesting point is the 24-year-old "Babe" Hardy, which seems much heavier than ten years later, when he joined the forces of Stan Laurel, but still full of youthful energy. In the opening scene, waking up with a hangover, Babe makes a very athletic back bed. Trust me, it's as much fun as this movie. If you read this before you see the first "Slapstick Encyclopedia" Cinema, I suggest that you go past it and jump to good things.
