This is not a movie. It is a collection of unrelated, ill-conceived and poorly complex scenes that look like the unedited results of a weak 10-year-old with a mini-DV camera. In fact, I have a theory that an extremely rough girl in the train corridor - the one with greasy hair, dead eyes, ipod and nervous tic - probably did it herself in the creative phase. <br /> <br /> If you've done it for more than ten minutes, do not try to match what you've seen to the context of the high-end Artiste European mentality. This is a real and complete waste of time, money and film that would make William One-Shot Beaudine smart. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that the endless series of vacuum-packed characters is representative of what is now passing for the majority of mankind. <br /> <br /> What's next? Six directors photographing socializing in the Wal-Mart snack counter?
