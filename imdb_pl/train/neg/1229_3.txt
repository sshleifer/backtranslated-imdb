I'm sorry, but apart from Kim Basinger, who's doing a good job, afraid, he was one of the worst thrillers I've seen in a while. Logic is thrown away when 4 young guys terrorize this woman in front of the crowded shopping center and then shoot the guard. But nobody seems to notice it. Then, instead of shouting for help or returning to the shopping center, he leaves and ends in the middle of the forest with the guys in the chase. I can not even describe how stupid it is to see this woman running away from 4 delayed bandits, carrying a red toolbox, shouting for God to help her, and then having sex with one of them after brutally killing others. Please trust me, this is bad and a little tasteless.
