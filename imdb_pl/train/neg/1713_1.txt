If you have not seen ZOMBIE BLOODBATH, you do not have one. A competition such as "making your own horror in one day" could not be found in such an entry, rather than indignation with an insult to the viewer's intelligence. Mr. Sheets has forgotten history, storyline, proper dialogue, the fact that people need BASIC's acting talents, and a recognized lighting designer has obviously forgotten to appear. It seems that it is recorded on the most fashionable cameras and copied on even worse equipment. The makeup effect consists of black mascara for zombies and yoghurt spilled on people's heads to simulate skin melting. It's just a home movie and very bad. It is nice to watch friends, family members and neighbors who will be happy to film. I can not understand all my life why this mockery of the product is mentioned in ANY serious movie magazine or website - I have home movies from weddings, which are much better and more interesting. A total waste of time, money and energy. The next part of ZOMBIE BLOODBATH II is just the same garbage.
