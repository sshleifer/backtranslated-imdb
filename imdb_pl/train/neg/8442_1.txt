GUERNSEY (Maria Kraakman - Belgium / Holland 2005). <br /> <br /> Muska Maria Kraakman plays Anna, a woman in her thirties who finds out that her husband (Fedja van Huet) is cheating on her, but does not dare to face him. She hardly avoids any confrontation with human beings, her parents, and her sister, so we have the main character of a feature film that does not do much at all. We barely know about her origin or motivations. Only a woman who seems to be stuck in a dead end, not only during this difficult part of her life. She obviously suffers from something, but why should we also have to suffer in the audience? <br /> <br /> I almost gave up the cinema after seeing this invisible mess. It was very boring and painful for 90 minutes. Usually, I try to avoid wasting energy on bad film making. I will take the beating and roll with blows, but in this case an honest warning applies. How the hell did Nanouk Leopold receive funds (largely from publicly-funded funds) for this turkey? Of course, there was no script that could be spoken. This can be compensated by a genius filmmaker with cinematographic ideas or a cast with slightly more interest. No, simply vaguely defined concept "I want to do something from a female point of view." The result is an insult, not a tribute to the woman's perspective of life. <br /> <br /> What's worse, there is no interesting shot in the whole movie. I can not imagine a cast that would make it happen, but Johanna ter Steege is a (small) light in the dark, if possible, with this terrible lack of material. I try to imagine how Leopold tried to direct Maria Kraakman: "Maria, look at the horizon, we film you for three minutes, just express sorrow." An excellent cure for insomnia. Receive a copy and watch it late at night, also guaranteed to sleep. <br /> <br /> Obscura camera --- 1/10
