First of all, I would like to say that I am a fan of Chris Rock. I like his other films, but this movie is like my summary. The biggest shit bag. At the beginning, Chris Rock plays a novice comedian who is a fright in a comedy building called Apollo. On the way home from a concert, riding a BIKE he sees the woman he likes and is hit by a truck. A little later, he chooses the body of an old, white and selfish millionaire. Then he dresses up for the Outkast music group, trying to recreate the scene from the original in which he appears as a jockey. Second, he returns to Apollo and tries to be a comedian he has tried to be in his previous body, and begins to disperse the white population and tries to be black. Do you have my drift? This movie is horrible, it tries too hard to be like the original, and in this way it looks like a sack of shit. Just use my advice, do not even watch this movie.
