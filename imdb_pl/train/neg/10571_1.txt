my wife is a fanatic of this series. The fact that I bought her seasons from the first to the third and the fourth season is made to order. Personally, I think that the performance is one big farce, and the cast is just as bad. Alyssa Milano should stick to other films she made, such as Poison Ivy, Embrace of the Vampire, to name a few, other women supporting the cast are equally inept in their performances. I saw better special effects in the old Republic Pictures series that I saw as a child. I can understand why the male guides stayed on the show for such short periods of time, although I do not know if it was their own choice or not. Please. Please do not renew for the next season, enough, Bob
