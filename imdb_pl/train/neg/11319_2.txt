Vampire cyborgs rule the world and use people's blood as fuel, but the power will change thanks to the renegade android (Kris Kristofferson) and warrior (Kathly Long), who will face Lance Henriksen and Gary Daniels (Who plays cyborgs in this absurd movie) questions left unanswered by this horrible movie, the most moving idea is "Who" is filling the country singer Kris Kristofferson as a warrior of a cyborg who is able to give as well as he does. No, do not get me wrong, I could see Kristofferson as a guard or something, but not as a cyborg. Surprisingly, it was written for Dolph Lundgren, but Lundgren had to have wisdom not to do it. However, despite the disastrous casting, Kristofferson is the easiest thing in the movie. It gives a much more human performance than the inexpressible Kathy Long. (And Kristofferson plays the robot), despite bad thinking, Kristofferson provides some moments of interest. Lance Henriksen sleeps, and Gary Daniels is wasted, but basically Knights fails. You stand in horror wondering who the hell thought it was even a good idea on paper. (This is a video in which quartet Kristofferson fights robots in a backpack). The worst is what ends with a continuation, fortunately it has not materialized yet, although I still have nightmares with the proposition of probability of such an event. br /> <br /> * out of 4- (Bad)
