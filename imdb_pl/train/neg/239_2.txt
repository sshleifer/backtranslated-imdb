I will not say that this movie was bad, but it was not good either. I was expecting something good, but I think Hum Aapke Hain Kaun was much better. It was completely old-fashioned. At every stage of this movie, I was counting on a refund and what will I get? The girl is burned and gets her aunt's love. <br /> <br /> In spite of their commitment, they must get permission for every little move they make. They're so fucking shy even after so many meetings. I expected that my aunt would be much more brutal. Everything she did is madly a crib. <br /> <br /> Hey, we also have children, but we do not watch them and we always have tears in our eyes. This movie is a dream. Happy family, one cruel woman, good parents-in-law and a man who loves her to death. In HAHK Anupam Kher was the father of a poor bride and now the opposite is true. And somehow I knew that Mohnish Behl would be in this movie. In any case, I believe that I have wasted my time. I give him 2/10.
