"I went to the cinema to see" Beat Street "/ it was not bad, it was a bit" neat "," Krush Groove "is a movie that did not bother / when it came to" Rappin "I drew a line. A word to your mother. <br /> <br /> Do you want me to stop? <br /> <br /> This is just a small sample of the rhymed stupa -fly style shown in this waste of film and location permits. This movie is seriously frightening (the 80's are simply horrible cking). As the emcee, Mario Van Peebles is the hell of an actor. And as an actor, Mario Van Peebles is a hell of a bodybuilder. <br /> <br /> Each movie called "Rappin" should better meet this highest standard of this genre. Why, then, did the 6-year-old go on in transitions, even in times when the standards were as high as for Webster? Because this rap is weak. So weak that even B.E.T. or Central Comedy will touch it with a 10-meter long gold rope chain. <br /> <br /> "Rapture" Blondie is a poetry next to this piece of Dr. Suess in the hood. So do not be a boobie, avoid this movie! <br /> <br />
