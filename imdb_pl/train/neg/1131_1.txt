It is a pity that even the talented director, Desplechin, was unable to create a decent performance from a grimly talented actress, Phoenix, Esther Kahn has no substance to convey a very concise and clear storyline. Trying to fulfill the concentric circle of the actor's difficult situation, the performance and presentation are too elaborate and ill-made to get any compassion from the viewer. In too long a time, Esther's redundancy fight is too melodramatic to be effective and reduces the story to the fragile frame of a disastrous display. The content is incoherent and unjustified because Phoenix tries to carry out Desplechin's instructions, just as Esther tries to do the same. Never feeling the convincing victory over Esther's pain, we never feel the victory in Phoenix's talent.
