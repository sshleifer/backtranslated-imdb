Loved Part One, The Impossible Planet, but whoops, what a disappointing part is the second The Satan Pit. A cliff of something that apparently floated from below was nothing. Then centuries spent creeping round ventilation holes to speak the story, the roaring beast, empty of intelligence, so no confrontation of the Doctor / villain I was expecting. TARDIS is somehow inside the excavation, although the pit is not open long after the TARDIS falls through the planet's crust. And finally, another ready solution that existed without a logical reason - that is, why not immerse the Beast into the Hole, as soon as the opening opens? Why not keep him down all these years instead of imprisoning him. Why not - I could continue, but I lost interest ...
