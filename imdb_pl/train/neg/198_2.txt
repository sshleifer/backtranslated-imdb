Burt Kennedy was a very good director, but you would never know it in this unbearable mess. This film not only looks cheap, but it is cheap - most of the battle scenes are moved from the far better "The Last Command" from 1955, and this film, made 32 years earlier, looks more contemporary than anything in this picture. The few action scenes that have been shot in this film are disorganized, lost and incompetent, looking as trashy as the rest of the picture. It has the appearance and character of a bad student film (and the budget did not seem to be much more). It moves like molasses, mostly works either over ham, or under a top coma - although Raul Julia goes out better than most of the rest of the cast - and that is annoying annoying historical inaccuracies. In addition, it is too long. If you're going to make a boring movie, do it in an hour and finish it - do not stretch it for three hours, just like it does. If you want to see a good movie about the Alamo, check out John Wayne's 1960 version, and even a 1955 movie from which he stole his action scenes. It's hard to believe that making this movie was difficult for six producers. Skip it.
