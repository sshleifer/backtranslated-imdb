This movie was on t.v one day and I did not like it. The first George of the jungle was a good comedy, but a sequel .... totally awful. The new actor and actress were not good at all, they should have an original actor (Brendon Fraiser) and an original actress (I forgot her name), so this film gets a rating of 0 out of 10, not a movie that you can sit and watch, and enjoy, it's a movie that you turn to another channel or take back to the store if you're employed or bought. It was good to see Ape the monkey back, but it was not as funny as the first, they should have a new George as Georges' son, and still have Bredon and (what her face) in the movie I was a little better than he was.
