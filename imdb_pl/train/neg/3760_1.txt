It's the biggest piece of lam I've ever seen. It is very boring that I would rather attend a seminar on creationism than watch it if I knew it would be as boring as it was. Even 40 seconds of a hot chick in a bikini with large tasami will not exchange it for anything less than 1. <br /> <br /> Reviews of this movie, claiming that this movie is "unintentionally funny", are absurd and just BAD. One thing is not fun in this movie. they spend the first 50 or more minutes walking in the woods, talking about things that you do not understand or care about, and it's just as bad when people start dying because you do not even know who they are because they are so UNKNOWN. Honestly, I did not watch it to the end, but it should say something about how awful it is. THE MOST VIDEO EVER. <br /> <br /> Immediately after this dirt was ejected from my DVD player, I started scratching it with cement in front of my house, not wanting other hit customers to come up with the same mistake I made as to rent this movie. Then Zach, pant his pants. Thank you for your time.
