wow, Naked Brothers Band. What should I say. I think I can say that this series sucks. number one: they have no talent, they probably can not even play instruments. number 2: the ad was said to be famous, but no one even heard about it until the shit program appeared. Look, I do not really hate it so bad, I would give it like 4 out of 10, but it's annoying me that everyone says they have such a great talent, and Nat is so deep and writes deep lyrics. Deep in the ass! he talks about hardcore wrestlers with inner feelings. Wow, I could read what he says on the bathroom walls, and it would be deeper. And they did not become famous themselves, their parents are famous celebrities and they wanted their children too, so they invented a bad performance. I have the impression that it will be canceled soon.
