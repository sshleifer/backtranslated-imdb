The original Japanese movie from 1965 "Gamera" http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/ was essentially an update of the darker, less-oriented Gojiry (Godzilla) for sensitivity to the 1960s. Gamera, of course, is a huge, flying, flame-throwing turtle that literally absorbs energy - not as large as some versions of Godzilla, but generally similar in many respects. <br /> <br /> This version of the original movie was edited and recreated by the notorious Sandy Frank. And as in the case of the Americanized version of Godzilla ("Godzilla King of the Monsters"), "Gammera the Invincible" is more than just an incorrect spelling. American scenes are not as absurd and irritating as those added to the great Gojira, but they do not really add too much to this story because there is not much. <br /> <br /> The film starts promising, there are a few scenes worth developing, and there is enough personality to create tension beyond the main story. However, after the Gamers appearance, the film begins to fall into a rather kaiju movie. <br /> <br /> Acting is good enough - even American extras are fine. Directing is quite good at this time and genre, and special effects are not bad at all for their time (all miniatures). Some sets and backgrounds are really very good. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem, of course, is that this movie is not very original. Gamera, however, develops a much more special personality in his later films - most of which are worth watching if you're a fan of kaiju.
