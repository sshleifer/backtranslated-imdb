I watched a DVD (called BLACK WIDOW in the USA) and then I felt it was really a terrible movie. But they had to cut some of the original movie, or I missed. Sex scenes had very little vulgarity and nakedness (even breasts), but I read a few other comments on IMDb.com, which mentioned the vulgarity and a kind of tampon. I did not see anything like that, just a bad, boring movie with unusual characters and a banal, sophisticated story. Giada Colagrande is paralyzed from mouth to mouth or Botox to her gills, and her expressive face touches her face. And her name makes me think of a super-sized drink in Taco Bell: "I will have a Coke Grande!" It was really funny that it was so bad that I had to play like in my own Mystery Science Theater 3000, noticing things like the fact that Dafoe's skin is too big for his face. It's really stupid putty!
