Michael Callan plays a fastidious photographer who, after all, seems to be a perfect "catch" for every woman who runs him; could it have something to do with the fact that he was also the co-producer of the film? He is a "hero" with whom it is very difficult to feel, so the movie is in trouble from the very beginning. However, this is not the end. It has the production value of a TV movie (check this clay head or something similar at the end), and ending codes cheats in a way that I can not reveal in case someone wants to see a movie (very unlikely). Let's just say that the killer knows more than we were told he knows. (* 1/2)
