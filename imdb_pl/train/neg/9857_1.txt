I just finished watching this movie and found that it is not really fun at all. <br /> <br /> I am an RPG player (computer type, none of the DnD tablets), but I have not found any jokes in this funny situation. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes seemed to be very long (the inclination and zoom could be reduced to 5 seconds instead of over a minute) and it seems that the director was just trying to fill the time. <br /> <br /> I think I was laughing a total of 2-3 times in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Acting was not so bad, a standard that should have a B movie. <br /> <br /> I would suggest not to worry about this movie, unless you're a big fan of DnD and even then it would probably be best to avoid this movie.
