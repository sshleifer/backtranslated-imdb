I discovered that it was a waste of time, effort and money. I know that Disney always shows a lack of creativity when filming "straight to video" - but refreshing the plot of the original movie with a "new perspective" is low all over ... soon they will simply re-release the original movies with new animation and new songs and call it "new" a movie version that we all love. " Nathan Lane surprisingly returns again to the role of Timon. Timon and Pumbaa animated animals from the world of the original "Lion King" embark on a narrative journey to tell us the original story in the way it REALLY happened ... as they see it. <br /> <br /> Of course, Timon is now the protagonist of this story, yadda yadda yadda, bla bla blah ... <br /> <br /> The musical sequences are bad, and the animation is nonsense. The vocal talents are impressive for the video function, but then when do you last remember that Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg or Nathan Lane are in something about real commercial content? In general, if you liked the original, you hate it. It is offensive because it is unfair for both children and adults. And it sums it all up.
