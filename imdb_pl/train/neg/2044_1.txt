This movie is bad. I do not mean "bad" as in; "Oh, the script was bad", or; "Acting in this scene was bad" ..... I mean bad that someone should be held criminally liable for corrupting that inconspicuous pile of cruding on a unsuspecting audience. I will not even epitomize him with an explanation (Plot ??), if I can refer to it. I can come up with just one other opportunity in about 40 years of watching movies that I found the need to vent my spleen on film. I mean, no one is going to deliberately make a bad movie, right? Yeah. Apparently they're doing it ... and the guilty man is the writer / director Ulli Lommel. But the worst part is that Blockbusters actually rents it to its customers! I advise. Leave this shit where it belongs. He got stuck on the shelf, collecting dust.
