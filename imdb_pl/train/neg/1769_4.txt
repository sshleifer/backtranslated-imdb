First watched 29.04.2007 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Mick Garris): Campy vampire movie like Stephen King has so many strange and silly elements that you start to laugh with incredible weirdness about 3/4 of the way to the movie and wonder if this the film can be cult for King's fans. This is a story about mother and son who are lunatorkami (shapeshift cats, eating meat, in need of life, near a extinct species of humanoids), who move from town to town in search of virgins to live. They meet as quite normal people from a higher class, except that they are secret lovers, and cats hang outside the house, day and night. Cats are deadly for them, so they set traps in their backyard to stop the population. We see them breaking some of their necks when they attack (which is also the first in my film experience) --- I hope that no real cats have been hurt in making the film. The boy is after a sweet girl, in which he has a crush, until he turns into a "sleepwalker", and then only wants her body. In this movie there is so much uniqueness in the camp that it could be better if it was a versatile satirical comedy about suburban life, but the director scares you away every few minutes until you just want to let it go and get the blood out . In the end it happens, and the film ends with a typical ending of Stephen King. The film is interesting, because King's mood is more than usual, but his eccentricity is also very present, and what you have is a movie that his fans will probably like and should have in their collection, but as a valuable movie experience there is not really cut it.
