I bought this movie quite cheaply from the rental company, thinking that the cover looks quite nice. And it was nice, but the movie is rubbish. I can deal with B-grade, sometimes I even enjoy a good B-romp (eg "Surf Nazis Must Die" is a classic example of how funny this genre may be), but it was simply bland, bland. The incredibly boring scenes were divided too rarely by good, healthy, cheap porn and funny sequences of horror movies. This movie has little to offer.
