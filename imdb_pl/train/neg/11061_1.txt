Curiosity led me to this "masterpiece". Unfortunately, I did not rent it, I bought it! The most disturbing thing about this movie is that it is not so disturbing. For reasons known only to them, the creators of this film decided to show the human side of Jeffry Dahmer. Are you joking? The man gave a new meaning to the term "finger to lick" well "! And with all flash-backs and flash-forwards, I had a problem with following the story. In all, Jeremy Renner's performance was not so bad. You can catch him in "S.W.A.T.", in which he plays a dissatisfied ex-policeman. In any case, I would rate it as 1/10. He only got 1 because of Renner's good results. There are many books and TV shows that deal with Dahmer crimes much better. Avoid this.
