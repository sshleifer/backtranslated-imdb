I was not sure if Andy Sidaris could repeat his success with the cinematic hit "Malibu Express". With his film "Fit to Kill" he proved that Sidaris is a serious filmmaker, not just one director. The plot written by Sidaris, unforgettably overlooked by the Academy, is a complex scenario involving many invisible twists. The main characters composed a work for a radio station based on sex known as KSXY. Clever KSXY is actually their secret office. In "Fit to Kill," they confront Kane, a long-term nemesis who tries to steal one of the most prized Russian diamonds. A well-written script is not everything, an excellent acting game helps to guarantee that this film will be an iconic classic. This film, with the participation of critics and credit unions, will be appreciated in the coming years. He suffers the same fate as the Mechanical Orange and Taxi Driver, but he will undoubtedly be recognized in the future. I am disappointed that no critics have recognized the production of Andy Sidaris's trademarks. Costumes, special effects, all complements the compliments of this beautiful film. It's best to ignore the grim 3 rating in this movie and go out and borrow it for yourself. My personal rating is 10/10. The drama is as thick as the hit Runaway Bride, and the action is better or equal to the film masterpiece of Last Action Hero. Andy, keep doing a good job.
