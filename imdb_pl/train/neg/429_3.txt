I have been lured to see this movie through its stellar power, but ultimately it all ensures it. The game is more like a Greek tragedy than a modern thriller about corruption in a big city. The biggest disadvantage is predictability and total lack of voltage. We know who the bad guys are from the very beginning and just follow them when they fall like dominoes. The film in its own way refrains from unjustified violence and sex, but forgot to replace good, pure romance or excitement in a different way. The whole taste of good, flat decaffeinated diet cola. "Q & A", which is also held in New York, is a much better alternative, as is "Confidential LA".
