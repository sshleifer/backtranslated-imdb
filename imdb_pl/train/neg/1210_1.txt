Where to start ... Oh yes, Message to bad people: When you first find a person you have been following (to kill) who witnessed a crime, do not spend time talking with her, so that she has another opportunity to escape. Message to the victim: When the bandits talk to each other and argue, take the opportunity to "RUN", do not sit down and do not watch them until you hear the noise. Message to the director: if someone has a 5 or 10 minute start in a vehicle or on foot, you can not have bad guys on your heels or bumper right away! time and movement do not work this way. It would also be nice to think that a woman does not have to brutally kill (4) men to give herself the opportunity to leave an abusive relationship at home.
