Currently, this movie is listed on IMDb as the 42rd worst movie ever made - that's why I rented it from NetFlix. I regret to say, however, that the film, though bad, is not close enough to deserve to be included in the list of 100 films that have ever been made. Personally, I've seen at least 100 movies worse than this one. Almost not brilliant support, but simply did not meet the expected level of horrors, which should be included in this infamous list. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew regarding their belated honeymoon (by the way, they are also married in real life). He is a doctor who is obsessed with bats and insists that they go to a nearby cave. There they behave very, very, very stupid (feature of a bad movie) and soon they are bitten by a bat. According to this film, bats love to attack people, and in the US there are bats-vampires - both are not real. <br /> <br /> Strange, after a bite the man does not even bother going to the hospital !! The first thing in someone's mind (especially a doctor) is to get medical help immediately, but not this one. Soon he has attacks - he is not interested in seeking help yet! You still think it must be the stupidest couple in movie history !! <br /> <br /> After a while, he goes to the doctor and is sent to the hospital. But by then it is too late and his attacks are more violent and he begins to kill people to suck blood. When it is obvious to everyone that a man is a crazy killing machine, a wife (who, like her husband, has a grapefruit for the brain) refuses to believe he is dangerous - even after he attacks people, steals an ambulance and starts a police car out of the way !! <br /> <br /> Most of the time Moss goes through these episodes, his eyes fall over and he looks like a normal person. It is strange, however, that several times he develops hands similar to bats, and at the end they used cool prostheses to look like a bat. If it was really bad, the movie would deserve 1. <br /> <br /> At the end, in a turn that made no sense at all, the wife inexplicably turned into a crazy bat lady and had a swarm of bats killing the evil sheriff. As it was all organized, it was a mystery, as was the conviction of Moss and McAndrew that this movie would somehow help them in their careers - though they both had quite a long career in television roles since 1974. <br /> <br /> Generally, very stupid. The story is stupid and it makes no sense and it's very much about people being too stupid to be real. This is not a good movie, but it is not one of the worst movies of all time. <br /> <br /> NOTE: For some reason, IMDb shows graphics for three DVD sets for IT'S ALIVE and these are two more parts of the website for THE BAT PEOPLE. While the BAT PEOPLE saw the title "It's Alive," both films are not related at all. It is easy to understand this mistake - especially since both were released in 1974, but in the film I just reviewed, they starred Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew, the other starring John Ryan and Sharon Farrell.
