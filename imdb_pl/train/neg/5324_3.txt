Vovochka is your everyday film about hooligans and authority. Wowochka, the main character, is early marked as a bad influence on children in the area. Thanks to the words of wisdom from several adults he meets along the way, he discovers that he is changing his malicious ways, but he is worthy of it. Personally, I think that the actor who played Wowochka is too irritating to sympathize with him, but changing the tone of the film would allow the majority to feel the emotional battle of Wowochka when he wants to be good, but bad things still happen. This fight makes the movie a bit different than other films of the same genre, it's a small taste that I meant. In total, I did not care about this film, although it was most likely intended for a younger audience.
