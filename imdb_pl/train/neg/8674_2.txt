The first few minutes of "The Bodyguard" have a charming charm: they open up with the crawling of the Bible (part of which Samuel Jackson recites to his future victims in "Pulp Fiction"), he continues two schools of karate teachers in New York argue about the eternal question of humanity (who is better? Sonny Chiba or Bruce Lee?), and then Chiba appears, playing alone; immediately stops the hijacking of the plane and breaks the bottle with your bare hand. Unfortunately, any entertainment value, intentional or unintentional, will soon be crushed by the chaotic history, the lack of action over a long period of time and the poor quality of each current action. To make it easy, here's why "The Bodyguard" is an unbearable movie: <br /> <br /> 1) You do not know what's going on. <br /> <br /> 2) There are almost no fights. <br /> <br /> 3) The battles that are there are short and terribly filmed. <br /> <br /> Sonny Chiba is cool. Judy Lee is great, her face is great. Only for them I give "The Bodyguard" the second star from 10. This movie makes 87 minutes have 5 hours.
