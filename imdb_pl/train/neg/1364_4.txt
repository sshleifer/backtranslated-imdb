The more I think about it, the resigned from the movie <br /> <br />. I saw it 9 months ago, so my memory could make it worse <br /> <br /> worse than it was, but I know it was at least as bad as 4 from <br /> <br /> 10. <br / > <br /> after watching the movie I met the director. he seemed so unaware of <br /> <br /> as to what he did or did, and when it came to <br /> <br />, he did not care about the movie. he even agreed that <br /> <br /> did not really know what he was doing, and he was forced to do <br /> <br /> some things because it was filmed digitally. <br /> <br /> I felt that the film tried to match the formula that <br /> <br /> built for himself: "9 people must be connected in some way. <br /> <br /> if we can get from point "A" to point "B", so to get from <br /> <br /> prostitutes we see at the beginning and we return to it at the end of 10 <br / > <br /> minutes for each character's relationship with another person. to <br /> <br /> makes someone feel choked by ambiguous, badly drawn characters <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> I just remembered the part of the movie where you can make Steve. <br /> <br /> Bouchemi is one scene where he is amazing. this is it. as and <br /> <br /> say ... 4 out of 10.
