The first Cube movie was an artistic film. He created a world in which all the major archetypes of humanity were represented, and showed how they fought for understanding the hostile world they could not understand. At a non-literal level, it was a conspiracy of "man versus cruel nature," in which the individual who represented innocence and goodness finally went triumphing to face a new, unspecified world, going beyond the small quarrels of man; a world in which there was no fight, but peace. I rated Cube 10 out of 10 and it was a movie that never had any sequels. <br /> <br /> The second film, Hypercube, was a huge disappointment. Some ideas were cool, but in the context of the original movie, both the story and the setting did not make sense and did not matter. Still, due to the fact that it was quite funny, I rated it as 5 out of 10. <br /> <br /> The third movie, Cube Zero, ignoring the second one, plays like a much worse commercial refreshing of the first B movie, without symbolism. There is no "homage" or "homage"; it's just ripping. The same kind of plot, with some elements changed idiotically (like writing letters instead of prime numbers between cubes - an idea that shows more clearly than anything else, that it is a rip off without any originality and nothing to say). br /> <br /> The fact that we see something from behind the scenes does not mean anything, because observers are only part of the Great Evil Experiment that we know nothing about. And in this movie, those who reach the exit (like Kazan at the end of the first movie) are simply killed - where * bleating * is in this sense ?! It's just stupid. I'm glad I did not pay to see it. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​and actions in Cube Zero are not so bad, but the story and ideas are so completely devoid of inspiration that this movie can only get from me 3 out of 10.
