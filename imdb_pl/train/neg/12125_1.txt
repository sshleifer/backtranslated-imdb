Why do people who do not know what time has been in the past feel the need to define this time for others? Replace Woodstock with the civil war and landing of the Apollo moon with the sinking of the Titanic, and feel as realistically as this formal soap opera is populated entirely by garbage. Is this what kids who were too small to go to Woodstock and who have not passed the exam? "I will show the old meanie, I will put out my own film and prove that you do not need to know about the subject to keep earning!" Yes, we already know that. The only thing I watched in this movie is give me a little insight into the thinking of the subclass. The next time I see a hooker in a bar that looks like Diane Lane, I run the other way. It is the abuse of children so that parents who are worthless bring up children. This abuse of the audience simply sticks Woodstock and Moonlanding to the rhythm, as if it meant the movie was in 1969.
