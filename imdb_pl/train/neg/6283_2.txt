What an amazing fall for Sean Ellis. <br /> <br /> You gather a group of your friends at home, everyone is excited about the continuation of Sean Ellis' work. You have a vague idea about the plot, no spoilers that could kill fun, very high expectations. <br /> <br /> It's late at night, the perfect atmosphere for this type of movie. <br /> <br /> 15 minutes pass and you start telling yourself that you will definitely get up, about 25 minutes you will start to wonder if you should just go to sleep and save it for another time when you can fully appreciate the expected non-existent subtle touch. Within half an hour you realize that half of your waking audience is already asleep and is calling it a day. <br /> <br /> A few days later, when you exhaust all other materials to see how you come back to this time, this time in the middle of the day, hoping that this time your mood will wake you up. 10 minutes later you are a fast message of incredibly and unnecessarily long intermediate transitions and images. Any other things that I would have already given up, but there is cashback and its legacy. But this heritage can carry you so long, it's a new level of boring movie making, imagine a short story extended to a novel with descriptions, here's what it is. <br /> <br /> A decent cast is wasted, and there is no cinematography that leaves you in awe, just like cashback. There are films that annoy you, there are films that lack certain aspects or are simply bad, unfortunately it is only a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Last words, stay away.
