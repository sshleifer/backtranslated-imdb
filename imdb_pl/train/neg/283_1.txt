to the movie, this movie seemed to be one of those after school specialties, only to lower the budget and lower everything else. I guess it was supposed to be some inspirational movie, but it did not work for me. like preachy.it has very pale Flash Dance shades, but so what? there is simply no excitement in this movie. dialogue is invented and banal to death. Of course, the whole movie seems to be a bad stereotype of the 80s. Acting was less than stellar, though it has a lot to do with what the actors received (or in this case, not) to work with them. At the beginning there is a poor selection of songs, with really bad lyrics. all involved actors. Everyone is talented, but this movie can not be said. This is of course my opinion, but I have to give Flying AKA Dream that they would believe 1/10
