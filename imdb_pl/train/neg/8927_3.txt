Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed !!!) receives a sex change from the doctor (John Carradine - dead drunk) and leaves as Myra (Raquel Welch). He then decides to destroy male masculinity (or something like that) and begins to teach film history in acting studios led by lecherous John Huston (do not ask) and break up the young happy couple (young, handsome, handsome Roger Herren and Farrah Fawcett - so Farrah Fawcett) . <br /> <br /> They took a great novel by Gore Vidal, which was impossible to make and obviously tried to film it. They also employed an Englishman with a decidedly anti-American attitude and hired a group of actors with a doubtful "talent" (Welch, Reed) and embarrassed old professionals (Huston, Carradine, Andy Devine, Jim Backus, Mae West), they put it all together and .... UNKNOWN !!! An absolute catastrophe. <br /> <br /> The film received an X rating in its release (it was reduced to R), mainly due to the really tasteless scene in which Welch sodomizes Rusty (Roger Herren) and the scene in which Welch tries to make sex with Fawcett. <br /> <br /> The movie is very distracted ... scenes are jumping everywhere and people are talking and doing things that do not make sense. This is not good at all, but I have never been bored. <br /> <br /> Acting is very different ... Reed is awful ... really sad. Huston is still chewing the scenery and re-nauseating. Welch is not really bad like Myra, but her lines do not make sense, so you never know what to do with her. West is little in the movie (blessing) and is really sick to hear a woman with an almost 80-year-old joke. Roger Herren (whatever happened ...) was very young, handsome and good as Rusty. Fawcett is doing well. <br /> <br /> It's hard to find something about it ... you just watch it in disbelief. Must see the movie - believe !!!!
