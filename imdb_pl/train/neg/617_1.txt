First, let's start with the quote my friend said while watching the movie: "The whole movie had to be bold. "Thanks to this film, they made every effort to achieve this title. The effects are obviously weak. Plot / dialogue is like a collage of bits stolen from every B horror movie ever made. Actors, I suppose, should be in college. However, some elements (especially at the beginning) make it seem that they are meant to be in high or medium school. It does not make sense. Scarecrow killing people is not pleasant at all. (SPOILER: Finally, when they chant Lester's name and reappear, the black guy and Scarecrow laugh, probably with relief that they were on the last scene, and during a bad dialogue)
