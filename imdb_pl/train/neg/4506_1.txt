American filmmakers decided to make a movie that they think is Japanese. The badly represented heroes, the actors are not even Japanese, and the set is cheap, unreal and definitely does not represent Kyoto at the beginning of the 1920s and 1930s. Whoever read the book, understand that the authors of the scripts have not added any additional value to distinguish the movie from the script. What's even worse, they even changed the original plot line with a few nonsense. Rob Marshall uses two famous Chinese actors for their two main heroes who have joined the hidden tiger hidden dragon. Marshall probably saw one Chinese movie that represents Japanese culture. Re-viewing these two actors makes the films even more funny. The last scene of Quentine Tarantino in Kill Bill # 1 is ten times more Japanese than the one from this movie.
