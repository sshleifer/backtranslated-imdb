I'm not sure why I like Dolph Lundgren. I think seeing him on the screen, I feel that anyone who works hard can succeed regardless of talent. It's a good feeling for all of us who have no talent. Some other reviews indicate how stupid Detention is, but many neglect the positives. <br /> <br /> Any movie where at least one annoying teenager is killed can not be bad. Why do so many movies that have a cast of teenagers always have to include stereotypical teenagers? Are there no other teenagers? Does every group of teenagers have one angry black guy? One brilliant gull that nobody likes? One slutty girl who is very friendly and (in this movie) is pregnant? One disturbing anti-social white kid from a broken home who all agree is talented (but what is talent?). And one laid back black kid who is in harmony with the Universe and so cool that all other neurotic children trust him. Then add some ordinary teenagers of any color. They do not say much, but at one point they are shot dead. <br /> <br /> Stopping would be better if the bad guys blew up the school. Ideally with writers inside. Dialogue is bad and the conspiracy is worse. When the bad guys (and the girl) finally take over the van full of drugs, they sit in the van. They drive a van to school because they want to paint the van again in the school's paint shop, but they'll never be able to paint the van. Incidentally, it would be easier to put all drugs in another car or two cars or another van or truck and drive away without painting the police van. They never transfer drugs or sell drugs, or do anything else with a large number of points. <br /> <br /> For some reason they decide that they have to kill the children and the teacher (Dolph Lundgren), even if the villains take over the school, nobody is aware of it because it is after school hours. A handful of people still at school have nothing to do with painting vehicles, so why hunt them? <br /> <br /> Anyway, the best part of this movie is that all villains are armed with numerous machine guns and still find teens (including a guy in a wheelchair) and still shoot hundreds of bullets in teens and I usually miss . At the end of the movie there is some bloodshed. Every time someone is shot, he must fire at least three hundred bullets. The stunts are very bad. <br /> <br /> I have read one of the reviews saying that this movie had a budget of 10 million dollars and I am amazed. When I saw the movie that I thought of, maybe Lundgren did it as a kind of charity for a film school where he is a teacher. How could this movie be their exam at the end of the year. It was a test to see it, but I passed it.
