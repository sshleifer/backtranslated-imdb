Yes, Marie Dresler drinks juice from dried plums, which she think is poison and leaves work. <br /> <br /> Dresler is good. Never my cup of tea, but she is a solid performer who certainly keeps the screen. <br /> <br /> I watched it for Polly Moran, whom I saw elsewhere. Here, Moran is fine - just OK - as Dressler's clever friend / foe. It is a pity that she fell into almost complete oblivion. <br /> <br /> The plot is good. Bad guys try to rob the city's residents. Dressler triumphs and everything ends well. <br /> <br /> I'm thinking about the central plot mechanism: bonds. This occurred during the crisis, so perhaps everyone was familiar with the bonds and what they can do if they are well used and if they are misused. However, I am not close to them from that era. They're like just different actions, right? It seems strange to build a story about Little Man around a somewhat refined monetary unit.
