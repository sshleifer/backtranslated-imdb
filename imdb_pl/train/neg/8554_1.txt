Most probably, the film was made in 1930. It was released in 1931. I suppose that talking physical images had great difficulty with the transition from the silent era. Nevertheless, this particular Zane Gray chart seems to be very weak. In addition, Gary Cooper probably learned to act. The result is something that would not be acceptable to today's standards. Maybe in 1931. In 2004, Not acceptable. Some of the actors did well. Unfortunately, Indians always have a short end in these early westerns. They lived on the ground long before the white man came, but according to their crazy history they had no right to defend themselves.
