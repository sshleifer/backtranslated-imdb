Scary Movie. Nuff Said. <br /> <br /> These lines are just a filler. The movie was bad. Why do I need to develop it, I do not know. This is a waste of my time. I just wanted to warn others. Avoid this movie. Acting sucks, and writing is just moronic. Bad in every respect. The only nice thing about the movie are Deniz Akkaya's breasts. Even this has been ruined by a horrible and unnecessary rape scene. The film is a poorly invented and completely unbelievable piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> OK, now I'm just going to tug IMDb for this stupid rule of a minimum of 10 lines of text. First, I waste my time watching this offal. Then I feel compelled to warn others that I'm creating an IMDb account just to discover that I need to write an essay about friggen on film to express how bad it looks. Completely unnecessary.
