I got Mirror Mirror mainly because it was Yvonne De Carlo (I thought it was great in American Gothic), but unfortunately it did not play too much role in this film. It starts OK and the pace moves nicely ... but at the end it starts to be a bit boring and boring. That does not mean it's a boring movie, but it's just very average and nothing spectacular. I did not like the "property" side and there were no decent gore scenes. Plus, the "main" story was very misleading, and the ending does not make much sense. However, I liked the story surrounding the gothic girl and how she got revenge on her tormentors. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend especially Mirror Mirror fans of horror - it's nothing to get wet.
