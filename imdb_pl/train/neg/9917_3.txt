When the future husband of Stanwycka is murdered on the eve of the wedding, he retreats to the shelter, where he slides off the cliff and is rescued by the wealthy lawyer Morgan. Morgan falls in love with her, leading to a decidedly one-sided marriage spent on a huge estate in Chicago (which seems to be surrounded by mountains!). Stanwyck is tempted when he casts Cortez, but eventually he returns to Morgan, in a very subdued and unconvincing resolution of the story. <br /> <br /> This movie has a great cast (Morgan in particular is one of my favorites) and a great director, but the script is meandering and sometimes seems pointless. I was so ready to enjoy this movie, but in the end I was disappointed. It's still worth watching the cast and it's good for anyone who likes movies from the 1930s.
