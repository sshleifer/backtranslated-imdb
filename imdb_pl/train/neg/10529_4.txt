First watched 12/6/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Walter Lang): In my opinion a disappointing musical from the point of view of character development, from this very promised song by Rodgers and Hammerstein. There are a few good songs and a decent comic portrait, sometimes the king of Siam by Yael Brynner - but the film does not really represent a good situation, presenting the situation and settings. I can only blame the scenario and possibly some actions, why we do not fully understand the character and its situation. I know it can be a bit too much to ask for a musical intended for the joy of songs and dance, but even this part did not stand out too much for me. The basic story is that the Englishwoman is coming to Siam to teach children about exclusive European things. We learn later that the King is actually the greatest student. Between the newest wife of the king, played by Rita Moreno (latina as an Arab), and a former lover who causes some complications, romance is forbidden. Deborah Kerr, as the main heroine of Annie, is okay, but not so convincing. The king learns certain things because of his presence, and then the movie disappears just like him. It's a really little story with a few songs and dancing, but not so great for the viewer.
