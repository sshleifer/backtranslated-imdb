After watching the film, the first question that appeared in my mind was: Is it supposed to be irony or not? After reading some of the comments about Doc Savage and the series of comics, I knew that this movie was not meant to be ironic. The story tells us about the American Super-Doc, which saves the South American republic from evil. It sounds like a typical story. But this comes in such an unrealistic way that it becomes absurd. The mandatory final battle shows the worst martial arts presentation I have ever seen. The film may be interesting for low-budget designers as a bad example.
