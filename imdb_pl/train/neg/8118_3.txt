Well, EYEboy, I must say that I am happy endlessly when someone distinguishes me and tries to make fun of me, especially when it is someone who seems as intelligent as you are. My favorite part of your post was: "But there is not a bad guy here with big bang-bang with a good guy, kimosabe. I like action movies, especially if they're well done, but I also like movies that do not have a lot of shares, if they're well done. I'm sorry, but Secret's and Lies do not fit into this category and it's just a very bad movie. I really do not see too many non-American movies, so maybe I was spoiled and I did not realize how bad foreign movies really are when I saw Secrets and Lies. Perhaps, if I rate foreign films according to a different standard, I could one day see how Secrets and Lies can be one of the highest rated films in IMDB. Hmm ... If it's true, it's very scary. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Barger bits@midohio.net (new e-mail)
