This bad remake of 1963 classics is starting quite well and then replacing the tension with uncertain special effects. For example, in the original one of the most chilling moments appears when Nell and Theo lie side by side on two beds, listening in horror to the sounds outside their room. Nell tells Theo to let her go, because he hurts her. Nell looks at Theo, who is a few feet away and realizes that it was not Theo who held her hand. In the latest version, Nell lies alone in bed when she suddenly dives and slides on the floor. It's only when he talks about the invisible force that he stops pulling her, we realize what happened. And can anyone explain what Nell's last words mean - "It's about the family. It was always about the family "? <br /> <br /> The only redeeming function is Lili Taylor's performance, but even that can not save the movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones demonstrates once again that there is little depth under its pretty surface. In the original, Claire Bloom subtly suggested her lesbian persuasion. Zeta-Jones, however, has to spell it, for example, asking Nell if he has a boyfriend - or girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Definitely one that should be directed at a senseless cemetery with alterations.
