Another huge underground film that attempts to blame the US government and armed forces (especially the army) for each disaster since the Great Flood. Anyone who has ever served in the American army can see how fake this movie is. Uniforms, equipment, sets and manners are bad. (And of course all the older officers are either corrupt criminals or total idiots.) Glaring propaganda without objectivity. Most of the theories presented have been disproved in the last few years. He uses every cliche, gossip and urban legend from the Persian Gulf - all are presented as the gospel. (The truth is that no one knows for certain why some GW vets are sick and others are as healthy as horses). PS This is not new. War is NOT fun and I know veterinarians from World War II, Korea and Vietnam, with some serious ailments. (And the government has a duty to take care of them all). Sensational movies like this will not solve the problem!
