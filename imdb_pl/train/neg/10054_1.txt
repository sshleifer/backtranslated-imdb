I'm not alone admiring the first Superman movie, a movie that Richard Donner did masterfully. Nor am I alone in the worsening of Richard Lester's Superman 2 ... which leads us to cut Richard Donner's same film, but unfortunately it is still an abomination. <br /> <br /> Superman's world is where suspensions in high doses require disbelief, but Superman 2 extends too far. It does not matter who directed Superman 2, because the script offends the intelligence of the first grader. In a sense, there is no plot, because the characters have no motivation to act in the way they work, in contrast to the original superman. With or without its power, Superman's power (or lack thereof) is handled in the least credible way. There is too much to criticize, so I will not worry about it. I condemn this film ... maybe a slapstick version of Lester is more suitable for the dumb scenario on which this movie is based. Super-Duper angry.
