Oh, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot, I'm a film student. I do not understand why Angelina Jolie would be in this movie? Did she need money so badly? I love AJ and I've seen almost everything that has ever been, so I watched it twice. It was SOO bad! even badly wrong, badly wrong. He had 1 or 2 fun little moments, but in total there was no waste of 101 minutes. I can not even say that AJ looked good because she did not do it. The plot is predictable, unless you expect a repetition of Romeo and Juliet, and then no. Everything unsatisfactory. Maybe if your 12 it can be a good movie, otherwise I really do not recommend it.
