You know it will be a bad movie when: <br /> <br /> 1. It was done in the 50s 2. It's black and white. 3. There are no actors' names! 4. Scream makes up for the lack of special effects! <br /> <br /> Well, do not be outdone - this movie has wonderfully turned on all four of the above elements to turn it into a real cinematic error. <br /> <br /> Okay - shhhhh, I'm going to discuss special effects here - or not - <br /> <br /> Did you catch underwater scenes? It looks like the movie was badly filmed in the aquarium - pay attention to the flapping of the cloak in the wind. <br /> <br /> And repeated re-use of film material (external shots from the house, bridge scenes - a great improvement of KRAF-Tiness of this film - not since "PLAN 9" - have I seen such a creative use of film material. < br /> <br /> And hey, where there were no special effects - do not worry - I'm screaming I HAVE the place of special effects in this movie ... Yes, this movie even cleverly used this old hacking trick. <br /> <br /> Grab the popcorn - set the brain to bewilderment (a few fermented beverages definitely helps), sit back and wonder: why the hell have they re-introduced the movie? <br /> <br /> Wayno <br /> <br />
