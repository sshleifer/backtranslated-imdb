The worst concert I've ever seen. The story is about a group of teenagers who for some inexplicable reason have super powers, and when they use a special device, they transform into strange, badly designed suits. Acting, when they are not in suits late, is decent. Definitely not good, but not the worst act I've ever seen. However, when the actors wear suits, the actors' play changes from worse to worse; much, much worse. Hyperanimated idiots have a lot of unnecessary movements. Even when they talk, they look like they have attacks. The villains are stupider than Rangers. Every episode, some weak, idiotic villain is coming up with a plan to destroy the Rangers. Then he sends the power of hyper-animated aliens to attack the Rangers. Then the Rangers initiate their 10-hour animation of transformation and then destroy the aliens. Then a poorly designed villain, who may be either an armed villain who looks and acts badly, a humanoid creature with a poor ladybug with trumpets attached to his back, showing obvious signs of mental retardation. Power Rangers fight with the villain, and then the villain turns into Godzilla, whether through a rain cloud or a nuclear rocket (yes, they shoot bombs with creatures, and creatures turn into giants). Power Rangers spend 5 minutes on hyper-animation and evoke their Zords, which are of course toys that show producers used special effects to make them look real. Power Rangers win, the villain is angry, everyone teaches a "valuable" lesson, and the performance ends. this is it! Twenty-five minutes of brainwashing, a fake kung fu fight.
