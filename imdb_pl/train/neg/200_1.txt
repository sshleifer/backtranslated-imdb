This reviewer likes this video to surprise me. The plot is chaotic. The figures are wooden. Michael Bowen spends most of the movie spying on other characters and misjudging them all. Nobody has any salutary quality or interesting place. This is not a nervous job. This is not clever. This is not ironic. This is not wise. There is nothing simple in this boring job. This is the lack of a theatrical release is not a surprise. The fact that "This network" is broadcast reduces this place. I definitely recommend switching to the Garden Show in PBS or even good information if you encounter this mess on late-night TV. If you encounter it on daily television, take a long walk. Even if you walk in smog, you will feel better if you did not suffer from this mess. Life is short. This movie is long.
