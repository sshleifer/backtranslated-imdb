Ho-hum. The inventor's deadly biological weapon (Horst Buchholz) threatens to fall into the wrong hands. Unconsciously, his son (Luke Perry) was working on the anteote all the time. Go to the CIA agent Olivia d'Abo and chases and shots from cats and mice start. The cast also includes Tom Conti, Hendrick Haese and the aging Roger Moore. Moore seems to be wandering around this mess definitely not one of his better efforts. Perry fans will accept. d'Abo is wrong in this role, but it's nice to watch.
