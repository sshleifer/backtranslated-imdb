*** THE REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS *** I will make this review short and sweet. I bought this movie from Best Buy because it sounded interesting and had some top actors like Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman. How bad it can be, right? Well, it's very bad. Justin Timberlake plays Pollacka, a would-be journalist who encounters a case that can lead to corrupt cops in the Edison Police. LL Cool J is Deed, a special forces policeman in the team of special forces called F.R.A.T. (Attack tactics of the first reaction). He joined forces with a bad policeman named Lazerov (Dylan McDermott). In the opening scene, we see how Lazerov and Deed take over several bank robbers, but at night they spoil a few drug-dealing guys. I do not want to give too much, but things become bad for drug guys. Pollack, who works for Ashford (Morgan Freeman) goes to trial with Deeds & Lazerov. Suspects a suspicious game and with the help of Ashford, some are investigating, which becomes ugly. Wallace (Kevin Spacey), which is entirely in F.R.A.T. the team joins Ashford to try to bring the corrupt cops to justice. <br /> <br /> From the beginning you can say that Freeman and Spacey's performance is quite weak. The only person who does everything is Dylan McDermott. He is a complete case in this film and made me a believer. LL Cool J is awful in this movie. He speaks each line in the same way and shows the same emotions. He was much better in movies like Deep Blue Sea and Any Given Sunday. The movie starts with a nice action, but then it drags it through the rest of the movie. The ending is far from satisfying. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time on this movie. This weekend I put it on Ebay.
