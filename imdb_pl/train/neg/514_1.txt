This is one of the most bland, nondescript, non-original and senseless movies ever made! It seems that everyone involved in this project did not even try to create an attractive movie. This is nothing but the continuation of the tiring series of films that try to earn the success of Smokey and the Bandit, which in my opinion is the best movie of them all. When it comes to wasting film stocks, Burt Reynolds lunatics throughout the movie, Jim Nabors is wasted, other actors do not have much to do, car racing is of course film material, humor is little inspired and many scenes are more dull and lifeless than staring in the wall for two hours. "Stroker Ace" is simply an unnecessary movie that has nothing special or characteristic about it.
