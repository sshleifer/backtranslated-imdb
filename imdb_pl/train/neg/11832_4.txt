From the creators of Shrek ???????? .. OK, that attracted my attention. <br /> <br /> Well, Shrek's creators also created Madagascar. Madagascar was half as good as Shrek. <br /> <br /> And now Flushed Away is half as good as Madagascar. <br /> <br /> That means Flushed Away is not good. Animation and all special effects were very good, but the movie was not. <br /> <br /> The story of this movie was intended only for children. Adults really can not love this movie. <br /> <br /> But there were many jokes for adults. I bet children understand jokes. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that I like it so much. <br /> <br /> I am totally disappointed. 4/10
