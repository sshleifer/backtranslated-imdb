I went to see it in the hope of the old-fashioned Alice Entertainment. When I realized that I would not get it, I watched it in a pretty well done film (in terms of filming and so ... it was). except that he has a good film quality, given that I watched grainy films all day long, there was nothing good about the film. <br /> <br /> He killed 42. Why did Tweedle Dee and Dum play Mudler and Scully? Serisouly, who can answer that? Who can answer something awful in this movie. <br /> <br /> I agree with who said it was just one big, internal joke for the staff. it seemed to be. <br /> <br /> Poor Mr. Carroll. I am so sorry that someone did it with their wonderful stories.
