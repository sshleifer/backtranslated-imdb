I have always been enthusiastic about period dramas, an art form in which the BBC has been a leader in the past. This presentation of "Byron" was unbelievable. Incredibly wrong! The script was horrible, the acting was not inspired, and all the characters were pitifully bland. Obviously, Byron was "crazy angry and dangerous to know," and he set the maid's hearts motionless. Not in this production. He appeared here as a tavern, he jumped out of a small gushing woman instead of a fiery hero and the Greek struggle for independence. It is said that Byron walked inertly. This portrait of the man was simply inert. <br /> <br /> I looked for two and a half hours, waiting for something to spark in my life. Nor a moan, not even a flash. It was complete boredom, if not boredom, from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> Considering that no one will ever improve the Avon bard, I also believe that Byron's poetry is oversensitive and my mind should be thrown on the back wall, and this drama of his life should be treated the same. <br /> <br /> I think the BBC lost its value with it
