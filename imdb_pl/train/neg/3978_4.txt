When in Rome there is a definite improvement in reaching the goal. I found there too predictable, elaborate and slow, and to this day I still consider it to be the worst Olsen twins. However, when When In Rome is not a scary movie, it is not great either. If I had to summarize it in one word, I would say it is possible. It is fun for teenagers, but I think that adults will not find much to do. <br /> <br /> When in Rome he has his good side. Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen are actually quite decent actresses, certainly very nice. I admit when I was 10, I really liked them, and generally I still like them. And I liked some of their films, such as Passport to Paris and New York Minute. Returning to the goal, both girls do not do it wrong, in fact they are very attractive. Plus, their costumes are worth dying, and the scenery of Rome is breathtaking. The soundtrack is also not half evil. <br /> <br /> However, where the movie is brought, it is in the plot and scenario. The script is mostly stereotypical and contains deja vu hints. The plot, like most of Mary Kate's and Ashley's films, is very predictable, and anyone who is familiar with any other work of Olsen's twins will find in it some non-original elements. Most of the characters are as thin as a cardboard box and you do not learn much about them, and sometimes the pace is uneven. Unfortunately, the breathtaking scenery is spoiled by a rather poor work with a camera that looked constantly pushed. <br /> <br /> In total, it has its advantages, and you can definitely watch them. However, for my taste it is harmless and predictable teenage fluff. 4/10 Bethany Cox
