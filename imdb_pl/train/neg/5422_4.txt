What "noise" does not do makes us understand its character. Tim Robbins plays an obsessive New Yorker who can no longer cope with the intrusive noise of the city, especially car alarms. This is a strange idea for a movie that has more or less the same creativity as "Wish Death". He is smart in points; especially the scene in which our hero tries to read Hagel: "I'm too stupid to understand this." Read and re-read the paragraph with confusion, we read it and do not understand. Throughout the film there are constant disturbances of alarms and sounds of the city. Although it does not help much, it helps us to understand our hero, who allows him to ruin his marriage and distract himself from intrigue instead of delving into his personality. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is too oblivious to notice its own sound problems, cheesy editing and visible microphones. No, "noise" is not bad. William Hurt is at least colorful. At least the end does not fall flat. In general, it leads to a home logistic point that you probably have not thought about. At least I did not have one. Though a total of ninety minutes, it could not have ended earlier. This story stretched and seemed lost as soon as it began. <br /> <br /> This is another movie that you can see at the film festival, but probably will not be picked up for distribution. Check it out on a DVD if you're really partial to someone involved in the project. Otherwise, skip this.
