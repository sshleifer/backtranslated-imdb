This movie comes straight from the dark dungeon of Full Moon Entertainment. This production company gained fame and fortune in the first half of the 90s, producing horribly bad and bad horror movies. The most known disasters in their ouvre are "Subspecies", "Seedpeople" and "Trancers". None of them is recommended, or actually it is not Dr. Mordrid. Hyperactive director Charles Band came to the right company for his film. Dr. Mordrid is incredibly stupid and tacky and almost completely devoid of humor. I only saw it because Jeffrey Combs plays in it. I've learned that it can have several disadvantages if you're a fan of it. For every good movie it seems that he made 5 worse. In any case, history concerns the battle between two ancient sorcerers. One good who has been here for 150 years to protect people (Jeffrey as Dr.Mordrid) and one wicked called Kabal. He wants to destroy every form of human life for some reason that I've already forgotten. Combs receives instructions from the mentor. This "guy" only exists with a pair of eyes in space. It's very cheesy! Every once in a while a blinding lightflash appears on the screen, but it is the only form of special effects that this film has. The whole thing is just whining and tormenting, and when the two wizards finally face each other, it will end before you know it ... I would expect that the wicked wizard would at least fight off a little, but not ... .. In some scenes you can really detect originality and creativity (like Jeffrey's lecture on the moon's influence on criminals), and if you really pay attention, you can even find very small, but pretty aspects (like a crow named Edgar Allen), but in general, it is a terrible waste of time and energy. I am a big fan of Jeffrey and maybe he is a superhero in my eyes ... but he certainly does not have to impose a stupid maillot.
