Can anyone make good CGI movies in addition to Pixar? Really, the animation looked outdated by 2006 standards and even by Toy Story standards from 1995. Or maybe they spent their entire budget on Hugh Jackman. Regardless of their reasoning, the story really was useless. <br /> <br /> Somehow Hugh Jackman is a rat - a rat lowered in the toilet. Yes, I know, it seems stereotypical. But then the channel imitated London's ways - to some extent. Throw a promise of jewels (????) and a bad (??) frog, and you will get a pathetic attempt at entertainment. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that something has amused me. Maybe connection to the movie? Or maybe a relationship of rats forever? But nothing happened. He had talent but he exploded. RE-
