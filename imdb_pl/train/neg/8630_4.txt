I know that there are other things in this episode, except what I'm going to discuss, and I really think it has some advantages; for example, the fact that after receiving a very negative opinion about Jin from watching Sun's retrospection in "House of the Rising Sun", we can see the Jin website and get a new, more balanced understanding of his life. <br /> <br /> But in this story is such an element that made me feel so uncomfortable that it significantly weakened my satisfaction with the whole episode. At the moment, in the scene in which Jin appeared with blood on his hands and shirt, it was suggested that Sun's father was someone who was enriched by suspicious, illegal methods. I thought maybe he was the boss of the mafia; mobs operate in Korea, as in almost every other country in the world, so it was a reasonable option. However, in this episode, we find out that Sun's father is in fact the head of a Korean automotive corporation, and what Jin did was physically attacked a government official (who was about to be murdered) on his behalf. <br /> <br /> I can be particularly irritable because I happen to work in the automotive industry, but I would say that SPECTACULARLY is offensive and racist, to even suggest that things like that are happening in Korea; that big, serious companies like Hyundai or Kia (which must be a model for this fictitious car company, because they are the only ones that actually exist), operate based on these mafia-like methods, instead of any normal automotive company in the West. It is unbelievable for me that writers would like to write something like this in this story and that there was no confusion in Korea. I feel like a foreign "Buy American!" Propaganda, depicting foreign car companies as criminal, unreliable costumes from the third world.
