This film depicts Ben Chaplin as a bored bank employee in England who orders a bride from Russia, receives a mail from Nicole Kidman and gets more than he expected when the surprise is not what it seems. The story is quite predictable, and Chaplin is getting too involved so much that it becomes a bit strange. Kidman is actually quite good in this role, thanks to which her character is the only interesting thing in this film. GRADE: C
