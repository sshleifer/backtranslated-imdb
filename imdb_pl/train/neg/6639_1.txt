It is very sad that Lucian Pintilie does not stop making movies. Getting worse. Niki and Flo (2003) is a depressing blow to the camera. It is a pity that from many films that are produced every year in Romania, the worst of them can be sent abroad (eg the Chicago International Film Festival). This movie without a story, acting or script is a waste of time and money. Score: 0.02 out of 10.
