A scary movie, as everyone said. What made me laugh was the appearance of Scott McNealy in the episode, which rewarded one of the murdered programmers in front of the wall of the SUN logo. McNealy is the CEO of SUN Microsystem, a company that virtually defines itself through its hatred for Microsoft. They played a key role in filing antitrust complaints against Microsoft. So were they stupid enough to think that this bad film would add fuel to this fire? <br /> <br /> There is no public record I see the SUN involvement, but the creators of the film clearly know Scott McNealy. An interesting mystery.
