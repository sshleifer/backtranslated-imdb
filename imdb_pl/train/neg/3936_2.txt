Wow. I thought it might be bland, but it was even worse than I imagined! Sometimes I like to watch a good movie about a "car crash": those that are so bad that you can not look away because you want to see how bad they can get. This is really the only reason why I can leave the TV - a morbid fascination. It's not just acting, which was just average, or slightly worse than you would expect from this cast, but the premise and story that should never have been to see the light of day. Also this script calls a moan. When it comes to cinematography, has anyone noticed that they used the segue device to draw curtains, as in a TV program from the 1950s ... but without irony? At first, I thought they had to joke, but the film takes it too seriously to use it in a brazen manner. Do not even ask me about the score ... the only point is the last song of Morcheeba. I think they wanted to leave something for 8 dollars ... I'm glad I saw it on TV !!!!! Just stupid! I wonder if that's why Timothy Hutton has had problems finding a job recently? I think that if you do not expect a lot and want to watch a mindless thriller, it would be better to spend the evening cutting your toenails, which is why it deserves 2.
