OK, I rarely complain about something that I got FOR FREE. So I think that this movie has pushed me beyond this limit. I saw it at the Hollywood Cemetery for free and very disappointed. The question of one of the viewers directed to the director for the use of American references in the same way as "props" instead of better interwoven into the film, basically says everything that failed in this film. <br /> <br /> NATIVE American REFERENCES --- References to Native Americans were really out of place and invented. It is obvious that this director and writer tried to face an arena in which they had never played before. They should stick to the old saying "write something that you know." IF they are actually oriented at this, they certainly did not show up on the film or the beauty of this unique culture was not given to proper justice. <br /> <br /> Clich√©s and ON THE NOSE --- I agreed to see this movie based on the fact that it was an independent film. So I stayed with higher expectations. "Little Miss Sunshine" was indie and she saw it before it became so popular. Before it even came out, I'm crazy about how it will be a hit. I could not say the same about the "Expiration Date". "Sunshine" led us to stereotypical incidents, but the filmmakers were so clever in their approach that the result will lead us in a different direction, avoiding the trap of being a "banality". This film, on the other hand, did not have the ability to not fall into the trap, because it was already TRAPPED from the very beginning. Mommy's psycho, Hendrix's couple, etc. <br /> <br /> I do not like to say that, but the best and wise movie that I saw this year are both indie. "Little Miss Sunshine" is the best, and this movie is the worst. I would like to be able to say differently. <br /> <br /> But I congratulate the filmmakers that they left their family members so well in the cemetery.
