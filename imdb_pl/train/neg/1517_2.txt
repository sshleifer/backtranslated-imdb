In the title, I write that the story is ridiculous. I will discuss below and say why, in my humble opinion, it is ruining this film. <br /> <br /> Gere and the Danes are doing their job, and although it's not their best job, it's pretty OK. However, the rest of the cast does a really bad job. Remember that it is not entirely the fault of the actors. The problem is that Gere and the Danes are the only ones who have heroes who have even the smallest room in the movie to really give any depth. All other characters have too little space in the film to create any depth, or the character is such a clich√© that it does not matter how hard the actors try. <br /> <br /> The director has a little Se7en, but just looking in the direction, I think he's doing a good job. <br /> <br /> But history. This is a type of script that is bad in two ways. First of all, this is a bad movie script. The characters are shallow (except for the characters Gere and the Danes), villains are stereotypes, and the actions of the heroes are completely unbelievable. In addition, writers must have a program in which they want to restore our views and ethics for a hundred years. It's a kind of movie that says some criminals are still criminals, regardless of the fact that they paid the price that society gave them. It's also a kind of movie that says, but only between the lines, that any form of sexual deviance should be punished without trial, judge or jury. And of course, according to the film, everything that is not sex in the missionary position by marriage is a sexual deviation. <br /> <br /> So if you go to film school and need an example of a bad script or if you write scripts yourself and want to increase your ego. Look at this. I recommend a different movie for everyone else.
