I saw every episode of this spin-off. I thought that the first season is a decent effort, considering the expectations for such success as Gray's Anatomy. So I continued watching. I'm afraid that the second season lacks charm, chemistry and, more importantly, the drama of his predecessor, Gray Anatomy. Relations seem to be invented, and acting is so-so. The letter lacks intelligence and comedy tips visible in GA. There is evidence that the formula, but does not feel formal and invented, unfortunately PP is not. I loved the presence of Kate Walsh in GA. I'm afraid that Kate Walsh's life in LA is not just interesting.
