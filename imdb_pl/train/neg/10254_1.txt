Spoilery <br /> <br /> Wow, END OF THE WORLD is a unique cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> Here's the full story: the scientist receives news from space (a la INDEPENDENCE DAY). News say that a huge disaster will follow soon, and the scientist will later hear on the radio that there has been a tremendous earthquake in China. He begins to think that messages have something to do with catastrophies around the world, so he tries to find out who receives messages (and who sends messages in space). He and his wife eventually discover that the messages come from the monastery. They visit it. Everything looks normal, including a priest played by bored Christopher Lee. But the scientist is adamant and really believes that messages come and go to this monastery. So he and his wife secretly return to the monastery, where they are caught snooping by strangers, dressed up as priests and nuns. They are kept against their will, and the spaceman played by Lee forces the scientist to get something they need to return to their planet. When an alien gets a special element, all strangers go one by one to their home planet in some cheap-looking transporter. Lee, being the last alien to the left, informs the pair that the earth will be destroyed because of some hokey alien decision. Lee walks into the transporter and is gone. The couple, looking at monitors showing video material depicting natural disasters occurring all over the world, decides to follow strangers. Because the land is doomed to death, the couple do not see the sense of being left behind, so they enter the transporter and disappear. The last shot of the film is the papier mache, exploding planet earth. End. <br /> <br /> That's it. <br /> <br /> I've never seen such a boring movie in my life. This is the most disappointing movie I've ever experienced. The scientist and his wife are the two worst heroes or heroes ever exposed to the screen. They do not care. They see catastrophes on the monitors and decide "what the heck does anyone need anyway?" They do not even try to stop them or do something to improve the situation. This kind of story could work if the movie had an overwhelming sense of doom on everything, but the action and the atmosphere do not exist. The actors and people standing behind this boring movie go through their steps so much that you can almost feel when they hit the cards when they get off and go back to work. I did not expect much from this movie because it is the production of the Charles Band, but I did not expect it to be so bad. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lee was once asked what was his worst movie he ever did and mentioned the invasion of STARSHIP. Well, I'm sorry, Chris, but STARSHIP INVASIONS was really funny. STARSHIP INVASIONS is scary, but terribly funny. THE END OF THE WORLD IS MUCH, MUCH, MUCH WORST: it is beyond boring and indifferent, without any entertainment value.
