ALIEN LOVE (This movie is known in the UK) is a very strange movie. I do not mean that it is an esoteric movie in the style of art house in the style of Peter Greenaway or Derek Jarman, I mean TVM with curses, sex, really good T & A, bad script and very retro style. You can imagine someone like John Hughes, who directs it ten years earlier, but of course he would break T & A <br /> <br /> Returning to the wrong scenario, one of the problems is that several characters have every kind of motivation, especially Amanda. Why is he raising Connie in the bar? That she could get to know a stranger? Do you see what I mean about retro? ET, SHORT CIRCUIT and many other films from the mid-1980s had this type of story, most of which was more defined and convincing than the one seen here. The story still follows the ill-defined, unconvincing and illogical path <br /> <br /> It means that I think that ALIEN LOVE is for viewing, not just for the T & A on the display. As a sci-fi comedy, sex is much better than FLESH GORDON and EARTH GIRLS ARE EASY
