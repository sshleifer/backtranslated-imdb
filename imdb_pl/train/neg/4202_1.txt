... Is something missing? "Unexpected changes to the story"? "The plot revolves with subversive joy"? do these viewers watch the same Arquette vehicle that I gave up (in the now obvious (un) conscious attack of sadomasochism) ... I just joined this site to make sure nobody else is renting this stinker. ... this movie was embarrassment for every person involved ... a quick question: did Sir Stevie read the script before giving Kate C.? if so, it must be the same Spielberg that illuminated "Howard the duck" ... do not give me this, "it was a hit game" crap - I'm guessing Mssr. Reddin is not too happy ... the DVD cover promised "surprising corners" and "a crazy story ..." History! Story ?? It's such nonsense that old Bobby McKee and his wandering structural team sound like geniuses ... Sundance? Berlin? Toronto ?? I have a home recording of my cat fart that arouses more interest than the negatively dimensional representation of Arquette about tormented loss ... and talking about deux ex machina for Mr. Stanley T.; thank God, he thought at the last moment that Dave would call the police! and thank you Shiva that the cops just caught the real killer ... what !!! until the loans I still had to wait to be a grift against Arquette and his "hidden millions" ... no, Mrs. Spielberg, you will not run away unscathed: what the hell was this kitchen scene with "the athlete's foot in my crotch" gag ??? whether you are worse or "fair"? I do not know ... hey film lovers: why do not you do this hit night and you do not lend it together with "girl in jersey" and "white chicks", and then you commit a sepuk (or it's seppuka) ... and take E. Dunsky with you ....
