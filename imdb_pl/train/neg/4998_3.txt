this one of the best stars actually shows that I've ever seen. we see concerts that we can see in Britney's life, I love five episodes. I've always been surprised by Britney and the themes of the show, I think some people do not watch the show how he can be a great person. she is really funny, very gentle and loves her fans, and we see him love his job. I just do not give 10, because k-fed he is a real jerk that Britney does not like at all. I'm doing the second season of this amazing show because it shows some people how Britney really is. Go Britney with your best and you will never leave our hearts.
