If you like movies like American Pie, Road Trip and Van Wilder; at all costs avoid this cinema refusal. It is an unbridled, exciting, bland waste of resources that should never be discussed loudly; much less registered and sold to unsuspecting consumers. Easily the worst movie I've seen in the last 18 months; a disgusting mind for the entire 86 minutes of his action. If it were much longer, I would not be able to write this review without using profanity. Watch out for being warned!
