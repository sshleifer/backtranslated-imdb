Watching it last night, it amazed me that Fox spent so much money on it and gained little from the investment. It's a kind of disaster you need to believe in. <br /> <br /> I'm sure Raquel Welch dusted the shelf over the fireplace on the first morning of filming to prepare a place for an Oscar, he would surely have won the bold movie. Oops. It did not happen that way. <br /> <br /> The incidents on the set were printed in detail by Rex Reed, which helped the movie gain its reputation before it was released. When it was finally released, there was no ordinary advertising circus. If I remember correctly, he opened up in Houston and neighboring theaters and never played in any of the big places. <br /> <br /> I blamed most of the director Michael Sarne, who was hot after referral (not all so good) JOANNA, a movie about music about young people in swinging fashion in London. <br /> <br /> If I remember correctly, Fox ended up shooting him and combining the film together as best they could. Therefore, the scenes take place without a specific sequence, and the characters appear and disappear. The impressive cast (Kathleen Freeman, Jim Backus, John Carradine, Andy Devine and others) has nothing to do. <br /> <br /> To extend it to the length of the plot, there are many clips from Fox movies with stars like Carmen Miranda (in amazing materials from THE GANG'S ALL HERE) and Laurel and Hardy who never dreamed they would play in the film with the grade X. <br /> <br /> The rating of X is caused by sporadic languages ​​such as sexual perversions; however, none of the characters seems to be enjoying themselves. Maybe someone involved in the movie had a distorted Puritan sensibility and came to the conclusion that if they make these things unpleasant, they will not misuse them. <br /> <br /> It was one of the "young" paintings that almost went bankrupt Hollywood in the 70's. One of the writers joked that EASY RIDER (made for a change of pocket) was the most expensive film ever made, because after it followed many movies that tried and failed in the worst way to duplicate his success. Sixty, once respected directors, such as Stanley Kramer and Otto Preminger, created films such as RPM and SKIDOO, trying to attract a young audience. White directors and writers tried to make films to attract a black audience. These films are closed somewhere in the vault, and two names and many others from this genre have never, as far as I know, been on the home video or cable. It's the deep, dark secret of the studio. <br /> <br /> Raquel Welch's performance is very good in all of this. With the right direction and script she could play in the type of sassy liberated women, in which Rosiland Russel and Barbara Stanwyck specialized. It looks great and has amazing costumes. Mae West is the liveliest seventy actress I've ever seen. On the one hand, it is painful to watch her attempt to capture the glory of past years, but I am sure that she needed money. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a large budget of the X-rating movie from this era check BEYOND THE VALLEY OF DOLLS (also from Fox), because it is not taken seriously. They are crazy children playing with equipment in a large studio. MYRA BRECKINRIDGE is trying to say something. There was no one who would like to listen.
