Now I understand. The title refers to the immediate reaction of each viewer after 68 minutes of mental torture. Trying to be too frightening, without good dialogue, even fear makes the Screaming Skull more like a Snoring. Although the mansion and property set in black and white give the film a dark tone, but that's all. The only scary thing about this flop is that people actually made money on it! Do you remember the coffin guarantee at the beginning? This can be the funniest thing I've ever seen on the screen. The sad thing is that the viewers probably hoped that director Alex Nichol was put in a coffin by force, nailed and buried alive for his poor effort. Jenny, placed in this unfortunate frightening situation, never gets any sympathy with a woman whose fear is blamed for a haunting cranial vessel. Besides, her husband, John, becomes a condescending, careless speaker, but it does not work, and he proves how hard he is by slapping a helpless cripple! Ah, Mickey, before you could order the restraining of real estate supervisors like him. This guy's approach is not very good, maybe too much glue to the plane. Still, despite his strange personality, Mickey is probably the only good thing about this movie, providing a light sense of entertainment, and I do not have enough of a guy saying "It was Mary!". and burial in pots in a greenhouse.
