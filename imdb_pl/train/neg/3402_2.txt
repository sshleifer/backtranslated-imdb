This is why Jane Show will not work. Once again, Canadian producers and writers can not create a sitcom without giving it another type of spin.

Characters are two-dimensional, and feature lines are on the top: forklift races ??? Give me a terrifying break. Here is a small advice for the authors of the series: Do not write funny situations, find fun situations. And remember, you must be born with a sense of humor to write really funny things, and not just be an improvising monkey.
