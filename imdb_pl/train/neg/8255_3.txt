At least it is not full of senseless violence or fluff. Nor is it too full of thought or a smooth plot. This story had a certain potential, but the director apparently lost his place in green. History is chaotic and goes in strange directions <br /> <br />, without a conclusion. I also do not believe that the director spent a lot of time around the golf club. Some of the performances are absurd. Not addictive.
