Tony Scott was never a very good director, but every movie that he made after "Crimson Tide" seems to bring him a step closer to being the worst, the worst action today (Michael Bay may belong to the same category, but at least his big, stupid , delusional epic play on some originally perverse level). And like other Hollywood-like bioparts (such as "De-Lovely" and "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"), describing the life of pretentious, overrated or even shallow ciphers, given the aura of "mystique" by society that develops into juicy details behind the scenes, "Domino" is a film that starts with a small potential, and casts this infinite amount before a sixty-minute sign. With an extended duration of 128 minutes, the film seems twice as long and spends time with heroes in the unbearably superficial and forgetful (in contrast to the supervisor of the "Attraction rule", Scott's attempts to color the proceedings with irony through Domino's satisfaction, the self-aware rich reader only draws attention to the mindlessness of the hammer in the film becomes an act that only masochists can find pleasant. "History: Domino Harvey (Keira Knightley, in such a tight performance as shallow as her great look) is broken, has a rather shallow lifestyle rich and famous in Los Angeles and accosts the rough bounty hunter Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramirez to learn more exciting trading, along the way there are double crosses, shooting, media attention (courtesy of Christopher Walken calling in his trademark) and funny romance tips. together in segments that are rare lasting more than a few seconds, increasing the resolution to make the movie a nightmarish neon nightmare that is really unpleasant to watch - if Scott would give him a chance to shake the image, drop him or distort him in some way; but all this cheesy stylistic overload overwhelms what has a small plot, the characteristics and tension that the film has (not to mention his, ehm, the "entertainment" value). Most of the characters seem either contemptible, either stereotypical, often both (watch the unbearable, several-minute segment in which the African American introduces a new list of racial categories on "Jerry Springer"), and I wanted everyone to get the end of the "tails" of our hero's coin to end. "Domino" is a complete, unfettered junk - no matter how much Scott was interested, who wanted to inspire his audience, he plunged into the sea of ​​migraine neon tension in a few minutes.
