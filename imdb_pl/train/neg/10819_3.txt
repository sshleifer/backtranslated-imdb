I agree with one of the other authors of comments about good history and good actors, but unmatched, and I would also say that I hurried up. It's been around 24 years since I read the book like at school. But I felt that you need to know Jane Eyre's story while watching this because the bits are skipped and that's why it does not make sense. For example, Jane and Mr. Rochester hardly speak and suddenly marry !!! Actors do not have time to inform the audience about how their character feels in each of these things. The actors are good, but they do not have enough time to do this story. I'm sorry to say, but I did not like this version. The 1970 version with Susanna York and George C Scott would be my favorite Jane Eyre movie. And Timothy Dalton in 2 main roles. I love him so much that I watch him regularly. There is a short version available, which applies to 225 minutes or the full version for 330 minutes.
