When this game was first shown by the BBC over 30 years ago, it would be something completely different at the time. So some people would find it quite scary and maybe they were impressed with special effects? <br /> <br /> Looking at art these days, it does not seem to be so scary, even the special effects can leave much to be desired. <br /> <br /> Will the train really be able to pass the RED LIGHT to the dark tunnel? I do not think ...... but if you re-watch this game, you'll notice that the first train that enters the tunnel runs straight through the RED LIGHT! (maybe it was in Dickens' time)? <br /> <br /> You will also notice that the path that leads down to the signal area is very steep and in bad condition. Certainly there would be a series of appropriate steps with the handrails so that the Signal could climb up or down. (I can not miss such things) <br /> <br /> I will not take anything from acting, both Denholm Elliott (signalman) and Bernard Lloyd (the traveler) gave great performances. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what's going on ...... I mean the spirit of the traveler or something? Does anyone really fully understand this confusing story ?? (maybe I'm the only one who does not do it) ??? <br /> <br /> ReasumujÄ…c ..... <br /> <br /> The whole performance has a great atmosphere. character. Nowadays, he suffers from the fact that he is not that frightening and a little, if not very, confusing, and has quite unusual signaling practices .... <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading my review.
