My family and I showed Underdog yesterday. And as bad as Underdog (my four-year-old loved it), Hot Rod makes it look like material deserving of an Oscar. The only thing that could save the movie was that Evel himself went out of retirement to hit Samberg in the face for making this movie. I admit, however, that the soundtrack was good. I was not sure if the film was set in the 80s, but most of the music comes from Europe? Who knows. If I were you, I would make a pass. And just stay at home and watch the test pattern at the local TV station. Or if you're dead, watching it, people under the influence can enjoy it.
