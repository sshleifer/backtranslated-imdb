Whoever wrote the "nice" post about it had to be a friend of these guys. This is bad even in backyard wrestling. In fact, it is not even supplies in the yard, there are a few men hitting the trampoline. Each guy has about 45 kg of wet weight and there's not a single ounce of entertainment. These are just a few bored children who even give the shipyards a bad name if possible. If you want to see fun backyard wrestling, choose Backyard Wrestling A Pleasure for Pain. Occurs in the 2 biggest names in BYW, MDogg20 and Josh Prohibition. These guys are good. In fact, they went from the shipyard and were professionally trained as "real" professional wrestlers. They went legally and became better. I recommend checking out these two guys. MDogg is crazy. So do not waste time or cash on this bad DVD, there are "better" movies from the yard.
