Ok ... it seems that so far only the Barman fans have commented on this movie - it's time to counterpoint. Watch out, this record is * LONG *. <br /> <br /> For those who do not know (mainly non-Belgians): Tom Barman, the director of this film, is the frontman of dEUS, one of the more well-known rock bands from the late 90s here in Belgium. Basically, they created some very risky and innovative albums and quickly became famous on a national scale. Then the ego started to ache, and the band disintegrated substantially, and the bartender and a few others remained on the dEUS-monicker albums. As it always is in such cases, the error after the failure was a lot of drunk and less interesting than the original. They tried to make an international break thanks to their album "The Ideal Crash" in 1999, presenting a much diluted form of their earlier style of writing songs. They failed. However, the ego was still large enough, it seems: large enough for the Bartender to consider himself a sufficient artist to try films. <br /> <br /> Often, these types of things are VERY big mistake, and this film does not make an exception. And Bartender clearly followed * art * for this one, another very big mistake. First of all, he is a musician, not a film director. Secondly, DUSUS plays best in it and provokes music, but it never comes close to what I think is * art *. It shows. <br /> <br /> So what is this movie about? Basically, it tells the story of a group of totally uninteresting people doing equally uninteresting things on a completely uninteresting Friday in Antwerp, as even more uninteresting things happen to them in the act of being uninteresting. The heroes are shallow, the plot is completely pointless, and the film simply has no other beneficial features to compensate for these shortcomings. Humor? The whole movie made me smile (a bit) about 3 times and actually I was able to provoke a single 5-second laugh (not quite loud). Mood? The film simply does not show any emotions or feelings. Puzzle? Well, (* MINOR SPOILER *) the idea of ​​"wind-man", inspiring the name of the film, is as fascinating as pizza with banana pepper - not too, and was made a thousand times before (everyone remembers Johnny Destiny - one of the worst performances of Tarantino in the hitherto film (* END MINOR SPOILER *). Well, his * artistic *, so do not expect any real action that would make up for all the previous ones. In other words, except for a few smiles, I was bored with my shorts. <br /> <br /> So what's left? Well, the soundtrack is quite good, although it suffers from some of the same problems that other OSTs have recently shown: first, it makes the movie look like nothing more than an ad on a CD. Second, it makes an impression that the bartender is trying to hide the weaknesses and lack of emotional content in the film for the quality of the songs that just do not work. In the end, it makes the movie look like an illustration And unfortunately, this is Barmans' own contribution to the soundtrack that attracts the most attention, although it is the weakest part of the whole soundtrack, if I like it. In total, he shows that Bartender knows more about music than about movies. Working with the camera is fine, but not everything, which will make you scream for joy. <br /> <br /> The only thing in this movie that watched me was the vision factor. Because I come from Antwerp, it was nice to play a kind of "guessing". I would not consider this a quality. <br /> <br /> In total another chance to lose for the Flemmish movie. I still notice that recently the best French films come from the French part of the country. This is mainly because they have at least something to say and can say it in a way that is both sharp and emotional (the Daerden brothers come to mind). Maybe filmmakers from the Flemmish art home should try it too.
