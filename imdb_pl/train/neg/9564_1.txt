Some people think it was the worst movie they've ever seen, and I understand where they come from, but I really did see it worse. <br /> <br /> Having said that, the movies that I can remember (those I did not block) that were worse than they were, were so bad that all the senses associated with watching the movie hurt physically. Movies that are worse than war games 2 are those that make you want to pick your eyes or stab sharp objects in your ears to stop you from another piece of your soul being torn out by horrors. <Br /> <br /> War Games: Dead Code is not so bad, but it is quite close. Yes, I was a fan of the original, but I did not expect miracles from this. Let's face it, the original was not really a great movie at all, it was basically just a movie romance of a teenager from the 80's with some appetite. because something bad, but it could pull me by the strings. Was it too much? Is it really impossible to do better than original war games, even for the straight to video version? Well, apparently it was too much to ask. Stay away from this movie. At first it's just bad, like "Oh yeah, it's bad, but I'm happy, maybe the end will be good like the original." And then it's getting worse, and by the end, trust me, you'll want me not to see this movie.
