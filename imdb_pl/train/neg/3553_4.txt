"The Incubus" is a mixture of a good (interesting murder mystery), evil (disconnected script, messy resolution, poorly executed attack scenes) and strange (strong incestuous undertones, strangely sleepy and stiff performance of John Cassavetes - was this character really meant to be "wacko" ?). This is not as offensive as it is believed, but it is also not particularly successful. (* 1/2)
