Well, I hated knocked out, I despised a 40-year-old virgin, and this little gem is a worthless piece of garbage film. do yourself a favor and skip it. I admit that I do not like the actors in this film and after my 18-year-old son showed me a DVD cover, I had the impression that "I do not like this film", but I stubbornly decided to try it out. <br /> <br /> about two minutes into the movie I turned it off, I was so offended. it's just disgusting. any decent person would be offended by the dirt in this movie. call me old-fashioned, but putting a hand covered with pussy juice in the face of a friend so that he knows that "you have a little bit" is in my opinion ok. yes, this rotten movie begins and I can only imagine that it gets worse from there. another real winner for Mr. Rudd. I bet he is proud as a blow. imagine if you could only get worthless roles like him, would you stay in movies? despite the remuneration, I would not do it. <br /> <br /> I should have known better; next time I will be.
