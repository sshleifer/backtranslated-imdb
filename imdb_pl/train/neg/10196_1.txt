As a poker enthusiast, I was looking forward to seeing this movie - especially since Scotty Nyugen was in it. <br /> <br /> Essentially, Scotty Nyugens' short spots in this movie are all that's waiting for it. > <br /> The characters are unlike yourself and annoying, the soundtrack is awful and the plot, well, there is not one. <br /> <br /> To be honest, my head hurts and I read the bar code number on the DVD box after twenty minutes I was bored. Actually, Nyugen was in this movie, otherwise I would not have wasted $ 16 buying it on eBay. <br /> <br /> Take it away from me - UNIKAJ like 7 2 offsuit !!! Horrible. :(
