Claustrophobic camera angles that do not help the film: too long shots of only the face, which most often feel the lack of the bottom half of the movie (that the screen is cut off), because it seems that there are important activities on, but you can not see them. In any case, there is too much confusion in the film, so these viewing angles worsen the situation and do not contribute to artistic visual effects. <br /> <br /> I like intricately made films and unconventional camera work. I can handle deep and free movies. But he is trying too hard to be something clever and I do not succeed in painfully. <br /> <br /> Nothing to associate with any character because they are not well developed. To develop characters, you need more than just long shots of the face, at least with this set of scenario + director + actors. <br /> <br /> I wonder if some of the not-so-good actions result from the script and the director or because of the actors. <br /> <br /> I will be away from films both written and directed by Le You for sure in the future. <br /> <br /> What an annoying movie even for someone who would be interested in this part of the story, and for someone who has spent time in Shanghai.
