Stalker is right! The girl sees a guy, the girl wants a guy, the girl invents mundane ways of bumping into him, the girl does not leave him alone, the girl pretends to be patient, the girl can not stop talking about him, the girl pretends that she loves another guy (or two), does not pay her attention because it is annoying, STILL girl will not leave him alone. Played well, Drake's character could be charming, but she is totally, completely inexorable in pursuit of Cary Grant's character, her friend is boring, and unfortunately, Drake's attempt to "play with a screwdriver" comes out "disturbingly insane. "Grant is himself, as usual, which is fine for Cary, but it's so close to the performance I saw in him. The direction is colorless, and the dialog box is simply blurred. <br /> <br /> The Screwball comedy is very difficult to perform successfully, and when it fails, as in this smoky task, it simply stinks. What's worse, Drake spends the whole film in need of a large amount of Valium and an embarrassing order. It destroys all the humor that can be found in this dryer than the mummy's relic.
