This is a really stupid movie in a genre typical of the 1980s: the action comedy. Conceptwise is reminiscent of Rush Hour, but it is completely lacking in action, laughter and chemistry between the main characters of this film. Let me know that I like Jay Leno as a stand-up and talk show host, but he just can not work. He is terrible when he tries to work hard - he barely manages to ignore this characteristic expression when speaking his one-color, which, by the way, is not too funny. And seeing him running (even then) is not a pleasant sight. In addition, I have the impression that Pat Morita - at least according to today's standards - does not give a very correct political image of the Japanese. Do not even start with this story. I give him 2 out of 10.
