I only saw the movie once, and that was enough for me. The film has a very small plot and seems to be nothing but continuous scenes of psycho-sadistic violence and very few others. I wanted to see this movie because it played Zoe Trilling on the second "Night of The Demons"; and I wanted to see him play normal. Unfortunately, the Tobe Hooper script barely starts and is nowhere to be found, because Robert Englund dominates the film and experiences the scenery and story. Zoe, I know where you are now; hiding from this movie!
