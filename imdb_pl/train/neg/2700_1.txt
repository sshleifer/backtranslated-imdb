Despite, or perhaps partly due to clever use of music to emphasize the motivation and ideology of each of the main characters, there are stereotypes, and in this not very subtle cinematographic scenario you can see the characteristics and characteristics. <br /> <br /> You can get the impression that John Singleton played in post-structuralist literary theory, because it was the taste of the day, and "Higher learning" was a tendentious result. The climax of the film is the "peace" rally, in which the symbols of the "free love" movement from the 1960s are restored to what is more like "Take Back The Night" with live, conscious musical identities towed on a rope. Perhaps in his original revisionism the director tried to confirm that the identity policy is a new Vietnam? Ooh, like Adrienne Rich of him and Remy shooting the crowd is a nice touch if you're kind of like Rich's political attitude. <br /> <br /> I would like to give this film negative stars. I can only recommend it to people interested in the 90s as a story, a time when radical feminists brought the academic triad of race, class and gender to popular culture and declared human hatred a "real and honorable POLITICAL option". Where is Camille Paglia when you need her?
