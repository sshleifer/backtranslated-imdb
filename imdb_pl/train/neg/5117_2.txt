I want to say first that I am a Christian (and that I work in the film and television industry), so I understand what it's like to work on a full-length film, so props for filmmakers in this area. I am for positive, uplifting messages, if they are faithful to the nature of life (that it is a fallen world and that things do not always work ... even for the followers of Christ). I am glad that others have such overwhelmingly positive reactions to the overt Christian message; for me, it was just that the execution was where the movie fell on my face. The film lives and dies in its history, and here you have one-dimensional stereotypes, exposure, abundance and spontaneous changes in the behavior of characters that are at least inexplicable. I believe that the film does not have to draw you into the message to give it a point. I'm sure the Kendrick brothers. it will improve over time and their methods of telling stories will also be. Maybe they could shoot the scenario of another person as their next project. <br /> <br /> * Sports films are not my first love but good (Hoosiers, Field of Dreams, etc.). They can inspire in many ways. If you're interested in a PG rated movie that inspires, take a look at Steven Soderbergh's "King of the Hill". The whole truth is God's truth ...
