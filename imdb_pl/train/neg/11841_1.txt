What happened to Peter Bogdanovich? Once a brilliant director, a navy coat ... now scratching the bottom ... Is this the same man who directed "The Last Picture Show"? Here he takes a somewhat interesting (albeit far-reaching) premise and turns it into a chewing gum that loses flavor when you take the first bite ... Dunst is not bad, but Izzard is unsuccessful as Chaplin and all other actors are cast for their "look", not because they were right. Detriment. I will go again to rent a "Paper Moon".
