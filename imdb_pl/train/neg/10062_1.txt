Nintendo !!! TY #% $ @ ERS !!! How could you do this to me? I can not believe it ... this movie is actually worse than the first one. I went to see my brother in the theater because my mother forced me to sign ... oh God ... where do I even start? The SUCKED story. The voice DRESS works. SUCKED animation. The end is REALLY DRESS. If you liked this movie, THIS FOR SUCCESS. And for Futuramafan1987, who said it's the biggest movie ever, you're A TOOL, NORMAL AND SIMPLE. This is not a movie for anyone but ten Game Boys who think that Pikachu is God. I'm still crying today, thinking about the terrible fate of the movie ... and then it was Pikachu's Adventure ... do not even start me from this terrible mess of the movie. To tell the truth, this is one of the most boring experiences of my life. Do not watch it at all costs. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Exit, find every copy of this movie that you can and record. Burn them all, and then go to rent a GOOD movie, like Aliens ... or Bowling For Columbine ... or even Back to the Future!
