Jamie Foxx is my favorite comedian. I feel, however, that he sold out to get his first big role in the budget. Foxx follows in the footsteps of people like Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dave Chapple, who have all seen that their talents are wasting stereotypical producers who think that black men who commit quite a crime are a funny concept (see Money Talks, Blue Streak) . <br /> <br /> Okay, I laugh a few times and admitted to all these comics that they're still in fun roles, but I'd like to see those guys play ala Marlon Wayans in the movie Requiem to a Dream. Tommy Davidson and Damon Wayans are making appearances in Spike Lee Bamboozled's satire.
