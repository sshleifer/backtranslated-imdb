Summary: Doctor Markov has developed a new theory on how to generate energy, knowledge that can disrupt the world's balance. He retains his coded and secret knowledge and desperately wants to get out of the Soviet Union. KGB on the other hand desperately wants new technology. So they run the schema. While trying to save Markov, the KGB comes in, takes Markov to a secret place and urges him to reveal his secret, saying that they are in Sweden and work for the UN. As a support of the KGB, he kidnaps the distant daughter Markov. The CIA now sends its best agents, a team (Swedes?) Ninja, to thwart the KGB and save Markov and his daughter. <br /> <br /> Comments: The cult movie, which is not very good, needs to see. The film is quite ambitious, but it lacks in many areas. First of all, it's very dark, probably in order to hide the location and the bad effects that some scenes are difficult to understand. You do not see what's going on. The second thing that is missing is martial arts, even though they are a ninja movie. Sure there are those with a fairly low quality, but mainly ninja shoot from vending machines or explosions. Automatic guns also pose a problem because they seem to have an infinite amount of ammunition. And the ninja seems almost immune to missiles, while Soviet guards are dying like flies. <br /> <br /> What does it mean that says it? Idea and ambition above all. Some, in particular, and especially for the Swedish film, decent action scenes, though not martial arts. A few nice scenes in slow motion and a lot of blood and blood. And a very interesting new weapon technology that causes victims of the heart or brain to explode. Mostly all the parts you're looking for in the movie B. <br /> <br /> Since it's definitely a B movie, you can not make a mistake. But if you expect it and watch a movie like B, it's funny. But do not forget that it is not just a B movie that was set in the eighties. Some girls, for example, in addition to wearing ... say "interesting" clothes, have deadly doses of eye shadow and make-up. <br /> <br /> In total, check the status of worship and ambition. Enjoy it, then forget it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
