The "Frankenstein Curse" faithfully captures the story of Mary Shelley for one word of the title, which would not be so bad if the changes were good at all. The tragedy of creating the destructive Frankenstein family has been completely removed and replaced ... nothing. The heart and moral center of history have disappeared. It does not help that Frankenstein is a clever, cunning murderer; he deserves everything he gets. The plot is basically a shallow list of Frankenstein's films. Even on their own terms, this is garbage: a neuter, chaotic film with a delicate appearance with a hairstyle in a pudding bowl. As the first of Hammer's horrors directed by Terence Fisher with Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, his place in horror history is safe. But this is nonsense.
