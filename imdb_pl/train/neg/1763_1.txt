This is one of the worst films ever. Hackneyed. Predictable. Flat. <br /> <br /> The only thing that scored one point were some pretty scenes highlighting Barcelona. I imagine that they use such films in Guantanamo or in another hidden prison of the CIA / NSA to torture suspects. <br /> <br /> Often bad movies have some advantages, there is nothing. If I was in it or worked on it, I would change my name. Really turd. It's hard to write more than this, but I feel that global film observers needed their heads. On the other hand, it will be a great gift for people you can not stand. <br /> <br /> You can send him to politicians you dislike, the law, ex-wives, Teachers you hated, former employees, Dick Cheney, W. and many more.
