Janeane Garofalo was very publicly dissatisfied with this film, calling him an anti-feminist, among others. She also said in her radio program that she hates to create "romantic comedies" because she does not believe in them. I wholeheartedly agree with Janeane here. This film is a trifle at best. She does everything in her power, but in general, it was just another boring, unbelievable "romantic comedy" that has no basis in the real world. While there are those who will say "hang your disbelief," someone will get tired of having to hang it almost every time you get a romantic Hollywood movie. Janeane's character, for some reason, is usually filmed in shadow and darkness, which makes it look unattractive, while Uma's character is filmed in lighter tones (which is probably unhappy with Janeane and is probably one of the reasons why she hates it the movie). It really hurts the movie if we're to buy the assumption that Janeane is going to look better. As many have said here and on other threads of comments, Janeane is not ugly, but in fact quite beautiful. I have not read a single review in which someone said that Uma looks better. Still, I think that Ben Chaplin is likely to stay with Uma, not Janeane. Many men do not like really smart women (and many women do not like really smart men) and unfortunately Ben would probably stay with Uma. And despite the director's attempt to make Janeane unattractive, he does not work. Her natural beauty and so appears. <br /> <br /> I think that many fans of fans of Janeane are obsessed with it like this movie because they like to think about themselves in the form of Ben Chaplin, or actually shoot with Janeane. Janeane is a lot more complicated than the character she plays here (real life is always a lot more complicated than Hollywood can imagine), so take cold gentlemen. This is the part Janeane is best known for, and it's a shame because it's not really a good movie.
