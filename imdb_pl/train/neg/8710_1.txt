I did not see the first two - only the one called Primal Species in England. However, I do not think I will do this. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible movie. Horrible acting, bad dialogue, cheap rubber monsters. Everything about it is so nasty. The most friendly heroes die really fast and leave you with irritating, especially called Polchak, who is an amazing jerk. Nobody would have survived 5 minutes in the army. It lasted for centuries, but I was glad when he finally managed to pull his head away - I had nightmares that he had to survive. Colonel was also a trash - all atmospheric winds and unconscious screams. And this weird Doctor looked and acted like she did not have porn. I waited for him to take off his glasses, shake his hair and turn into a vampire, but she did not. It is a pity, because it would revive the film without end. <br /> <br /> Did not Roger Corman ever make half-decent movies?
