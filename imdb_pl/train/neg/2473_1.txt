if my grandmother made films, they would probably make a much better figure than this ... incredible evil ... the main characters (mom, dad and son) are fine. Especially mother is a nice actress, and the child turns out to be nice, especially on stages where he should be frightening. But does the director know the meaning of the words Plot Point, Triller and Good Script. the scenario has no evolving atmosphere that could become tense. If you like to be hunted by trees, you can probably enjoy it, otherwise just stay at home and sleep. oh ... actually it was something funny: a movie from 2001, but we could not understand it because the picture is so bad (like a mini-DVD), and the cars are so old (like 70 and 80 years old).
