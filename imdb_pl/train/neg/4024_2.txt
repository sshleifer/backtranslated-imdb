This movie is simply awful. Poor John Savage had to bend so low to be in another movie. He appears as a rare type of vampire who is to help a lady who looks like a washed out and tossed street whore who is a dancer at a local strip club. Apparently, he tastes a drop of blood from another dancer who is one of those rare vampires when they are kidnapped on the wardrobe floor. Savage is then assigned by the short leader of this rare vampire race, which looks like the intersection of punk 80s rock and one of the Olsen twins with purple hair. This movie drives you crazy thanks to rapping and dancing Savage with a dwarf with a tattooed spider on his head, also one of the rare ones. He quotes Elephant Man and Jimmy Durante and I just had to laugh. It just gets rediculas. And then the most glaring special effects that they can come up with is that Corri throws organs out of the mouth. And you can say that all this is false. Her son does not know what to do with my new identity and is more a pest than an object of peace. I love that I like a good movie about vampires, but I just hated it. Even the pictures stink, blur and blur when the camera switches this way, and trying to make it look as if the vampires were moving fast for the camera to catch up, then the camera turns bright in the Savage scene chasing Corri's son, until he's blinded himself. Avoid this !!
