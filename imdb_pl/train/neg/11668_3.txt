There are nice landscape pictures. Writers bring banal lips to the lips of the actors. With smaller actors this concert would be stupid. "Art must raise humanity or BS." Not because the art of all these people is also to stimulate humanity and express the dark side. The main character even says that those who do not drink hide the side of the shadow. Wrong, he lived in the dark and suppressed his dark side, drinking and being one-dimensional, not expanding his horizons for anything other than landscapes. In his work there was no breathing organism or expression of his pain. The artist limited himself to a dozen landscapes. Discussions between the characters are a primary school, trivial things that always gave one character the top that the writer wanted. I tried to like it after reading all the first wow comments here. I had to dig deeply to see those with whom I agreed. I think great comments came from people related to the movie. I was only moved once at the end. The kid was too passive. The landscape was nice and the music was funny. Only my opinion, but I do not show myself anywhere.
