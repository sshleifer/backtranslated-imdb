I like Jane Austin's novels. I love Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility books and movies, and I'm halfway to Mansfield Park. But I could not stand Emma. I quit the book after 2 chapters, and at the end of the movie I did not care about Emma. It did not seem to change at all. Maybe it was Paltrows' acting (as good at Se7en) or lack of interest in the movie. I do not know. <br /> <br /> The costumes are nice, but the dance was clumsy compared to the dance "Pride and Prejudice" by Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. <br /> <br /> I gave him 2 mainly because Knightly is damn beautiful, and although it was a rather patchy performance for Ewan McGregor, I liked his singing.
