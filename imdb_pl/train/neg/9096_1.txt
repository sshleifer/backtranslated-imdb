I think it is probably one of the worst movies I've watched for a long time. <br /> <br /> Trying to get "the same characters" with different people is a * bad * idea. If they could not get Sara Michelle G. and Ryan P. in this one, they should have simply reduced their losses and said they should do it. Instead, they get NEW actors who are horrible at what they did. I really felt like I was in high school or (badly) in college, playing with the acting lever of these people. <br /> <br /> Where do these people come from? Was this their first movie? Certainly it looked like this. <br /> <br /> This movie is also similar to the original in several lines of speech. I just finished watching the first one and appeared in second place. I was very excited when I could see the second one and it ended up being the worst performance I've seen for some time. I hardly ever * EVER * turn off the movie, but this definitely fell after about 30 - 40 min.
