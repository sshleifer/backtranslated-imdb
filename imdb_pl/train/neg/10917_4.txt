I am a fan of Columbo, especially on a rainy Saturday, and it was great to see Oskar Werner after Fahrenheit 451, but this episode was very short. The original plot and twists were obvious and could be guessed in advance, even years before modern detective shows. But it was fun to watch the crazy patterns of couches and "modern" electronic equipment and, of course, the obligatory suburban humor that made fun of modern art for sale. A technically advanced home is tomorrow's version of Jetson or Disney and a cool thought about writers who invent these "gadgets". <br /> <br /> If it's sunny outside, go play because it's much better Columbo episodes. Still, we should be grateful for cable TV for broadcasting these episodes.
