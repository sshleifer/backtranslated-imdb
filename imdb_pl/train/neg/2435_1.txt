I am warning you here: I decided to believe those reviewers who said that it was not an action movie in the usual sense, rather a psychological drama, so you should appreciate it on this basis and you will be fine. <br /> <br /> I am here to say that they were wrong. Completely wrong. <br /> <br /> Well, no, not exactly; It's very disappointing if you were looking for an action, they were right. But it is also very unsatisfactory at all other levels. <br /> <br /> Tom Beringer was not as bad as I think, no worse than usual; but what did they have to fill Billy Zane in this? Was it any wish of death from the producers? The way to make their movie a guaranteed flop? In that case, it worked. <br /> <br /> If they really wanted to succeed, why not quit someone who can work? Oh, and I might as well go to a screenwriter who knows how to write. Ah, yes, and a director who knows how to direct. <br /> <br /> As someone who sat in this mess, actually believing that he would soon be buying back, I can assure you that he never did. It is a pity that it could have been a good movie.
