Defeat. The film was simply not good. He has the humor that five-year-olds will not even giggle. I mean, some parts were fun, but most of them are not. Lindsey Lohan is a great actress (and bad singer) and should work on better movies. The movie should be broadcast as the original Disney Channel movie, which is FREE. <br /> <br /> The only thing that was well done in this movie was music. Nothing like a remade soundtrack that will brighten up your day. These songs are so good. Especially Alyson and Amanda's Walking On Sunshine and Caleigh Peter's, the song Beach Boy, Fun Fun Fun. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10. If I gave her ten, nine of them are music, and 1 will be a movie. Not worth the money, but the soundtrack is.
