Adrian has just left the asylum, being rich and without parents, his life seems empty. One day he meets Gonzalo, a poor boy whose mother is a prostitute. Desperate to earn some money, Gonzalo helps Adrian in his search for life and where his parents are. This is a movie from a new director, and most of the film is perfectly visible: the scenes are not properly directed, some dialogues are forced, some inconsistencies in the script ... In any case, the ending is unexpectedly well done (well, just a little) and it saves a little film. Actors are known and have great quality, but are not inspired enough to make the film interesting; everyone did better work in another film. The movie is boring and you probably spend most of your time thinking how long it will take before it ends. Of course there are a lot of worse films, but there are definitely many better ones.
