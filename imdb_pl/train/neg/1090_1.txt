it was the most pointless movie I've ever seen, because there was no story, and the actors probably did not care. 90% of the movie had absolutely no story, I laughed so much that my ribs started to ache. a little where the old people, when they caught Robert Duvall, were ridiculous. on the director's level, creating a noir movie does not involve many sequences of rain and aimless close-ups of the main character. this is an unsuccessful attempt to create a noir thriller, and instead alienates the viewer with inconsistent scenes. because it was based on the "manuscript" by John Grisham, I do not include it in his book for film adaptation, because there is no uncertain and captivating plot in it, such as "company" or "rain producer".
