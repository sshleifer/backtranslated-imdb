it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm still not sure if it was serious or just satire. One of those movies that use every fool who does not know the stereotype they think about. Arrrrgh. <br /> <br /> Don Johnson was pretty good at it. But otherwise it sucked. I saw it more than 10 years ago, but it still hurts and will not stop in my brain. <br /> <br /> The final line of the movie really sums up how stupid it is. I will not ruin it if you want to tempt fate by watching this movie. But I guarantee you a moment * nghya * at the end, with a few in between. If you do not have anything better to do, and you like pointing and laughing, maybe it may be worth your time. Additionally, if you are forced to go on a date with someone you do not really like, suggest watching the movie together, and they'll probably leave you alone after they see it. It's a good price to pay, I think.
