I do not know where to start. The cast is full of people who have never done anything before. Debralee Scott is on the cover list, but does not appear in the film at all. Writing is quite bad, even for student films. This is, of course, a very low budget, with one scene in a sorority house with an extremely sharp assembly. <br /> <br /> Characters are quite typical for college movies - a shy guy, a nerd, a black guy, hard guys, a guy with a mustache, an attractive girl, a girl from a small town, etc. The teacher shows that what can you expect ... a heavy, middle-aged guy who will come down easily. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a college waving, stay away from it. It's so bad, it's not funny.
