I do not want to delve into details because I can not justify wasting time on reviewing this movie, but I had to give a different opinion, hopefully I will help people avoid the movie. Animation is crud and history changes between boring / senseless and extremely irritating. Humor was completely lost in the audience, and so - Ghost in the Shell fans, this is NOT a science fiction action or anything like that - it's a slapstick comedy attempt, and humor just did not work after translating. Watching this movie and a horrible way to start a film festival was a total duty, especially considering how excited I was and how I was open to everything - I did not expect Ghost in the Shell to continue, but I was expecting something funny and just not She reached. Yaaawwnnn ... Instead, rent a Kino trip.
