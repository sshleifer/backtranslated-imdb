A very outdated movie with a horrible, kitschy and scruffy dialogue and a very poor construction. In addition, Cassavetes and Falk are constantly abusing. A pseudo "good movie". There is no time to discover how disastrous this intellectual turkey is. The first scene is total boredom, filled with histrionics and hysterical exchanges. The sound is terrible. The camera moves are unimaginative, as are the characters. No poetry, no subtle psychology, no interesting shots. The actors are still smoking and we see ads for beer beverages. Very cheap. (one exception: a nice and simple way to play Ned Beatti).
