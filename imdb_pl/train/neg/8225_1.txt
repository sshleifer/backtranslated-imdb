DO NOT WATCH THE SAD EXCUSE FOR THE FILM. I wasted my time and money and I am convinced about it. <br /> <br /> Acting is comparable to a high school game. The script is shocking. There is no story. Twenty minutes from the end (which I think I should be rewarded for getting there) I had a headache because of all the screams, crying and wailing of five girls. <br /> <br /> Most of the violence is (rarely happens at present) rather suggested than graphically presented, but I think that characters so damn annoying that I wanted to see them, and indeed every person involved in creating this piece, dies in the most terrible way. <br /> <br /> I spend ten minutes of my life saving you from the very poor 100 minutes of your life. Do not do this.
