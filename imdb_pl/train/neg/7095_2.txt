"Diary of Sex Addict" is a pathetic attempt at a serious drama about sexual compulsiveness. Probably a scam related to film marketing, this movie is a stylish session with a good cast and little more permitting. In conclusion, "Diary ..." would convince us that our sex-addicted figure has the stupidest wife in the world, a stable of infants on the side that have nothing better to do than dropping the panties for him from his whim and there is no work despite being a restaurateur. At best this movement could have been a good drama. In the worst, cheap softcore. "Diary ..." is neither anywhere between them. This is a dustbin. (RE-)
