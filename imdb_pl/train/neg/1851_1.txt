"Friend", apparently tasteless and class, suggested that I look at the work of Ron Atkins. If it's representative of his work, I never want to see anything else. It is an amateur, indulgent, criminal and trashy rubbish. The title "slut mangler" is an angry low-budget creator who murders a group of whores. There is some nudity and some erection, but no single element could save this from the kata loop. The lighting is frightening, the dialog is childish and mostly flashy, and the direction has no idea. During the recent Fangoria convention, I saw the doco about American filmmakers. Atkins was one of them. He spoke as if something important was in his work, but after seeing it, I do not see anything important. There is also no style, and terrible video effects (such as solarization) only strengthen amateurism. Not even bad, it's cool. Avoid.
