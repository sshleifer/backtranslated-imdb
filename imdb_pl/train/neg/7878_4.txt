I am a big fan of the original book and this adaptation is just bad. First, he had a problem deciding whether it was a kiddie toon or an adult, which caused a strange mixture of stories for adults and quite violent scenes with a stupid little duck that still gives "funny" moments in the beginning. br /> <br /> But this is not important, the movie is simply boring, unmoved and is not faithful to the original story. You simply can not transfer all the points that Orwell tried to introduce to his book. <br /> <br /> {SPOILER} <br /> <br /> The second revolution? !! Did they not learn anything? Who will be the next Napoleon? Benzoin?!!
