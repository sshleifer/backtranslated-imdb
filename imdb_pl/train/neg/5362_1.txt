A woman with a wig that "dyes" the hair in the middle of the movie (= shots of the wig) probably does not see what the viewers see from a distance: <br /> <br /> *** start the spoiler alert * ** that her hubby is having an affair with her best girlfriend and they both try to get rid of her. *** End of alarm spoiler *** <br /> <br /> And what was the spoiler: the title already gives it, right? Bad actor, bad screenplay: a waste of time Oh yes: in the end, he lives happily ever after .... <br /> <br /> If you like this movie, you really will love "Cannibal women in Avocado Jungle of Death" ... .
