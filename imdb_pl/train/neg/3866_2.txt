I thought that this movie is not absolutely moral. I mean, how would you feel if your fianc√© left you on your cousin's wedding day? I would be depressed !! It's classified as a comedy, but I do not think it's funny. I thought I just found cheap laughs and took them. I usually love Julie Stiles movies, but that's an exception. Jason Lee appears in another shameful performance, which once again proves that class and decent morality are not relevant in today's society. It lacked taste and I despise films like this one. I understand that people will defend this film and its morality because it is "just a movie", but I still stick to my sign that this bad behavior should not be allowed on the screen. I am not trying to say that if you liked this movie, you are a bad person, because everyone has the right to own opinion, and parts of the movie were pleasant, I just say that in reality people behave characters in this film are disgraceful.
