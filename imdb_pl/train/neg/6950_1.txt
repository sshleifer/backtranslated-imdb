We all knew that before the release, the Ron Moore mini series is not Battlestar Galactica. Fine. This means that he must stand alone. It can not be based on Battlestar Galactica. If something is good, it's good for yourself, and Ron Moore has something he can be proud of. If the reports are true, Moore wanted to. However, if his mini-series decay, he embarrassed all the great actors who appeared on the screen, not to mention the innumerable number of employees outside the screen. And that's what he did. <br /> <br /> Yes, this mini-series is not a remake. I would not call it a re-imagination. This is a new production inspired by Battlestar Galactica. It does not take place in the Galactica universe, with the same places and jargon and technology. He does not talk about searching for Galactika for the thirteenth tribe. Nor is it based on the legends and secrets that underlie Galactica. Rona Moore's mini-series is a space opera, action film with a solemn nod towards Battlestar Galactica. <br /> <br /> Maybe I should say: "just another" space opera, action movie. Because, as the threads go, it has little original or even interesting. I can tell you the whole thing without a spoiler warning. But I will not give you that. I'll just hit the most important point. Now ready? Here's: Just watch the trailer. He will tell you everything that is in this story. <br /> <br /> Yes, man's creations turn against man and try to destroy man. (I think they forgot about the rules of Azimov again.) They look like people, so there is a whole stranger between us. At least there is no time travel. Oh, and a lot of battle scenes and random acts of sex and violence. The end result was that when Moore pulled a ceremonial bow from Galactica, it turned out to be more banal than respectful. I mean, was he unable to come up with anything of his own? <br /> <br /> I wanted to see something else from the first few minutes. I did not care about Moore, because I could not identify with any of them. This fact hit me in the face when the Cylons started the attack. Armageddon on a planetary scale, and I did not do it. How depressing. <br /> <br /> Moore's heroes face an insurmountable obstacle instead of defeating him, rather tucking the tail and saving their own butts. After all, it was the only way to save humanity, yadda yadda yadda. They took a safe way out, instead of risking their lives to defend others. At least disgust is not apathy. <br /> <br /> But in the end, the mini-series Ron Moore was simply aimless, a movie on the treadmill, always running nowhere. And I wanted it to end. And before it ended, my life force was sucked out of me. Against my will, I turned into a mindless, soulless zombie, probably one that the mini-series will like. I had to make up. I needed - and I swear it was true - I had to watch the Babylon 5 episode. In fact, two episodes and I felt much better. And happier.
