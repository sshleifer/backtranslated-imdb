I watched this movie after seeing other comments about IMDb, even convincing my wife that it was "a unique horror film". I wanted to like this movie, but I could not. <br /> <br /> "Love story" was good, but the horror aspect was quite bad. If the story was about a young man who fell in love with a girl suffering from a parasomnia, it would be a better movie. <br /> <br /> A nursing center has spread credulity far beyond the borders, in fact it was quite ridiculous. The doctor joyfully ignores privacy and professionalism. The nurse enters the room for routine feeding of a dangerous patient (no security escort) and drops the tray and runs out of the room shouting for no apparent reason. A forensic (and film villain) patient is tied up in a full-on standing position - apparently for years? Nothing makes sense. <br /> <br /> There were even a few actors in the movie that I liked about other things, such as detectives, but I still can not recommend this movie.
