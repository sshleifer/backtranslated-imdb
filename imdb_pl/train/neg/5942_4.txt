If it's supposed to be a black experience, let me out to the front or back door. <br /> <br /> One day, the boy's mother sees two young hoods passing by and from that moment is everything for him on the hill. Angela Bassett, the only shiny grace in this film, plays his caring, religious mother. Despite his anger at how his life has changed, in the middle of the photo he really decides to accept it. He lets his friends come and suddenly it's okay to use profanity for as long as it's not in the presence of children. <br /> <br /> This is a sad state of affairs about gangster rap. You knew where this movie was going. <br /> <br /> I literally laughed loudly when, at the end, when Bassett accompanies his son's body to the funeral, he claims that while his life was interrupted at the age of 24, he became a man. What man? He was a convicted criminal, he wrote the most cruel rap music with constant vulgarity and a contemptuous society. This classroom scene in which he tells the teacher that as a plumber he earns more than a teacher is a perfect example of what is happening in our schools. Total disrespect for the teacher. <br /> <br /> The gang rivalry on the east coast is never fully understood. Everything we see is burning guns. <br /> <br /> A horrible picture does nothing to prevent gang violence. What horrible models are these rap singers and their filthy music. The African American community should be upset about their existence. Who was this classless fat man who played Biggie? He made Rerun from an old TV show look thin by comparison. I know that the streets of Bedford Stuyvesant changed this plump boy into the vulgar monster he was. What an unpleasant situation when it is called film entertainment.
