The only thing that surprises me more than the number of people who liked this movie is that it was directed by Clint Eastwood, whose work I admire immeasurably. Lead had absolutely no chemistry. I could not believe for a moment that there was something deeper between them than desire. This story just did not call. Add to this a slim conversation, lots of stereotypes and an incredibly slow story, which basically leads nowhere, and you have a real stink. Naked scenes of Kay Lenz may be worth the trouble for those who are looking for some expensive meal, but otherwise it is a colossal waste of time. When I watched the movie, I thought it would be better titled "Cheesy".
