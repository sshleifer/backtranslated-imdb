This movie was the worst movie I've seen since "date movie." I was laughing all through the movie instead of being scared. It was funny that snakes sought a particular part of the passenger's body to attack, for example, the eye, tongue, butt, breast. If we have seen the national geographic channel, we know that the snakes will not be wedged on the body after biting. In each particular scene, the snakes bite the passengers and stay on the body biting the person. I believe that the producer did not study his information about snakes and their behavior. I can not believe I wasted my money on this movie. So I do not recommend this movie of trust, just wait for it to be in the dollar theater or borrow it.
