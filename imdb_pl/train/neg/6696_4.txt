(There are Spoilers) Miya, Kari Wuhrer, the killer of the nymphomaniac killers, takes over the life and car of the nineteen nineteen, even though he is too embarrassed to admit it, colleagues from the freshness of Trent Colbert, Kristoffer Ryan. At the end of the movie, Myia not only slimmer, but gives the poor innocent and naive Trent a lesson in how to see dangerous work with nuts and stay away from it, to stop turning into one. <br /> <br /> Hanging around the truck driver, resting Miya is picked up by Roy, Burt Young, for some hot and heavy action in the back seat of his buggy. Roy is either too drunk or stupid to realize that Miya is no different than his strange daughter! Outraged by the fact that Miya does not want to have him, Roy almost suffocates her to death only to interrupt her first-year college student Trent Colbert, who throws herself at the side of rest, shifting one of the truck drivers. <br /> <br /> Seeing her chance, Miya jumps into Trent's car and they are both excluded in what turns out to be the strangest car chase in film history. In the north-east of the US, they both take part in a truck, destroying murder and shooting with state soldiers, who then lead to Trent's parents' home, holding them hostage. There is another crazy shooting between mad Miya and the entire SWAT team reinforced by local police and state soldiers. <br /> <br /> One would expect a movie such as "Hit and Run" to be deliberately or unintentionally funny, but it is not. In fact, the film is very disturbing when it comes to how Miya treats everyone in the film, that he comes into contact even with her perverted and molesting children, Father Roy. Forcing Trent to lead her to the northeast, Miya gets a drunk poor man who has him in his motel room with handcuffs and a lit candle. Miya also gets it from the motel owner, horny Mr. Foster, cheating him to give her the weapon as part of a strange erotic game. After holding Foster up, he starts with Trent, who is cold in his motel room, a wallet with about $ 400.00 in it, he does not bother with the car. <br /> <br /> I need money to pay for gas to return home to my parents for Thanksgiving, Trent is calling on a mobile phone from Miyi to pick her up at a local restaurant and get her money back. Like the moron he is Trent, he picks up Miya, who is now a fugitive of his right, and then he gets involved with Father Roy on the open highway when he tries to take Trent and Mija off the road. <br /> <br /> The chase ends in this derelict locker room, in which Roy chases Miya, running him on a muddy high-heeled road, with the fact that he puts it in what you know, with his own shotgun blasting. Roy was so busy trying to take off his pants that he had forgotten that he left the gun unattended. <br /> <br /> Both in the case of detention and murder, as well as the impact and escape, the accusation against them two desperate stops in the S & M / Tattoo boutique, in which Trent gets pierced his ear and nose and is dressed in leather and chains, from Myri, along with the matching collar of the dog and his. It is to meet his simple and conservative parents for Thanksgiving. <br /> <br /> Taking part in a shooting with state soldiers, one of them seriously wounded, two fugitives from the law goes to Trent's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Colbet, David Keith and Elaine Martyn home with all the local police along with the SWAT team is waiting for them there. <br /> <br /> An awful movie with a really disturbing ending that made you wonder what exactly the movie tried, if any, to tell the audience. At first, you felt a lot of sympathy for Miya, but when the movie was rolling along his unsuccessful ending, which evaporated as quickly as a tray of ice puppies in the Valley of Death. Although Roy was the most incredible person in the movie at the beginning of the movie, Miya completely dimmed him.
