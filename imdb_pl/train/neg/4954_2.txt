I grew up watching the original Batman Animated Series and am an avid collector of Batman's graphic novels. With the hero of a comic book as iconic as Batman, there are some features that can not be changed. Creative freedoms are good and good, but when it changes completely, it is too far away. I bought one of the "The Batman" seasons in the hope that an additional bonus feature could shed some light on the creators' reasoning to make this show so cruel. In an interview on the creation of "Batman" one of the artists or writers (I'm not sure which one) said: "We felt that we should not play with Batman, but we can ruin the villains." They began to make Joker an immature young child, begging attention, Penguin in some anime knockoff, Mr. Bob Kane rolls over in the grave. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: I would like to have more hands, so I could give FOUR COLUMN DOWN. That squeezes my rating 2 out of 10 simply because it uses the Batman name. Warner Bros ... think it over! Please!
