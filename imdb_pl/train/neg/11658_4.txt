Scary Movie 2 is by far the worst of the four films, because there is not much plot, bad acting, quite boring and really bad jokes. But. And it is big, but there is one good actor, one good repetitive joke and a good beginning. A good actor is Tim Curry, one good repetitive joke is a terrifying, strange butler with a disgusting hand who always makes cringey, but laughs worthy of things. A good start is the spoof of Excorsist. <br /> <br /> The plot of Scary Movie 2 are the main characters from the original, and on the way a lot of new characters are invited to stay in the terrifying night of the old court, but will they survive the night? This movie is not very good, but if you get bored, you might as well watch it!
