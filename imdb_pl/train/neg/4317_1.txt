My spouse and I thought this film was very schlocky. It started well, but quickly became unbelievable and ridiculous. Most of the actors were weak, except for the little girl, Abbie, who was really great. In addition, the window was predictable and poor - especially Gideon, Anio≈Ç. Besides, without giving away anything when one of the characters has a tragedy, it seems almost nonchalant. Initially, we thought it was a "shock", but then we realized that it was just a scary script. We love almost all of Hallmark's films and their thrilling stories, but this movie does not rise to the occasion of being one. There are so many great - do not waste time on this awful movie.
