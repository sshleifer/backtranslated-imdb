What should be a simple general plot of the mystery with the participation of a dead philanthropist is really a painful story about a group of characters (the only great actor is Ginger Rogers, in a very early role), all trying to find a murderer among a small group of residents in an elegant apartment building. These figures range from completely stupid to even bad. As a cheap, low-budget production, most of the action revolves around Rogers and its main character (some guy, I do not care who he is because he really sucks), talking about his various possibilities of solving the crime, being constantly cut off by an absurd detective with head in the ass. Honestly, I've never had a bad time watching an old b-rate movie, and I've seen real head hunters. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the butler did not do it because there was no butler. But pay attention to the guy who is closest to the butler. Go. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
