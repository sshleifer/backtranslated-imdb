As a spiritualist and non-Christian. I thought that I would really stick to my faith, but what I see too much. I thought that the film would have great arguments, but he got only one-sided views of atheists and Jews? And who are all the people on the street who they talk to and who do not know the back of their heads? Where are the proper theologians, priests and other things from which he could have arguments. Not retired nuts that wrote books and graduated in 1970. Personally, this DVD was a waste of time and not worth my time to see if the facts are good or bad or whether I should or should not believe because the anti-Christ told me so. Please think that he came to the conclusion that he did not find God because his own ego and demons defeated him. I will not say that the movie was stunning to help the reading atheists get better about themselves. But if you really want to show the world that you care for us, poor souls who believe in Jesus, then they will entice us with their worth and not beating the drums.
