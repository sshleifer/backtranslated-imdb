The problems with this film are numerous, but I will try to mention the most glaring and troublesome. First, while the topic suggests a lot of vignettes about living in Manhattan, in fact everything, as usual in movies and television, concerned something strange, usually of a sexual nature. The plot lines were thin or non-existent, and virtually every scene, camera shot, line of dialogue and expressed emotions were absolutely and completely false. In the end, it reached the point after an hour that numb the mind of the trash that I left (something unusual for me in recent years). but I believe that the director Mira Nair (once, before Amelia, talented) took part in this disgusting parody, so perhaps the director's talent in America came down en masse to the septic tank.
