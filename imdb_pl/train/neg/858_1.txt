I hate this movie! Nothing was like a book, and thinking about it makes me crazy. If you watch a movie before reading a book, then yes, it's a good movie. But King's book was AMAZING, and this movie was not similar. That is, the general meaning may be similar, but most aspects of the movie are completely different. End, for example! So the book is extremely intense, and Danny and Wendy escape the second before the hotel explodes. but in this awful movie version Jack likes them in a stupid maze ... Yes, there is no maze in the book and there is no reason. Another part that made me angry is that Jack is simply killing Mr. Halloran! hell, he's basically the hero of the book and they just kill him as if he was not important. In general, it was just bad that the movie was so extreme distant.
