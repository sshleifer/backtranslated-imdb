Imagine a scene in which a group of writers are sitting at the table and one says: "let a black woman approach a unsuspecting society member (also black) on the street and ask him if he is black and then go away." Other writers laugh hysterically until someone suggests that they repeat it in each episode. More laughter. Now, if you think the premise is fun and the program contains many such situations, you'll love this program. For the rest, use the zapper and find something more fun, eg. Watch dry paint. Those who have written voracious reports from this program should either leave or be forced to watch TV comedies that are really fun. Another example of humor in the series, the girl tries to get out of the supermarket checkout, trying to hypnotize the cashier. Extremely funny the first time, but why repeat it over and over again in various programs with various cashiers? I can give other examples, but these can be treated as spoilers, revealing why this comedy simply is not fun.
