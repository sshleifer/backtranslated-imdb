One of the other commentators mentioned that they almost left. If I was not with my wife who wanted to stay, I would have gone out. It's a pity too, because I think it could have been a good movie. But this is easily one of the worst scenarios I've ever seen. It starts nowhere and goes nowhere (I would say that it is not going anywhere fast, but it really is not going slowly ... painfully slow). From time to time there are hints that something interesting may happen or that there is potentially a bit of depth under one of the characters, but that's all we get - hints. There is no payout or revelation in the whole film. Not that I need a funny story to have fun ... I love a good meandering study of characters, just like the next indie. But these characters make up nothing. You do not care what happens to one of them for the entire duration of the movie. In fact, you almost start to hope that they will die, because at least death may be more interesting than watching their inexplicable behavior, which is so strange and unpredictable that one would think that it would be convincing in itself, but it is not. Instead of the bizarre, noir-esquire characters in hard fashion, you simply recognize what it is: a group of talented but unsuccessful actors who think and raise their eyebrows, reading a bizarre dialogue without a shadow of context. All this for two pokes, painfully slow hours. Horrible.
