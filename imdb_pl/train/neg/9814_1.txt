This is the kind of movie you regret that you put in a video recorder. This is a strange, bad version of Stephen King's "Misery (1990)". I can not understand how this movie got the result of 5.2, because there is no history what ever, and when the film finally ended, I felt relieved. <br /> <br /> This movie should be released as a short movie instead ... a lot of time is spent on the same. And as in any bad movie, everything happens at the end of the movie within 10-15 minutes ... <br /> <br /> So before you decide to watch this movie, remember to put some new batteries in the remote control, because you will be doing a lot of fast forward ... do not worry, you will not miss anything important.
