Everyone involved (and the public) should look for a "candidate" to see how good the film would be. What happened to the history of South America? What did Julie Christie and Kate Capshaw think that their roles would be cardboard notches. So far, I've enjoyed every Gene Hackman performance and / or movie. He was either disinterested (and it's hard for me to believe it), or terribly unsuccessful. I also liked and defended Richard Gere (and I was vilified for that). But here he had no "power." He was never intimidating and only sometimes convincing. All in all, I was very disappointed. I really expected much more from this director and cast. If you can not find "The Candidate", watch "Wag the dog" or even "Bulworth" again.
