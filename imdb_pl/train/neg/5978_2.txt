Pokemon's third film is too abstract for younger children to follow and too repetitive to entertain older children. The message of the film - dealing with loss - is undermined by the return of the young girl's father during the films. The Rocket team provides some entertainment, but is not really part of a small storyline, so they do not appear too often.
