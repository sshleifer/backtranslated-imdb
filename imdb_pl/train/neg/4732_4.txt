If I write a review about the movie, maybe it will stick to me ... but in general I expect to forget that I saw this film in two weeks. So why bother? Again I see that I am watching a low-rated movie that was cool to watch. I did not expect that I would be able to stay in the room when it was turned on. <br /> <br /> It was not great, but at least it was not unbearable ... not a comedy of errors which always makes you cringe. It was just a sweet fluff ... and if you can not stand it, stay in the locker room. I agree with those who defend this film, because it will certainly satisfy its target demographic group and will not be completely boring for an adult. <br /> <br /> It offers some good chuckles here and there, but a side splitter. Sure, it's stupid and just a bit funny, but at least it's not good for anything (as many have said yes). Maybe these people are afraid of their sensitive sides? <br /> <br /> I have a tendency to judge on the bell curve, so 4,5 or 6 is actually a good mark in my book. Giving him 4 makes sense and strengthens his assessment at the time of writing this text. Giving it a value of 1 or 10, as most have done so far, makes the rating numbers irrelevant. I can not believe how strongly people feel in this or that way about this forgotten down (or even write about it). Is something missing? <br /> <br /> In any case, it should be noted that Emma Roberts plays Clairedycat quite convincingly. Ariell Kebbel often writes herself in the role of bh, but she does not disappoint when her character is guilty of it. You can also recognize Bruce Spence playing Leonard, although his role is additional. <br /> <br /> You can certainly miss it if you're an adult. But if there's a teenage girl in your life, borrow this movie ... and be prepared not to hate it (you can even enjoy it).
