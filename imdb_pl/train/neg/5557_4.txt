OK, but does it make a good movie? Well, not really, in my opinion. I recommend it. And there is not much to find very slow, tedious, in fact. Number one and two were predictable to some extent, but not so much. I also felt that this movie was sometimes quite a camp, which did not really fit into this series and character. Jeff Fahey plays the main evil guy in this part. is quite a decent actor, but I felt that he played his character also in the top. I think it matches the tone of the movie, which would be great, if I liked film.plus, there were some poor one liner. Amnold Vosloo returns in the title role, but There is not much work with this movie. The character did not really develop as I hoped. Okay. This is just my opinion. But for me, while this movie is not hopeless, it is quite bad. I vote for Darkman III: 3.5 / 5
