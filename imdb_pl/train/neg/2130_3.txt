I'm probably late for the party. I just saw this version of Bye Bye Birdy from 1995 on Sky TV. I did not know it existed and I was fully prepared to watch the 1963 film version when I turned it on. <br /> <br /> I played Albert a long time ago and think about starting an amateur production show, because I remembered it as a great fun. I was not impressed by this newer version. It's just not enough fun. It was not colored. He lacked the enthusiasm of the youth. The lighting was bad. Nobody has mentioned this fact. It is not a musical musical, it is bright and conquered. The decision on lighting was a poor creative choice. <br /> <br /> Bye Bye Birdy is a farce, a comedy of errors. I have no idea about it in this version. The lighting was terrible and dulled the overall performance. Dance numbers also seemed anemic. We have music videos today. At least the dance numbers should face the best of them or the best on Broadway. The choreographer slept at the wheel, it seemed. <br /> <br /> Although all the actors were extremely talented, there were some really bad choices for the casting. Vanessa Williams is not Latin, and with so many talented Latin artists, it would not be more correct to throw one of them as Rosie. Vanessa is an African American, lovely and talented but evil cast. Jason Alexander's effort was amazing, he always does intelligent work, but he just was not Albert. He was unsuccessful and I think it is obvious to most people who see this version. <br /> <br /> The medium is not a stage medium. Translation from one medium to another is necessary. Extravagance and the flash of the music scene must be translated into a movie. He has no merit to be faithful to the script when he is filmed. The spirit, the essence of production must be released. For me, the production of Bye Bye Birdy in 1963 was bright and lively, while production in 1995 was as dark as lighting and as colorless as dance numbers. It turned out to be an unfortunate waste of many really talented people.
