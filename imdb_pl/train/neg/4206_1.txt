I was at the premiere of this film at the Toronto Film Festival in 1997. After the screening, when the screenwriter / director and some cast members offered an answer to the questions, no one could even ask a question. Rarely the movie is so poorly directed (why on land random frames from some scenes were pulled out?), The unfortunate act (David Arquette, paraphrasing Dorothy Parker, does not start the emotional range from A to B. Park in A and brings lunch) and completely pointless. Characters behave completely out of character for no reason except to force the plot to move in specific directions. Finally, the film ends completely randomly and purposelessly, which is "really to make you think." Unfortunately, what makes you think, "Well, 90 minutes of my life I never came back."
