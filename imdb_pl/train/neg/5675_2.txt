Set in the 1970s, "Seed" focuses on the condemned serial killer Maxie Seed (Will Sanderson), who killed 666 people in 6 years. He is condemned to death, but he does not die on an electric chair, even after a threefold shock. <br /> <br /> Detective Matt Bishop (Michael Par√©) and other officers are hiding this secret, burying the seeds alive. Seed explodes and follows people who put him in his living coffin. <br /> <br /> Filmed by the worst director in the world (Uwe Boll), "Seed" is nothing more than a snuff film to try to spread the coat of a decent society and fail to achieve any aspect of the plot. He said he was based on real events, because if a person survives an electric chair after a threefold shock, he will be released. It's an urban legend and it would never happen. Like the other Bolla abominations (for example, "Alone in the Dark"), "Seed" is simply terrifying.
