Wow! This movie is really awful. I can not imagine how anyone could read this ill-written script and give it a green light. The cast is evenly the second, with really scary performances of practically all actors. History is chaotic, fragmentary and incoherent. Speaker, leaden and predictable. No joke, no charm, no humor. Not sexy at all. Characters remain flat like the proverbial pancake. There is also a strong current of misogyny, which became increasingly difficult to bear as the film progressed. When your advantage (Carrell) is unpleasant and unattractive, from there up. Despite the false ending in which love triumphs over lust, I have a sick feeling in my stomach. If it is humor and social commentary, we are definitely doomed to death.
