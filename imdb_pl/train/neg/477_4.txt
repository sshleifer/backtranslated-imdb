I read somewhere that when Kay Francis refused to reduce his salary, Warner Bros. he got revenge, throwing her in worse projects for the rest of the contract. <br /> <br /> She decided to take the money. But her career suffered accordingly. <br /> <br /> This may explain what she did in "Comet on Broadway." (Although this does not explain why Donald Crisp and Ian Hunter are also involved in this.) "Insane" is a word that others have used for the story of this movie, and that's the goal. The murder process. Her seedy vaudeville career. Her success in London. Her last scene with her daughter. No part logically leads to the next part. <br /> <br /> Also sets and costumes looked like things from film B. And her hair! Turner shows a lot of movies this month. Observe any other and you will do yourself a favor.
