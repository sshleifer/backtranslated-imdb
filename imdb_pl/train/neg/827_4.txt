Burning saddles! It is a battle between two distant brothers (Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard) who can burn out in a mental disorder; they start to differ from childhood, and Debra Winger's goddamn love is in the middle of it. Director Glenn Gordon Caron (the television kid behind "Moonlighting") suffocates the dark-texture comedy in Vince Gilligan's script with such a slippery presentation that the film resembles an enthusiastic film student's entry for a fifteen million dollar grant. He has the spiny energy of a great commercial function, but a shapeless style that does not bring anything out of the characters except their weird quirks. They are not even signs, they are plot functions. Hardly released for theaters, the film is a disaster, although strictly as an example of style over the substance looks good. Winger is the only standout in the cast that looks really embarrassed. * 1/2 of ****
