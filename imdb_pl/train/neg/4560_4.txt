Men In Black 2 was a real disappointment for me. While the actors did quite a good job, especially Smith, there is simply no cure for a bad script that is already in production. The movie really had the character of a "sequel" playing part-time events from the first movie. In a word, the story was ... evil at best. It was not well thought out and it seemed at times very choppy and incoherent. <br /> <br /> In the first movement, the MIB organization had a kind of "elite" strength. You had several special agents and it had a "secret" character. In the sequel, the MIB organization has the JROTC Summer Camp climate. <br /> <br /> The movie was not awful or anything like that. He simply missed the "cold" (for lack of a better expression) of the first movie. Many of the same old humor has been recycled from the first to the second and did not add the originality of MIB Universe. <br /> <br /> An ideal analogy would be episode 1 to the first 3 movies. Was it decent? Yes. Is it worth bearing his title? Not quite.
