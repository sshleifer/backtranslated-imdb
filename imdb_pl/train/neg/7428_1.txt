As usual in IMDb, majority voting instead of the "weighted average" is much more indicative of the entertainment value of the video. In this case, most give him "one". How are they right? To start my review, first I admit that I have no idea why this movie is called "Alien Intruder". It is related to space and even to a "stranger" (I suppose), but there is no rhyme or reason (in general) at least in the long run, there is no real basis for the plot or resolution that I can see anywhere. /> <br /> There are a lot of scenes that are so awful (both in terms of the line, time and how they are spoken) that far outweighs the strange feeling when watching really bad movies. I have no idea about this part at the beginning, where the electronic Bugs Bunny seems to be saying something about it. <br /> <br /> "Conspiracy" refers only to the area known as G-Spot, I'm sorry, do this G-Sector ... and the virtual reality program infected with some foreign (?) virus. I think he is a stranger, because the image of a normal Ariel appears as a photographic negative. <br /> <br /> For most of the movie, we see people shooting from space weapons, falling out of lofts and seemingly endless, aimless, close shots of "Where is Ariel?", "I can not find Ariel" (pointless, because most other shots CONTAINS interaction with Ariel, in any case - anything) on ​​the computer screen. Commander Skyler (Billy Dee), sits and watches every fantasy of VR condemned programs, hoping to find this alien virus and become one with it ... ??? Or maybe I missed something ... <br /> <br /> Billy Dee Williams took several courses on "how to act in despair" before filming it. We know this because it spends a lot of time sliding his fingers over his face and looking like a mourning one. <br /> <br /> The docking scene with the nose of one ship entering the back of the other was half-amusing at least, and I assured myself of laughter in addition to the early scenes in which we see several shots of a ship that is just spinning in a circle looking like an experiment Lego who went wrong. <br /> <br /> It seems that everyone is dying in this movie, so why? Even female VRs are killed, as if it meant something (especially that everyone is dying anyway) ... outrageous. <br /> <br /> Because of the money I save on shopping, I will not be rant about wanting to get back my money I paid for the DVD. The dollar that I saved on this bag of vanilla wafers paid for the time of this reviewer. <br /> <br /> I will just add that the story itself, at least as a novel, and with much more detail, could probably be quite interesting with the right author. <br /> <br /> 1/10
