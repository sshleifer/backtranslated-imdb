Where to start this movie is so bad and terrible, I do not know where to start. Okay, two marionettes who wrote this kid. Joseph Green and Rex Carlton, first they could not come up with so-called minds in the surname. I think they separated the difference, that's why the main title is BRAIN THAT WOULD NOT DIE, but HEAD THAT WOULD NOT DIE appears on the screen. Nobody knows anything about the profession of a doctor. After all the doctors take the oath "do no harm." Killing a woman for a head transplant would be considered "harm". Plus, a small thing called matching blood and tissues. Rejection would mean John's death in a pan. Plus, which keeps the monster with a patch. What kind of medical school did Bill UNIVERSITY FRANKENSTIEN finish? Old FU or MAD SCIENTIST TECH? The monster did not have a name, it pisses me off. What's more, the genius surgeon Bill Bill Cortner does not know how to keep the patient dormant? And all this is a catastrophe of the movie, it is incredibly stupid and impossible to watch, except for MST3K. I give him THANKGIVING TURKEY.
