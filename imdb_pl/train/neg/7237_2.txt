Life is really too short for such films. I knew it could not be good when I realized what I already suspected - that David Schwimmer would play exactly the same type of person he plays in "Friends". <br /> <br /> Let's face it, a guy can not play anything but a sucker or never offer any other parts. I have the impression that it is a mixture of both. <br /> <br /> And I must say that it is extremely difficult to like a movie that totally wastes the great talents of Gwyneth Paltrow, Barbara Hershey, Toni Collette and Carol Kane !!!
