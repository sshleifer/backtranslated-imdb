Lolita is a rebel and is about to share with our wide-open eyes stories about sex, between sci-fi and fantasy ... Well, this production of Surrender Cinema is not very good: very bad actor, scary music and story without any story and every line. BUT sex scenes are quite well done, many lesbian scenes, and Jacqueline Lovell, as beautiful as in The Exotic House Of Wax, offers us a very good final and very hot show. Only for Lovell fans.
