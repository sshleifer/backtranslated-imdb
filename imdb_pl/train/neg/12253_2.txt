I never thought that the movie could be so horrible, but unfortunately I was wrong. Horrible acting, terrible plot, terrible effects. The crocodile was horrible, and when it came to the stupid sex / killing scene in one, it was a bad move from the very beginning. It was really shocking and it is not a compliment! If someone can do this movie, watch it and then say "Yes, it's a good movie.
