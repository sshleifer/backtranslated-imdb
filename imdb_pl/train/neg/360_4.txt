I read the book and loved it from the beginning to the end. However, when I saw the movie, I was very disappointed. Above all, Deborah Raffin should not be underestimated, but she was too mature to play a woman 24/25. The late Christopher Reeve was also wrong for the same reason. Will, according to the book, was about 30 years old. I'd like to see some more research into his military life, his friend Red, Elly's journey to see him, because that was an important part of the story's development. Miss Beasley was also unsuccessful because the book mentioned that she was a Plus Size lady. I know that the film did not have the "Bridges Of Madison County" budget, which in my opinion was released at the same time. <br /> <br /> But for me it was a very bad movie about low budget and unsuccessful. As someone mentioned, I would like Miss Spenser to leave her retirement and write scripts for her books as they should. He knows his characters better than anyone, I hope he will also consider the cast. The movie let me down!
