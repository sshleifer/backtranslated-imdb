I was expecting to enjoy a romantic comedy with Hip Hop, but I was disappointed on many levels. First of all, history is so much recycled that it is almost unbearable. Secondly, set design, acting and history are not very authentic or credible. Thirdly, there are many more good black actors to choose from than the standard types. How about originality? Thirdly, there were very few Hip Hop songs played on entirity - if at all. Nobody seems to be really central. In general, the film was a huge disappointment, but the style of editing was very interesting and almost made the film pay off.
