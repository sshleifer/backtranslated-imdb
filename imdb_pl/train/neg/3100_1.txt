Hobgoblins .... Hobgoblins .... where to start?!? <br /> <br /> This movie gives Manos - The Hands of Fate and Future War - for their money as the worst movie ever made. This one is great for laughing, where Manos was just painful. Hobgoblins will go to the time capsule somewhere as the perfect movie to describe the term "stunning 80s". Acting (and I use this term loosely) is horrible, Hobgoblins are one of the worst dolls you will ever see, and the fight against garden tools must be seen as faith. The film was an ideal vehicle for MST3K, and this version is the only way to see this mess. This movie gives Mike and the bots a lot of ammunition to get one of the funniest monotones they've ever done. If you try to watch it without the help of Mike and bots ..... God help you !!
