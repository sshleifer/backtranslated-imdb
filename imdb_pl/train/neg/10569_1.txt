I tried to see this movie in a military camp during a foreign mission and let me say that you will be watching everything in these circumstances. But not this piece of sh. T. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes have set the tone for the weak actors with the quality of pornographic films, strange plot twists in plot and incredible situations and behaviors. After that it's getting worse. This movie does not have one charm, and yet it is not bad in a way that makes watching funny. It's just awful. I've seen a lot of movies in my life and I'm not one of those snobbish critics, I mean, I will like most movies, even if they're bad. This man. <br /> <br /> Steer, good, without this, my friend.
