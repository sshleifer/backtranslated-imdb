If you are a person who can jump out of a very bad movie, I highly recommend this one. If not, stay away. This is an amazingly cheap movie, and sometimes it can happen that you are wondering if it's not just a joke that someone is dragging on you. The most positive comment I can say about it is that responsible people have realized that it's super-low-budget nonsense, so there is at least a sense of fun here. amateur as much as possible. Their idea of ​​gigantic deadly fungi is simply guys covered with beige colored sheets that look like trash bins on their heads. This, of course, is not to be taken seriously (to put it mildly), but even with this caveat you will find that you are shaking your head at this incredible trash. Or often laughing out loud like me.
