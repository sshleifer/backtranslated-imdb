Do not waste time on this movie. It's a total thrash in terms of acting, direction, sound editing, soundtrack ... Some of the very good actors were wasting their performance. The film does not do justice to Paresh Rawal, who is probably one of the most talented actors in Bollywood. Akshay Kumar, who is also a rising star, did a pretty bad job. John Abraham, what's wrong with him? Is that your name? I mean, he should thank God for having a beautiful face, otherwise he would win Razzie awards in India if there were such prizes in Bollywood. Asrani has great talent, but he exaggerates with his previous version. <br /> <br /> The scenario, which does not mention the rip off of Boeing from 1965, was quite poorly worded. First of all, people in Bollywood simply can not do something original. In addition, they do not even know how to copy well. The jokes in the film were so exaggerated that sitting in them was painful. Priyadarshan may be a star in the south, but he just can not do a decent Hindu movie. The sound editing is extremely bad. I can continue this case, but the most important thing is that Bollywood should be ashamed of such a movie. <br /> <br /> The worst part is that some people love this movie. What is wrong with you? This is the reason why Bollywood is. Do you know that Bollywood makes more movies than Hollywood every year, but most movies are unseen abroad because of movies like this. I'm Indian and I'm totally embarrassing to Bollywood for producing this piece of thrash. Movies like Dil Chahta Hai and Lagaan were just great. They are world-class films that are timeless ... among the best in this decade. However, Garam Masala is probably one of the worst of this century. Period. <br /> <br /> I give him 1 in 10.
