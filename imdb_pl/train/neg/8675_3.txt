The best thing you can say about this movie is if you're a fan of Sonny Chiba, this movie gives you a lot. Chiba delivers speeches; Chiba poses; Chiba sneers; Chiba looks at the camera; Chiba hits and kicks live sushi from a whole group of bad guys; Chiba is sitting on couches and chairs and looks thoughtful / thoughtful; Chiba rides his car ... <br /> <br /> I like Chiba as an actor and martial artist ... but even for Chiba fans this movie may have too much Sonny Chiba. This is, of course, something like vanity for him. And no, I would not put "Street Fighter" in the same category, because in "SF" he plays a ruthless, immoral antihero and shares the camera with an intriguing cast of friends and enemies. Here he is almost at the forefront and center, and he tries to become Batman, Captain America and Bruce Lee in one. Toshiro Mifune and Chow Yun Fat could not do this throughout the entire feature film, and Sonny simply bears his greeting. At least he could change his suit from time to time. <br /> <br /> The film is even more collapsed by a completely unproductive and ill-made introductory sequence (apparently pinned to the front of the movie for the American version) and a silly cheer "(" Viva !! Chiba !! Viva !! Chiba !! " ) that starts something bad. There's some amazing amateur and inadequate dubbing - Sonny (or his usual English stand-in) apparently could not care about the American version, so they got a bit of a bad drug with a completely different, smoother voice and dialect that is quite irritating to the face, which we all know and love with "Street Fighter". <br /> <br /> Even with all these defects and x-rays, it may still be a small classic, but the camera works and the fight scenes are hopelessly bad. I am inclined to believe that Karate does work, if someone has such an amazing character as Chiba, but the director and cameraman have secured their bets, hacking and editing battle scenes with weeds, so you can not really see what is most of the time. Not everything is bad: there are a few decent shots and compositions, and there is at least one memorable and terrible moment when bad guys appear in the customer's bedroom in a really ingenious way. <br /> <br /> And when it comes to the actual story ... forget. For the "bodyguard", Chiba is something like an idiot. The scenario depends on making mistakes and oversights that put him (and his "client") in dangerous situations repeatedly so that he can break free of them, and after 30 minutes, even the most credulous sentence seems to think that this guy should be good. (Also, if his character really wants to destroy Japanese drug trafficking, he would take his client's neck 10 minutes after the script and shake her until her teeth would start chatting like a castanet until she spilled his little secrets ... and a whole lot of senseless death and conflict would have been avoided.) <br /> <br /> However, the whole film is far from the bottom of the barrel. Sonny Chiba is still there and it's still cool to watch. I paid a fine to take it out of the bargain DVD stand on the local mega dead and I feel it was worth a look once.
