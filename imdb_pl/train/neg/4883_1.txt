During a cheap movie made at the beginning of the movie Crazy Fat Ethel II, I was wondering if it was the same movie that was on the cover. Unfortunately it was like that. The story itself is mindlessly simple. Ethel, a murderous maniac with eating disorders, is released into the house due to the overcrowding of the hospital. He is by far the most reasonable resident, while one man puts dead flies into another soup. Ethel is then teased by one of the employees of the half-life house with a chocolate bar after he goes down to the cost of feeding the dogs. Ethel will take revenge by strangling him with a wire on the stairs, and then ... well, you have an idea. If it all sounds like fun, it is not. This film was poorly made with cheap effects and even worse performance. Characters are so wooden when they deliver their lines that they should stand in front of a cigar shop. To make matters worse, half of the movie consists of flashbacks to Ethel's first movie, Criminally Insane, which is a bit better. VERY weak effort.
