I thought my favorite Martian was very boring and stretched !! It was not fun at all. The audience just sat down the whole movie and did not laugh at all !!! Even the children did not laugh !! It's sad because of the Disney movie !! I thought they could find someone who would play a martian better than Christopher Lloyd !! He was really stupid !! And he was not funny !! I thought the talking suit was really stupid !!! In the original TV series, the suit does not talk and does not move !! In my opinion, they should not waste time on this film !! He gives me two thumbs !! Really a waste of time and I do not recommend anyone to the movie !!! Thank you!!
