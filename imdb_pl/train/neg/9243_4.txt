Put simply, I do not like westerns. And never sitting in one from beginning to end, I decided to watch "My Darling Clementine" and see it all the way, no matter how much it hurts me. At first it was terrible, as expected. I think acting is funny, the scenery (your standard dessert, horses and cowboys) boring, and the music and its time are balancing on the edge of pain. However, after a psychic conversation with myself, I struggled, after the first 20 minutes it started to be a little easier for me. Focusing on cinematography and how John Ford managed to make even the poorest situations (in my opinion boring) sometimes look quite stunning, made it much more interesting. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I can not go so far as to say that at the end of the movie I liked it. However, it's good enough to sit until the very end, and that in itself makes an impression on me.
