Return to the cabin by the lake ... was missing. He had to have a very low budget, because a significant part of the film had to be filmed with an ordinary video camera. So in the same scene you'll have a few movie shots about film quality and simple shots from video cameras. It's a very strange combination! I think they should find SOME a way to not make a "home video" effect! <br /> <br /> I think it's worth seeing IF you saw the original CBTL, because you can compare and see the differences. But if you have not seen the original CBTL .... you will never want to see it if you see the first! It will probably seem too tacky and you will not even care about the original.
