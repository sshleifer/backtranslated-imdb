This is to be a comedy, but mainly bad taste, and nothing causes a smile in the movie. The film tells about the attempt of a couple for a child, and those people in real life who are in this situation will hurt the presented images. For example, scenes at the fertility clinic are not the least funny and are genuinely embarrassing. A male leader who plays a construction worker and his helmet has a poor excuse for rejection by Village People. A female leader tries to look 20 years younger than she is. Both threads turn out to be unattractive, unattractive and totally unconvincing. The film includes various funny and completely modest free scenes, for example with a cheap airline, devoid of humor. The only reason I give this 3/10 instead of 1/10 is one sign for Shirley Maclaine, who is a class above everything in the picture and one brand for some decent (though old) music.
