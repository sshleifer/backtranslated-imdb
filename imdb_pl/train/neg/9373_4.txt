The peculiar charisma of Martin Koslecka brings some credibility to his character of the frustrated artist. He gives his dialogue a strange sense of realism, making the sculptor Marcel a convincing man. The character seems to be a real person, not the typical black character of the movie B. <br /> <br /> The plot has nothing to say, and many scenes are boring. What makes it work is the strange chemistry between Kosleck and Rondo Hatton as a creeper. The talkative, philosophical nature of Koslecka contrasts with the low key, the monosyllabic approach of Hatton. Creeper's character is not well developed beyond the basic level of monsters, but Hatton suggests undeveloped possibilities and makes you wonder about its history. <br /> <br /> This movie was in the Shock Theater very often when the kid, so I have a nostalgic fondness for it. In any case, it's worth seeing once for those who like horror movies from the forties.
