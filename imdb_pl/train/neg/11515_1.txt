and forget about it. Completely. If you really want to see Madonna's act, rent a "Body of Evidence", at least Willem Defoe is in this one. <br /> <br /> In this movie, while the sets are beautiful, you can mute the dialogue. You will not miss anything. Bruce Greenwood is wasted, Jeanne Tripplehorn is a prop, and Madonna is so horrible that it becomes funny. Why they had to massacre the original movie for this mess, I will never know; they guess they thought it was "banking". Madonna, as an actress, is definitely NOT. <br /> <br /> If you rent an original movie from 1979, you'll like it, and the actors playing it can actually work. 1/10.
