I can not think of Al Pacino. I watch him in the Godfather, Scarface, Dear Carlito, and I think I'm watching one of the greatest actors of the last thirty years. Then I see him in "Two for Money," "Everyone on Sunday and Revolution," and I wonder what this guy thinks about. <br /> <br /> I came across a revolution a few days ago and thought I would invest the next two hours on it. Here's a short message: Do you want to convince prisoners to talk? Force them to watch it over and over ... admit to everything. <br /> <br /> I will not make a plot because there is no coherent plot, but it happens during the American Revolution and Pacino plays an uneducated peasant who does not want to get involved but ultimately does it. Although there is no money, no education and dresses like a caveman, very hot Natasha Kinski falls in love with him for no apparent reason, because they only have two minutes of dialogue. <br /> <br /> To be honest, if "Al Smith" played in this movie, instead of "Al Pacino", it would ruin their career. The script was horrible, but Pacino's demotivated performance and obvious false accent made it even worse. Donald Sutherland's role was ridiculous. I can not really describe it. Natasha Kinski is the main character, but she has 5 lines in the film. In fact, nobody says much in this film. <br /> <br /> One of the funniest premises in the film is how Al Pacino and Kinski have this amazing talent for constantly bumping into each other on the battlefield. Just like the whole northeast is Starbucks. "Hey, it's fun to see you again, ON ANOTHER battlefield 100 miles away ... see you in a few months." <br /> <br /> I have to give this star IMDb, because there is nothing here for a negative result.
