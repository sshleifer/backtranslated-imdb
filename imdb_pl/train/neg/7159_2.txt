I thought I would never find a horror like "The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre," but this movie competes with him. <br /> <br /> I am not a person who falls asleep when I was watching a movie, but I did it 15 minutes after the trance started. I woke up and started to look at it. Why did I deserve it? The whole film was torture, I have to scroll quickly to watch it. <br /> <br /> I can not understand why one of my favorite actors of all time (MR WALKEN) could have done it. I have to think that he made the director a grace, or he really needed money, because the film after the movie does, it is ruined; and so quickly ... <br /> <br /> And what about the movie? this is not a scary, stupid plot, the characters are horrible (but I really liked the one in which Jared Harris played), the effects are very weak, lack of death and blood, etc.; in three words, it has everything. And I mean it. I can not stand how a director can make a movie like that. <br /> <br /> In any case, when I was more disappointed when I saw in the video cover that the movie was presented by "Stephen King", I think that he would never be able to introduce this shit, no? (I rented it in Argentina). I do not recommend this for a million years. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie from 2 to 10. (As I say in the review "Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre," there will always be worse films, so it does not deserve 1 out of 10)
