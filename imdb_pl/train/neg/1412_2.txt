While watching this movie, I came up with a screenplay for a movie called "The Making of 10 Items or Less": <br /> <br /> Producer: I have good news and bad news. The good news is that we can get Morgan Freeman! <br /> <br /> Writer: That's great! But what is the bad news? <br /> <br /> Producer: we can afford to hire him only for one day. I think we will have to get someone else. <br /> <br /> Writer: So we're hiring him for one day. The film lasts one and a half hours. The working day lasts eight hours. I do not see a problem. <br /> <br /> Producer: But ... he will have to take the time to get in character. <br /> <br /> Writer: So we have to play him a character who basically himself. <br /> <br /> Producer: But he will still have to understand his motivation and that's all. You're not saying that we have him playing a great actor who makes a low-budget movie, right? <br /> <br /> Scenario: Why not? <br /> <br /> Producer: It's funny! But good, at least we'll have Morgan Freeman in our movie. And I think we also need to set a movie in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> Scenario: Of course. <br /> <br /> Producer: This script is a lot of nonsense. We'd better make money on it. Just in case you have a Morgan Freeman Wal-Mart or Target plug-in or one of these stores, so at least someone will want to sell a DVD. <br /> <br /> Writer: Sure! <br /> <br /> Producer: Wait a second ... what is it about a tiny bodega with "ten items or less" an express belt? <br /> <br /> Scenario: Oh, that's strange. But now we can not change the title! <br /> <br /> I doubt that my script would be very similar to reality, but then it would not be "10 or less". This is a case of good acting, but bad writing and I hate seeing it. While watching an independent movie, you expect to try to pass a message. I think they could try a tired old message, "do not let something stop you," which was made to die in much better movies. Anyway, with "10 items or less", the only news I got was "Look! Look at Morgan Freeman! "
