Somewhere in this movie is a half-hour episode from the Twilight Zone that is trying to get out. While the Cube was tight, well made, claustrophobic and addictive, I'm afraid that Cypher is a distracting, boring reworking of a few worn-out topics that just do not add up too much, especially if you've seen almost every decent sci-fi movie before. <br /> <br /> Cypher manages to drag in incompetent ends within a relatively short 95 minutes. None of the characters ignites each other, and for the film made in 2002, the technology is really tacky. It is difficult to combine this tired and boring movie with the Cube director. This is not a bad movie, but it's definitely not a good movie. <br /> <br /> When you watch the grass grow and dry and bored with your insects, you will definitely watch this movie, but other activities will probably be more stimulating.
