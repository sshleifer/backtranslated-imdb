After two long, long initial skits, one of which my brother saw the upcoming application and the other completely free of jokes, we begin the fast rewinding, which is appropriate for GROOVE TUBE. Naturally, stupid boys from frat who are still playing the role of JACKASS or Tom Green, will find an idea for excrement coming out of a tube, OLYMPIC SEX (I really do not have to give details, right), and a clown who basically does it "not really an engaging clown, I think I've seen about ninety times that it will eat like a beetle: well, more power for you. <br /> <br /> I want to express it, despite what you've heard, this movie in no way was a model for many infinitely fun movies like KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE or not. Film skit has already been realized in I NOW, SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT, EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS WANT TO KNOW ABOUT SEX, and so on. And much better.
