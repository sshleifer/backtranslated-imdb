Canadians are too polite to boo, but the audience at the Toronto Film Festival left the theater, murmuring that they would rate this film 0 or 1 on their voting cards. The assumption is that the contemporary filmmaker interprets the seventeenth-century tale of the love of shepherds and shepherds embedded in the distant past, when druids were spiritual leaders. Working in three epochs gives many opportunities to introduce anachronisms, including stupid and impractical clothes and peculiar spiritual rituals, which are associated with really bad poetry. Lovers are divided by jealousy and their rigid adherence to idiotic codes of conduct, from which emerge disguises and various farce situations. The film could have been fun as Monty Python's song, which reminds us too closely, but Rohmer's effort falls very flat. The audience laughed at the view jokes, but otherwise mourned the slow pace. The ending comes in a hurry and is really awful. It's a trivial movie and wasting time on film.
