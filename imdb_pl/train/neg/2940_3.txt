I saw this movie when I was really small. This is definitely one of the strangest movies I've ever seen. Now I like strange movies normally, but it was a bit too much. <br /> <br /> There is not much story to the movie. If anything, it starts with Toy Story, where toys come alive, and Raggedy Ann and Andy embark on an adventure to save a new friend, Babette. From there follows madness. He is Greedy, Looneys, a sea monster named Gazooks, and a group of pirates singing show melodies, all of which made a bizarre movie. Besides, I can not resist the impression that Babette is annoying and a little too tearful. It certainly did not help the movie. <br /> <br /> Now, although I did not like this movie, there were a few lovely parts. I liked the camel song. Although it was a song about loneliness, it had a friendly atmosphere. Then he was Sir Leonard. While most Looneys were just ordinary, Sir Leonard was the most interesting and probably the funniest. King Koo Koo was just a small bag that made Dr. Evil looked like a serious villain. There was also a song by Raggedy Andy, No Girl's Toy. It was definitely a good song for young boys who wanted to play hard. But to be honest, even these things have not improved the movie. (But remember, this is just my perspective.) <br /> <br /> Although I personally would not recommend this movie, I must admit that it has its charming moments. See if you're interested, but only if you're in the mood for something "really" unusual.
