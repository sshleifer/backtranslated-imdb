I can not stand this show! Have there ever been one salutary quality, one funny point or one plot, which "no" made the average viewer want to drown in a bowl of soggy cornflakes? <br /> <br /> Voices. Oh, those terrible, miserable voices. Just like repeatedly dragging a set of small cutlery on a dusty plate, each character is extremely irritating in his abilities to penetrating, nasal vocals. Cosmo sounds like a whining mutt, Vicky sounds like a stereotypical devil, and Timmy's daddy makes every line sound like a bad personalization of the game show host (Guy Smiley from "Sesame Street" comes to mind). <br /> <br /> Animation is terrible; even the producers of "Yu-Gi-Oh!" laugh with mostly bad graphics on this concert. Each character has teeth or a square head or head of three sizes too large for his body. And what about the fact that the characters talk to every single line with wide eyes and smile, as if posing for a photo with the president? Then there is the fact that every character in the series is completely moronic. Ever since the subtle charms of Amelia Bedelia, Homer Simpson and Buddy Lembeck of fame "Charles in Charge", the heroes were portrayed as unrealisticly stupid. Usually "unrealistic" is synonymous with "unusable", and this is definitely here. Since the time of "The Naked Gun 33 1/3" there was not so much slapstick based on the unconscious ... or at least Leslie Nielson was good at it. <br /> <br /> Finally, the premise of the series (and this is the same episode, so big time spoiler alert): Timmy wishes something with his two "Enough of the Oddparentami", something goes wrong, there is always a coined reason, for which he can not immediately turn the course and wish for damage, then everything ends. And, by the way, Timmy's parents never believe him when she complains about Vicky and still employ her at every opportunity. Maybe it's just me, but it looks like a children's program with a subtle message that basically nothing good can be said about an abusive babysitter is not the best idea. <br /> <br /> If you write an article and you want to give an example of how far the quality of cartoons has dropped, "The Fairly Odd Parents" must be a great place to start. An excellent example of TV producers throwing a worthless product aimed at children with little or no effort just because they know that someone will see it somewhere.
