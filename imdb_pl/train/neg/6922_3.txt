The singleton and newspaper campaign suggested (as often as they did) a much more gloomy and violent track than shown on the drive-in screens. Claude Brook is in fact the Americanization of Claudio Brook, who has worked in films for years. This one is quite difficult to find; I would like to see him again to compare him with other international horrors of the day, but I do not remember when I was impressed. It was probably a fragmented version that went to American cinemas and video. But oh, this one sheet ... is still the jewel of my later collection of horrors.
