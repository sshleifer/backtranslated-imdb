Dark Rising is a typical bad movie, of course, quickly produced horror / sci-fi / fantasy. It has a strange, unexplained story with holes so large that it can fit an elephant. Most of the time I did not know what the hell was going on, but it did not matter, a simple demon hunter returns from the infernal dimension to save the story of the campers with misleading things added about witches and the book of evil story elements and characters that do not make sense or they disappear completely without a reason. Acting is bad, but to be honest, they can not do much with this script. I'm guessing. There are several topless scenes, which is probably the only reason for this bad movie (like many other bad movies). Give it a pass, unless there is nothing else on T.V.
