This is absolutely the dumbest movie I've ever seen. What a waste of a great cast. It's James Cromwell as an ignorant playing substitute. I could continue and continue, but of course I would spend more time on this review than anyone has ever done on the script. The only thing that this film mentions is that we are against them and how to enjoy secular blood beyond any reasonable human tolerance. This is one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen - and I LOVE James Garner.
