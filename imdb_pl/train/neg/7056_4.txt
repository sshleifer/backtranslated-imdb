This movie is a great example of how even very funny jokes can be terribly bad. I really expected at least something from this movie after watching the add-on which was fun as hell, but the movie was not half as good. <br /> <br /> It is strange that jokes are really funny, false no smoking, Jo Bole ... etc are really good jokes, but I do not know who to blame this movie flop. <br /> <br /> The main candidates can be: - 1) Hammers (actors) and hammeresses (actresses), not even a funny kind 2) Director 3) A guy who casts actors and / or director Anyway, if You really are bored and I mean really see this movie, or get a copy of any advertisement or trailer of this movie and laugh with the ass, because they will be much more fun than the movie. <br /> <br /> ps the only advantage of this movie is mahesh manjrekar and funny chappu bhai
