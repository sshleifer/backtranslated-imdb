Slaughter High is inherently your emblematic slasher movie of the 80s. The prick is getting out of control, leaving the wicked burned guy behind. A few years later, the geek comes back and starts killing people who hurt him. Now the story may sound intriguing and very funny, but what makes this horrible movie so different from the rest of the 80's feature films is that it has some flawless mistakes and mistakes of continuing. <br /> <br /> Acting is frightening, but it is not really as bad as one would suppose. Although it does not help that every character in the movie is so crazed and unacceptable. The host, Carol Manning (Caroline Munro) is the easiest of them all tormentors and she is supposed to share compassion and roots. Not to mention the fact that the geek is almost too bizarre and I think that even the stereotype geeks themselves would be rudely crazy and on the contrary disgusted with how bizarre his is, so when someone cripples him, does he really care? <br /> <br /> There is a large unintentional potential for laughter. Munro's lack of acting talent is quite obvious, which puts her at the same level as the rest of the horrible cast. However, the funniest thing is that the film misses Munro, who is 30 at the time, as a teen among the cast of teenagers. And when it comes to later life and Munro plays at his real age, the rest of the cast does not pass as adults. All this fits well with the theme song, which is a funny pose of heavy metal thrash, accompanied by a maniacal laugh and a yelling voice "I'll take you". With that in mind, Slaughter High really is not a very good slasher, but it has a bad entertainment value. It may be necessary for hardcore slasher fans, but do not expect dilemma, tension or credibility. Awful!!!
