Cedric Kahn's films were based on characters and not based on actions (I think about L'Ennui and Feux rouge), so shocking is that this series of really experienced car chases intertwines with attempts to give the form of Succo. I do not consider Stefan Cassetti to be an interesting actor; reminds me of athletes doing sports, such as Bret Favre. This blank look looks like a really cruel deer caught in the headlights. A real actor would force us to think more about Succo's personality than to admire his skills in carjacking. <br /> <br /> Small acting comes mainly from Isilda le Besco, when the needy student Succo takes the assault. Interview in the police office is a miracle of stubbornness, with little fear of the future mixed in. Le Besco separately, you can not recommend this film very well.
