Look, I will not lie to you, but I got this movie for $ 3.99 from a friend because he had Danni Filth, lead singer of the popular death metal band "Cradle Of Filth". I was expecting, of course, violence and gore at its best, because what Mr. Filth can portray as one of the storylines. <br /> <br /> But dear God, I was so angry. This movie is biting seriously, big time. Because it's a low-budget movie (haha, wait, do ZERO BUDGET), of course, there are no beautiful musical scores with Howard Stern orchestra and Spielberg's special effects. No, it's all one camera, bad angles and bad blood scenes. <br /> <br /> Take, for example, when our star and the brutal devil, Mr. Filth, brutally kills the robber. Grab the throat, and the blood spits out, but oh, it looks like the man's shirt has a packet of juice filled with fake blood. <br /> <br /> Cradle Of Filth fans: You will hear two songs in the whole movie, but with camera angles and cheap filming, they draw the general pleasure of the DOWN song. <br /> <br /> My last comment: Steer away from him. It's blood, blood, breasts and hey, even a tacky story that can be done about it. So if you like scary violence, almost no votes (yes, there are hardly any words in this movie), just buy it. Just in case. But if cheesy films are not your thing, avoid them. Do not waste your money.
