I love the stories of Jane Austen. I have read only two of them (P & P and S & S), but after watching this adaptation, I reach for "Persuasion" from my bookcase to get the meaning out of this story, and because I do not believe Jane Austen could write such nonsense. For me, I thought that if you put a movie on Jane Austen's novel, you can not go wrong. By default it will work great. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, where are the characters with whom you sympathize and like? You must have at least one sympathetic character to let the audience invest their emotions in them, and that did not bring results. Sure, I wanted Anne and Wentworth to gather, but only because what you know is the purpose of this story when they meet. Instead, I had to resist the temptation to throw my cup into the TV and continue watching it to the end. <br /> <br /> Anne was totally annoying, and in the end I really have no idea why Wentworth was so impressed with her that it seemed like there was nothing to be charmed about. She was gentle, unremarkable, boring, socially inadequate, and stumbled upon a sheep, following the instructions of everyone else, instead of having her own mind. It can still work for the main character if you do it right. It was not done well. <br /> <br /> The other heroes simply showed different degrees of narcissism, of which Mary was the worst, with a full narcissistic personality disorder. Where Mrs. Bennet at P & P had similar flaws, she was still charming, while Mary was more bizarre. More disgusting than funny. <br /> <br /> Wentworth was very handsome and looked like a decent guy. For most of the story, I was wondering who he was and why he is in love with Anne, he is certainly the type of guy who would like a person who is a little more ... alive? Acting with conviction, not too much to speak, because I reacted more to the characters presented than to how well / badly people acted. Anthony Head was perfect, but as soon as I saw that he was in it, I was expecting no less. <br /> <br /> Also this story was very misleading. It was not until the end of the film that Elizabeth was Anna's stepmother, but in fact her sister (I'm still not 100% on it). The whole story with Anne / Wentworth was also a bit vague. They were together, but then they broke up and they are both bitter? Why? I've been thinking about this for a long time, and the explanation seemed to be that she dumped him because somebody persuaded her? But it was said in a certain way "along the way" that he almost missed it, as if it was somehow unimportant. How can it be unimportant, when is the core of history? There were also many names dropping, but there was no real sense of who the heroes were. Like Louisa, who was she? Friend? Family? What? It was not clear who the different characters and their mutual relationships are. Lady Russell was there a lot, but why? Mrs. Croft and Wentworth were brother and sister, which seemed very unrealistic, because Mrs. Croft looked old to be his mother. <br /> <br /> The last kiss, it was a bit weird that they kissed on the street but I did not really think about it because I was too busy shouting "ALREADY WITH IT !!" on TV because Anna's mouth shook they trembled and trembled for ever before they met with Wentworth. Do not hesitate, but only for a few seconds, not half a minute. <br /> <br /> Then there is the question of working with the camera. As a regular movie observer, you do not pay attention to angles, unless you choose to pay attention to it. I did not decide to do it here, but I still noticed them. For me, this means that filmmakers do not do a good job. Many of the conversations concerned extreme close-ups of faces, which should only be used when you really have to make an important point. In this adaptation it was excessively used and therefore it did not matter. Feeling held occasionally also did not work in the drama of the era. Camera work in the current scene also seemed too modern. (Not to mention the race itself.) It was the only adaptation of Austen that I caught in the Austen season at ITV. I wonder if it is worth watching "Northanger Abbey" and "Mansfield Park", or should I just read books and leave it. I am sorry to say it was Jane Austen's adaptation, which I did not like. Maybe I'll watch the 1995 version instead. The BBC are known to have performed beautiful Austen adaptations before.
