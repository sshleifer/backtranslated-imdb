This movie is so EMPTY. In each movie scene, the maximum number of actors on the screen is 10. Because everything was shot in front of a blue screen, there are never any add-ons, and the movie just seems strange. <br /> <br /> THE ACTION was terrible! It's so obvious that it was in front of the blue screen, because all the action scenes can be seen, how the actor / actress wonders if he is half running, when they should run away in search of life ... Looking at the floor for his grades ... <br /> <br /> Spoilers: You will also see how you shake your head at the movie. At some point in the home Sky Captain base they have as many as 100 planes sitting on the runway. They warned that attack was coming ... So what are they doing? nothing. All planes are blown up and again ONLY a person fighting with him is a Heavenly Captain ... <br /> <br /> THE WHOLE world is under attack and is the ONLY person who fights. At the very end of the movie you can see hundreds of plains that are finally starting ... but what are they doing? Nothing ... the movie is over ...
