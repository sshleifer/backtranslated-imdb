I have it as a turkey movie and I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Acting - generally, despite the fact that many were in other films, it is obvious that they had to work hard to act so badly, so constantly over this whole movie without accidentally passing a certain degree of acting. <br /> <br /> Plot - being generous I could say that the screenwriter initially started from the story, but he tried to ignore it. the plot collapsed faster than the Chinese refused the computer. <br /> <br /> Scrip - now it was an abomination of nature. he did not swim with any rhyme or reason. most of the heroes' lines were at best pathetic to imbecilic. the script worked hard so that no character was considered unforgettable. I watched other films in which the supplements were more interesting and unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Special effects - ROTFLMAO !!!!! These were short special buses. <br /> <br /> Direction - until you are able to come up with your own ability to manage, copy the style of your favorite director, otherwise you will make only such mistakes. <br /> <br /> It's good to know that your friends / family have given you 10 stars for this video
