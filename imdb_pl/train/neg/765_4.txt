Seriously, what were they thinking? Over the years, the Columbo series tried a few new things and moved away from the usual successful formula, but this movie really exaggerates. This movie is fundamentally different from other Columbo movies, but the differences are not for the sake of the movie. <br /> <br /> The main thing is that this movie is different from other Columbo movies, it's the fact that there is no murder. The whole premise of this film is completely different and puts Columbo in a completely different environment and situation. The whole is simply completely different and more "modernized". <br /> <br /> Director Alan J. Levi has done several other Columbo movies in the past, which very much stick to the usual pattern. It is also a strange choice that he was chosen to lead this movie. <br /> <br /> Columbo himself also feels completely different, perhaps because he is placed in a completely different environment and situation, when he helps his nephew after his bride disappeared immediately after the wedding. Lack of some good humor Columbo with relief and trademark also does not make it a good or pleasant watch. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the film does not start too bad, but the movie begins to be more and more ridiculous with its history as it progresses. It's such a stupid thriller written about a kidnapper with a story that begins to become less and less likely. This makes the film more and more unobtrusive. This is a very interesting entry Columbo, which really can not entertain its viewers in any way. <br /> <br /> It also does not help that supporting actors are not the most talented. Despite the fact that his character is placed in a completely different situation and the film is shot in a completely different style, Peter Falk still keeps up well, and his presence still saves this movie a bit. Can you imagine how this movie would be without it? I could say that it would be an extremely bad and mocking cheap movie. <br /> <br /> A strange Columbo entry that can be described as a failed experiment by turning away from the usual pattern. <br /> <br /> 4/10
