There is not much to say about this movie, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> Acting and dialogue are far from even decent, the story of a hybrid werewolf is not well explained, and the whole here and there has holes in the story. <br /> <br /> CGI is something you would not want to see. It's so amateur that it makes me vomit. <br /> <br /> The only good thing on the DVD was the extra version. Gagowa roll. Everything else, just a waste of time and money. I hope that nobody will buy it, it is not even worth renting. <br /> <br /> Stay away.
