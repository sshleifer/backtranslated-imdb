There were a few moments in my life when I was confused and depressed. Possession by Rancid Aluminum was one of them. <br /> <br /> Warning signs were. No premiere (even the stars did not want to participate) and no reviews in magazines. The only reason I was sitting in the movie was the hope that I would make up for some sleep. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the film has been explained. The narrative was idiotic. At one point I was cheering when the movie was filmed, and then to my growing despair, it turned out that my joy was not really shot. I sincerely hope that everyone involved in the film will be hanged for this cruelty. <br /> <br /> There were several positive aspects, mainly unintentional moments of humor. For example, a scene in which the main character, for an unknown reason, feels the need to release himself from the toilet cubicle, and at the same time tells the person in the next booth to put his fingers in his ears. <br /> <br /> My words can not explain the anger I feel, so I will end it. <br /> <br /> Ridged clay: only for sadists, wastelands and regressants who want to torture themselves.
