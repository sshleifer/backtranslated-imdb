Although I recently put it on my list of the 10 worst movies, I must say it is probably no worse than Burt Reynolds in "The Maddening" or some sequel of "Look Who's Talking". Still, it's pretty nauseating, even if the sexy Drew Barrymore plays something like a horror movie in the movie Holly Golightly, moving from New York to Los Angeles, but learns that it's being followed by a murderous look. Poor Sally Kellerman, a bizarre actress highly acclaimed in the 1970s, has been reduced to a poor supporting role, and the main character Barrymore, George Newbern, is the worst type of the show's actor, always stopping to laugh on each line. The picture is full, but the bloodied scene with Drew's shower has a spectacle in it, and the psycho identity (though from the "Scooby Doo" episode) is interesting. But as for the finals ... be real! Who had to clean up this mess? * with ****
