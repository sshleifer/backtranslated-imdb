This is one of those stereotypical mtv generation dance movies and I do not see where all these "not so bad" trash come from. Acting is terrible, it follows exactly the same story as all other "dancing" movies. It is horrible! The name should scream, do not look. 'How she moves.' Since when can movie titles ignore grammar? At least some of the dance movies had half-decent dance scenes, those do not even deserve a watch. I give him 1 in 10, just because there is no zero. I am seriously begging anyone who has an IQ above 60 years to not watch it and waste money. 1.6 / 10 should say it all. This film should not even be created.
