It was really scary! He had a terrible plot, he was badly played and he was like an amateur remake of dead dead, but not that good. <br /> <br /> It took all my perseverance to defeat him, it was a good job I did not have to visit the toilet because I doubt I would come back! This makes the Hammer House of Horror look like a Hollywood epic movie on a big screen. <br /> <br /> The only value of this movie was the never-ending offer of beautiful women. Not bad among them! <br /> <br /> If you want to spend time with your friends after a beer night, then this one is for you ... otherwise avoid it like a plague!
