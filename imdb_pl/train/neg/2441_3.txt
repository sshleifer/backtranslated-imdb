I thought that "Intensive Care" was quite bad and very involuntarily funny. But at least not as bad as I expected. Sometimes it is a bit uncertain, but it is never good shocking. <br /> <br /> SPOILER AHEAD <br /> <br /> The game is in funny times. But the classic moment of all times is that Peter (Koen Wauters) is stabbed and beaten by the killer. He lies moaning in the corner of the corridor. Amy (Nada van Nie) kneels beside him and asks: "Poor Peter, should I help you?" <br /> <br /> This movie was shot in Dutch and English. To save on costs, all license plates are US, and the background in the news studio is the panorama of Manhattan. Very funny if you're Dutch and you're looking at the original Dutch version.
