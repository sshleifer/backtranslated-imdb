"Dominique" is one of those films for which the expression "slow-how-treacle" had to be invented. Too many endless and repetitive sequences (how many times do we see Robertson go down the stairs slowly, because he hears someone playing the piano?). The REAL is redeemed at the end with a surprising twist of action, followed by a second turn, which only leaves a bad taste in our mouths. Not a nice movie.
