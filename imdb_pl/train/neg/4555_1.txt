This film does not reflect any mystery and intrigue offered by the book. The main point of the book, the observations, are not even raised, leaving the viewer wondering why everyone is doing so much of them and why they are willing to risk their lives. <br /> <br /> character development is not good at all. Lack of background and personal development does not leave the audience really worried about what is happening to them, so the action sequences fall. <br /> <br /> The search for manuscripts ends abruptly and without any real explanation, leaving no sense of satisfaction as to what the whole search was about. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst book adaptations I've ever seen. It's terrible and a waste of time. If you have not read the book, skip the movie and read it. If you have read the book, skip the movie and read it again. <br /> <br /> It's almost as if the purpose of the movie was to discredit the book, it's so bad to do it and funny. It is a pity, because it could be good if they used it at the peak of success and would probably be able to get a good screenwriter and some good actors. <br /> <br /> Please, do not waste time, READ THE BOOK !!!
