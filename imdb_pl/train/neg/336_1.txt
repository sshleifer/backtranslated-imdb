Why when the star reaches the top of the star chain, ruining all the good work, creating a bad movie? Burt Reynolds reached the top, and then began to do terrible car chases Hal Needham. Arnold Schwarzenegger has become the hottest property in Hollywood, only to invite himself to mockery with the frightening hero of Last Action. And here talkative Eddie Murphy erases memories from "Places of commerce" and 48 hours with this "family" adventure film, which is incredibly boring, childish and generally horrible misfortune, in which the chance to see the great breasts Charlotte Lewis in a tight blouse the most attractive aspect of the film . <br /> <br /> The story is clear. This applies to Murphy's social worker who was contacted by mysterious types and said he was the Chosen One. I chose for what, I hear you ask. His job is to save a Tibetan boy with mystical powers from the demon race that wants to rule the world. As the main demon, the classic actor Charles Dance looks terribly embarrassed to perform in the movie, but hey, I'm sure he was well paid for dedicating his talents. Of all Murphy's films, this is the worst. I have read some reviews that suggest it's nice to see Murphy in an unusual role in an informal movie, and although both points are loosely true, there is no forgiving fact that a movie - however unusual or informal it may be - is an absolute load of garbage. <br /> <br />
