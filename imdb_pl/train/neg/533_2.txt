I knew that 'Evening' was a girlish movie, so I expected to be bored. The evil wicked at IMDb said it was a "chick", but that your companion would survive. <br /> <br /> Survive? Yes. I'm still here, but when we got in together, we were amazed at the statement that it lasted only two hours - it seemed a much longer evening! I suppose that for Yanks it is supposed to be lofty or fascinating, because it concerns rich people living on the beach - well, right on the beach, in a house with a wide veranda and lawn, but without a visible mower. If it makes an impression on you, it may seem like a short movie. <br /> <br /> There is Monty Python's movie about Knight, who just will not die. It ends with filming (why the Yankees add a third syllable to the word I'm thinking) the torso on the road, still shouting threats to his nemesis. This movie is also a kind of living dead. Vanessa Redgrave dies and dies with inappropriate guilt. She is not worried that she was a wide, breathless bimbo, but she imagines that she is a murderess. <br /> <br /> Of course, being a girlish movie, there is a guy who should be a character of Mr. Darcy / Heathcliff. I am not a subwoofer, so I can not say I am a good judge in such matters, but a boring mollusk that has been thrown into this role seems to have only the title of a servant in its favor. It is a bloodless cipher. <br /> <br /> As you can guess, the main characters are not too policemen, but the latter do, surprisingly much worse. There's a guy whose only job is to respond to the news that his girlfriend is rude. Okay, but this is not Hamlet's role - why is it so bad? Forgetting that it was a girlish movie, I thought it would be thrown away because any decent friend would tell him that the face mushroom did not flatter him, but then I realized that she must have encouraged him to grow a "beard" because he looked worse without it. <br/> <br /> I have not slept, noticing which actors and actresses had their earmuffs attached to their ears for free or noticed interesting fragments of the scenery - if you are dragged into it, see if you can see the stuffed head of a buffalo, just something that You can expect a beach house. <br /> <br /> Apart from the obligatory wedding, there is only one action. You would think that they would do well. Unfortunately, the accident caused by the impact and escape is carried out by a car that was not there. When an accident is discovered, the cast goes about screaming for a character they can not know, it is nearby (but we do it as an audience). If they have no idea that a person is within a few miles of the place, why are they wandering aimlessly, shouting for him? I suppose the director's excuse is that it's supposed to be a half-memorable dream sequence ... <br /> <br /> Another element of the scenery that drew my attention was a saucepan with a copper bottom. I did not think that the technology created for this was developed until the 1950s.
