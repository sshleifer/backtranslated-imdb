Confused mess from beginning to end. As they used to say about Beatles songs, there was a secret message if you played LP back. If someone had the patience to watch scenes from these films from the beginning to the beginning, he would have gone with the same degree of disappointment. <br /> <br /> In addition to the whole of this psychedelic hodgeu, the similarity of flashbacks and false starts, the purest characters were the supporters of the film, who would have vengeance if the film had not been sorted. The two did not like either. Abuse, screams and threats were delivered in a comic book. I think that one-dimensional was exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Okay, so maybe the artists roll their eyes, relishing the fact that, unlike them, we plebeians just do not understand it. Well, I'm afraid there was nothing to gain. And the two main sins of every bad movie from beginning to end. Non-existent and pathetic story, if you want to call it that, and definitely the worst, not one character you care about.
