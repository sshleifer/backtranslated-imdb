I do not know who wrote the script for this movie, but from the first moment I was annoyed. With all the decisions they can make in the mountains, why do they make the decision which of them is the most dangerous? Why do criminals behave stupidly, even though they managed to get a huge sum of money from the bank and get away from it? Why does the main criminal not land on the helicopter, he does not shoot Stallone, he does not take the money and does not run away as a hostage with the chick? And there are more cases of illogical behavior. I gave this film 5 points for a good action and wonderful landscape scenery, but due to the illogical behavior of the characters, I can just give this film 1 point ...
