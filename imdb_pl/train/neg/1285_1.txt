Born, raised and educated in Scotland, I was terrified by the disgusting depiction of a man who was nothing but a bastard. What is worse, the thread of the whole movie was sex in one form or another, by implication or verbally. To see this, one would think that Scotland from the eighteenth century was inhabited by a group of sexual perverts and homosexuals. Lange was a joke appearing as a "young" mother at the age of 49, but Liam Neeson was even worse! "Bathing" in a Scottish lake is not something ordinary, as they presented it - but it gave them another opportunity to demonstrate how we were sexually driven. Save money and watch Pinnochio.
