When "My Deja Vu, My Deja Vu" aired last season, I was happy. Scrubs, I thought, do something wise and special about the concept of clips. Instead of playing film material, they play jokes in a conscious way and I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> I think it's really unfortunate that I was wrong. One season later they succumbed to what almost all comedic movies inevitably do, the music video ... and it looked like it was created by a kid with professional experience. The shaven head of Dr. Cox shows how lazy the editors were to connect him, because they do not reappear up to 4 episodes of "My Long Goodbye". I can not imagine that a wig is too much effort to maintain the continuity of what was once a well-constructed sitcom. Who knows why he was placed there, just seemed lazy and out of place, reminding me (to a large extent) of the sections emitted over the last year. <br /> <br /> Three seconds of clips jammed with the background music is Extra DVD on (very) rainy day, not a television episode in prime time.
