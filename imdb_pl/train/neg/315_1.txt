Observing this stinker is a cruel and unusual punishment at the hands of Sandler. A really slow and painful death. <br /> <br /> "I bought a DVD in a cart of 5.88 USD in Wal Mart. But the thought that echoes in my head is: "How can I get my money back?" <br /> <br /> The most unforgivable thing in the movie is that the boat JUST DO SINK! br /> The best constructive suggestion: Mystery Comedy Theater. You know this program on the SciFi Channel, in which a guy and his muppet machine falsify the invisible horror movies (Mystery Science Theater). IMMEDIATELY disable the comedy program and use this video. Without a good humorous parody of this train wreck, I'm afraid viewers can start tracking Sandler with ice cubes and chainsaws. <br /> <br />
