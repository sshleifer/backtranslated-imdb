Blank Check is one of the worst films of the nineties. The plot is completely pointless; his tone of loneliness is pathetic. Do you really believe that a twelve-year-old acting as a personal millionaire assistant can achieve everything in this film, eg Buy a residence for only $ 300,000. The concept, not to mention the bargain price, will be believed only by the most naive viewers. Please respect your intelligence and do not watch this awful, horrible movie.
