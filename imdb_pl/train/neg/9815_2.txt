This film begins with the presentation of the original idea, but later it became a great frustration. What is the matter of the original start, if the rest of the film did little to avoid the stereotypical plot? The film itself is very unbelievable. I would like to know exactly how someone enters the clinic, gets a nurse's outfit, kills a doctor, takes a patient out of bed, puts in his Chevy pickup and leaves? I do not think anyone could answer that question, so they just jumped onto another scene hiding these little details. Performances are simply bad. Black character is another "irritating crazy antagonist", without depth, completely linear character. After 20 minutes of film, most of the scenes are unbelievable, it seemed that they were placed there only for 90 minutes because they were totally unnecessary. The doctor sees a woman clearly under strong drugs, refuses to examine her, is thrown out of the house and just leaves the peace? The final scene made me laugh, only Mickey Mouse could do it more from reality. I give him 2 out of 10 for the first 10 minutes of the movie.
