I'm not one of those people who just watched the movie after watching the movie and decided to call it the worst movie ever made. If in doubt, look at my other reviews. However, for the first time I saw a film so horrible that I wanted to write how bad it was before it was over. <br /> <br /> I LOVE bad movies. For me Ed Wood is a genius, I thought that Bloody Murder, Jeepers Creepers and the most terrible horrors were good. However, there is nothing good about what I can say about this film. <br /> <br /> The plot does not really exist. If someone reading my review is wasting his money to see it, he can find out what the story might be, but I advise you to make nickel worth more than watching this movie. <br /> <br /> The special effects are bad. <br /> <br /> Acting is bad. <br /> <br /> Both wires are attractive, but that's all. <br /> <br /> I'm not the type to mess up the movie to anyone, but I INVITE anyone to send me an email to foxbarking@yahoo.com to ask for feedback about this movie before losing it to dimes. I will tell you everything. <br /> <br /> I love bad movies and I love horror and I love new inventive movies. I even love horror movies like Hostel (which some reviewers claimed it was, but of course they only thought that Roger Bart was in this and Hostel 2). But it can be the most worthless and stupid and stupid movie EVER made. <br /> <br /> And before you disregard this review, it comes from someone who has not only sat down during the entire House of the Dead premiere, but actually bought a copy of it.
