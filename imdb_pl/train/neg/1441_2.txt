Sam chose this movie on the cover, thinking that I am waiting for an adventure at the level of "Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom". Unfortunately, I was in a virtual yawning. However, not like the yawning I had before. This yawning was so big that I could barely find something good in this movie. The cover described amazing special effects. There were no. The film was so light that even the stereotypes were terribly depicted. It gives you the idea that you can solve problems with violence. Well, if you want to teach your children. I do not. Stay away from this. If you're looking for family entertainment, you can find something more inspiring somewhere else.
