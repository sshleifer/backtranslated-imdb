This Italian half-horror film starts very similar to a soft-core porn movie and turns into a secret that has a few to many loose goals to be good, and the fact that it's rather boring makes the movie rather unlikely. is considered my taste. The only thing that is really worth watching is the many tits scattered throughout the movie. The story has a guy who at the beginning of the movie tempts the girl to his castle, where he takes them to his dungeon, gets mad and apparently kills them. They show nudity, but they never really show the murders at this point in the movie. Then the guy finds a nice red head at the party and starts to meet her and marry her. He has something for the red heads you see because his beloved wife Evelyn was also one of them, she also died in circumstances that did not have to be a matter of viewership. After many talkative scenes, murders with snakes, foxes and the like begin. At this point, it's easy to find out who is responsible for the murders and what is his motive, then you have a nonsensical ending where everything ends up not so nicely. This movie just did not work for me, it left me a lot of questions, and the last third of the movie simply did not have tits from the first two thirds of the movie. Explaining Evelyn's death would help the movie if it were to end when Evelyn got up from the grave. It was acknowledged that the title is not completely misleading, because in a sense it left the grave, not under its own power. Gore is very light, because there is a scene with foxes and a scene at the end with quite a lot of blood. I thought that the film was a bit boring in most cases.
