Many of the main heroes of Hideo Gosha's 1969 film "Hitokiri" (killer, aka "Tenchu" - the punishment of heaven) were real historical figures (in the "western" format): Ryoma Sakamoto, Hampeit Takechi, Shimbei Tanaka, Izo Okada, ____ Anenokoji . The name "Hitokiri", a historical term, refers to a group of four super-swordsmen who committed numerous killings of key figures in the ruling Shogunate Tokugawa in the mid-nineteenth century under the orders of Takechi, the leader of "Loyalists" (ie ultra-nationalist, pro-imperial) Tosa clan faction. What was the fight about? Unfortunately, you will not find out in this movie. "A brilliant history lesson" indeed! <br /> <br /> No, Gosha is much more interested in showing you the usual bloody cutting and cutting and (from the absurd length) internal torment of the not-too-light killer Izo Okada than in revealing the actual story. Sakamoto, for example, was someone of historical importance, considered the father of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The closest Gosha is a history lesson in which Sakamoto, whom Takechi considers a traitor to the Loyalist case, comes to Takechi's residence to try to ideologically sway him. It starts with a conversation about the international political situation, with foreign warships in Japanese ports and Japan, which is too weak militarily to defend against them. Want to know more? Excuse me. Gosha cuts off this potentially fascinating lecture in the middle of a sentence (!). So much for informing the audience about a turning point in Japanese history. <br /> <br /> The film left me completely confused about the goals of both sides in this fight. For two and a half centuries, which Shogunate exercised central power in Japan, it was an institution dealing with the prevention of social changes, the preservation of feudal social relations. External pollution, both ideological and technological, was feared. According to this spirit, firearms, those "leveling" instruments in Europe and both Americas with which the villager could oppose the samurai were forbidden. Throughout this period, the emperor was nothing more than a spiritual figure. <br /> <br /> But in the cities that stood in the neutral zones between feudal lennami, a new class of merchants, landowners and craftsmen developed - a class known in Europe under the French name of the bourgeoisie. Inevitably, when this new class gained strength, it touched many boundaries of feudal society. As in Europe, the king (emperor) became the main figure in the struggle of the bourgeoisie for power against feudal aristocracy. But political leadership does not always fully understand the interests of the class it serves. When the outside world boomed in 1853, in the form of Admiral Perry's Black Ship, the ruling Japanese elite was in crisis. Their army did not match those foreigners. They also heard about the desolation that the British and French imperialists in China sowed. What should Japan do to protect itself against the fate of a weak neighbor? Surprisingly, some elements of the typically isolationist Shogunate were willing to open up trade with foreigners in order to get some of their advanced technology. This is the point of view represented (barely) in the movie Sakamoto. On the other hand, the loyal emperors of the ultra-nationalists, represented by Takechi, believed that they would be able to stop the foreigners by force if they could only stop the other faction from "selling off the country." (Sounds familiar?) So the murder of key Shogunates is okay - and we're leaving. <br /> <br /> Takechiego's motivations were the biggest brain teaser for me. Gosha suggests that he is fighting mainly for his personal promotion, not for the cause of the Loyalists. Can we accept this to represent the loyalist tenor as a whole? (Do you care?) <br /> <br /> Several reviewers have compared this movie with "Goyokin" that Gosha did the same year. But where "Goyokin" is a crackling, tense, adventurous yarn, with a hero worthy of compassion, "Hitokiri" is rotting, nowhere is it so appealing and lacks such a hero. Sakamoto could have been the protagonist of this film, but we must not get to know him - nor what he represents - well enough to achieve this status. <br /> <br /> Because of his great results for the previous five Kurosawa movies, the score of Masaru Sato here was very disappointing, it sounded like something rejected from the "Bonanza" episode. <br /> <br /> Barry Freed
