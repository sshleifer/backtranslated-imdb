As long as there was 3d technology (I think in the 1950s), animation was created. I remember specifically the cartoon Donald Duck with Chip and Dale. I do not remember that name right now, but the conspiracy was that Donald worked in the circus, fed the elephant peanuts, and Chip and Dale stole the peanuts. It was created for viewing in 3D probably in the 1960s. If you happen to watch Meet the Robinsons in 3d in cinemas, they showed this cartoon before the movie and explained the details of its origin. There are probably around 100 cartoons created especially for viewing through 3D glasses. This claim was a bad move, because it is not difficult to prove that they are wrong. In addition, it looks like a bad movie.
