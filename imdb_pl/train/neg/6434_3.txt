I am always surprised at how different all people are and how you have both extremes in almost every movie. People who think it's the best movie, and people who think it's the worst. <br /> <br /> Stigmas would not be the worst movie I've ever seen, but they're there. First of all, the sound. Producers spent more time on the soundtrack than on editing. It was so loud when the soundtrack played and no one spoke, and when Patrica spoke in her monotonous voice, it was difficult to hear her. <br /> <br /> I usually like Patricia and Gaberiala, but they were both flat in this movie. Patrica had essentially 3 emotions. Silently, with great pain or really bad, he has stigmata. The first one is dominant, the second is screaming pain, the third is raising the voice. This volume distinguished three, not emotions. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed the deep meaning and threads that everyone was talking about, and maybe I was distracted by the terrible style of filming and MTV. When you watch a 3-minute movie, you need quick cuts and slow motion to pass a quick story in a 2-hour feature film, it's nauseous. I do not see the point of seeing these women on the street and dropping the child. And no Pittsburgh is raining so often !! <br /> <br /> I think maybe a real story could be intended with something to say, but the whole budget was spent on buying music and equipment to make a slow rain throw arrows and rent this wonderful apartment where you lived Arquett, which resulted in the release of a man from history.
