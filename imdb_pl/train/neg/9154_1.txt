THE. WORST. MOVIE. ALWAYS. MADE. <br /> <br /> After seeing this supposedly homosexual movie, I suspect that someone has caught a brain damaged by a semi-blind neo-Nazi and told him to do the worst gay movie in history, in some illusive attempt to attack gay culture. I had to stop the movie and call a friend to get in to have someone to laugh at when I stopped the movie from shock, disbelief and indignation because of such pure foolishness. <br /> <br /> At the top of everything, horrible writing and acting, and an illogical and stupid plot, it's just a badly made movie. A dog with a handycam tied to the tail could do better. <br /> <br /> Seriously, after reading some of the positive reviews that this movie has here, I suspect that the writer must have half a dozen IMDb accounts. Anyone who says that this movie is even viewed as something other than a joke is a liar or hard to pay.
