I just finished the marathon in this series, and watching progress has been painful for me. From the fictionalization of historical elements to the terrible accent of O'Herlihy in later episodes, the series simply shrinks. If you are looking for a low-quality generated down from World War II, I could recommend season 1, but after that avoid everything, it turns into a step from telenovela, with increasingly worse plot and sensitivity. br /> Old black and white film is definitely the best type of entertainment with the Colditz name attached to it, and you can not even expect it.
