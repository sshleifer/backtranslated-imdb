Uwe Boll has made the impossible: create an adaptation of the game that remains at least somewhat consistent with the game; turned a game full of antisocial and offensive content into a movie full of anti-social and offensive content. So, as an adaptation, it is a success. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we're still dealing with Uwe Boll, so do not expect the film to be really good. when he has his moment, "Postal" very quickly wears his greeting and becomes a pain to sit down. <br /> <br /> In fact, Postal is a satire on the United States, as a twelve-year-old kid did. Boll seems to think that the offensive is linearly proportional to the comedic value: the more offensive, the more funny, and the more exaggerated. This results in the creation of a film that sets new levels without taste, while being extremely successful. Yes, some of the gags work, but it seems to be happiness. The most important points are the director sating himself, and people are very violently hit by trucks and other vehicles. The low points include ... well, almost everything else. <br /> <br /> After initial surprise, Postal just gets boring to watch. Yes, good and good joke, ten minutes, but everything else is made up of hordes of annoying characters shooting and racing each other after what seems like an eternity. <br /> <br /> I probably worked as a short movie, but it's not enough content for something that lasts over 90 minutes (though it seems twice as long). There are cool ideas and cool rehearsals, but they are hopelessly lost in endless and senseless action scenes and content that are offensive only because of the 4/10
