I just got back from "El Otro" playing here in Buenos Aires and I have to say that I was very disappointed. The film is very slow (do not get me wrong, I like slow moving movies!), Slowly to the point that I'm driving you crazy. You only hear Julio Chavez breathing heavily throughout the movie. It is a poorly made film, but more importantly, it is a film with no inspiration, I did not feel anything for the story or its character. <br /> <br /> "El Otro" was made just for the sake of filming ... makes us forget. I would advise you to give this film, if you want to see good Argentine movies, look for Sorin's films.
