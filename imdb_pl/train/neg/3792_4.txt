I've seen many, many Nutcracker production. Perhaps I was watching this movie from a contaminated theatrical director's point of view, but I was disappointed. I am sure that people in the specific ballet choreography industry consider this production to be impressive, but from a purely theatrical perspective I found everything, from design to choreography, to be bland and not matching the "film". None of the traditional "strange" and impressive costumes looked as it should be (i.e., the candies did not look like candy, the rats did not look like rats, but rather like chocolate kisses), the acting was weak, maybe the screen was too low, and choreography did nothing to me. This makes the whole exhibition very satisfactory (at best), as if it did not stand out from other productions. Remember, however, that it is from the artistic point of view of a theater director, not a dancer or choreographer, but a simple theater director.
