This is the worst documentary from Canada in history !!!! I am glad that the guys did not make another film. All they want to do is make a movie and it does not have to be the movie they wrote. They change the script to the person they are casting. I could not get out of the theater soon enough when I saw him at this year's Toronto Film Festival. Please, never watch this movie.
