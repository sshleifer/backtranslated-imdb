It is a weak film with a turbulent history of cuts and name changes. It does not work at all. First of all, dramaturgy is wrong. Initially, it is very slow, and then hastily and unsatisfactorily moves to the end. But there is also (and it may have to do with the cuts) difficult movement between species. It starts with being a thriller to be taken into account, and then degenerates into farce instead of satire. the ending can be fun, but it is also so blunt that I almost felt that it offended my intelligence (which is not enough). So the movie tries to be everything, but it really does not succeed at any level. This is also seen in the very unstable development of the character. You almost get the impression that Connery plays three roles, not one.
