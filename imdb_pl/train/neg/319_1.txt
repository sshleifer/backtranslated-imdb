My friend bought this movie for 1 pound, and even then it was very high. Despite big names such as Adam Sandler, Billy Bob Thornton and the incredibly talented Burt Young, this movie was as entertaining as taking a chisel and sticking it straight in the ear. He uses tired, lower parts of comedic techniques - consistently breaking the fourth wall when Sandler talks with the audience and seemingly pointless montage of "hot girls". <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship who wants him to be a successful comedian to be successful with women. When a comedian who lives on a ship - shamelessly called "Dickie" because of unfathomable success with the opposite sex - is considered lost at sea, Sandler's character, Shecker, has a great break. Dickie is not dead, he is rather locked in the bathroom, probably sick to the sea. <br /> <br /> Maybe he vomited the worst movie of all time with his mouth.
