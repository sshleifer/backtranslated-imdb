I saw this movie in the theater when I was a kid and I always remember it as my first experience with cheating a horrible movie with good advertising. The ad was great, but later I found out that it has every explosion or "special effect" in the whole movie (about 4), and even those that were not in the movie. There was something like an alien conspiracy, but the aliens were never shown in the film as far as I can remember. This was clearly the case of someone who broke down a cheap film intended for fraud. I think my world of innocence ended that day when I learned that there are bad people who make bad bad movies.
