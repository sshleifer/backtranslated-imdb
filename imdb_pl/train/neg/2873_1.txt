This movie presents a wonderful brunette named Danielle Petty. He has stunning green eyes and is in the first few scenes and the last scene. It is the only thing in this movie that is not repulsive. Maybe there is no future as an actress, because this kind of film is a kind of offensive catastrophe that kills careers. <br /> <br /> The movie itself has absolutely nothing to recommend. This is not a good horror, nor a good false journalist report, nor well done. No skills are seen in his production. It's like a bad student movie. The frightening elements of this story do not make you sick, it's the fact that it's so badly made that it makes you sick. If only I could, I would give this ZERO movie to the stars.
