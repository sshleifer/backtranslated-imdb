I'm sure it was one of those "WOAH!" Attractions in 1982, when Epcot opened, but now it's just stupid. The message of the film is trivial. The Circle's vision is confusing. And this awful song at the end is grinding. And I really want them to install seats. After so many wanderings, all you want to do is sit for a few minutes. And when you hear that there is a movie to see that it sounds quite impressive! You're playing, sitting, right? WRONG! You stand there for over 18 minutes, leaning on a small handrail. Disney should make a newer attraction similar to Maelstrom to liven up and replace this boring, unremarkable movie. NOT FUNNY. Skip it. Actually, skip Canada, unless you eat there. Go directly to the UK.
