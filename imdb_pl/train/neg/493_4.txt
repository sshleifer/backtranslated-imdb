A dysfunctional family returns home for the holidays and murders, which causes chaos. A violent sexy Milligan in her most home made. A bit better than a home movie (like most Milligans films) is a journey to deprivation style from the 1960s. Known for the abundance of nudity and sex, this film is neither sexy nor macabre, it is now more peculiar (though definitely judged). The film suffers from uneven casts and cheap production (no one was ever sure where the money went to his films because he was always broke). It's a bad bad movie that is not worth watching, except for a complete Milligan or because it has cool people.
