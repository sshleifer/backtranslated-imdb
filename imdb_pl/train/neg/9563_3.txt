It is loosely based on the ideas of the original hit of the 80s. It is set in today's day, because at the beginning we see a base in Afghanistan destroyed by UAV. <br /> <br /> And this is where the movie jumps over the shark. UAVs are not armed. They may be, but I do not think they've ever really been tried. We see a computer that developed this operation, named R.I.P.L.E.Y. We were introduced to the "hacker". Is Farmer (he is good at chemistry and electronics, who does not make him a computer hacker) and his interest in love, Annie) and the first attempt to hack Willa is not only a complete failure, his IP address is also logged in and Annie guessed who it was. We also meet with my mother Wills, who works for a chemical company. <br /> <br /> Wills receiving money from neighbors bank account (Mr Massude) is not a hack (he helped him set up an account), then we get a nod towards the original movie, in which they decide not to play in Global Thermonuclear War and play in The Dead Code. The trail that runs the RIPLEY office is NOT on Will, but on Massude's computer, so all the evidence collected was useless against Will. <br /> <br /> Exactly why RIPLEY has shut down the Villa machine is not explained (the game only plays online?), and the reason why you had to turn off all the electricity in the entire block in which he lived. Why an anti-terror agency would consider this a real goal is extremely questionable. When it comes to RIPLEY, you activate your mobile phone? I do not think he was connected to the computer, and the message would not be played until he picked up the phone, so there's bad hacking. <br /> <br /> RIPLEY agents arrive at Massude's home, take him and Will receives an envelope that turns out to contain a lot of money. Is not the search for the license plate of the car that Massude has taken away a "hack" because you never see it hack into a DMV computer. RIPLEY agents who catch Dennis at the airport when they look for him will not have the right to arrest or detain him. Willa's mother also did not "steal chemicals and biocides". And even if she did, they had no right to arrest or detain Dennis. Patriot Act or not. <br /> <br /> I do not know why Will worried that he would be arrested for any crime in Canada, because it is a completely different country in which different laws apply than in the US. <br /> <br /> The computer went crazy and all actions taken against Will, his mother and Dennis were not approved by the government agency. The phone's phreak, which we'll see if it does, is the first show of hacking skills in the movie. We also have a hack in RIPLEY that seemed too easy for such a powerful system. <br /> <br /> The "guy" who was running at Annie at the airport and was also watching them on the street, which had nothing to do with RIPLEY and the ridiculous idea that RIPLEY could track the phone while the underground was as stupid as the idea that the computer reads lips. <br /> <br /> Another reference to the original film, in which they mention Stephen Falken as a designer replaced by the RIPLEY system, Joshua Project. We discover that the "guy" who met Annie is Falken (he did not play with the sadness of the original actor) who falsified his own death. <br /> <br /> We also see that WOPR is "what will help" beat RIPLEY, and they still use the same voice. Falken and WOPR are destroyed too quickly after they are almost not used (the same explosion should kill Will, Annie and the Russian, and they are unlikely to create a stand-alone computer system that has the ability to bombard or drop chemical weapons) a country, where it works. <br /> <br /> The whole thread and the idea of ​​"decontamination" are completely unbelievable. Such orders would have to go through the president or chiefs of staff, so another laugh and an incredible idea. <br /> <br /> IP intrusions against RIPLEY are not done by Will, he just contacts one of his friends who suggests and implements this idea. It's too funny that Will will get a login just from increasing RIPLEY Joshua's action as a backdoor in RIPLEY (especially after being torn to pieces) is an amazing scream and scream of a very desperate writer who had no ideas and wanted to make this movie was finished with. <br /> <br /> In RIPLE is the awful good Y game Dead Code and we see the countdown (speaking 17 minutes), and RIPLEY says "Decontamination in 30 minutes", how it is, when they can not even keep up with your own clock? RIPLEY's mission against Philadelphia is paused (in my opinion too easy) and decides to attack Joshua in his inner circuits and redirect the missile aimed at Philly to Washington, where RIPLEY is stationed. The idea of ​​nuclear exchange, so that RIPLEY would realize what he is doing, will not work (surely he would already know if Joshua had initiated her, just as he had learned this lesson in the original movie?) It's another nod to the original movie. <br /> <br /> Their struggle with RIPLEY's repetition of the very words of Joshua from the end of the original movie shows how many original ideas he could not come up with. <br /> <br /> If you want to point out bad and stolen ideas, Randall Badat and Rob Kerchner are guilty. It's a terrible movie and it's best to avoid it.
