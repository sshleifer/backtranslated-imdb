This is one of the worst horrors I've ever seen ... Unfortunately, I'm a horror lover and I will rent any horror movie, unless it was not created for t.v. When you look at the box, it is said that it is R for gore and some language ... Where was the blood? Was it one good death scene in which you really saw gore? I could overlook it if there was a short nudity or good dialogue. In this lame movie there was not even one witty or funny line. Sometimes horror movies are amazing because they are so stupid, but it was just sad.
