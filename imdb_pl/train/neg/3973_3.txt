Acting was poor, but in horror I can live with it if history is good. There was no. The initial event was an awkward and obvious trick of using the worship of children by most people. OK fine. Fast forward to the "place in the country" where they recover emotionally. I like the revelation of ghosts. OK, cool - it will be a horror of a supernatural character, with rotting things partially in our world partly in ... anywhere. The action begins to pull like a dog with three heads in the excitement of cats and birds - Is there a force of evil trying to attack them directly? Is there any evil force trying to attack them directly - to force people to do terrible things that they would not really do? Oh, wait, no, maybe the whole REGION is some kind of psychic echo chamber in which ambient disagreement can resound in murder? OK, wait - maybe it's just one small, mentally tangled boy in the style of "Delbert", who misses his mommy and is on some sort of madness, like Kates from Norman Bates, knocking? Oh, yes - extra points for: the only black figure seems to be the grandson of the "our gang" porter. The actor plays it as simple as possible, taking into account the bad dialogue, but the fact is that his goal is: "You did everything to get out, hey, boss!" At least they wrote it so cleverly that the GTF disappeared . The piece with the muted and outstretched girl was definitely terrifying, just like the chick in the shower. These were just two of the few really tasty treats in this movie. The problem is that they are connected in a disharmonious way, like a bite of a steak, a bite of chocolate and a Gummi bear bite. Everyone is great but confused? Bleah! Such potential. Wasted.
