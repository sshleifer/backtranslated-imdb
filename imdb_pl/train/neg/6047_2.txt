What made French Connection work so well was the relationship between Doyle (Hackman) and Russo (Scheider). In this disaster directed by Frankenheimer (who also brought us such jewels as Raindeer Games and Dr. Moreau Island), the film focuses on Doyle and his special obsession to get Charnier (Rey). The fictitious idea that NYPD will allow Doyle to travel to Marseille to find Charnier with the help of French local authorities, laughs loudly funny. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Charnier did not leave the city with 65 kilograms of pure slap !!! The street's value is 32 million, but yes, let's send Doyle to find this guy, after all it was his pinch. Please!!! The story was poor. Acting was horrible (with the only exception of Hackman, who completely took over his role). The direction was everywhere. Even the cuts between the scenes were terrible. Do yourself a favor and watch the first installment twice and skip this one.
