There are two reasons why I did not give 1 this movie. One of the reasons is the work of some actors (such as Malcolm McDowell and Gwynyth Walsh) who have tried to play on their usually good level of acting. However, in many scenes they were blocked in some way by bad scripts. <br /> <br /> Another reason is the cool idea and appearance of the Cyborg, which is quite different than most other roles I have seen so far. <br /> <br /> Everything else in this movie is as bad as it gets. Boring scenes, useless and boring dialogues, bad script work. And it seemed that it was the first movie for many actors. This may be an interesting story, but it has not worked out completely.
