Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) is back on the screen after his debut title, this time it's a movie played on erm? During a diving trip, Rome finds a beauty blond body at the bottom of the sea, her feet, as you might expect, locked in cement. Rome immediately in the case after the employment of Waldo Gronski mountain. Rome is in danger immediately, because he must investigate some types of mafias that have turned against him, and he is the main suspect, he must now set out and hope to solve the matter himself. Sinatra is trying hard to sell us bad jokes and make us believe that he is a good detective, not to mention that he is sexually attractive to raucous Raquel Welch, but he does not succeed in this unfortunate project with ham. A sincerely funny affair that surrounds every woman, it's pretty amazing, every woman in the movie is a stupid head who likes to lean in front of the camera, director Douglas obviously undertakes to enlarge the cracks of his asses every time they bend their back muscles. There is even a ridiculously besieged gay figure who is plagued by faith, it was a movie created by "real men" for "real men" to confirm their own weakening sexuality, it's a shameful mess.
