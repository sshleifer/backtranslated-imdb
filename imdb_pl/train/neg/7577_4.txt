It's just a bit attractive for fans of "bad movie" entertainment. It is more profitable for pop culture students of the 1970s: fashion, furniture, attitudes and this great "feminine Libyan" moment of the early seventies, when it was still new and innovative for a self-employed, independent woman who could exist. <br /> <br /> "Superchick" (Joyce Jillson) has achieved a successful career when it comes to a scandalous career (after all, what a stewardess is, but a waitress at 30,000 feet - the same applies to men), she slept with many men, he could protect himself and others (karate) and he was not attached to anything. It is a kind of liberated woman who scared off the anti-feminist juices, those backward idiots who believe that no woman is complete without her husband. <br /> <br /> The "sexy flight attendant" was a powerful archetype at the end of the sixties to the seventies, (even in "The Partridge Family", "I remember the sway of a bachelor Ruben Kincaid who constantly gets stewardesses) and from this point of view this stupid film is an important capsule of the pre-culture of pop culture, free-love, female libia, the swinging seventies. The plot, however, is quite awful. And for those cavemen in the audience there are several naked breasts to look at.
