Another cult hits again. This is not a spoiler, because REAL ends after examining the people who brought this too long, pseudo-scientific infomercial ... Ramtha's School of Enlightenment. <br /> <br /> When any religion / philosophy is needed To hide behind a screen similar to OZ, I am leaving. Thank you Ramthie. I watched a borrowed copy of this movie on the recommendation of a "friend" ... to waste valuable resources on a New Age lobotomizer would be tragic. I can only hope that they "really believe they can walk on the water" enough to accept this "logical" ending ... in other words; Come, drown ... or shut up :-) As a movie ... it deserves a strong "1" entertainment value, especially for creating the most disliked character in the film's history (roommate of the photographer ... eeeeeek!). If you must see this movie, borrow it from one of the brainwashed people who recommended it.
