I bought this movie for 1 euro, not knowing what it is about. I thought, "hmmm, a movie called a mutilating man must be, if not very funny, at least filled up." It was not funny. It was disturbing. Very disturbing. And I do not mind disturbing movies, but it just meant nothing, except that hurting children is not a good thing. hmmm ... The quality of the pictures was terrible. Acting ... there was no acting. Just a fcker-up fcker crippling for over 90 minutes. This is probably the material for judging sicko on extreme gore. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this. It is not worth your time. It's just awful. I regret that I never bought it. <br /> <br /> They should maim the guy who did it
