It's hard to believe that people really like this thrill! I think children can enjoy it, but for me it's a kind of movie that parents can not stand. Predictable plot, boring Belushi and probably the worst child actor of all time. I will give the director some responsibility for the child, but it was really painful. I feel embarrassed now because people know it's her. When I sang Star Spangled Banner, I had to turn off the sound - then I came here and discovered that they did it because they won Star Search. I always thought that Jim Belushi should be ashamed to trade the name of his wonderful, unfortunately missing brother, and that's absurd to show why. Zero stars.
