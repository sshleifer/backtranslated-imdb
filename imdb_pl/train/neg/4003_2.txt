Big disappointment. It was one of the best British crime / detective dramas from the 90s, which developed a fascinating title character played by Scottish Robbie Coltrane. However, this one-off has little to add and perhaps suffers from an inevitable disappointment due to increased expectations when the favorite program returns after a long break. Coltrane does not have much to do, much more attention is given to the uninteresting killer, and in what he must act, he seems uninvolved, almost bored. The story of a former soldier is written by books, and the attempt to update us about Coltrane's family life seems light. Perhaps if the writers had a whole series in front of them instead of just one two-hour show, they would write it with greater depth. As it is, skip it and watch the old Cracker from the 90s, which is far better.
