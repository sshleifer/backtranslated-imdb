First of all, let me emphasize that Sam Niel is nowhere in this film. What is the movie without Sam Niela. Has anyone seen Event Horizon. D-Wars had the potential to make a movie about a dragon that controls lizards with rocket launchers sound cool, but unfortunately not. No, not Sam Niel, there is no good movie. I recommend taking $ 5 for hiring D-Wars and adding 10 to 5 and buying a Sam Niel movie - apparently to send this, I have to have ten lines of text, so heres a list of Sam Niel movies I recommend <br /> <br /> -jurassic park - dead calm -hunt on red October -vent horizon-no jurajski park trzy <br /> <br /> generally D-Wars is a pile
