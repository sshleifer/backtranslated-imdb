I'm now watching this movie on WTN because it was the channel that the TV was turned on when I turned it on. This is a rather unreliable and quite boring story about the pastor's wife (Alexander Paul) falling in love with a young stud / tramp (with an abs laundry) played by Corey Sevier. It can not be a story. Corey often takes off her shirt and Alexandra faints. I have the impression that he should not be good and that is why he has trouble with the skinny Alexandra Paul. This is not so important because, as I said, I often take off my shirt and just notice the cleft of my ass. There is a lot of sax on the soundtrack, which is simply painful.
