What a huge pile of dung. Shot-on-video (REALLY crappy camcorder, NOT digital) rubbish heap. This is undoubtedly the stupidest thing ever created. The fact that this is actually bullshit is completely asana. Anyone who sees it will become more dumb for watching it. Seriously. I felt that after seeing the trash I killed a few brain cells. Positive reviews of this rubbish about $$ have obviously been made by a "filmmaker" (and I use this term VERY loosely) of myself and / or his family and friends, because no normal person with the intelligence of squirrels really does not like this wasteful life. Trust me, stay away from this movie. You will thank me for that. Avoid it like herpes.
