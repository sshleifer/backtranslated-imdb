We all ask ourselves the question: "why are not they making films that were just right, instead of reworking those that were already great, they can only improve this way?" Well with Prom Night they made a recurring version of Jamie Lee Curtis' mean shitty movie 80s and made it even WORSE. It is paint by numbers, which clearly tries to attract young teenagers (hence the lack of violence, etc.), Knife in this slasher movie is dull. The director spends so much time focusing on trying to make an attractive killer looking a bit scary that everything else comes out of the window. The cast, which includes Britney Snow (who was great at painting the hair), tries their hardest, but the material gives them nothing to do but seems scared. More annoying is how the death scenes are treated (he will hear the attack, but I will not see him). It also seems that the only place where this knife worked in this film was the assembly package, because the film looks as if it has been massacred (I am not guessing anything terrible, which ended on the floor of the cutting room, so as not to scare the children). pours money from Americans sending this movie to number 1 at checkout !!! Slasher's films are great fun, but in the case of Prom Nights I wanted to download the original. I've seen more terrifying episodes of OC and Dawsons Creek
