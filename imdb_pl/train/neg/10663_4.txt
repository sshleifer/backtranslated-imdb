The film was not a loss, except for a few boring scenes between them. But the cast of women gave quite a good performance than men who were funny. <br /> <br /> But Krista Allen really loved the movie. Her voice was so seductive and sexy. really is one of the best in such roles. In the last 5 minutes she also played well as baddie, which is an interesting part of the movie. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds was not very good and it was not his best as the action star. He could have chosen a better scenario than this one. I really think he did for money.
