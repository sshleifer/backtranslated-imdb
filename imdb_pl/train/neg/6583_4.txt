Interesting idea and story, which did not really work. <br /> <br /> When you see a movie, you may feel unhappy with the ending, just like me. I really did not know who to reach in the movie, Taye Diggs looked bored like a detective, the rest of the characters seem to be one-dimensional and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> If the victim of Alicia (Mia Kirschner) was a more nice girl, we could really enjoy seeing how the plot unfolds, and the perpetrator is brought to justice. The problem was that she was as bizarre as other girls, turning a sweet girl into an opportunistic blacksmith. I do not understand the moral message of this film, and as a thriller and thriller does not work.
