I wanted to hit the TV. Watching this was torture. I hated it. Never watch this movie. Terrorists are annoying. Adam Sandler is annoying. Normally I like him, but not in it. I wanted to break a DVD. This is the most annoying movie in the world. The comedian he is jealous of is unbearable. The only amazing part is the rocker with black teeth that collects all girls. It was so annoying that I wanted to hit the TV. DO NOT BUY THIS FILM unless you WANT AN ANNOY. If you like Adam Sandler, do not buy it. It just makes you hate him. Do yourself a favor, if you see her in the store, hide her, so as not to expose everyone to the danger of buying it. It's the $ 1.99 loss I paid for it.
