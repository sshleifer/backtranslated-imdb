I watched the movie last night and hoped for the best after seeing all the cool trailers. Even the DVD cover looked good. As soon as I started to look at it, I thought how others "oh my God, what is it." moments that were a bit scary, but then the mood was ruined by stupid music. During the scenes, which were supposed to be a scene full of tension, there was rock and opera. That's what ruined it for me and I shook my head, thinking that damn again I lost my rental money and was cheated by the cover. Nothing against the music itself, it was just in the wrong parts of the movie. Who edited the movie has no idea what they are doing. The cover showed lightning, suggesting that they had been caught in a storm at sea. That would be more interesting, but it did not happen. Acting was not the worst I've ever seen, because they're all unknown, and it's obvious their first movie. Another reason I was disappointed was the fact that the plot did not make sense. At the beginning, 2 men saw that all teenagers got a boat, then at the end there was supposedly only one girl, and others were either her imaginary friends or ghosts, which I'm not sure because she was very badly introduced. WhyteFox, who wrote a comment on this subject, claims that this is a real story. He or she believes in ghosts and ghosts and says there is a movie with a haunted boat nearby. In this film there was no mention of it being a real story. I've never experienced something like that myself, but I'm not saying it's impossible. I suppose that if you are interested in renting this movie, do it at your own risk. If you like amateur student horror movies, you can like it.
