Words fail me. <br /> <br /> And this is not common. <br /> <br /> Actually it could be great, fun sci-fi B-movie, but unfortunately it was not. Rarely in the field of drama, so many competent actors struggled in vain with such a canine breakfast from the script. I can only support the comments of the previous reviewer - go and clean the bathroom. In fact, we do everything except watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Positives: nose Lucy Beeman. Negatives: everything else. <br /> <br /> The most accurate line: "Nowhere is it going". <br /> <br /> If only any plastic surgeon could meet such a fate.
