This complete mess of the film was directed by Bill Rebane, a man partially responsible for the truly infamous anticlassic Monster a-Go Go. As I approached the end of The Cold, I came to the unbelievable conclusion that the film was actually even worse than the shocking 1960s. History? what is it like? is about three eccentric millionaires who invite a group of people to their distant mansion to play a series of macabre games. Anyone who manages to keep pace and survive until the end will win $ 1,000,000. It's a very simple plot, but Rebane still manages to make the proceedings incomprehensible. Things happen. Characters are completely forgotten. Nothing makes too much sense. And then it ends. Weirdly. I mean, what the hell was going to end up exactly? I think that you have to draw your own conclusions. Production values ​​and acting are undoubtedly the standard of pornographic films. In fact, Pamela Rohleder (Shelly) is not even that good. She is so unbelievably terrible that she is convincing. Unfortunately, the same can not be said about this whole shit festival, it's just a chance rotter in the basement.
