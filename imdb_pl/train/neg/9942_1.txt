At least the seats in the theater were comfortable and I ate the corn as loud as possible to drown out the worse dialogue. This is not a movie for girls. All the guys who like it are the ones that ladies can be sure of. Stupid history, average dialogue and a cheap movie in general. I have seen many, many films, but this is the new winner in the wrong category. If you happen to see this, the only thing you will be waiting for is the ending. So you can end up with the theater as soon as possible.
