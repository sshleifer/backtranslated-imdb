This film is nothing "Office space" except the assumption. The office space was fun. I would not recommend this movie to anyone because I did not laugh at the whole movie. Mr. Cornbluth's lenient tirades quickly become more annoying than 15 Jason Alexanders in the same room. If you decide to watch this movie, take advantage of a free rental or watch it in someone's home to be able to leave if necessary.
