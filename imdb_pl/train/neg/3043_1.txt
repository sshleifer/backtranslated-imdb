This film is supposed to be a "carefree" story about Miko≈Çaj and his "magical and mystical" miracles. But instead it comes out as completely frightening. Two things in this movie that stand out in my view as scary are: 1) the way Santa looks. and 2) "ordinary strange dances of Satan" just strange dances are simply disgusting. Watch this movie only if it's a MSTed version or if you like very good laughter. I can not believe it is a movie for children.
