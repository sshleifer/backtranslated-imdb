Lorenzo Lamas performs as a CIA agent who captures an exotic beauty named Alexa, kidnaps his daughter and forces her to fight with former employers. O.J Simpson is also on board to provide a little credibility for the not-so-talented team. I must admit that I am not a fan of Lorenzo Lamas or his films. He stinks. However, compared to the sleeping wife of O.J Simpson and Lamas, Kinmont, Lamas seems to be ah, Jean-Claude Van Damme. I only saw the CIA because I was again interested in O.J Simpson's process because if your parents had a cable and extra channels, you could not get away from the movie. in 1994, you could go to the Amish community, and some moron would play on your portable TV set. The film itself is a collection of lame sequences of actions and would be intriguing, although the value of shock of O.J Simpson leaping on fireballs and exchanges would be one liner delivering unintentional humor. Where were Bobby Knight and Kobe Bryant to make this complete camp classic? <br /> <br /> * with 4- (Bad)
