Ignoring (if possible) tedious unpaid smoking of marijuana (which seems to be mandatory in films financed by the Australian government) cast of the film gives quite reliable results. It's so far away. The rest is just awful. The plot is overloaded with "wow" symbols, which are supposed to look good on the film, but they do not go anywhere. A brutal example is the giant peach swimmer, of course left from the city parade and donated by the local canning factory. It was too tempting to waste what, let's hope, a free, yet irrelevant, prop! Peach receives a cursory, unexplained washing at one stage, but it ends there. <br /> <br /> Similarly, the imaginary road sign of the "black patch" in which Steph's parents were killed, is to symbolize a possible escape from her past, but her escape to what? She had quite a lot of space in which she was, especially considering her visual disability and the endless, loving patience and concern for understanding the young babysitter. <br /> <br /> The Guinness Award for a banal melodrama, however, goes to Alan's characteristics. Alan is successfully pursuing the noble role of the trade union husband of trust, but "rats" on his colleagues, becoming the superior of vile multinationalism - he hiss! hiss! As the superior, Alan does the malicious dirty job of the boss. He introduces relief until the surprise, surprise, the whole plant is closed, and Alan is pathetic, without work. There are no zones free of clich√©s, mate! Not only that, but Alan also loses the seductive Steph from the most unlikely relationship you will encounter. If you think the story is melodramatic and didactic, do not ask for details. What is the importance of shaving cream on Steph's seductive leg? Why a hotel where a couple loves, in the end does not suppose that someone gets an illegal entry into one of his most wonderful bedrooms, and among other pandemonomy sheets are regularly soiled - quite spectacular. To sum up this film in one word: Avoid, Avoid, Avoid.
