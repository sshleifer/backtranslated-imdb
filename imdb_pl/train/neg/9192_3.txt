I found this movie in the "horror" section of my video store. This seems reasonable, because most zombie movies have their place there. From the trilogy "Dead" Romero to "28 days later". However, after watching this video, you can quickly see what the movie really is. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is a music video that is progressing faster and getting more and more bloody. There is no horror here. It's just half-decently staged action scenes that soon become tiresome because they last ... and last ... and last ... and you'll soon feel that you're accidentally skipped 3 minutes, but no, that's what the movie did. Detriment. I think that everyone can find a better use for $ 7 million in the film industry than make it solid. Although some of the 360 ​​effects were cool, but once again, they were already used and became boring, because each time it was the same stunt, with only a different character. <br /> <br /> Also what is annoying ROYALLY is a combination of material from the arcade game. I played this game. It sucks. Why did they bring him here? Oh, that's right, it's not a movie, but a video and it's a bad movie. 3/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R: a lot of violence / gore and vulgarity
