This is one of the most stupid movies I've ever had the misfortune to watch! I should have expected it, after watching the first two, but I still fall into this kind of movies thinking that "maybe this time they did it well". No - not even close. <br /> <br /> Where to start? And what about special effects ... To give you an idea of ​​what goes into SFX in this movie, at some point a soldier shoots at the "Raptor" as he runs down the hall. Even in less than a second of time on the screen, the viewer can easily see that it is just a man with a tail that apparently stuck to him while running. Bad Bad Bad Bad. <br /> <br /> And what about acting? If so you can call it. There is one character who is supposed to come from the south. However, after six years of living in the south, I have never heard this way of speaking. Perhaps he has some strange disability - an inability to talk normally. It is fascinating that the character does not do anything that requires such accent from him - that's why there was no reason for the actor to try to do it. <br /> <br /> What about the story? It's quite basic - the Raptors are running away, people with weapons have to chase them. I'm starting to wonder why the dinosaurs in these films always go to the nearest tunnel system ... will they not stop outside to hunt for prey? Well, at least they have a good feeling that there are very few appearing in the film that supposedly revolves around them. <br /> <br /> Other things - let's say that you are in a building and you know that there is a man eating birds of prey. Would you decide to devote some time to argue about who is better - Army or Marine? And then decide for a wrestling contest to settle this? And what about the idiotic idea that they must track down predators - Share on groups of two people. Did they never watch any horrors (or at least an episode of Scooby Doo)? In short, this is one of the most stupid movies. I miss him unless you want to moan through the movie.
