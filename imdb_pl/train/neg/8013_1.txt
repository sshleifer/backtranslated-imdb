One would think that a film about the reconciliation of a young man with his growing homosexuality would not be boring. Think again. This production should be bottled and sold as a remedy for insomnia, because it is about ten times more powerful than any sleeping aid on the market. It's almost as if the filmmaker * considered * making a movie, but became lazy and decided instead to run a series of random (and random) shots and scenes of go-nowhere, throw a few real scenes containing the real game, pretend that good lighting does not have meaning in the process of creating the film and includes it with the film "arthouse". This is just such a shitty product that makes it easier for many traditional filmmakers to buy indie film movement, and which stops public opinion from making indie films easier to use. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in movies on this subject, it would be better to match some of the short films available on the Logo website or to rent Get Real. Better yet, read Stone Butch Blues. Whatever you do, skip this long-lasting piece of ruins.
