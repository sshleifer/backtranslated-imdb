We all know that the movie is never entirely fair to the book, but it is unique. Important characters were cut, Blanca and Alba were in fact mixed into the same character, most of the main threads and main elements of the main story were eliminated. Clair's clairvoyance was extremely disregarded, which made her look much more shallow than the one I met in the book. In the book, we'll learn more about her powers and the important effects she has had on so many people, which in turn was a key element in the life of the family. In the film, she was nothing more than an exceptional lady. The relationship between Esteban and Pedro Tercero (Tercero-third is, incidentally, son, and thus Segundo-second-) and his links with Esteban and his grandson of Panchy Garc√≠a (not the son he also recognizes) is fragmented in half, and its importance reduced. <br /> <br /> One of the most fundamental things in a book that the movie is completely devoid of: it's called the "House of Ghosts." Where is the house? The story of 3-4 generations of the family is about to rotate around the "big house on the corner", the line described many times in the novel. A home in the fundamental part of the story, but the film unjustly brings it to a plain background. <br /> <br /> If I had not read the book before, I would never guess that such a juicy, shallow movie can be based on such a rich and fun novel.
