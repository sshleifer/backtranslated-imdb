You should know that I am the type of person who watches even the worst movies to the very end, often out of pure morbid curiosity. I even looked at Leprechaun until the end, before I succumbed to the temptation to rip my eyes out and step on them. You should also know that this movie was in my video recorder for less than half an hour before I made a crazy jump on the stop button and withdrew the rental office to put as much distance as possible between me and him.
