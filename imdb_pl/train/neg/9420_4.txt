Continuation of the much-better "Cleopatra Jones" in 1973 has a statuesque black actress Tamara Dobson, who returns to his role as a chic, super-hard drug agent who in Hong Kong casts a ring of heroin. Cross-pollination of blaxploitation and kung fu B movie is fun at first, but in the end means a flag. The final shoot-off is right on the assembly line, and Dobson herself seems less energetic than before (she is still sexy, and she puts a special spin on her comely slim dialogue, but this environment could have been too much of one thing for her - she's tired) . Stella Stevens is playing in a villa this time; he's good, but he can not match Shelley Winters in his predecessor. ** with ****
