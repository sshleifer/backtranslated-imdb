This is literally the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. This may be the worst movie possible. Some movies are so bad that they are good; this movie is so bad it goes beyond a pleasant camp and it just becomes incredibly horrible. It's anti-enantiodrome. We bought him with the intention of condemning, and all my family gathered for an evening of clever remarks; instead, we sat in a dazed silence, sympathetic to poor Peter Sellers. <br /> <br /> This is worse than the animated Lord of the Rings. It's worse than the Matrix sequels. He is worse than Krull. It's worse than any Batman movie. <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances let the film come close to ten feet from the TV.
