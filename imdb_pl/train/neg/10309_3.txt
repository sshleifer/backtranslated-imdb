"CIA Codename: Alexa" is an absolutely terrifying piece of the classic movie of Luc Besson "La Femme Nikita" (1990). The film is basically about a woman who has been accepted and trained by the CIA and is forced to perform a secret mission for them. (Almost the same structure of the history of La Femme Nikita). Lorenzo Lamasa and O.J. Simpson is probably the worst in cinema history. The "acting" of the Lamas is simply the evil personification of Steven Segal. Watching Orenthal's acts in this movie is an amazing experience. <br /> <br /> Writing and acting is so weak in this movie that sometimes it's funny. There are so many "conventions" of action movies in the film that it's absurd: unnecessary car explosions, people flying through glass windows, terrorists, evil horse tails, etc. The musical result resembles David Michael Frank's score for "Hard to Kill" (1990), which is a continuation of Steven Segal's theme of this film. There are a lot of martial arts in the film and it's pretty well done for low-budget American production. Mindless action and timeless game never give up and I must admit that I was slightly entertaining. <br /> <br /> Lorenzo Lamas looked like an action star in the early 90s, but he certainly is not a star of action, that's why he makes soap operas, not cinema hits. My recommendation is to omit "CIA Codename: Alexa" and check "La Femme Nikita".
