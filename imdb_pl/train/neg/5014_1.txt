The film has the longest, most tortured and painful ending of every movie I have seen for a long time. Unfortunately, it starts right after the opening credits. January Jones gives such a wooden performance, I was surprised that she did not get up in flames when she approached the candles in the film. I really do not remember her from other movies she made (a blessing I have to believe in. I never criticize performances because there are too many things in the movie that can affect it, but in this case it's so bad that it actually distinguishes from the lines and situations that Meryl Streep would have problems with, but sometimes I swear she reads from the memory card switched off For REAL! The plot, dialogue and tempo are as bad as you'll ever see, but there is still no excuse for this performance or for a director who would allow me to do this I feel sorry for the other actors. The cruel intentions / 10 small indians / breakfast club have packed themselves into a rotten burrito, and then they were returned by a writer-director from primary school.
