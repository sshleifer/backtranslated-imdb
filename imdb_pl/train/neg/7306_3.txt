Really one of the scariest movies I've ever sat in. I never really took the time to write one of them, but I felt compelled to do so after I was a witness to this insult to filmmaking and felt a little sad to be honestly wasting my time on such a piece. There were so many parts that enraged me with their total randomness and lack of sense (eg When the police would ever shoot people with infectious diseases? When hospitals ever go through such people because of lack of medicine? Why did the guy who noticed spy on his wife wandering outside in a dressing gown, carrying a gun while rolling on the bed?). Also the characteristics - which we almost expected in such films - were awful (eg. The way a blonde - I do not remember his name and did not throw anything - completely turned away from my girlfriend and escaped to leave her) and I finished, wishing so that everyone will meet with terrifying ends! The production was frighteningly chaotic, and the photos had nothing to write about.
