So why is this show sucked? Unfortunately, this is really the only question because there is no doubt that this is happening. <br /> <br /> For people unfamiliar with the premise of the show Cavemen focuses on the number of doomed Cavemen Neanderthal TV series and their struggle for survival in today's America and is based on the characters in the television ads series Geico Insurance. The concept is solid and there are every reason to believe that it can be successfully implemented. <br /> <br /> I had to think about it, but then the slogan from the ads - something like "We" is not so different from you ", he gave me the key to the fact that the show is suckiness. Although cavemen / Neanderthals are actually a different genre than humanity, it turns out that the title characters of this series are exactly the same as those of us who are boring jerks. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's my background as a game writer - not a soulless hack, a commissioner from California - but this program has so much potential and nothing has been done. First of all, producers should focus on fun things that would make cavemen different from us. <br /> <br /> What could be fun, for example, giving them professions, such as a perpetual degree student and a furniture store employee, when they would be more attracted to such things as underground workers and guides in cave parks? Why would they play prosaic games such as squash, when the whole episode could be dedicated to them, trying to get a hunting license to go to the spear game? A presentation like this could be written and some deliberately bad writing is needed to make it so bad and boring. <br /> <br /> Another tiring aspect of this program is the attempt to present cavemen as subjects subject to the number of stereotypes associated with different minorities. Yawn! It has been done many times and it has never been so gloomy. And, as mentioned earlier, Neanderthals are really different species, so using them as a metaphor for a racial stereotype is both incomplete and out of place. <br /> <br /> Answers are welcome, including answers from anyone who wants to say why I'm wrong. I would like to enjoy this concert and I am sorry that I have not been able to. <br /> <br /> Michael J. Varhola, Skirmisher Online Gaming Magazine
