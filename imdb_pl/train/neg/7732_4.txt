Before writing this review I came back and read the reviews of other people again. This film was a special disappointment for me because it has two of my favorite dancers, Gene Kelly and George Chakiris, praised by the often astounding Michel LeGrand ("Wuthering Heights", "Ice Station Zebra", "The Thomas Crowne Affair") ") . The dance was stiff, unmotivated and unoriginal, the songs can be forgotten and the story a joke. Even the costume was not particularly flattering. Only photography correctly captured the right mood and spirit. I am glad that other people liked "The Young Girls of Rochefort", but certainly not.
