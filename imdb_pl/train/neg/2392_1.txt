We watched it twice in the theater because we could not believe how bad it was for the first time. Maybe we missed something ... No, what was missing was missing from the beginning of the pre-production. Actually, I went back to Robbin's novel to see if I could find a problem, and discovered that what I thought was fun and exciting at the time was now so much disconnected and fuzzy garbage. > So the initial problem with the film was that he decided to do it at all and the rest of the train wreck was moving forward. Absolutely nothing works - it is not a blessed thing. Some beautiful outdoor photography is ejected by accidentally placing the camera in the interiors. All actors look at least uncomfortable - Angie Dickenson looks positive - except for Rain Phoenix, which gives the impression that she is too unaware to realize how terrible her performance is. The dialog box is one long, unbreakable balls. Scenes do not make sense from second to second, and connections between them do not exist. And yet the movie stumbles blindly, convinced that it says something deep. <br /> <br /> It is too bad to be even funny; it is simply terrible. Gus Van Zant made other good films that I encourage you to watch, and I'm happy that he survived (and seems to have learned) the mess.
