I love science fiction, I'm fascinated by Egyptian mythology and I value digital animation. I thought that the movie that connects the three would be at least pleasant. I could not be more wrong: history (or rather its lack) was completely boring and devoid of imagination - while imagination is usually the largest component of any science fiction story. Dialogue and acting are even worse than in the average porn movie. Especially Thomas Kretschmann gives new meaning to the term "bad results". Bad acting would not be such a problem if only the "director" Bilal did not take himself so seriously; all lines sound like they should be poetic, it seems that Bilal really thinks he did a work of art here. Well, in this piece of rubbish there is no art or poetry, just pretentiousness! This man should really stick to the comics because he can not handle all possible accounts as a director. The worst is the horrible digital animations that are so ugly that they actually change the viewing of this movie into a physically painful experience. The graphics look so false that even the werewolves look like "Van Helsing" and look like live actors! And because half of the characters are animated in CGI, it is quite a problem that the CGI effects look so false. If the Egyptian gods really exist, then Bilal is a dead man because he will no doubt take revenge on him because of the funny way he presents them in this terribly bad movie.
