I caught this Cuban movie in a film club. It was shown shortly after the magisterium of the Silly Symphony cartoon from 1935, in which the Isle of Symphony is reconciled with the Isle of Jazz. What about the recently deceased Ruben Gonzalez led through the speakers in this old cinema room and the Cuban flag hanging from the scrub-like stucco motifs of rocaille, the stage was prepared for the blatant holiday of the engaged film and synchronized hissing on the idols of Helms-Burton. But then the movie started. And the flaky paint of the cinema gradually became more interesting than the shoddy mess on the screen. <br /> <br /> The story of Nady Mas promises a lot. Carla is a bored envelope in a Cuban post office. The only escape from a completely dark existence is to steal letters and rewrite them, transforming the basic murmurs of people into BrontÃ«an's explosions without breath. Cue countless shots of photogenic Cubans gushing with joy, regret, pity, horror and the like. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the simplicity of the narrative is plagued by endless trips to art cinema, a Latin caricature, the Slapstick of the Marx brothers, and even - during a particularly unstoppable editing trick - the celluloid scratching of the school face damage. <br /> <br /> Multiply one-dimensional characters. Cunda, the head of the post office, is a dominatrix-nosferatu deprived of humor. Her accomplice, Concha, points fingers in various ways, eavesdrops and squeals. Cesar, metal dolt and romantic interest, reveals a hidden writing talent when Carla goes to Miami. The pursuit scene (in oh-so-funny fast forward) is thrown for good. All this would be fine in the comics of Mortadello and Filemon, but in a black and white zero turnover with high rebukes, ahem. <br /> <br /> Nada Mas tries to tame the stile somewhere between "bizarre-heroines-matchmakes-strangers Amelie and the theme of" poetry-as-redeemer "Il Postino. Like Amelie, her protagonist is an eccentric lonely white woman who fights the approaching spinsterdoms, trying to introduce magic into the lives of strangers. And like Il Postino, the film does not shrink from long-lasting recitals of poetry, and the postman on a bicycle takes a romantic figure. Unfortunately, Nada Mas can not capture the exuberance and transcendence of any film. <br /> <br /> There are two things that you can deserve to watch this movie in the nighttime TV stupor. The first of these is the opening Carla's arrow on a tiled floor that cuts the crossword over which he works. The second is to watch Nada Mas as a warning example: our obsession with the Buena Vista Social Club with Cuban artistic creativity can often blink to accept any batch of bongo on the soundtrack. This film should not deserve a global premiere - films such as Waiting List and Guantanamera successfully cover similar themes.
