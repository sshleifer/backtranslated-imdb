Warning: This review contains a spoiler. <br /> <br /> Wow. Almost impressively bad. Attention, I said "almost". It's nothing more than a lot of random scenes combined into a loose story test. Heroes (you CAN NOT call them "heroes") shoot at innocent passers-by to get food, and they do the same for similar reasons. There is also a lot of homoeroticism that was a turning point for me. (SPOILER: It seems that rage (which is only topless and not naked, as other reviews say) is killed early, but miraculously recovers its strength, adding another 70 minutes of torture to the audience). abuse has occurred many times in this film disgust. If you're in MST3K mood, you can think that it's possible to watch, but for the most part you can forget about it. Instead, rent the original Conan DVD.
