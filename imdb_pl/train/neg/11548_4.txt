Jeez, only in the 70's ... Antonio Margheriti brings us this bizarre hybrid of western spaghetti and kung fu flick evolving around the treasure hunt. Spices of this kitsch coproduction between Shaw Brothers and the Italian one-off company include humorous storytelling, events outside the walls, and a very tame T & A. Additional moments in the camp are served by the unbearable Lee Van Cleef wig, covered with the skin of psycho-gunner Yancey Hobbitt (loved by Julian Ugarte, a man who should have done more unknown European productions of the genre than him) - witty dialogue, funny background music and completely funny sound effects accompanying various minor events (especially every jump made by Lo Lieh). <br /> <br /> During this small campaign, the price and square in Turkey are falling, it's great to see Van Cleef and Lo Lieh on the same screen and you can not deny the charisma of this duo. Do not expect too much, and you'll get a lot out of it. <br /> <br /> This is my truth. What's yours?
