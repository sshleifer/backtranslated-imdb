Non-existent plot, a lot of poorly directed / super tacky scenes (Snipers / world-famous sharpshooters who can not even hit their targets a few yards away? What happens with the ending? ---> a group of law enforcement agencies destroying the carnival shooting range? WTH?), technical errors (how many bullets can be stored in a glock magazine? over 100? These people are firing their weapons without having to reload). The film is so bad that even an older Hollywood actor, like Michael Biehn (Alien, Terminator), can not save this trash. <br /> <br /> DO NOT watch this movie (I realized I had wasted a few good 100 minutes of my precious life on it). I hope that the director will stop making films or learn more about his next film.
