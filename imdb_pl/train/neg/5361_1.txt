I saw this movie when it first appeared in the 70s and hated it, hated it, hated it! It's easy the most movie movie I've ever seen in my life. I do not know where Leigh draws inspiration, but this is one of those movies where you want to shake the characters to open their mouths and communicate. The title says it all, because there are no recorded moments in this film, only a long, long silence with people who are unable to express what they are (probably) feelings. If you want to see something that will lead you to drink, then this is for you. If you have nothing better to do for two hours, stick the toaster fork: the experience will be infinitely more pleasant than anything you get! Yes, Leigh came up with many really valuable things much later in his career, but he misses it.
