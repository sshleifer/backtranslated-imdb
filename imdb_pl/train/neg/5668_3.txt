First of all - in this movie there is absolutely no flirtation - with Anthony or anyone else. These people do not flirt - they just do it. Your first endurance test is wading for more than 15 minutes of intense violence and sexual perversion. It would not be so bad - hell, I like violence and perversion the same as the next reviewer, but without the context to put it, it's repulsive. So you go through torture and chaos. Then we meet Donna and the film turns into something completely different - no better - just different: the image of the road without a heart. In the episodes there are bad comedy attempts - widely written and widely played by the likes of Judy Tenuta and Mink Stole (and several whores and drag queens). They all deserve better. Photography is deliberately confusing, so if you have motion sickness (or really EVERY disease) - this move is not for you. Think about it, I'm not sure who this movement is, except, perhaps, gay and bi-sexual S & M fans who like poorly script-based, poorly filmed movies about themselves.
