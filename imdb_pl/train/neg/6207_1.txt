This film commits what I would call emotional rape on the viewer. The film supposedly caused quite a stir among the critics in Cannes, but for me the last scene was a pathetic attempt to spot a new director. Almost no voice in the discussion about violence, drug abuse or juvenile delinquency (or any other issue, for that matter). <br /> <br /> The metamorphosis of the main character from a good but restless boy to a malicious rapist is practically non-existent, while the scene of rape (an excessively dragged, exaggerated version of the rape scene from the "Mechanical Orange") is unbearable and I refuse to comment on about her aesthetic values. There are certain things that an artist should not do to achieve his goal. At least in my opinion. <br /> <br /> To end this: shockingly brutal, repulsive and NOT WORTH TIME. Instead, see "Orange Mechanical" or "Le pianiste".
