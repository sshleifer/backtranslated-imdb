OK, I'm not Japanese. I know a bit about Japanese culture and a little less about Japanese pop culture. Besides, I'm a Spaniard, I eat paella and I like black humor. <br /> <br /> Well, with this point I can comment on the movie: I have no idea how pleasant it is for the Japanese audience, Mamoru Oshii is quite a good director - despite the too pedantic postmodernist Talking Head style, and even that was interesting and somehow interesting - and I'm surprised that he came up with it. I am afraid that this may be just one of those things lost in translation, but as a European viewer watching a movie with an overtone overloaded with English subtitles, I thought it was horrible. The jokes seemed bad, the script was overcooked - I mean, give the audience a break and shut down some damned narrator - to the point that my head explodes over the exaggeration of fast pace and absurd action. br /> <br /> I thought, however, that the animation is really cool. The idea is great and well used in these animated scenes. However, sweets end when the characters are put aside, starting with the endless, not funny at all mumbo-jumbo speech on still photos. It just makes you want to quickly go to the next scene cut out of the hysterical scene. <br /> <br /> I have read that Mamoru Oshii is planning to continue this. The idea was good, but terribly used. Maybe the second part will bring back good parts of the first one and it will actually make an interesting movie, or maybe it will be more and more scenes with narration. But, hell, if you thought Talking Head was dense, the amazing life of fast food people would give you a reason. <br /> <br /> Of course, all this commentary is based on the experience of someone who is European. Probably it is completely useless for the Japanese, maybe it was a really funny film lost in cultural boundaries and translation. Maybe.
