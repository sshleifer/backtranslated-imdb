*** Possible Spoilery Dzia≈Çkowe *** <br /> <br /> I love Dennis Hopper. I ask why he took the role of a police detective in "Spreading the Earth" in 2000. This movie is hopeless and I'll tell you why. <br /> <br /> It's a small town that has a contract for a sports arena. One catch: there is a killer in the wild, and this is bad for business. The mayor has an agreement with the Irish mafia to find the killer and make sure he never goes to court. Det. Ed Delongpre has other plans. He wants this guy too to be caught, but he's on the level and he believes in the system. I want to see that the system is doing its job. <br /> <br /> It could have been pretty good. It could have been riveting. That was awful. First of all, they call this guy a serial killer. Err no. There are specific criteria and none of this fits here. The bad guy killed 5 children on the first day and I think it was the second day the second day. The entire film covers a 48-hour period ... "Killer Serial" action. I do not care what distorted motives give him in the end, the Killers Series do their deed for a long time. Suddenly, they do not kill 7 children in two days. It's Spree. <br /> <br /> Ok, annoying, acting was terrible. Hopper was the only name here, and he was the only one who even approached his role. Unfortunately, it is a bit typical for me and I think that he does a lot of psycho, much better. It was not a good vehicle for Hopper. It did not allow him to do what he did best, or to behave horribly. It's not that he did wrong, it's just that I saw him much better. <br /> <br /> A guy from the Irish mafia, Johnny Gault (Tom McCamus - A long journey into the night) who is responsible for their investigation is too rigid. Contradiction? Not quite. He tries to play with a cold, hard guy and he does it to the extent that the character is simply wooden. Boring to the max. He did not frighten me. He did not arouse any emotions except boredom. I can not tell you how many times I've checked how much time has passed until the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> Another thing is that it had the character of a movie made especially for television. You know what I mean. Poor production values, low budget, re-use of scenes to reduce costs. Only eh. Yanno? But I have the impression that comparing this to those is an insult to them. <br /> <br /> Derek Vanlint was both the director and the operator of this project. He bit more than he could chew. I can not stop feeling that Hopper had to take this role as a personal favor for a friend. This is the only rational thing I can come up with. It was Vanlint's first work as a director, the third as an operator. I hope it was a learning experience for him. <br /> <br /> I will not ruin the ending if you decide to torture it, but I want to say that everyone dropped the ball here. .. Even Hopper. In a scene that should be emotionally tricky for a detective, it was just ... well ... blah. I did not see any of these anxieties that would accompany the man's total shift. Very disappointing. <br /> <br /> It's 100 exhausting minutes and rating R for violence and language. No child under the age of 13 will have any interest in watching this, so no worries. And so it is not suitable for anyone. heh. <br /> <br /> Skip this one. You'll thank me later.
