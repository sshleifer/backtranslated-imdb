This is the worst piece of shit I've ever seen. There is nothing good in this film. The plot is stupid, dialogues do not make sense, humorous scenes have never heard of real humor. Actors simply do not play, even worse they do not try. The script itself is in the same league as Ed Wood and Uwe Boll. There is only one good thing in this movement, fighting. They are well-arranged, as you would expect from the Hong Kong guys, and they are the only reason to watch Prince of the Sun. Although I think that the fights just fill the empty space so that the screenwriter does not have to think about the plot. However, this weak and absurd thread may make it impossible to see it to the end. Avoid this unless you're a fan of Cynthia Rothrock's dragon woman.
