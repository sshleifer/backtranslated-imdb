This video is making a few mistakes. several American actors in Spain and Spanish actors speaking English. English "Spaniards" is OK, but the way you play in it makes everything annoying. dialogue throughout the script is very weak; it could have been a Spanish scenario, but translated incorrectly, who knows and cares. I can only assume that they are well-known Spanish actors forced to speak English, they can be good, but not in this flop. the film will be recognized in the first 5 minutes, it's so pathetic. then the rest is just bad. a lot of waste of time, many plots necessary for the UN. Oh, I mentioned one of the Baldwins in this.
