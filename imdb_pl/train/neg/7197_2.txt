WELL. I think that the TV show is quite sweet and always has some lesson in it. So when my kids decided they wanted to see this movie, I decided to do it. I would like to stay at home and watch a television program instead. <br /> <br /> The fact that humor is stupid and unoriginal is the smallest of problems with this movie. The story is non-existent, characters seem to exist in a vacuum, and worst of all, the gadget has no lesson. It seems that Disney has taken all the things that make Inspector Gadget works on TV and threw them all. Honestly, my younger child (8 years old) liked this movie, but the older (10 years old) passed away thinking that it was stupid (he was too old for the humor of youth, but too young for any humor for adults). br /> <br /> Generally I like Disney movies, but this one is missing miles. It's okay for a very narrow age range (say from 7 to 9), but for everyone else you have to miss it.
