"Gray Matter" AKA "The Brain Machine", but the people in the movie thought about it; the screen says 1972, but IMDb says 1977; it's a movie. The government has some overriding interest in this "brain machine" project, which has prepared four people - which, roughly, have been a philosopher, a horny priest, a crazy veteran and a patriot who has made an abortion - to sit down a shrinking room with a computer that can read their terrifying secret thoughts. In the end, the government takes over the laboratory and everyone dies. Here's a movie that's incompetent in every way; MY S *** has better production values ​​than this. However, I was interested only in what exactly the filmmakers think about it, using the drama of the four guys in the room. Answer: a treatise on how science is worse than God. Thanks a lot. It's like opening a Kinder egg and getting the 30th goddamn puzzle. Priest James plays "Roscoe P. Coltrane" Best, Gerald's philosopher "Republican Simon" McRaney. It also contains a very, very, very long setting up and transfer of images in large quantities, it moves almost as slowly as a liberal convention.
