I saw this function as part of the Asian American Film Festival in New York and was terrified of graphic, sado-masochistic child pornography that I had witnessed. The plot is hidden under too many graphical scenes of sex - and none is in the least erotic - the sick are the more affection. The director seemed to be rather shocked than to explore different levels, why these characters are so. See if you can stand it - I still have flashbacks.
