I loved Dewaere in the Noir series. His talent is trivialized in "The Waltzers" aka "Going Places". Alright, this is a pair of guys betting on conventions in the most absurd and irrevocable way; many people consider such behavior to be fun. It was a boring, senseless exercise aimed at shock. Annoying smirk on Blier's face, face behind the camera. The Noir series was an important expression of personal freedom and licentious behavior. From the first moment, when we see Patric Dewaere prancing on a deserted area, we have an idea for a stunningly beautiful antihero, with whom we will spend time for the next few hours. When we see him chasing a wretched middle-aged woman with his buddy Depardieu in "Going Places", we have a fair warning that two hours spent with these guests will be a draining soul. I have a problem getting even "3" for this annoying entertainment.
