I am an actor, producer, director and what I have to say are facts. This project was the worst film in the history of film making. From producer to director and editing this so-called film is a joke and I mean GREAT joke. Why did Blockbuster issue such nonsense? I consider my work to be very serious, and this film is an insult to my profession. Did the director try to make a bad movie? I do not think so. I've seen bad movies from Zombie, but it takes Coffie's cake and everything on that damned table. THIS FILM DRESSES !!! I really hate to talk bad about other filmmakers because I'm one myself, but please take another profession. I respect the fact that you finished the movie, but I have to ask you: "WERE SMOKING CRACK", I mean the make-up on your girls, the terrifying Zombie, what you thought. For the whole nation, if I could vote for Zero, I would have. THE MOST VIDEO IN THE FILM HISTORY !!!
