Maddy (Debbie Rochon) is a mentally unstable young woman with a turbulent past who gets more than she expected when she goes to a party with a pool with a handsome co-worker. When her date and her friends jokingly say that they belong to the "Murder Club", Maddy treats her seriously and goes straight to "Level 3", banging on the woman's brain in the garage (for crushing her car!). But is Maddy also the one who puts on a plastic mask and kills other group members, or has someone lost her? <br /> <br /> The plot of this film (originally entitled MAKE 'EM BLEED) is very poorly thought out, full of holes and spirals that are completely out of control before the absurd end of the left turn. Part of the dialogue is almost ridiculous. I had no problem with Rochon's performance, but the cast was awful. However, I was able to sit fully in full moon entertainment. There's a lot of skin and blood and it's the perfect kind of swipe to sit down with your buddies' group and split up. Horror fans can also enjoy the episodes of Brinke Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman (as parents of Debbie) and Julie Strain (early victim). <br /> <br /> Result: 4 out of 10
