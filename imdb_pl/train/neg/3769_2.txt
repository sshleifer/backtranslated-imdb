There were a lot of Bigfoot movies, most of them not good, but at least they have a silly charm for them. Sasquatch hunters do not even do that. It's just a crushing bore. <br /> <br /> Sasquatch Hunters is a group of paleontologists, primatologists and foresters who set off into the remote forest of the Pacific Northwest. Bones belonging to some abnormally large primate have been discovered in this region, and because monkeys are not natural in North America, this initially leads to a scientific expedition. Indeed, they will soon discover an entire cemetery full of skeletal remains of these enormous monkey creatures. I think we all know what happens to people who disrupt the ancient burial sites in movies. <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie consists of uninteresting, interchangeable figures assembling their equipment, wandering around the woods, stopping for rest, wandering the forest even more, pausing long enough to explore and discuss some arrangements along the way even more wandering in the woods, looking for a group member who disappeared, even more wandering the forest, kicking in the ground, randomizing theorizing and gathering around the campfire to discuss what they did that day. When Sasquatch finally appears, it turns into people stumbling in the dark when they are singled out individually (made in the blink of an eye, and you missed it, and the actual killing occurs outside the camera). All this is terribly boring. <br /> <br /> The film wants to be taken seriously, and the director clearly tries to build tension, but you can not find it, so we stayed with boring, outstretched scenes people wander through the woods to get somewhere and wander through the woods at night trying to be scared. I would be lying if I said that I did not use the fast scroll button too fast to speed up these scenes. <br /> <br /> As for Sasquatch himself, just like any other character in the film, there is not much to do and he lacks a distinct personality. It looks like a more shaggy version of King Kong, which is not as bad as the scenes in which they used CGI instead of a man in Bigfoot costume, which is painfully obvious during the scenes of daytime monsters. Part of me can not refrain from feeling that even using computer effects to revive Bigfoot is a bit of a sacrilege. If there's any movie monster that I think should only be brought to life by the situation, it's Bigfoot. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that do not have a story, as it does. It's all that's really there, the premise that the people involved pulled out to make a full-length movie without bothering to add all the ingredients to make a valuable movie.
