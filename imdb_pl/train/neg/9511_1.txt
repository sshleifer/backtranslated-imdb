I wanted to see this movie since it was advertised on television. I went to Tinsel Town to see Last Night at 7:40. I regret that day who wasted my ticket for this trash when I could see something better. The beginning was a crowd of garbage and clich√©s. They exaggerated the way love works in reality. All the girls were stereo types. The boy was too stupid for his age. Flowing gases that a pregnant girl barely laughed at. The bank robbery was completely boring with the gags that were used in other movies. Their escape was an old van Chevy, who claimed he had no breaks. Hey, why did not they get a nice girls' assault vehicle instead? This could increase the public's opinion about the film. This movie was very low low low low low budgeted, because nothing was damaged or destroyed there. This film had many things that would make the Christian people go wild. Hey, I was even expecting a car chase scene, because all bank robbery movies have car chases, but I've never had them. So I'm evaluating this movie b, which means low-budget and 1 in 10 stars.
