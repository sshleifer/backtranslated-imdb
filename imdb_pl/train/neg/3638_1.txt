The film shows France's unresolved problems with colonial legacy in Western (Francophone) Africa through the foggy and complex psychoanalytic prism of a young woman, France (symbolically representing her nation here). This is often a captivating and challenging portrait of a young woman's desire to come to terms with the traumatic moment in her past, and especially with the desire of the nation to reach the "others" that were once "owned" and formed. This is reflected in the way it concentrates entirely around the concept of travel (or being in transit) from the present to the past; remembered realities to undeniable contemporary political and economic realities. <br /> <br /> All characters play a symbolic, though limited and unconvincing role. France, which is supposed to be both a visual and totemic representation of contemporary French society, leaves indifferent to its difficult situation, because it seems that it is still saturated with the same naivety that she enjoyed as a child - in fact, as a child, she seems more in possession of her reality. The rest of the rag-tag team is simply forgotten. Black Africans are, say, offensive impressionistic portraits of former colonized peoples colonized by poor material handling. They are nothing more than a dark and dying background, where blythe-like France wonders, searching for a world that she never knew, and hoping for one that can never be found in Cameroon.
