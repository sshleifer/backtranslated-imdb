It's not just the plot that makes the movie instant for bored viewers. It's a horrible direction with a horrible scenario and errors on the left and right that make watching too painful. I'm sorry, but I do not see "fun" in it. Simply a thrill, indicating many mistakes and stupid monoplanes. I wonder how stupid managers think of their producing company when this movie was first introduced. Probably as stupid as the sheriff who dipped himself in a truck full of antifreeze with a yawning bloody wound. Oops! Did I forget to mention this sheriff, who is not only a poor actor, but can also be moved by the impetus with a load of antifreeze that rinses the exposed body? I think he forgot when he won the not so exciting victory over the snowman.
