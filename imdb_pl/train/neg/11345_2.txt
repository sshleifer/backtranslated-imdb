I mean the word "pedestrian". It seems that film producers have forgotten something interesting. Faith Domergue can do it better. She is supposed to be a mysterious, vengeful goddess Cobra torn apart by love for Marshall Thompson (there's an idea, eh?). Instead, she is a typical would-be housewife of the 1950s, and the single flat expression she carries throughout the movie makes me think they did all this early in the morning before Faith drank coffee. As for the rest of the cast, everyone is so "completely American" that the result is ridiculous. It is more productively coated in Val Lewton in "The Cat People". I think that "Cult of the Cobra" really should be entitled "Cult of the Contractual Obligation". Why have so many such talented people dreamed about going through a free, predictable, derivative failure?
