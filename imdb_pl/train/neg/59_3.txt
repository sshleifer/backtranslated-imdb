The protocol is an unlikely movie whose only saving is that it plays Goldie Hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors. The story revolves around the ditzy waitress who becomes famous after unintentionally saving the life of an Arab dignitary. The story goes down in the middle of the movie, and Goldie's charm simply does not save this movie. If you're not a fan of Goldie Hawn, do not go out of your way to see this movie.
