It must be one of the worst films of all time. The graphics were terrifying, acting was a b-movie, and the effects were simply Nintendo 64 qualified. One would think that they would put a little more effort into it. Of course, this is a movie with the SciFi channel, so you have to expect that it will be low, but this one deals with cake. Hell, I'm still laughing. So, as shaking your head in the movie in disbelief, this one is fine. <br /> <br /> Although it seems that they have some "known" actors and actresses, it's hard for me to believe that they did not realize that the quality of the film was worth their time and effort. <br /> <br /> The graphics could have been good in the 60's or even the early 70's, but this is 2009! I will not give spoilers, let's say that if you played in "Jurassic Park" on Nintendo 64, you will very well know what you see in this movie <br /> <br /> Certainly not worth the 2 hours you had to sit down
