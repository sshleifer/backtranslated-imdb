First of all, write a script on a napkin. Who needs something more? After all, we're not a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> In that case, get the amateurs. This will be good for the festival buzz. After all, who needs people who have spent years polishing their craft? Then hire an operator who does not know how to smoke. You see, if it is well-lit, it will not look like "real" and festival people will not like it. Who must have professional photography anyway? Then hire a ten-year-old who has never held the camera to be your operator. It gives your film a completely amateur accent, which the screeners confuse with the "reality" and guarantee that even if you empty the seats of real people, critics and a small group of audience that over-intellectualizes, will shout "genius", they will not believe that it was just a complete amateur hour. <br /> <br /> Once you've done that, buy a ticket to the Bad Film Festival, also known as Sundance. <br /> <br /> What a sad waste.
