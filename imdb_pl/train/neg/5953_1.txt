How did this shit stay on TV for so long? This is horrible. It makes me want to shoot someone. It's so false that it's worse than a science-fiction movie from the 1940s. I'd rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense. I remember watching him when he appeared. I thought: hey, that might be interesting, then I found out how really it was absolutely, crazy, ridiculously stupid. It was so bad that I took out my penknife and put my hand to the table. <br /> <br /> Please, people, stop watching this and all other reality shows, it's garbage that drowns the network and cancels the quality of programs that require thought.
