I would rate this movie at minus 10, but unfortunately it is not offered. <br /> <br /> Why I did not go out in the first five minutes of this movie, I can not say. I should have gone with my instincts and leave immediately !! A few people in our theater did and unfortunately did not follow them. <br /> <br /> The story lacked all the criteria for the film. NO plot. Awful acting! Even Robin Williams was so disappointed that maybe he would never see the next movie in which he is. I liked the Tazer scene. It is a pity that it did not shake the meat in the meaningless plot. Someone must cheat the writer and director of this film!
