OK maybe a 13-year-old like me was a bit too old for this movie. It's about this spoiled rat who lives in the palace. Then the wastewater drains him into the toilet! He ends up in this rat city and meets this rat who has a jewel he wants a greedy frog. He will do everything for this jewel, he sends the whole army over these two rats. He plans to take away the jewel and flood the city of rats! The cool part of the movie is snails. They do all sound effects. They sing, make noise, they are amazing and also quite funny. A good line is aimed at 7-year-olds. Another wise, great movie to see a younger member of the family. I did not think animation was the real art of dreams, more like WAllace and Gromit. I think he relaxed a bit. The movie was just decent, but it's not worth spending $ 9.50 on it, I'm sorry.
