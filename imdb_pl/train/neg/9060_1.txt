Surf the channels and grab it in LOGO. It was one of those "I have to watch it because it's so badly bad", like Roadhouse without joy. The letter is terrible; completely indecent, and acting is unpleasant. <br /> <br /> There is a low budget, and then there is an abyss where this epic should be cast and never seen again. My point is that the main heroes are going to a ski retreat in some rented house, and the house is, well, ordinary, which does not matter, but they decide to show everyone who is over it, as if it were the Sistine Chapel. I'm sorry, but watching 6 guys staring at every boring room 10'x10 'with a futon in the middle and gushing is lame. I think they have not learned anything from Bad News Bears in Breaking Training (see the hotel room control scene) ... wow the toilet !!! yaayyyyy !!!! I do not buy it on top, so everything goes routinely. If it smells ... and it looks like ... well, you know the rest. <br /> <br /> Avoid the plague. <br /> <br /> edit: Apparently, other more thought-minded reviewers believe that since I did not like this movie, I am "obvious hatred", which I can only assume I am a phobia, which of course is not true. I decided to do this crazy crazy thing and judge the film based on the actual content of the movie, not just its presence (ie, its refreshing view ...) <br /> <br /> Of course, it may be a refreshment, but it is not great movie, just give them better material for work and a more compact direction. In fact, I approve of the effort. Honestly, I'd rather listen to my Kitchens of Distinction catalog than watch it again.
