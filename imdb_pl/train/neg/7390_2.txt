How do you spell a wiped, fat Italian who can barely make martial arts movements without using heart medicine? In this movie, we see Steven Seagal at his lowest level of achievement - his career began to deteriorate the pathetic behavior of the indulgent, which has eroded his career. In this film, it seems that most of his training consisted of the daily ordering of fetuccini alfredo in his restaurant. <br /> <br /> He is fat, slow and very old in this film, hardly anyone is a hero of martial arts, more like a laughing clown. <br /> <br /> It's time for Steven Seagal to retire - this movie is about 2 hours of reasons. <br /> <br /> Story: a thick, Italian guy with a strong reputation for strength gets wind that a criminal group can play with a drug designed by the military to create the ultimate warrior response. This pretend, though pathetic and funny, gives a chance to some of the best fighting scenes that involve explosions through the walls like a comic. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that this movie sucks, and Steven Seagal is a complete joke? Yes. I did.
