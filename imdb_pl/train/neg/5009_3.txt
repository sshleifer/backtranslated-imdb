It was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. The plot did not make much sense, and the acting was terrible. I am a big fan of Amber Benson, I think she is usually a great actress, I can not imagine why she decided to do this movie. Her character, Piper, is drunk for almost the entire movie, with the exception of the opening scene. On the other hand, there were a few points in the film where acting was so bad that I actually laughed loudly. But nevertheless, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It's only 80 minutes, but it's 80 minutes of your life which you will waste completely.
