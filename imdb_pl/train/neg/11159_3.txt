I saw this movie on the "preview" and I must honestly admit that I do not like movies with Meryl Streep so much. This photo was the worst. Half of the theater did not return after the break in the middle of the movie. I could not blame them if it was not a real story, there was absolutely no need in the second half of the picture. Just before the film moved forward, I expected that loans would appear for about ten years.
