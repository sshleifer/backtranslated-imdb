I just finished watching, I can not say that I was impressed. <br /> <br /> It starts up pretty well, visually and the atmosphere gives a horrifying feeling like this type of movie should. But everything ends when the first monster of the lord appears. Not only do you recognize them after the lord band, but they are seriously misplaced in the film. Monsters from Doomsday with leather jackets and earrings are 80 years old. <br /> <br /> As for the storyline, it begins with similar horrors, people trapped in hell. But there is no clear history of why and what is happening. The viewer is thrown out for some reasons, but the lines never meet and end in nothing but mess. <br /> <br /> With all the money spent on this film, with an intriguing beginning and good results I thought someone would take better care of the product. I wonder if the lordis made this film just to prove that their costumes can be scary (except that they are not). <br /> <br /> So the movie becomes credible for visualization. . But the rest is an embarrassing attempt by the rock band to make their monstrous aliases more frightening.
