This film has a special place in my heart as the worst movie I've ever seen. It's just as much fun as hard physical work with stomach cramps. The film starts badly (I would rate the first few minutes of the movie on 1/10) and then it gets worse, minute by minute. The only way to gauge this would be some vast spiral negative number that grows for ninety, long minutes. Unfunny is not a real word, but it best describes the humor in this movie. Somehow, the video even manages to make charming, scantily clad women, and sex looks grotesque and distasteful. This movie is incredibly bad. I would say it would be better to be closed in the theme of TITANIC playing over and over with Buscemi's character from ESCAPE FROM LA droning in your ear rather than watching this movie. The next parts are not so bad. If you need to rent a Troma movie, get Tromeo and Juliette or Combat Shock. I would rather watch 5 Tony Little Infomercials than watch CLASS of NUKEM HIGH. Do not get me wrong, I needed some criminal genius to make this movie so horrible, and if any movie ever deserves a reward for being awful, that's it.
