This is one very terrible production. The general consensus was that although Princess Margaret could be pampered and spoiled and could enjoy the excess of luxury she had, she was a very beautiful young woman. Here is the weakest point of production, the actress did not manage to achieve it. It also turned out that the production budget could not extend to the hairdresser - from the very beginning the hair on the form of Princess Margaret had solid bird nests in a disheveled stare and looked as if she had been dragged through a bush. The actor playing the Prince of Edinburgh seemed to be preparing for his role, watching Rory Bremner imitate Prince Charles and was a farce. <br /> <br /> Production was doomed to lies, a kitschy, embarrassing garbage load. I think all Daily Mail readers deserve a free DVD copy for Christmas!
