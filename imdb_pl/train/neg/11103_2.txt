OK, I saw this movie, although it appeared last year ... I thought it was a good movie in general, with the exception of a story that was stupid and scary ... First, we never know anything about creatures, why did they appear , wtf do they do it in our world and have they really been on Earth before we were or simply came from outer space? Secondly, the butcher's role in maintaining order is simply so obvious ... Really, how big could the subway substation be? There were only so many of these creatures, so I think instead of killing innocent people in vain, they could simply set up tactical bombs, or maybe clean those, and Nuke would do the job. I know it sounds funny and it is, but I do not consider killing people NECESSARY ... Third, Leon behaves like Superman jumping on the train and fighting Vinnie Jones, who was much taller and taller. On the other hand, when he faces the conductor, he does nothing and acts like a mollusk, watching all abominations. I mean OK, the conductor had a terrifying help (lol), but if Leon was so brave, he would go all the way ... I mean, he risks his life first and then does not do anything right when he should. He could have died as a hero, but he lives as a coward ... it may be so, but not after he showed so much courage ... So the cop's case ... come on! It was a city with a subway, I bet there must have been other cops besides this lady, other police stations, it was really stupid ... All in all, a great Vinnie Jones, an interesting idea for this reason is not built at all .. By the way, what do the signs on the chest mean? Vinnie Jones can not make up for the rest ...
