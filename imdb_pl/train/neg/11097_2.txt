This is exactly the Saturday series that I loved during World War II. I was less than ten years old. And this is the audience for whom this series is intended. Looking at it now, you have to roar because of its ineptitude and stupidity. Taking into account shortcuts and repeats, the budget had to be almost nothing. Acting? Well, these are photos of the Republic from 1944. They read the poems ... and no doubt they had one idea to convince them. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars.
