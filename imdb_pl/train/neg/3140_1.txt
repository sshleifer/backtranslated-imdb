I think I'll probably like the new Star Wars movie, The Phantom Threat, which will probably kick the Titanic out of the water if you'll forgive the pun for a clean destructive box of office receipts, and then throw him out of space one. Every time I hear someone say that "Titanic" is the biggest movie they've ever seen, I think, "You do not see many movies, do you?" What a parody. You can make 50 good movies that are much better than "Titanic" and for the same price. <br /> <br /> "Well, many academic prizes have won, many people really loved it", as someone could say in his defense. Well, many people like Spice Girls and billions and billions of people eat at McDonald's, but that does not mean it's high quality. Yes, millions of Elvis fans can be wrong. <br /> <br /> I will be the first to admit that part of this problem was for me a mega hype in the movie. I waited for a month or so to see it, and finally expectations were not met, which simply drew more attention to the terrifyingly stupid love story. It is true that "Phantom Menace" will probably have a similar fate. but. <br /> <br /> James Cameron's "Titanic" is. a) Trashy action movie thinly disguised as a serious piece from the era. b) a three-hour epic that has the best moments in the trailer. c) a cheerful love story unbelievable or entertaining. d) something better for documentary filmmakers, which I would enjoy much more. e) film with arrogance that reaches the level shown on the real ship. f) stealing 3 hours in which I will never return, which is why I can come up with the greatest motivation for a time machine. When I meet someone who has not seen it yet, I say: "I would like to be able to change places with you." g) hitting any true hypothermia victim in the face. How long do we have to believe that people can immerse themselves in cold water and still make understandable sentences? h) fortunately a film that was not recognized as an actor's performance on Oscars. i) technological achievement in film production and not much more. <br /> <br /> The only reason I publish this as an anonymous comment is that I do NOT welcome the overthrow of 10,000 thirteen-year-old fans of Leonardo DiCaprio, who will have no doubts approach his defense, and I'm really not interested in listening defense of the Titanic story, action or length.
