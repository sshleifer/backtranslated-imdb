WARNING: I advise anyone who has not seen a movie before, so that they do not read this comment. <br /> <br /> Although I did not see them all, The Hamiltons certainly provided one pathetic piece of entertainment that did not make me feel at all !!!! I thought it was common with half-bad acting, a stupid plot and a turn of action at the end of the movie, which was very delayed, this movie sucked !!! there are people who eat other people. Yes ...... I notice that I said people are not human, not because they are not human, or I am waiting, I think they are, OH DO NOT WAIT, WE SAID HER !!!! ! So good, are these people cannibals, are they imbues, or what they are !!!! I mean, maybe it's just "THINGS" that came here to see how people taste or are cannibals that eat people for a long time, and maybe this movie was HHOORRIIBBLLEE !!, WHICH WAS !!! So if you think The Hamiltons is good, I ask you why WHY WHY WHY it was so amazing because it was just awful for me !!! One big BOOOOOOO for The Hamiltons !!! Go to The Gravedancers, Tooth & Nail, or Borderland to find a piece of entertainment !!!!!
