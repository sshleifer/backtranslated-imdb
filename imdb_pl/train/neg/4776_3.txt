I had to write a review of the movie after reading the next comment saying it was the best Sidney Poitier movie. Poitier has just returned from more than a decade of filmmaking and is clearly creaking. His 11 films are listed in Wikipedia and do not include this. His 5 films are on the list of the 100 best inspirational AFI films, not including this. Berenger and Poitier, a rube and a city slicker, set out on the trail of a dangerous psychopath before crossing the border with Canada. Some of the comedy attempts in this film have clearly failed, and Berenger's and Poitier's ties were remarkable and awkward (the flimsy writing did not help them). Kirstie Alley (as a hostage) was underestimated and almost completely ignored when she was on the screen. Attempts to suspend are attempted, for example, when you are going to try to guess which of the five men on a fishing trip are a murderer (they are all villains of cast type). I understand that this is a whole appeal to most fans. I guessed who it was and I really did not try. <br /> <br /> If you're a Berenger fan, take a look at Sniper (1993) and you'll even see Billy Zane strutting around his things. It's much better. In all, I would give Shoot to Kill 3/10. It is not bold and it is too simple for me.
