In order to make a film about the supposed end of the world, there should be certain facts and realism 1. It is never said why these people believe in it. 2.Location is New Year's Eve In Toronto Canada. YES, I ASK ME ABOUT ME, WHY IT WAS THERE WILL BE GLUE TO THE NORTH AND WHY (based on costumes) WAS WIDZIAŁEM JAK WEDENIEŃ <br /> <br /> 3. Acting was in the neo-au-natural style, which needed a director who he knew how to do it. <br /> <br /> 4. individual fragments of the story were grim and aimless. I can go on, but I do not want it to be as boring as a movie. <br /> <br /> rating * 1/2 (out of 4) 2 on the IMDB scale <br /> <br /> thank you you are always <br /> <br /> JAY HARRIS (alias) SIRBOSSMAN
