What about Indonesian music movies? I have never seen Indonesian music movies like those from Bollywood. They miss the spirit of the story and only a handful of "poetic lines named by them". <br /> <br /> This story about the love of two children who are separated and then meet after a few years of change, no special attention. It is a simple plot (though it is quite focused) with music stories "intended to be" here and there. <br /> <br /> Some confusing characters are omitted, which should be saved by brilliant acting. The main actress can try to survive the character, but it's the best she could do, trying. When it comes to casting, I do not feel the need to put a Balinese student in this story and of course it's not the only unnecessary characters. <br /> <br /> It is strange why I would like to watch this movie? Maybe because of mango ...
