Take your Frankenstein's basic film, inject some Reanimator (but not good parts) and you have Dr. Hackenstein. Of course, this was of course inspired by the aforementioned films, but it never really came to anything special. <br /> <br /> The scientist accidentally kills his wife, so the whole movie takes place during one night when trying to revive his wife. To revive his wife, he decides to cut off parts of the body from some women who have been immobilized and, by chance, decide to stay overnight with him. <br /> <br /> I can not really say that acting is bad or directing. Everything here is simply too standard. What little trials are in the mood really works (check the scene where Hackenstein is hiding behind her deaf assistant, because she would undoubtedly be very upset if she saw him hug the woman and the needle), but that's not enough to recommend the movie. The music is decent, the blood is decent there, and the cast looks pretty good. For half the time I was even entertained by this movie. But I never felt that it was more than just wasting time. Avoidable. <br /> <br /> Try Frankenhooker instead.
