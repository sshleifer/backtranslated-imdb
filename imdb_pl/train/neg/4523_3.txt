When this movie was released, one of the all-time great reviews of capsule films was born: Sphinx Stinks. Yes, but in a hypnotic way. Casting is stupid, starting from the top: Frank Langella and Sir John Gielgud as Egyptians? Not enough makeup in Cairo, at least while making this movie. But it's fun when they try. The performances have a range from mummies (sorry, obvious observation) to over-the-top, with very small gaps between them. It looks like Lesley-Anne Down can not find Egypt on the map, much less on its archaeological treasures. This is at least partly due to some really bad writing, one of the curses that will be visited by every viewer of this film. I think that movies with a curse or deriving from a somewhat esoteric subject, like Egyptology, are ready for a stupid, overwritten dialogue. It does not fail, and the convergence turns out to be double. The plot has one source of dramatic tension: can it become dumber and less credible? The answer is usually YES. Shots from the location are beautiful, and the set design is generally very good, the only consistent reminder that it was not some low-budget production. This and the fact that there are so many famous faces in such unintentional laughter. Cheap, no; trashy, yes.
