I used to be in a movie store once, skipped Blonde and Blonder, but something like that just seemed to be a lovely movie. Who knows? I mean, I'm sure most people threw Romy and Michelle before they saw it, Blonde and Blonder could be another secret treasure that was handed over. But when I started watching him: executive producer Pamela Anderson, wow, I knew I was in something terrifying. Not only this, but both things that were considered the peak of zeal: Pam Anderson and Denise Richards, not to offend them, but they did not age well and play roles that in my opinion were more intended for women who should be aged 20 years, not 40 years old. The story was just bad and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Dee and Dawn are your stupid stereotypical blondes, they really have no idea what's going on in the world, it's just really sad. But when the girls are somehow confused with deadly killers, the cops tell their story and actually call the girls geniuses because of their attitude of "ignorance is bliss." They're set up to "hit" the guy, and they think they'll just "show him a good time", but the real killer is being tweaked and wants a suitcase and kills the girls. > <br /> Denise and Pam just look awkward on the screen and almost like they read the script the day before. I know it was supposed to be this stupid comedy, but it was more than stupid, but terrifying and simply unnecessary. Would I ever recommend it? Not in a million years, girls are just trying to maintain the status of "sexual kittens", it is rather a sign of desperation, and Blonde and Blonder is a huge blonde BOMBshell. <br /> <br /> 1/10
