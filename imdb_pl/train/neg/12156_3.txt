Jesus Christ, I can not believe I wasted my time watching this movie. I watched only because I have such a love in Jordan Ladd. But watching this movie almost detached me from it. This is absolutely horrible! I could watch the Survivor Series 93 above it. <br /> <br /> The main guy in this was so bland and generic. I would love it if the great Tiger Drove 'Mistuharu Misawa' put his butt through a glass window. I was furious every time he said "lake" and "cabin". I'd kick his ass. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Jordan Ladd was absolutely wonderful. A real angel. But she could not even save the joke from the movie. Unfortunately, she could not even act as if she was wrong when she took this truth. It looked hilarious. <br /> <br /> I also loved the piece where Jordan accidentally spilled yogurt on it. It reminded me of the time when ... never think. <br /> <br /> Anayways, watch this movie because of its horrors.
