Creep - "Your journey ends here." Some very graphic scenes and ... well, that's all about this movie. <br /> <br /> No real plot, no story. No nice characters, well, "characters" are not correct, because you have no idea who anyone really is. I mean, they're being hunted down by some weird "thing" in the sewers (who is it? Why is he there?), I think it's scary, but do I really care? No, I'm not. Why not? Because I have no idea who these people are and I do not know if I should want them to live or die. It's one-dimensional and based on gore and sound effects that frighten you, which rarely happens. <br /> <br /> This movie has no meaning, no purpose. It seems to me that I fell asleep and lost 45 minutes. He jumps into action. Basically, some women and her friends are trapped in the London subway, chased by a strange creature, and then eventually run away from it. <br /> <br /> Creep has its own moments that make you jump, the art is good, the location is perfect, and the sounds are fine, but this is not what makes a decent horror, so all this is wasted . <br /> <br /> It's nothing new. Another predictable contemporary "horror" in which Kate (the main "character") consistently does stupid "hey, I know you are sitting at home, I think I should do a sensible thing in this situation, but oh no! I'm going to do the opposite, because I'm stupid blond. I would like them not to do it, they do it so many times, it's boring and predictable. In fact, I'm irritated that a stupid woman has not been stabbed by, erm, a gray creature that looks like a stranger. <br /> <br /> "Your journey ends here" is a line of movie markers. Well, Creeps' journey ends for a moment in the movie. If you've had a few beers, bring some friends with you and then watch them for sure. But if you want something original and wise, avoid it.
