I went to see the Omega Code with a group of other Christians with a total of about 15 people. We were all expecting a good piece of Christian film. What we got was a terribly painful, exhausting and quite boring movie rehearsal. It has good-looking production values, but it also has weak acting, a poor script with poor dialogue and no real sense of direction. From the first 15 minutes, we all knew it would be a long night. We all hated it, and some people in our group put this film as reeking of more cheese than "Anaconda". None of us could believe that the film lasted less than 2 hours. Brilliant effects and sharp images can not save this evil, bad movie. I would give him 3 out of 10, and the rating is only so high because I hired the disgusting "movie" Wilko≈Çak (1996) the night before watching this movie.
