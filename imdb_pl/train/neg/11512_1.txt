*** WARNING! SPOILERS CONTAINED HERE! *** <br /> <br /> This is a semi-autobiographical look at what may happen to Madonna if she is ever trapped on a desert island. In this role there is absolutely no challenge for Madonna and it shows. She is just Madonna playing Madonna, and she can not even DO. I know what you say, you say, "How do you know that Madonna really is, you have never met her!" Correct, I did not do it, but we all remember "Truth or challenge", right? I know Kevin Costner does it. <br /> <br /> You'd think that in 2002, Madonna could learn something, in one way or another, from crossover women who also went through the silver screen. For God's sake, did not Madonna see "Glitter"? Mariah Carey showed the world of the film JAK JAKZTOE !!! Mariah digs the shoddy ass of Madonna to the curb in beauty, talent, presence on the screen, charisma, characteristics, name it! Everything we see in this view of the world of Madonna is the only one in it. <br /> <br /> If there is one thing to say for Madonna, she is consistent. When she was MTV's lover, she established the world of women's fashion for 20 years. Now, in the film, she has set the female role in the film AND the society from twenty years ago, admiring all the most hated, horrible, reprehensible, hideous features that women considered introverted, traits that so desperately tried to prove that they really do not. <br /> <br /> *** THERE ARE SPOILERS HERE !!! DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW ... *** <br /> <br /> Here is one good thing I will say about this film and I was really impressed. They did not go to Hollywood Ending - the figure of Madonna is alive. In the typical, happy ending of Hollywood, the figure of Madonna would have died on the island, and her suffering, oppressed, beaten husband could eventually settle down with a good, decent woman, a woman who would be exactly the reverse of his dead wife and they both live happily ever after. But in this extremely depressing conclusion she is saved and once again this poor victim of her husband is again burdened with her wife's demon, and his life will again become a living hell. <br /> <br /> *** HERE ENDETH THE SPOILERS ***
