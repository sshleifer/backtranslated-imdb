Nothing to say, but Wow! Has anyone really sneaked into them in the open field? Well, it happens about 25 times in this movie (apparently the director's favorite tactics). In one of the opening scenes, the producer who speaks in a smooth / hot shot has to drive in the back seat so that a man with the camera can sit in front to film. Shortly after arrival on the pitch there are five players, and although it is obvious no later than 2 in the afternoon, everyone is convinced that the sun always sets. After about 30 minutes of carefree rubbish we are privileged thanks to the retrospective of the clown's history in which we see some of his previous victims. If you watch this movie, check out the woman's chest. Her ribs reach up to her neck, it was disgusting. Most of the horror action takes place at night, but without a night vision camera, chaos must happen during the day. A few night shots that appeared in the movie, it looks like they were stolen from the Blair Witch Project or random photos from the director's backyard. In a sense, the film compensated in the end when the matrix appeared like shooting with a clown, which we scrolled and watched hysterically laughing. <br /> <br /> We DEFINITELY RENT THIS FILM, IF YOU HAVE EVER SEEN IN THE OPEN FIELD. <br /> <br /> SIGNED, ANSWER
