I love the painting from the 1930s and 1940s in the film. I love Salma Hayek. I was more than ready to love this photo. but. . . <br /> <br /> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! ! ! !! ! <br /> <br /> No, there is nothing good about it. The only amusing aspect for me was the character of Colin Farrell, who is an uncertain writer, and this scenario, despite addressing the juicy theme of racism, is approaching the audience in the style of ABC Afterschool Special. it did not sound like it was "playing" was Sutherland, and its minutes were few. <br /> <br /> A tricky approach to a tired storyline.
