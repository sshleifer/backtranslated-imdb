It's a movie that shows that mood, music and texture are not enough to make a good movie. Sure, the viewer is treated in many beautiful scenes of Los Angeles in the 1930s - I liked the view of the trolley approaching the tunnel and the tram rising on the hillside - but in a sense, this great cinematography is self-defense because it creates a mood that "something will happen "- and he does nothing. The script also fools you into some plot or action or trauma - and does not deliver it every time. Not even providing (assuming) the theme of the film, significant character mismatch. The main actors, both too nice for their roles, did not give any repression or agony, and the script did not expose us to any. <br /> <br /> Now, Donald Sutherland? This is another story. His character was so well shaped, so perfectly played that I wanted the camera to follow him.
