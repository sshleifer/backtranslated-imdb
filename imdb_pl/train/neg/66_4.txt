I think I was interested in this film, both because of the sound of the story and the main actor, so I gave it a chance, from the director Gregor Jordana (Buffalo Soldiers). Basically, Ned Kelly (Heath Ledger) is founded by the police, especially Superintendent Francis Hare (Geoffrey Rush), is forced to flee, forming a gang and opposing them to clean up his family names. That's all I can say about this story because I did not honestly pay attention to it. They also performed Orlando Bloom as Joseph Byrne, Naomi Watts as Julia Cook, Laurence Kinlan as Dan Kelly, Philip Barantini as Steve Hart, Joel Edgerton as Aaron Sherritt, Kiri Paramore as Constable Fitzpatrick, Kerry Condon as Kate Kelly, Emily Browning as Grace Kelly and Rachel Griffiths as Susan Scott. Ledger achieves quite good results, for what is worth it, and the film has eye-catching moments, especially in the fight for weapons at the end, but I can not say that I liked it because I did not look at it all. Fine!
