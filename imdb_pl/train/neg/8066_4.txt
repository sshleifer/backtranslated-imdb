Melissa Sagemiller, Wes Bentley, Eliza Dushku and Casey Affleck play young students at Middleton College in Middleton. Four teenagers create two love triangles. One night, during an ominous moon, they drive and argue on a slippery and winding mountain road. Not looking properly, they care about another car and one or more of them are killed. A nightmare begins ... A bad and politically correct horror without gore and nakedness. This is obviously influenced by the "Carnival of souls". Pictures are decent, unfortunately there is zero suspense.4 out of 10 - just another immediately forgotten basket.
