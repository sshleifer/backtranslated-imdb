This is not a bad movie ... but it is the type that makes you watch your girlfriend. History is not bad ... it makes one and a half hours seem so long. It's hard for me to lose this movie because I really like his idea, but it was too long and thin in history ... a pity. The main character never really changes everything from beginning to end. I mean going through something "changing life" and can barely smile. I really thought Mac was really good. His bizarre idiosyncrasies prevented the film from total disaster. Maybe I just do not "get" this movie. If anyone can explain it to me, I would like to be informed.
