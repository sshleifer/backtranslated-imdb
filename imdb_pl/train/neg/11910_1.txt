Interestingly, acting; it was not bad, just not enough. It was rather bad. Special effects and lines were the only culprit of this defeat. Standing alone, they were not terribly bad, but their combination was a tragic move. The performance seemed long and slow, and the special effects were apparently aimed at speeding up the film, but it completely failed. <br /> <br /> A lot of guilt for this disaster was triggered by special effects. they were cool. Appleby was not the best choice for this venture. Although it could be everything that they had to choose, with a little appreciation for the fans. An experienced actress would bring something to the role that Appleby never did. Scfi releases really good, original films, it's a pity that it did not work out.
