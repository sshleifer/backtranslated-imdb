This Tim Burton remake of the original "Planet of the Apes" from 1968 (with Charleton Heston in the lead role) is far from the quality and plot of the original. <br /> <br /> Certainly special effects have improved since 1968, but writing is not. The characters were boring and the dialogue was terrible. I sat there with my friend (who luckily only rented him) and I completely understood why before Christmas all toys "Planets of the Apes" in Target were in the check-in basket. <br /> <br /> My advice to Tim Burton: do not put it in your CV. <br /> <br /> My advice to everyone else: watch the original 1968 "Planet of the Apes" movie.
