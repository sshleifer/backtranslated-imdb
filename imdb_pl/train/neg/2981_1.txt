This movie was recently released on DVD in the USA, and I finally had the opportunity to see this hard-to-find gem. He even came with the original theater announcements of other classic Italian horror films, such as "SPASMO" and "BEYOND THE DARKNESS". Unfortunately, the announcements were the best thing in this movie. <br /> <br /> "ZOMBI 3" is in a bizarre way really connected to the infamous Lucio Fulci series "ZOMBIE", which began in 1979. Similarly, in comparison to "ZOMBIE", "ZOMBI 3" consists of a worn out plot and a handful of extremely evil actors who keep this "horror" on the ice. Gore hardly exists (unless somebody is afraid of people running with green moss on their faces), and English dubbing is below the embarrassing level. <br /> <br /> This time the plot is associated with something like a secret military operation with a group of inept scientists (ie, an idiot man and his stupid female kick to the side) who develop some kind of chemical substance called "Death" which is to revive the dead. As long as my ears do not have to be checked, I do not even remember REASONS to study "Death." It seems that it EXISTS just to wreak havoc on the poor souls who made the mistake of choosing the "star" in this movie laughter. <br /> <br /> In any case, "Death" is experimenting on the dead body (whom I swear he looked like Yul Brynner), and after the injection into his system he sits up straight and his head explodes! The sound effects are also quite funny - when the corpse's face breaks from the green slime, the sound of "paper squashing" is heard. The toxin "One Death" is transported outside and is "pickled" by a group of thieves, where it is opposed, but infect after being cut off on an exposed vial. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, a guy turns into a zombie, but before he can get away on time to a cheap motel, he infects a modest doorman and murders a maid, pushing her face into the bathroom mirror (!). The army catches it and immediately takes action before "eliminating" all those who are unlucky enough to be in the "contamination zone" and turn the motel upside down. They find an infected thief and burn his body, just to let the smoke infect a flock of birds that fly over the chimney (!). <br /> <br /> We switched to introducing a group of men who leave the army, listening to "groovy music", which comes out of a small, nasty boom box, pulling a trailer of slutty girls behind them that lean out of the windows and show your breasts. Can anyone say "zombie food"? We also have a sub-story with the girl and her boyfriend driving a car who stop to check the group of birds lying on the road ... the same birds that have been infected with the zombie smoke! <br /> <br /> Birds attack the boy, and the girl goes to the abandoned gas station to look for water. This is one of the most amazing moments in the film. It's about the old dirty, rusty and apparently abandoned building, where he's still loudly asking, "HI? IS THERE HERE? PLEASE, I NEED SOME WATER! "He encounters a group of zombies, one of which is chained to the wall (!), And the other waving a machete. After banging and rolling over on the ground, he escapes but does not blow the lighter with a petrol station. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, the birds attack the load of whores, and one girl is bowed and infected. Everyone is approaching the same motel where the original infection took place, and that's where the second most entertaining moment of the movie takes place. After a few hours (at most one day) the same motel is now covered with dust, it has the vines growing in it and it looks like it has been sitting for years. In any case, what better place to shelter than this particular building? Needless to say, the group begins to break down when several people leave together to get stuck in an incredibly stupid situation associated with a zombie attack. <br /> <br /> The third most entertaining moment concerns a man and woman who investigate an abandoned village, about which the woman comments: "THIS PLACE IS A DUMP!" Then she is pushed from the balcony by zombies into the pirahna contaminated water (?), where he has his legs off and turns into zombies in a few seconds! Meanwhile, her friend back at the motel, who had been pecked and infected with HOURS, is still in Zombie! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are too many inconsistencies in this movie that make this movie too stupid for words. For example, the time indicator for zombified infected people varies significantly. Sometimes it takes a few seconds, sometimes it takes hours. Some zombies are running, others are pulling their legs and walking really slowly. Some even make kung fu moves while others hide under haystacks to surprise people. Some zombies even talk! The funniest moment is of course the infamous "head of the zombie in the fridge", which "rises" in the air and "attacks" a stupid man who is looking for food. The funny thing is that his girlfriend pulls her throat through the "headless" counter-part (LMAO!). <br /> <br /> However, the biggest disappointment for me was the lack of plot with people who are killed by zombies. We never see them returning as a zombie, in fact the only ones we see "zombified" are those that are pecked by birds and one girl who bends her legs. Besides, I expected that the couple who died in the kitchen and / or the guy who died on the bridge came back as a zombie. It is also amazing that these zombies only take "a few bites" and then pass to the next victim. <br /> <br /> The most funny moment was, of course, the zombie fetus. A pregnant woman who has been infected is lying in a hospital bed. A woman who seems to have a lot of "medical knowledge" tries to release a baby (!) And has a face pulled by zombies before she thrusts her head into the woman's stomach, where the hand explodes and rips the rest of her face. Timeless! <br /> <br /> As always, all characters are perfect stereotypes of this genre. Megalomaniac military officer, pathetic, useless squealing of women who cry to die, obvious figures that MUST be killed (eg watch out for a man chasing a chicken!). There were many funny scenes, such as a shed set in the air with a hand grenade (of course, the scene in which the entire budget was spent) and a climate scene in which the man yells: "I AM THIRD ... THREE FOR YOUR BLOOD!" The costumes are really bad - the same zombies appear again during the movie, wearing the same "Asian" clothes that can be found in Bruce Lee's movie, and watch out for the blue skirt of the '60s that a girl wearing a motel is wearing when she and her boyfriend fall into the infected man. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie leaves the door as usual for an apocalyptic history, a radio DJ who tells the whole movie, becomes a zombie himself and warns his listeners about the "beginning of the end" while the two survivors take off with a helicopter. The material "DAWN OF THE DEAD", if you ask me about it. <br /> <br /> Regardless, this movie provides a lot of laughter. Gore is minimal, and what is there is very much unconvincing, let alone the imagination: a simple mixture of black blood, a thick green smear coming out of crying wounds and a "zombie makeup" made up of green moss. "ZOMBI 3" provides a good rental for a night party or night of beer and popcorn. In addition, horror fans should stay away. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
