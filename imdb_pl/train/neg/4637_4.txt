The Bangville police were to be Keystone Kops's debut, named after the studio in which they worked. In this, however, they do not dress in silly cops' costumes nor run fast, which is their trademark. In any case, Mabel Normand is a farm girl here who begged her father for a calf. He later sees strange men in the barn and quickly calls the police. One responds and the pursuit is on. Then Mabel slams the door when someone comes in. It turns out that her mother is jumping to the conclusion that the robbers are there! So when Mabel blocks the door with furniture, mother and father try to come inside! It was probably the most fun part of the short episode with police car explosions. It was a short 7 minutes that passed so quickly that it passed before it started. The only real characteristic that has developed is Mabel, which emanates charm only with her face and big eyes and seems so optimistic joy, except, of course, when she is afraid. It's easy to understand why she became a star. It was mainly thanks to her that I recommended at least once to see it and why I give it 4.
