This early vehicle Pia Zadora followed Harold Robbins' famous formula: the ambitious main character plunges into decadence, following the path to the top of a randomly chosen, but charming world, in this case the film industry. But despite the fact that the film is so formal that it is completely predictable, the film is completely unbelievable at the same time. Zadora (to call her an inexperienced actress to be charity) never convinces as a writer. One would expect a film about making films to have an insight into his own industry and creative process. But the script does not give her any features that make the writers interesting film characters: observation, the ability to say words, the relationship of love and hatred with their own creative abilities. Her character is as empty as a hole in a donut. And this is just the taste of incompetence displayed here. Pictures are so dark that sometimes it is difficult to see what is happening. And the scenes never connect with each other, so everything seems to be another accidental moments at the wrong parties in Hollywood. Avoid.
