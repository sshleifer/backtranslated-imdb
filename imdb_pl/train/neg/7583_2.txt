The worst film by David Lean. Even "In Which We Serve" was not as bad as this. Usually, a film with a really good reputation, such as this, has at least some advantages, so you can understand why it can be considered classic. But after seeing it, I just could not understand why this piece of shit was so well-liked even in 1945! I did not like British manners, storytelling, script (which can sometimes be witty, but completely ridiculous) and soundtrack. The character of the elvira is to be attractive and attractive, but in fact she was ugly and had a strange and annoying voice. Another film that convinced me that I do not trust the reputation of films. Another very overrated "British classic".
