This movie has been very popular lately in HBO or Cinemax. The reason is that they assume that people would be interested in comparing it to the whim of Leonardo DiCaprio / Tom Hanks with the same name. The only reason to see this is attractive Matt Lattanzi. Yummy! Although I must say that Matt was a bit above his teeth to play in high school. If he was a woman, he would have told him to play the MOTHER of high school! (Is it just me, does his daughter look like Shelley Duvall?) Oh, conspiracy - who cares? A typical teenage girl playing in adults.
