Several farmers fight in a small village in China. Wang Lung (Paul Muni) is buying O-Lan, his future wife who becomes his slave (Luis Rainer). American stars appear in major roles, talk with artificial accents and emphasize old stereotypes and patriarchal ideology. A good wife, many children and the earth are the best things for men. They are perceived as ownership and investments. Because it is a large budget film, in which many add-ons work, large sets are built and special effects take place, filmmakers could not risk hiring less popular actors. Luise Rainer won the Oscar for this performance, which is by far the worst in the film. Her unchanging face creates a barrier between her and the audience. O-Lan is to be the heart of the family and the best figure with which he sympathizes. On the other hand, Paul Muni gives better performance by showing his talents again. Another problem with the movie is the ending. It looks like Franklin did not know when to finish the picture. This film can be dangerous if it is considered a real example of Chinese culture and tradition.
