* Warning Spoilera * <br /> <br /> First of all, I rate this film 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> The idea is good, but there are too many stupid mistakes in the film, it is not possible to make it a psychic drama that could be. First of all, she never fights alone. After the initial very strange doubt her mother (which is not credible, when her mother turns out to be so supportive and loving later in the film), the victim of rape is not alone. <br /> <br /> She is also extremely naive and always falls into strange crew traps. <br /> <br /> Her friends are incredibly ugly. <br /> <br /> Most unbelievable is that Ethan does not control the crew when he changes his mind. Ethan is the leader of the team (hey, they even say that) and people seem to think that the other guy is a jerk, but when Ethan changes his mind, he just fails to convince even one person to the crew that he's right and that he was friend is wrong. Everyone just hates him ... why? The film gives no explanation. How has he ever become a leader? <br /> <br /> The funny thing is, my girlfriend thought I was watching Beverly Hills when she came in. Two actors from the same successful TV series .... a cheap way to get viewers?
