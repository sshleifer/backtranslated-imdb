This film screech sets a new standard for bad film production. Jared Rushton gives the right performance of a very badly created character in a fatal movie, creating a net effect of a very bad movie. The main message of the film is how the boy's temporary trip to the Canadian desert after surviving solo in a plane crash allows an unhappy teenager to cope with his distress when he discovered his mother's extramarital affair. Unfortunately, it turns into a bizarre collage of random "survival events" (including two particularly Hokey scenes with a bear fight) and strange hallucinations that make you wonder if this kid is sitting only in the alley somewhere on the pot, dreaming about it the whole movie (and what a nightmare!). In addition, despite some film viewer previews, there are several scenes unsuitable for very young children or family watching, including the graphic scene of a dead pilot underwater with one of his eyes apparently exploding. > <br /> In all a scary movie that nobody should be subjected to, let alone innocent children.
