Quite a disappointing prequel of the first two films, there is nothing of the uncertainty of the first and the uninteresting second. Focusing on the guys who "run" the ankle, it basically takes away the sense of tension inside the ankle, because we just do not care about the characters inside. Much of the film is simply boring and it is really terrible thanks to the introduction of a supervisor with glass eyes and crazy sea green-eyed. After that, however, it just goes down in the top unintentional gaiety. The end fits, however, tying it back to the first in an indirect way. The script is terrible, the acting is mediocre at best and the direction is not impressive. A much smaller continuation.
