The film will never be unbearable. And to say it directly, there is nothing to show either, except for the sexy Alicia Silverstone in a nerdy, not sexy figure revealing pretty sexy dresses. The story is very easy to follow or there is nothing to follow - you can see it in any way. There is no tension, little actions, unbelievable dialogues, unsatisfying sensuality, boring places and very bland action. Kevin Dillon is completely worthless. Silverstone ... well, I did not focus much on her acting, I admit. However, as I said before, if you have nothing to do but watch a movie, it will not look that bad. 4/10
