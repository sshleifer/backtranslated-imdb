Hmm ?? I agree with the reviewer who said that "weird people with generous tastes reviewed the film". I thought the movie was intriguing enough to watch it. I think it's mainly because of Marsden and Speedman - not the plot. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this film is on the one hand psychologically gentle, on the other it is deeply homophobic. Thumbs up and triple thumbs down. I am not sure if the film is aimed at promoting dialogue or spreading fear and propaganda. <br /> <br /> I thought acting was mediocre. A lot of conversation, which was about 90 degrees skewed from reality. I still wanted to make sense of the plot, but it's only a conversation with a crazy man (Speedman). I feel sorry for him (Speedman) because of his loss, but not completely. His loss is not greater and is certainly less than the losses suffered daily around the world by more significant causes. <br /> <br /> Does the video reveal naivety about HIV / AIDS? Yes: What the recipients intended. Is HIV a dark, mysterious, evil killer? And what about the victims? The answer to both questions is NO. Neither HIV nor its victims have more or less bad intentions than lupus, multiple sclerosis, tuberculosis, hepatitis, cancer or their victims, FOR GOD SAKE. Just because the disease is communicable, does not mean that it is purposeful OR negligence - or evil - simply IS. <br /> <br /> Does this justify ignorance or risky risk taking? - NO. Should all people practice safe sex? - YES. Will safe sex save the world? - NO. Is safe sex realistic in all cases of love and desire between passionate and emotional people? ?? OF COURSE NOT. In what world would we live if everyone followed the rules, no one ever took risks, and sex was never spontaneous and passionate? Do I ignore the fact that the film deals specifically with gay sex? ?? YES. HIV spreads by dividing blood or body fluids between infected and uninfected people. Sex is not necessary for transmission, gay or otherwise. <br /> <br /> I am always bothered by the intentional violence of one person to another. Actually, I thought the movie did a good job, presenting the absurdity of Tom's brutal abduction, slavery and intentions towards Dan, and that kind of crazy violence takes place every day. <br /> <br /> Notes of awareness film: Tom is crazy. <br /> <br /> Why Dan does not ask "why" you feel this way, not "what are you doing"? Implication: men having sex with men receive "AIDS" Implication: HIV = AIDS Where was Tom's responsibility in a sexual act? Why was Dan obliged to use a condom? "Maybe you ruined it before you put it in?" What are we talking about here? Was one of the parties unconscious? "Maybe she did not want to hear the truth," you're joking with me. "She's in heaven and so unbelievably hurt with what he knows about me now"? Is Dan's life over if he has HIV? Definitely not! Is this why the whole world is so homophobic ???? They think that homosexuals are the cause of HIV, that they will give it to the rest of the world, and we will all die? Are you joking??? Are people stupid enough to think that the cause of homosexuality is a problem? Is this how we feel about the victims of tuberculosis? malaria? I see that Tom is hurt because of his wife's death and blames him for AIDS, but seriously? Who is guilty here? Victim or virus? Are diseases really responsible for the sick? (assuming they were not looking for and did not try to spread the disease). <br /> <br /> Sure, safe sex is necessary for a safe life, but it does not lead in the same way, it does not fly, it does not leave the house, it does not live. Do we really want to blame the victims' disease? Would the safe sex between Tom and Dan stop the final death of Tom's wife? Perhaps, but not the only responsibility of Dan. <br /> <br /> Tom is crazy. Did I mention it. <br /> <br /> Tom to Dan: "maybe you will get what you deserve"? COME ON! 24 days: Rapid, naive and homophobic. <br /> <br /> Am I exaggerating? Perhaps. But I think this movie points the gay finger at their reckless and malicious intent towards the "simple world" by engaging in dangerous sex when the proportion of homosexuals who practice safe sex is proportionally equal to or better than the proportion of heterosexuals. We all have to wake up and take HIV / AIDS seriously. HIV kills hundreds of thousands of simple Africans every year.
