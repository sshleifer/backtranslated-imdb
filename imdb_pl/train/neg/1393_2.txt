I thought watching movies about employment on corporate compliance was tedious. This film has not gone anywhere. What might have been a bit of a half-hour semi-darkness, turned into an endless movie loss on people parked cars, a photo of a guy's pool (he really needs to pick up his phone), needle printer his job, and Heuy and Louey are sitting in a yellow lit room controlling the repeating "T minus 10 and counting", as if something exciting was going to happen. It's not like that, do not give up hope. The best thing about this movie is seeing James Best and Gerald McC in something other than the famous television personalities, and this is stretching to find something good. And do NOT start with music that consisted entirely of Tympani, a few large marine mammals, and a microphone feedback. This movie is as close as I gave him one more, but he gets 2 because I was able to finish the cure for insomnia and did not have to go inside. AVOID ALL COSTS.
