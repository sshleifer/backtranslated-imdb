but Thomas Ian Griffith simply does not have a Polish language who has a great actor, admitting that he was born 5+ years ago. Some of the humorous poems could have been designed to create not only action, but also comedy. And how to throw away the Central Committee from Katia Koslovska? Plummer's figure was so banal that it would fit Bullwinkle better. Personally, if the action films show the skin - I would like to see an equal time between a woman and a man, otherwise do not show any.
