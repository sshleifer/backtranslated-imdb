The Broadway musical "A Chorus Line" is probably the best musical in the theater. It's about the experiences of people who live for dance; the joys they experience and the sacrifices they make. Each dancer listens to parts in the Broadway choir line, but what comes out of each of them is the story of how their lives led them to dance as a respite. <br /> <br /> The film version does not convey the passion or beauty of the stage performance and is probably the worst film adaptation of the Broadway musical, because it is devoid of life and devoid of feeling for dancing, in general. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake was putting the director's work to Sir Richard Attenborough, whose director proposed the right accent and tempo for "Gandhi". Why would someone who is right ask an epic director to shoot a musical that takes place in a rather narrowed place? <br /> <br /> Which brings us to the next problem. "A Chorus Line" takes place on stage in a theater without real sets and limited costume changes. It was the least brilliant musical on Broadway, and its simplicity was his glory. However, this does not translate well into a movie and no one really thought it would. For this reason, the film should have taken us into the lives of these dancers and should have left the theater process and auditions. The singers could offer their songs in other environments, and even offered flashbacks of their first ballet, jazz or tap class. Heck, they could dance on Broadway in their vivid imagination. However, there is not a single shred of imagination to create this film, because Attenborough's complete indifference to dance and the play itself is visible in his weak direction. <br /> <br /> Many scenes are simply awkward, because the dancers tell the story of the director (Michael Douglas) whether he wants to hear them or not. Douglas's character is capricious when it comes to choosing who will give a nice ear and who has no patience. <br /> <br /> While filmmakers pretended to be faithful to the nature of the game, some heretical changes were made. Very beautiful "Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love" - ​​a great number on the stage that brought back the dancers to adolescence - was removed and replaced by a terrible "Surprise", a song so bad that it was nominated for Oscar. Adding an insult to injury, "Surprise" simply told the same story as "Hello, Love", but without wit or pathos. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to watch this movie, unless you want a lesson about what NOT to do when you transfer a Broadway show to the movie. If you want to see a movie version of this program, the closest thing is the brilliant "All That Jazz" by Bob Fosse. While Fosse's daughter is in the "Choir Line", HE is Fosse, who should be involved as a director. He would know what to do with this material that deserved more respect than this sad effort.
