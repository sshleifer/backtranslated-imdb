I went to the movie as Sneak Preview in Austria. So I had no idea what I would see. The story is very normal. The film is very long, I believe it could be cut to 1/2, without causing problems. It's the kind of movie you can see in a boring night you want to be bored with! Ashton Kutcher was very good. Kevin Costner is fine. The film talks about the American Coast Guard, how they are trained, their lifestyle and the problems they face. Because the film does not have too many effects. So if you want to watch it, you do not have to waste your time and money on cinema. It would be more effective to watch it at home when it appears on DVD.
