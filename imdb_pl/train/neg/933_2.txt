Undeveloped / unbelievable plot line (until I realized where it was going, I did not care anymore) bad castings (next ... William Macy as a hit ???) bad targeting ever seen Tracey Ullman doing SO wrong?) (Is I was worried about what happened to the unethical, incompetent hero John Ritter?) bad script ...) The only really good thing about this was the kid. Ten lines? Is not it okay if your comment is less than ten lines? What's next ... whose rules? Why can not I say what I have to say in less than 10 lines ?? Is this not arbitrary? Why can not you have less than 10 lines of comment?
