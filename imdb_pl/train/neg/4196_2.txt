This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Not only history, but acting is shockingly bad. Dialogue sounds like someone reading a message. <br /> <br /> This is rated as comedy / drama / romance, it's not out of these things! It's a small action, that's all. There really is NO comedy or drama. <br /> <br /> If you went to the cinema to see it, I feel sorry for you. I do not recommend it at all. Almost everything you decide on will be better. This is an action / crime video. Action scenes were sucked out, and the criminal part was very predictable. <br /> <br /> If you're not interested in a good story or a good game. And you just want to look at the "foreign" movie to see that you're a stranger. It may be for you.
