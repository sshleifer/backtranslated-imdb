If you saw Sholay in 1975, do not watch this movie. If you have NOT seen Sholay from 1975, go WATCH. But do not watch this movie. This movie contains all the ingredients that could go wrong with Sholay's remake. <br /> <br /> Amitabh 'Babban' Bachchan plays the role of a psychic black character (probably only 40 minutes of drum, which should not be burnt). If you delete the rest of the movie and just watch your character in amitabh, it will still be worth watching. But as insp. Narsimha, Mohanlal does not do justice to his talent. Ajay Devgan (Heero) is extremely down-to-earth and the only reason I think they have thrown Prashant Raj into Paradise is because he has a striking resemblance to Amitabha on his young days. Sushmita Sen wears well, with grace and makeup. But the award for the "Worst performance and any role to this day" must be Nishie Kothari. She manages to demote her to such levels that even drama in high school would overshadow her performance. <br /> <br /> If you have a deadly enemy, take him to this movie. :)
