I rented this movie today, thinking it could be a good football movie because I'm a big football fan. Boy, I was wrong. This movie is too religious and polite and REALLY unrealistic. This movie says that if you are a Christian, you can easily get everything you want in life, eg Become a great player! You do not become a great footballer, becoming a Christian and asking God, you do it through practice and hard work. All you have to do is ask God and he will give you everything ... puh-lease. This is not true at all, duh. I was laughing a few times because of this embarrassment. The only funny part was stupidity (cartoonist Shultz? No, the guy who flew over the Atlantic, etc. Etc.) But really this movie was not so great. I do not recommend it, especially if you're not a Christian, lol.
