Strange people living in the city live their lives. There is a licker guy who licks everything, a dumpster who finds the body that he takes home to live with, a crazy girl with a doll dressed like her, a guy who wants to clean up girls from their wicked ways ... in extreme cases this film in black and white film is better without color. The monochrome image takes two steps away from the feeling of a home movie. Just like in Trom's film, this movie is cool in attacks and beginnings, but most of all it is strange because of strange sake and soon becomes a crushing bore, because one you see configurations, you can guess where there will be a lot of time - not always but enough that it would not be fun (although I did not see the coming clean up). It's worth a try if you have nothing else to watch and wait for the next set of Golden Girls to come with Netflix.
