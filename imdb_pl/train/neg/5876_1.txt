I had to compare two versions of Hamlet to my Shakespeare class and unfortunately I chose this version. Everything from acting (actors deliver most of their lines directly to the camera) to camera shots (all medium shots or close ones ... no scenery shots and very few backgrounds in the pictures) was absolutely horrible. I saw it during my spring break and I can safely say that I felt released from the 114 minutes of my holidays. Not recommended by any part of the imagination.
