I probably give more credit than it deserves, because it's Halloween, I was at "Knott's Scary Farm" and I was in the mood to watch a really bad movie from Halloween. <br /> <br /> Oh, and it only costs me one dollar. <br /> <br /> I usually go through a movie to get to "good things", but I resisted the temptation here and I'm still not sure why. From the initial photos it was obvious that it was not a "real" movie, not even a B movie. It's more in the category of "horrors" by DeCoteau, such as "The Brotherhood", which are shot in a video for about 50 cents (in fact I was half worried when one of his big college boys stumbled in his pants or something. There were no shots (too expensive to perform many camera settings) and flat lighting, but ... hard to determine. There is something refreshing in watching the director without money, pull back the half-decent movie. The fact that he even does a decent job is praiseworthy, and this movie has its advantages - the game is not bad, the photography is pretty good (if it's too bright to be frightening), there are some surprises, and the whole thing is a bit ... somehow somehow. <br /> <br /> A group of kids from college (for an unknown reason) got stuck in a warehouse where they organize a yearly haunted house. The terrible old man gives them a satanic book and accidentally evokes the powers of hell. It causes that disguised people in the haunted house become who they are and cause a lot of chaos and human suffering. Along the way, we are treated as a strangely complex and thoughtful thread of lesbian relationships - it's interesting that this couple seems to be the most rounded in the film. Yes, there is a sex scene, but it is not a good thing - at least not more than in any legal lesbian movie that shows them sex. It is rather unusual that the horror sacrifices time and effort not to resort to cheap exploitation. <br /> <br /> Another thing that interested me was how clearly they tried to imitate "stupid children having sex and dying" in the climate of the 80s. It's hard to believe because there are so many films that already exist, the genre was made to die. I'm not sure if it's good or bad that these filmmakers just tried to make another entry in this genre, without irony, as if it was still a LIVING genre, but I appreciated the trial. <br /> <br /> Which is why I sat through it; sometimes you just want to watch mindless, no budget, horror "A-for-effort". There were really too many settings, not enough gore, endless storylines, blind alleys and stereotypes and an unfortunate general feeling of a movie that simply did not have enough money to be a movie that the producers anticipated ... but at least the scene of the haunted house was pretty cool. I would pay for going to this haunted house if it existed, and it did not bother me to pay the dollar to see it on DVD, even if I never see it again. <br /> <br /> Oh, and ** possible spoiler **, but it was a great, short case with a vampire girl in the coffin: "I used to be claustrophobic. But I changed. " Ha ha, good.
