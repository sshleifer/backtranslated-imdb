Despite the sumptuous production numbers and great costumes this film is mandatory to watch. The plot of murder-mystery is just a tool for editing musical numbers, but often leads to a stunning detention, except that it is not very addictive. Although a lot of money was spent on them, the numbers are badly displayed and badly photographed. This is of course a movie before the code, because girls often wear very few clothes, and there is even a song that sings marijuana praise! All performances are one-act, but it's nice to see Carl Brisson in the musical, but when Victor McLaglen, like a Lieutenant cop, once again watches hunting, you can throw a towel or least forward to the next number. Too bad patrons who were trapped in the cinema during its premiere!
