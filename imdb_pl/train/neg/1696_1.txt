I hate to throw away such lines, but in this case I feel I have to: the American remake of THE GRUDGE is by far the worst film I've seen in cinemas in the last 5 years. I said it. And since I've done it, let me explain why. <br /> <br /> "When someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage, a curse is born. The curse is gathered here in death. Those who meet him will be consumed by his fury. " That is the premise of THE GRUDGE and I admit that it sounds intriguing. Unfortunately, filmmakers do not take it anymore. Those who encounter the "curse" are really absorbed in his fury and all that you get. You want more? Well, that's not good. Some critics and fans indicate that THE GRUDGE's only goal is to scare you. The problem is that when there is no conspiracy, scary images and sounds can only move so far. Director Takashi Shimizu, pulling out George Sluizer and rewriting his own original film (s), bravely trying to build atmosphere in the first hour? repeating the same scene over and over. It looks almost like this: <br /> <br /> -person enters the house <br /> <br /> - heard by the camera and / or a strange sound is heard <br /> <br /> -person goes to investigate < br /> <br /> -the vocalization begins loud <br /> <br /> -person sees the ghost <br /> <br /> -du≈ºego krzyku and / or cat skrzeczenia <br /> <br /> - cutting na czarno <br /> <br /> Before the audience gets a little thread, the same scenario develops 5 times in the first hour. The first time was really a little scary. Every subsequent use became funny when the movie lasted. Before the end of the movie ended, my laughter and my friend wondered if this scene would end "with loud shouting and black cut". It never turned out that we were wrong. <br /> <br /> The film does not have a line plot, but it develops in a series of vignettes that leave the audience mixed up. I have no problem with non-linear story telling when it's done well. The movie jumps from period to period without rhyme or reason. I have not seen a movie like this since the opening of the theatrical version of HIGHLANDER 2. And this storytelling technique has behind it every kind of secret that a movie could have. If you already know that ghosts scared two characters to death, how is it shocking when their bodies are in the attic? And why should we care when the detective tries to investigate the mysterious disappearances, since we already know what happened to everyone? <br /> <br /> Of course, in the second week the US version of THE RING earned $ 15 million on the first weekend THE GRUDGE is nothing but a calculated imitation disguised as a real movie. The most horrible thing about THE GRUDGE is that he earned $ 40 million on the first weekend, and some consider him the "scariest movie ever". I wonder what will happen to those who will be consumed by the fury of paying to see THE GRUDGE?
