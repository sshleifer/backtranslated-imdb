Let me briefly present the movie: A rotten, naughty child named Max will come across a radio containing Kazaam: a raping genie. Like all other species, he wishes to fulfill 3 wishes, but thanks to his good temper it also helps Max in his personal life, because he has to do with persecutors and father mixed up in organized crime. During all this time, Kazaam raps from time to time (also showing Shaqa's grim skills). <br /> <br /> This movie proves what we all know: athletes have to stick to sport. I admit that it never looked like an Oscar-deserving movie, but EVERYTHING on this waste of film is awful. Characters are either unlikely or stupid, the plot is not even worth mentioning, dialogue is a joke, and Shaq is only a quarter of the problem. Hell, even if Denzel Washington plays in Kazaam, this movie will still be a joke. I know that the movie only drew EVERYONE, because Shaq was then so big (in no case it was not intended). Honestly, I can not come up with one positive thing about this loss of time. Shaq should have taken the time to make this movie in order to practice free kicks.
