There is only one thing I have to say about this film - the scene in which Shaq has a musical number with the character of Francis Capra about the desire to be a genie; never see this movie. This story is awful, acting is awful (come on, it's Shaq!) And I'd rather see Capra in Free Willy (equally horrible) twice before I see this movie.
