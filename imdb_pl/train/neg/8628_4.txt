My 7-year-old daughter loved how it was done by Disney. This is a problem with "Air Buddies". It is a strictly film movie for children filled with carefully calculated sweetness, a pair of politically correct customs and enough nocturnal humor to avoid the terrifying assessment of G. As a parent and even as a 10-year-old, you've seen it before and done better earlier. Think "101 Dalmatians meet at home" and you have a general idea. I think that a good story for children is a good story, a period. "Air Buddies", which is as original as recycled paper, does not meet this standard. This is not the worst movie that your child can watch, but there are megatons better.
