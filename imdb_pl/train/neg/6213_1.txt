This movie has become one of my 10 worst movies. Awful. <br /> <br /> There was no continuous minute in which there was no fight with one or the other monster. There was no chance for character development, they were too busy running from one sword to the other. I did not have any emotional attachment (except for the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them). Scenes have been grossly stolen from other films, LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix. <br /> <br /> Examples <br /> <br />> The ghost scene at the end was stolen from the last Star Wars scene with Yoda, Obee One and Vader. <br /> <br />> The spider at the beginning was exactly like Frodo attacked by a spider in the Return of Kings. (Elijah Wood is the victim of both films) and wait ...... it hypnotizes (stings) his victim and wraps them ... uh hello ???? <br /> <br />> theme of the whole machine versus people BY≈Å Matrix..or Terminator ..... <br /> <br /> There are more examples, but why waste time? And will anyone tell me what happened to the Nazis?!?! Nazis ???? <br /> <br /> It was a story for minors that was brought to underage applications. The film could not decide whether it was a movie for children or an adult film, and it was not too big. <br /> <br /> Just awful. A real disappointment at least. Save money.
