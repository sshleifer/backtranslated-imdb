Wowwwwww, about an hour ago I finally finished watching this horrible movie !!! I wanted to turn it off in the first 10 minutes, but I came to the conclusion that I would give him a chance because it simply could not have been better. Or at least have some advantages, as at least I thought it would be a make-think type movie, or really intelligent, or very well filmed or something ... Needless to say it was not like that, and I wasted about one and a half hours life. I'm not even going to explain why it's terrible, because it wastes my time to explain that "it may contain spoilers" ... IMDb, you should calm down on spoilers and pay more attention to people who judge videos and comments they do not pay for writing good reviews or engaging in some way in a movie or something like that. I thought it would be fun after this scary movie to see how bad it will be, and I was very shocked when I saw quite high marks ... all grades with around 7-10 stars must explicitly refer to ANYTHING VARIOUS movie ... I'm still a big fan IMDb, but seriously think about this evaluation process, because this film should be rated no higher than maaaybbbeee like 3.
