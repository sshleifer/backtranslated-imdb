* the review may contain spoilers * <br /> <br /> predictable, camp, bad special effects. it has the feeling of a television movie. the idea of ​​the UN as being taken over by Satan is an interesting phrase to the end of the world according to the Bible. the premise is interesting, but her excitement falls short. if you want to convince people to Christianity with such a film, at least make it a qualitative film! I checked the watch seriously while watching this song. I can not say anything more about this movie since I saw it more than a year ago, and besides, there is not much to say about this movie ... Skip it!
