It is obvious that all the good reviews posted so far in this film come from people who were involved in the movie or know someone who knows someone, and thus saw a lot of cuts. Well, I do not know anyone who would be involved in this and saw the final cut, and it's clean trash. The only thing that happens is ambition and many scenes from the horrors of horror (none on the screen is terribly long). It's as if the filmmakers made this film over the weekend during the horror convention, and actors like Tony Todd, Tom Savini, David Hess and Michael Berryman filmed scenes during coffee breaks. It is a very cheap, careless X-Files with shot-on-video with a terrific play of non-actors actors with more mulets than is allowed in the 21st century. Little or no action; all this is an overly explanatory dialogue that tries to explain the pointless story with no sense. Computer effects are a joke, but they do not have enough or enough action to make this movie enjoyable in the MST3K way. After about 8 simple scenes in which you do not say anything, you will find yourself in the fast scroll button ... and you will not let go. Absolutely worthless.
