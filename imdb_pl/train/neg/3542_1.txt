After reading the comments on the site, I feel compelled to write for the first time. It looks like this movie is like Marmite and shared the audience. I must say that although I agree that movies do not need to make sense to be enjoyable (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE), they still have to engage you in the form. Now, when I was completely immersed in the murderous lesbian affair in Lynch's work, I must say that I could not give a word about Mr. Green or other cardboard gangsters who lived in this world. <br /> <br /> Besides, while so many people seem to try to say you did not like it because you did not get it, I would have to disagree - I did not like it because I was bored. I wanted the movie to end, and constantly listening to these quotes still did not help. Call it wise, if you like - I think it is repetitive. <br /> <br /> However, my main reason for writing is the question of all other reviewers - there were no credits on the printout of the movie that I saw. Just black music. Did I watch the printout with a dud, or is it a proof of GR's pretentiousness? Or did everyone involved in the film see a severe cut and their name removed ???
