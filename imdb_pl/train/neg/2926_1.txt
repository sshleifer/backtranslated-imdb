It looks like there is a bit of cursing when it comes to gay cinema. Namely, happy endings are not very frequent. Beautiful things excluded, homosexual films end with breaking off relationships or premature death. And some, like Come Undone, only the end ... period. <br /> <br /> The creators of this horrible nonsense have something to learn about the plot, direction and time lines. During the first ten minutes of this film, I felt somewhat confused, let alone the first look at the character of Jeremi Elkaim, who led a small psychological session. It looks like this movie was randomly made without the slightest attempt of continuity or consistency. There is no real way to determine when you're watching the present or some etheric flashback. I could take only that before it became really unattractive. <br /> <br /> Stephen Holden from The New York Times called this film "... beautifully shiny and completely real." Well, it seems that Stephen invested in beer goggles before watching, because it really is not beautiful. Because of all the praise that this film received, I expected something worth seeing. Unfortunately, the film has achieved its title. And at the end of the movie (which did not provide any resolution, I could add) that writers, director and film have everything that Come Undone has.
