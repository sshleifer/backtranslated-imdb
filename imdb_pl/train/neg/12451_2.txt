This movie is funny, not good. Fights are terribly bad, while sometimes they try to shock you, breaking some bones, and even this happens only two or three times, certainly not enough to call it a shocking failure. Shooting means that the hero can enter the open field with 10 people shooting him from the Uzi, raising his weapon, starting to shoot and not injuring himself. <br /> <br /> The story is empty, the guy wakes up, loses his memory, starts to fight, because he's good at it. Five years later, memories return, revenge of blablabla. <br /> <br /> Not worth the money, really not worth your time, unless you're drunk and bored.
