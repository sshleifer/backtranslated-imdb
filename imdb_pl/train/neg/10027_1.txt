The action in this film beats Sunny bhai in Gadar. Akshay Kumar has Leonidus' superpower in 300, Neo in the Matrix and Spiderman and Superman. That's funny. In addition to the typical comedy Akshay Kumar and Anil Kapoor, I see nothing positive about this film. The story seems to be that the writer told his 10-year-old son to write. The film is so unreal that shooting long range Anil Kapoors with a shotgun is the smallest mistake of the director. With the exception of Tashan's directors who make this film, there is no other Tashana. I regret that I'm wasting money on this movie and I do not recommend it to anyone. 1/10 is the least I can give on IMDb or give it a zero.
