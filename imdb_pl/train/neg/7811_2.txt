Here's how you do it: believe in God and regret your sins. Then things should turn around the next day. <br /> <br /> Until the last fifteen minutes this movie is just a bad summary of a bad drunken life. His mother is dying. His stepmother is b_tch. His dad is dying. He drinks. He is getting married. He has children. He drinks a little more. His wife is angry. He disappoints his children. Wife threatens to leave. He calls the late Reverend late at night, he wants to kill himself. Then, after recapitulation, we receive a subtle "Left Behind" message. <br /> <br /> "He needed a withdrawal". This is a sentence that I had to repeat over and over again when loans began to appear, so I would not lose my respect for Madsen. <br /> <br /> Madsen kneels and begs Christ for forgiveness. When he does, he goes outside and says he sees the world in a different way. He tells his wife that he has found God, and that's enough. Reverse the scene for four months, and the wife is tired of going to church. Finish the movie as Madsen's walks at the bar and give a monologue about how happy she is with Christ and without alcohol. Last moment? Gives a dismissive wave to the bar (ie Sin house) and gives gay, Miami-Vice, after school a special congratulatory jump in the air, like freezing the frames of the camera. See, why did I have to repeat the sentence? "He needed a withdrawal." <br /> <br /> Man this movie is bad. The production values ​​of B-Grade 80 do not help too much. The screenplay could easily be an episode of 'Touched By An Angel'. It could have been knocked out in 30 minutes plus advertising. Acting is wooden and it is never reliable. Even Madsen, who I am a huge fan of, and is the only reason I was sitting, clearly shows that this is his first acting job and he does not yet know his $$ from the elbow on the camera. After 45 minutes I started to get discouraged. It was homework. I just wanted to put it down and say it well, I saw half of it. It's enough. But no. If I were sitting by Ninjas Cheerleader, I could sit in this place. <br /> <br /> The only reason I do not give this item, 1 are two points: 1) I love Madsen. I know it's not fair. But it's great to see the title opening "Introduction to Michael Madsen". Sue me. 2) Some dialogues are so bad that they are classic. At the end I'll stick some quotes so that you can enjoy them. <br /> <br /> That's it. To end this, this thing is a piece of shit that should remain blushed with the rest of the peat. But hey! Look! Michael Madsen! (See also TILT, EXECUTIVE TARGET, DAUGHTER OF MY GOD, etc.). Now I have to observe the Reservoir Dogs and watch Madsen torture a policeman to regain my respect for him. See you, Kids. <br /> <br /> "These things will make me blind, but I will drink it anyway" - the first taste of cheap Madsen alcohol <br /> <br /> "I do not have" I understand! Everything seems so beautiful! - Madsen goes outside after confessing to God <br /> <br /> "I will go to the center later and I will raise the Bible, and I will also get a haircut" - Madsen after rebuilding at the table, because Satan lives in his hair
