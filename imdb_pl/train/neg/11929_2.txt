I watched "The Eye" before I watched this one. I really liked "Oko", it was one of the best films of the latest Asian cinema. So I chose this "haunted Bangkok" because it was the same director and it was a kind of popular round here. But man, what a disappointment ... "Haunted Bangkok" is three stories about love, revenge, ghosts, etc., Which are not at all frightening, even disturbing (like "Eye" was) ... there is nothing. I can not even fill the 10 lines required for the comment ... <br /> <br /> 100% boring. <br /> <br /> * My stake: 2/10
