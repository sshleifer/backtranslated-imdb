"The Deadly Look of Love" is basically "Fatal Attraction" with a few twists and turns added to the other half. The ending will not surprise anyone who has seen more than two or three movies of the week. This is another warning story about surrendering to temptation and it adds nothing to the new genre. <br /> <br /> Brett (Vincent Spano) is engaged to a beautiful woman who just has a large trust fund. Even though she has everything, she risks losing everything by starting an affair with Janet (Jordan Ladd). Janet, a fair-haired blonde from Cedar Falls, falls for Brett, and she does not treat him particularly well when she comes clean about her engagement. Soon after the wedding, Mrs. Brett appears dead in the main bedroom of the large, luxurious house she shared with her new husband. When the police ask Brett, he immediately points his finger at Janet. After her arrest, Janet seems to be getting lighter - not because she was an image of stability earlier. Her protector (Holland Taylor) is convinced that Janet is innocent and if he wants to prove it. <br /> <br /> Did she do it or not? How will it end? You can find the answers to these questions the next time "The Deadly Look of Love" appears on your local station. And remember not to miss the moral of this beautiful story: men are pigs and women are crazy.
