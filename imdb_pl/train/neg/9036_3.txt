I can not believe I'm wasting my time watching this rubbish! I did it because Leonard Maltin gave him an 'AA' rating, and for television films it is usually a reliable indicator of good quality entertainment. <br /> <br /> Acting was fine, but whoever wrote it should always be deprived of access to any means of communication. The conspiracy is ridiculous, the motives of "bad guys" are completely absent, and the various family interactions are stupid and shallow. For example, Dad says that a violent reaction to aggression is BAD, but it turns out to be an "admirable" person NOT because of his philosophy "ignore idiots", but because it is quite good in his fists ... <br /> <br /> The only news I managed to get from this pulp was that the nuclear family is good and the alternative living conditions are bad. Oh, and bad people happen to good people.
