"The Leap Years" is a film adapted from the e-novella of the Singaporean writer Catherine Lim, which became the first single novel / novel sold on the Internet. The film had a winding post-production schedule: filmed at the beginning of 2005, It was released at the end of 2005, But it appeared only 3 years later, on 29 February 2008, Leap Year. <br /> <br /> Before I say anything, I must first admit that I'm not a fan of the romance genre, so I can be a bit biased towards this movie - I only watched it because it was a Singaporean movie and that you can rent it in my neighborhood library. Here are my two cents on the film. <br /> <br /> Let's start by saying that apart from KS and Qi Yu-Wu and Wong Li-Lin, everyone here seems to be Eurasian. The love interest is Eurasian (Ananda Everingham), and the three Wong buddies are all er-hem, Eurasian. Does this film perpetuate the stereotype that falling in love with and dealing with Eurasian people is more "common" than an ordinary Chinese (or any other Asian race?) I do not know, it certainly looks like this. In addition, everyone in the film speaks of a mystical "bad" accent that is nowhere to be found, certainly not in Singapore. This is a kind of "semi-perfect English" that the author would like to convey to us, but which does not exist anywhere except, for example, through the MTV channel. The effect is that the dialogue of the film sounds forced and stiff, it is not supported by the lack of real blue Singapore in the cast. <br /> <br /> It seems that the screenwriter is trying too hard to pull a one-liner after one-layered. After twenty minutes, the "joke" of the film begins to gain momentum, and the film begins to serve its usual film. <br /> <br /> I guess I did not like this movie, because the whole premise of maintaining the romance for 16 long years seems incredible. <br /> <br /> There are other disbeliefs in the film. I can not believe that KS (played by Qi Yu-wu) would be one of Wong's girls. And the scene in which the groom says, "Go before I change my mind," was used in hundreds of TV series in East Asia (Korean, Chinese, Hong Kong, Taiwanese, etc.) ... <br /> <br /> So 4 stars for this movie. The value of production is fair, and Wong Li-lin tries its best, but the scenario does not help. Joan Chen has a 15-minute piece in the film as an older Wong and is probably the best actress in the movie, but, hey, her role is simply episodic. <br /> <br /> If you meet "The Leap Years" in the rental or library, you may want to put it in a DVD player because of curiosity, but otherwise, for people who do not like the genre of romance, you can decide whether do not miss this.
