Yes, there are great performances here. Unfortunately, they happen in the context of a movie that seems to have no idea what it is doing. In the first 45-60 minutes, all the music behaves like a realistic one. Suddenly, about an hour, the characters who have always talked to each other, suddenly began to sing to each other. To make things even more confused, out of nowhere, they actually do about 15 minutes of the sung dialogue, and then they seem to give up this idea and move on to other things, like a drummer starting in a jazz club, and two electric guitars suddenly turn into completely arranged song with a massive section of strings. In addition to all this inconsistency in how to use music, the composer's apparent inability to write music in a style that is supposedly portrayed. While the first few tracks mimic the Motown sound from the 1950s, the rest of the movie is just (bad) Broadway show music. Then there is the pure stupidity of the snippets of the group making the imitation of the Jackson family and Eddie Murphy changing from Little Richard to James Brown in Lionel Richie. When he started giving Stevie Wonder, I could not help laughing. It was clearly one of those movies that make me appreciate how little time I have on earth and that I can not waste two hours watching this movie.
