I will keep it as short as possible because this piece of nonsense does not require any mention. ZOMBIE 90 is one of the worst films ever made - just there with another terrible Schnaas entry - ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH! T 3). These films are so bad that everyone involved in their creation should be filmed. Somehow I managed (barely ...) to sit in ZOMBIE DOOM - but ZOMBIE 90 is so horribly inept - even compared to another terrible movie of Schnaas - that I had to scroll everything after the first 10 minutes. ZERO acting skills, inept gore, horrible camera-style camera, funny dubbing ... it lasts and lasts. I really can not find a single item that could compensate for this junk - and I usually find SOMA in return in almost every movie. This is really one of the worst films ever - you were warned ... 1/10
