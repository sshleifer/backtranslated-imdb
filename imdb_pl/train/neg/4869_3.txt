This movie was unable to discover the humanity of animals that left me with an empty feeling inside. [Spoiler ahead of us] I was not convinced that Dr. D really had an irresistible reason to give up the big buy-out transaction to help his furry friends. While Babe (original) undermined the trend of big budgets, focusing on the human virtues of animals compared to their human counterparts, all the animals in this movie were nothing more than comical caricatures that were eagerly thrown into the meat grinder (even more so if one could understand their pointless babble). Without the bad behavior of Eddie Murphy, this movie would be a flop.
