Woody Allen, when he's the best, has one of the hardest feathers in the area. It can make a sharp observation and wrap it around a line of impact like no other. However, when it is in the worst case scenario, his films can stink of pretentiousness. Unfortunately, Melinda and Melinda have this stench from opening to closing. Configuration is one of his more intriguing ideas. Four friends are sitting in a restaurant discussing whether the essence of life is comedy or drama. To solve this dispute, one man tells the beginning of the story and asks two other men who argue (one comic playwright, the other a dramatic playwright), whether history is a comedy or a tragedy. The two men continue the story, and the movie plays stories that weave together. When I heard about this film for the first time, I realized that they tell the exact same story, the genre (comedy or drama) only changes depending on how you look at it. That would be interesting. However, the stories have only one main element and several side elements. These are completely different stories with big feature differences. The drama is so rigidly written and pretentious that it can only really act as a parody. If that was the case, it failed because these elements prevent the public from feeling any emotional investment in any of the characters. Comedy is a story that has moments of success, but they are still short and fleeting. Will Farrell is apparently supposed to be Woody's head, but he could play this character much more credibly, without adding Woody's stuttering and ticking hands. Woody is the best in being Woody. When someone tries, does not play a character, he models a recognizable actor. This type of thing just takes the audience out of the story. <br /> <br /> My favorite films by Woody Allen make me leave the theater a bit lighter in spirit than I entered. This made me want to get my money back.
