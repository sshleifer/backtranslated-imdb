It's the worst and I mean the worst movie I've ever seen. The whole story is completely unconvincing and full of stupidity. <br /> <br /> I mean ... <br /> <br /> The guy in this movie can actually talk to the computer as a real person. You probably think it must be a super cool high-tech computer, well, that's true, but it does it with another very weak and weak computer that does not even have a graphical interface. <br /> <br /> and the main idea of ​​how to overload a "super" computer, connecting to it through a computer game on the web, is really stupid. My cell phone will turn off lighting to save energy, but apparently this brilliant computer can not decide whether to use its resources to deal with national security threats or to load computer games. <br /> <br /> there are other bad things about it, but I just do not have time for that. <br /> <br /> I just can not believe someone can make a movie stupid
