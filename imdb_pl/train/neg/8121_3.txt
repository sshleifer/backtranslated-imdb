Time is precious. This movie is not. I must learn to ignore critics who are delighted with small movies such as Fargo and this total waste of time. <br /> <br /> The theater was full and they all left with the same reaction: is it a film about critics? What a shit! <br /> <br /> The hook of this movie is a busy black daughter looking for her white rubbish family. Get it? <br /> <br /> Acting is great. <br /> <br /> Production (lighting, sets, editing, sound) is about 2 steps above 60 minutes of history. Characters are shallow and unintelligent. I was offended by the fact that these people could not learn about each other, which was obvious to the public; the audience murmured to the screen of the movie, what the heroes should say next. <br /> <br /> I had more fun while washing.
