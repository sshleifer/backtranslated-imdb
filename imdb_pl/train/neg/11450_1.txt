I need to see an early preview of this movie and I hope they will have time to edit it, how they can improve it before it goes out on August 3. This is Andy Samberg from Saturday Night Live as "Hot" Rod Kimble. A game in a teenager in a small town who wants to be a stuntman like his late father. When we meet him, he jumps in a mail truck in his wheelchair, and almost. It would be worth the Jackass movie if he had not tried to do it. Isla Fisher plays a slightly older and more mature girl from the neighborhood, Denise. It seems he likes Roda to join his "crew". Jorma Taccone (also SNL) plays his stepbrother, Kevin, who records the acrobatics with a camera. Sissy Spacek plays Rod's mom, Marie. She remarried Franck Powell, played by Ian McShane. Frank is a real hard guy who likes to beat Rod in real fights. It is clear that Rod will not get Frank's respect until he can defeat him. We learn that Frank needs $ 50,000. heart transplantation and Rod is determined to raise money just to "be able to defeat his ass" when he is healed, and prove he is a man. A long fall on the mountain side convinces Roda to "great effort" in one feat. Rod goes off to get some money from the ovules, charging you for doing acrobatics that would make you collapse if you saw them in real life. Like a human torch at a birthday party for children. At the show there were those who managed to laugh at the majority of acrobatics. Whenever you lose hope and money, a sponsor comes in that saves you days by buying 15 school buses that Rod wants to jump. He receives exclusive rights to broadcast and creates telephone lines to receive donations. Rod gets a new outfit and a real motorcycle. The whole city turns out, and the world is tuning. Is he jumping? Does he have a girlfriend? Do they raise $ 50,000? Does Frank get his ass by Rod? Wait for this 90-minute movie to come out on the video to find out.
