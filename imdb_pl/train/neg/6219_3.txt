When THE MAGIC OF LASSIE opened at Radio City Music Hall, I was stupid enough to believe that it would be as cordial as some of Lassie's first films. No. <br /> <br /> The story was terrible, the songs of the Sherman brothers were far below their usual level, the characters were uninvited, and JAMES STEWART and MICKEY ROONEY had seen much better days. <br /> <br /> That's when I wanted to see what the ALICE FAYE contribution would look like, because she was absent from the screen for many years and was always so attractive in her previous roles at Fox. Alice was also disappointed with the stupid script and unflattering photography. Another disappointment. <br /> <br /> Nothing original here, nothing even interesting for an adult to enjoy - and of course, there is no magic gift for anyone. You can omit this without losing anything.
