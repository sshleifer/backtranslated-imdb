There should be a rule that says quite clearly that movies like Resident Evil are to be created in the spirit of the game, not in the spirit of blowing up everything possible. RE was a game of survival horror genre and a damn effective game, but Paul WS Anderson managed to create any other video game. Alone in the Dark is basically the same kind of spirit as Resident Evil, so of course there is little hope that the director will be able to create a piece of brain enough to create a horror movie, not an action movie. Instead, Alone in the Dark proves that there is no longer any hope that video games will become movies. <br /> <br /> The plot, although it does not seem to matter, is the biggest of many problems with the movie. The film starts with what can only be described as five minutes of text scrolling, which may or may not be important because after one minute the audience stops caring and simply sits by the rest hitting the nearest object. Then there is something in the orphanage, some artifacts, an ancient tribe, some bureaucracy and some demons, all of which are so confused that the viewers really can not follow what is happening. Characters come in and out of the story like candies, some have huge increments for senseless death. Basically, I can understand that some demons have been released, and Edward Carnby (Slater) has a link to them thanks to some operation taken on children in his orphanage that failed him. He finds an artifact that engages demons and passes it to the former anthropologist of the girl (Reid) who, of course, can immediately have sex without any reason. Then, out of nowhere, hell breaks loose, and the pair end up with a military team led by some asshole commander (Dorff) who apparently has a mutual hatred for Carnby. <br /> <br /> It's all funny, and the reason why I do not really understand it is not just because it's complicated and confused, but it leaves no room for anyone who really cares. Instead, I strongly recommend that if you have to see this movie, bring a tennis ball or something that will take you when the plot can immerse you in the confusion. <br /> <br /> Action scenes in the plot movie as terrible as it should at least raise a bit, right? It is a pity that this movie is like any other shit crap ever created, with enough quick cuts on the head of the house. Considering that this is a horror game, not an action game, it is particularly annoying. <br /> <br /> The first action scene involving a man chasing Cranby from a taxi is one of the worst I've ever seen, and the rest are not that great either. Demons look a bit cool, although they turn into a powder when they kill this effect. Scenes with a lot of guns that should be cool to watch, instead, make the mouth of the fire the only source of light, and the camera zooms in and out faster than the head addicted to the cracks. All this is a kind of nonsense that causes robberies that children sleep in bed. <br /> <br /> Acting is what I like to call taking actors and forcing them to do nothing. Slater does not do anything important to the whole movie, though it seems he has more talent than he can. The same applies to Dorff, who has an ungrateful role, despite having talent (something that happened to him). Reid is essentially exactly what she should be, sex appeal in the background, because every time she tries to act, it is a disaster (just like the incredibly bad look of the scientist she had at the beginning). <br /> <br /> All in all, this is the kind of movie that worries me about future video game films. If they ruin such a ghost, it's only a matter of time before Samus Aran kills the Middle East with AK-47, and Tommy Vercetti fights an alien squadron. However, unlike Resident Evil, this one does not deserve a second chance, because I do not think anything could help me forget how scary this movie is. It's bland, uninteresting and uninteresting. This is the film equivalent of diarrhea; everything is connected, nothing really fits, and at the end you are happy that it is the end. <br /> <br /> TOGETHER: 4%
