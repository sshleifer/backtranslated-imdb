I am totally amazed at why this film is even liked, let alone respectable, especially by so many critics who are otherwise quite reasonable. <br /> <br /> There is one keyword that describes the movie to the core - irritating. <br /> <br /> The most easily explained example is the director's use - more precisely - abuse - of music. In the first half, the really boring reggae melody is played about three times (once it's too often). But in the second half of The Mommas And The Papas "California Dreamin" is played at least seven times, usually at the highest level. God, whether you liked the song or not, you'd be very sick by the end. Think, some say they've seen this movie four or five times. This means that they listened to California Dreamin 28 or 35 times ..... <br /> <br /> All this unnecessary hyper-replay (adds nothing to the story) could be justified if the rest of the movie had some outstanding merit, or if the story was engaging in any way. <br /> <br /> But it is not. <br /> <br /> The only aspect I liked was Bridgette Lin loading and still playing Asia The Invincible in a raincoat and sunnies. Even this quickly ended. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that the undeserved high reputation of this movie will convince many poor suckers to see him. <br /> <br /> I can only warn you - if you've never seen the HK movie before, do not start with it. <br /> <br /> If you feel compelled to watch it, avoid watching it at the cinema at all costs. Fast forward and mute buttons are essential tools to survive here. <br /> <br /> You have been warned!
