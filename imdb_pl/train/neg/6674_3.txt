I must admit that the film's drawing is directed by Eduardo Sanchez, who led an extremely popular and successful Blair Witch Project. Besides, it's a stranger movie and sounded like Stephen King's Dreamcatchers, one of those movies that critics hated, but I liked it. <br /> <br /> But no, unfortunately, I felt that in most cases, Changed is a waste of time, so I will keep this review short. Rooms are always promising, and Altered is not different. It tells the story of a group of men who have experienced strange encounters when they were younger, and as usual, others will take you as a madwoman, imagining things. Stories of alien abduction must always deal with probes in openings, so I will not go into details, but you'll get a drift that's damn uncomfortable and something you'd like to forget about. <br /> <br /> What if you have a chance to get revenge? This means that you successfully hunt and get one alive. What do you do? For this group it is a joyful time of return, or at least they thought so. And here the film begins to develop in snoozefest, with bad, uninspiring dialogue and even worse acting. Even if it has a low budget value, there are not too many factors exchangeable, whether it is the power of the plot or the help of the cast, which makes their characters a little interesting. It is a standard carton tariff with vanilla plain script, combined with a few cheap tactics used. <br /> <br /> However, makeup is good. Much effort has been put into doing some things that I will not mention, because it will break down only a few elements that make this movie tolerated. Besides, there are cheap special effects, blood and blood moments that you've never seen before. <br /> <br /> Watch it only as a last resort. In comparison to another movie about monsters in the city - Holiday, this one is less fun and is taken too seriously. Pounded in an uninspiring direction, you have been warned.
