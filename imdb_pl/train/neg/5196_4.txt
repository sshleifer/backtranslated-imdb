Although it is slightly more technically elaborated than the previous BULLDOG DRUMMOND ESCAPES series, it is a weaker escapade in both the plot that is less exciting and the leading man who just does not have the charisma of Ray Milland. <br /> <br /> Having said that, several actors and heroes continue their roles and manage to keep the flag in the air. Also present is John Barrymore, who appears throughout the film in various bizarre costumes. <br /> <br /> In any case, this is another endless night for BD, when he and his cohorts are racing, trying to save the poor girl he is going to marry. The tips are stupid, but again the supporting actors often make them funny.
