I had some expectations for the movie, because it had a nice cast of stars and it's the return of the duets Akshay and Saif. Well, I hesitated before watching the movie because it was the same man who wrote the story for the Dhoom franchise because I hated Dhoom 2; but if Dhoom 2 is compared to Tashan, I would say that Dhoom 2 is very realistic. <br /> <br /> When I saw the credits at the beginning, I felt good because it was nicely arranged. Well, the first scene pissed me off. The main drawback of the film are the action sequences. Me and my friends laughed at these ugly fights. It was like Akshay against about 30 thugs and everything, and the bandits even had machine guns! Phew ... you must see this to understand how bad the action sequences are. <br /> <br /> Another thing in the film is too predictable history. It reminded me of some movies from the early 80s. <br /> <br /> Well, the only thing worth watching is the sexy Kareena who looked really hot in it. 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Guys, please ... please ... I do not see this, thinking it's a real gangster movie. Well, you can see it to have some laughter on the horrible battle scenes. <br /> <br /> That's it.
