After the disastrous revolution, the film was the last nail in the Goldcrest coffin, and thus the British film industry. The movie is an absolute pants, full of music from the attempt to resume jazz in the mid-80s, based on a book and author who at that time was popular and deservedly forgotten. Temple looked for centuries, trying to find Suzette and invented 8th Wonders Patsy Kensett another person who was popular at the time. By the time the movie came out of post-production, the revival of Jazz came to an end, as did Kensett's career, and the film met with a completely disturbing movie audience. <br /> <br /> Poor would be an exaggeration for some of the worst / nastiest / most outstanding acting that ever immortalized the British silver screen, watching it almost 20 years later, and the movie is really remarkable.
