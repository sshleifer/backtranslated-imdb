Here's a movie that could be a comedy in Australia. Unfortunately, annoyingly, there is a flaccid and shoddy and overflowing Lala. How did the diurektor do it wrong? Well, mainly by being serious about the work so funny that nobody in their right mind can take it seriously. Unless, of course, they were not a frustrated, lonely gay banality (but somehow sweet) ... or a banal clich√©. No value in history, which seems to be the prequel of GERRY Santa with Gus Van Sant ... and with a title such as THE FLUFFER, how does it all have such weight? Well, this author must be so crazy that he did not reach Burt and BOOGIE first that he had to do his own. Sophisticated and undeveloped, apart from the theme of "unrequited love, boredom" that remained from the faded lyrics of Streisand, we only have a romantic cake and TV series. The necessary fourth act of this long, dramatic drama is really terrible because the movie leaves like Gerries in the desert and gets stuck there. In Oz at the end of the 90s, about 20 people created a similar, but in fact a funny movie called MONEYSHOT. Originally filmed as THE VENUS FACTORY, he also suffered from a terrible author than Orson, so they filmed his half again, forced the ruthless television editor to cut him down to 72 minutes and hey-presto. Lesson when bad movies change into good, brightening. It seems to me that FLUFFER stiffens after release and after seeing that it does not occur, I understand why.
