For 50 years after the Second World War, the United States was in a state in which key segments of the economy were dominated by military interests. At the same time, because of design and war, everyone in the community served or was connected to someone who had. <br /> <br /> This allowed to create a miniature based on the concept of American cunning among an inflexible military machine. Sometimes this machine was a non-American army, for example in prisoner-of-war situations. Once stories are removed from other machines: science fiction and corporate, but they always refer to this military genre, and even testosterone pictures even refer to their comic siblings. <br /> <br /> You can trace this, I think, perhaps starting with a comic, meaning Amrican, sections of "The Great Escape", which immediately spawned the offspring of TeeVee in "Gomer Pyle" and "Hogan's Heros". Then the second wave triggered by "Catch 22" and "MASH", which were real life, then books, then movies, and in the case of MASH, then TeeVee. <br /> <br /> But before all this, there was the "Phil Silvers Show", Sergeant Bilko, and that was after "Mister Roberts". A lucky cheater who committed only harmless crimes, and then only as a response to the too harsh system that tried to limit his life. It was the day TeeVee shows were meaningful. You've absorbed them, not just carrying them to work on talking. In no way was he clever, except to find this crack between what we wanted in control and freedom. <br /> <br /> This is one large zone in which Americans have discovered how they think of forgivable and even engaging lies in the military context, a zone that has been appropriated by one of our political parties here. <br /> <br /> Because it is big, it sometimes pays off. Stripes was quite funny, I thought. It was something of a misfit who actually defeated serious enemies, something like "Dirty Dozen". And sexual adventure. <br /> <br /> Now this is long before the escalation of cultural wars. He tries to touch this sweet place, as do the other modifications Steve Martin took care of. It is so indecent that the army is actually a stronger player. Yet another way to track how societies develop handles for military power. <br /> <br /> Ted's rating - 1 of 3: You can find something better to do in this part of your life.
