Less self-conscious and much less pretentious than GUTS OF BEAUTY, this gore flick Kazuo Komizu is worth watching (at least once). <br /> <br /> Sleazy snapshotters escort would-be actresses / models to a distant home in the forest to molest them sexually. Unfortunately (for horny boys), a long-lived demon who lives in the woods has already directed the girls to play. <br /> <br /> The case ends even with the boys - IF YOU think you are beheading, dismembering and masturbating with the legs cut off "fun". <br /> <br /> Once again, everything sounds better on paper than it looks and sounds on film. <br /> <br /> Like Komizu's distorted LIFE, DEAD TO TOKYO BAY with his ineptitude, he also invents this effort and is saved only by some bold violence and some great white photos of panties. <br /> <br /> But do not buy noise. I will be very disappointed.
