I think I have never felt this profession in the film before. After worshiping the two previous films by Guy Ritchie (I do not count Swept Away - he was blind) I could not wait to see it. <br /> <br /> The opinions were weak, and I do not trust the press anyway. More worrying was the fact that the internet was buzzing, it was a bit smelly, so I passed my Â£ 4.80 yesterday with some uneasiness. <br /> <br /> I do not even intend to try to explain this movie, mainly because I have no idea what is going on, and at some point I was honestly close to getting up and asking if I did not get it! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems to me that Ritchie seems to fall into the trap of his wife that he treats himself too seriously. characters. It's almost as if he had a checklist of movies he wanted to break up, here are some of those I've noticed: <br /> <br /> Matrix, Fight Club, Kill Bill, The Usual Suspects, Vanilla Sky .... <br /> <br /> I think the most frustrating thing is that the performances of the two main actors, Jason Statham and Ray Liotta, were in fact very good and it was really a lax story and an editing / direction that allowed the movie to go down . <br /> <br /> So big, big thumb from me.
