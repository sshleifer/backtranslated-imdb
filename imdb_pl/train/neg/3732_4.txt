Perhaps because I was so young, innocent and MAN when I saw her, this movie was the cause of many sleepless nights. I have not seen him since I was in the seventh grade in Presbyterian school, so I'm not sure how it will affect me now. I will say, however, that it impressed me ... and most of my friends. This served its purpose, at least until we were old enough and competent enough to analyze and create our own opinions. I was particularly terrified at what the newly converted Christians had to endure after they had not received the mark of the beast. I do not want to spoil the movie for those who have not seen it, so I will not mention the details of the scenes, but I can still imagine them in my head ... and 19 years have passed.
