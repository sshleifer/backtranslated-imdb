Unfortunately, this movie has no appreciation for the original. Nicholas Cage, quite wooden when it comes to actors, gives the screen a range of skills, from not very enlarged to over. Supporting cast is not better. <br /> <br /> The plot remains very similar to the original in terms of stage progression, but it is much worse. Not enough details were provided to allow recipients to get acquainted with what is being sold. It turns out that it is simply a bill of poor goods. Disbelief can not be suspended, nor can one confess to doubts. The only saving aspect of this movie is that it is very visual, as the medium requires, and anyone who has recognized the location should be praised. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of laughter in the audience and many boos literally in the end. <br /> <br /> Disappointed! Wait for the original to appear on TV, pour whiskey and enjoy.
