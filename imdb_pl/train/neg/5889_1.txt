First of all, I strongly believe that Norwegian films are constantly improving. From painstaking emotional movies from the '70s and' 80s, movies from this place actually began to contain a bit of humor. Imagine ... Real comedies were created! The films started to be fun and funny, in contrast to the long, dark, depressing and boring ones. <br /> <br /> In the nineties and twenties, some really great films were created by the "new generation" of filmmakers. The film after the film was praised by critics and played a lot of money. It has become the norm! <br /> <br /> Then came United ... <br /> <br /> * LESS SPOILERS * It just is not funny. Not once. Not always. But it's about ... THOUGHT that's fun. Because we're used to Norwegian movies as fun. Especially with such a cast with some really funny comics. But ... They do not say or do anything funny! Where is the humor? Show me humor! Is this an awkward official played by Harald Eia? Is it a horribly totally absurdly unrealistic football coach? Are these Arne Scheie's comments? The movie is not just fun! <br /> <br /> But this is not my main theme about United. This is predictability. (And here I am afraid that Norwegian comedies have ceased to exist, because I have seen it in many other films too.) You still know that it will end well. All characters are exactly what they are presented at the beginning of the movie, and everyone receives exactly what they deserve. Absolutely no place for surprises! <br /> <br /> All in all I can say that I was sitting with a bad feeling after watching this movie. It was one movie that made me realize that we probably need a new blood to create a Norwegian movie ... again! <br /> <br /> Mark: 1/6
