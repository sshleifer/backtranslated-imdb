The Hills Have Eyes Remake Alexandre Aja was one of the highlights of 2006. It was not only a remake of the classic horror, but it was also damn good. So almost a year later, we are treated as a continuation of this remake. While the original scripter Wes Craven returns as a producer and co-writer, this movie simply did not reach the level set by the original and remake. A group of military interns stops in the desert to check some scientists and discovers that they have suffered a mutant family from the first movie (at least those that have remained plus a few new ones). There is a lot of blood here. What annoys me in this film is the total lack of characteristics. The viewer does not care about what happens to any of these people because we did not get to them. Even the mutants had a certain characteristic for the last time and this time nothing. Gore does not make sense due to the gore. There must be a reason for it to be interesting. Nothing that's going on here is interesting. And what's up with rape scenes in movies lately? Here we get another one for no real reason. I hope this is one set of hills that will not be visited again.
