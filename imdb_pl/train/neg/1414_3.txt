After watching this movie, I came to IMDb and got acquainted with some reviews that compared him to Lost In Translation LITE. When I read that I could see the reviewer's point right away. <br /> <br /> This movie was a poor attempt at a similar topic. Interestingly, the format of the film is almost identical, but PACING is amazingly different. "10 items" pushes the viewer through the 1-day timeline, while the better-planned "Lost In ..." seems to stretch for several long days. <br /> <br /> And "I'm sure some people will see this because he has Morgan Freeman and he will be disappointed. It seems that his better roles nowadays support roles in great hits, and do not lead roles in limited-edition films and indie movies worth less than $ 10 million.
