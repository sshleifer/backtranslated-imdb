This movie is so stupid that it just goes around the corner and becomes funny. Actually, I wanted to watch "The Fall of Darkness" and I thought it was a movie. Boy, what a mistake! I jumped as fast as I could and still could not get rid of the boring moments. I simply envy people who are paid for playing or working on this movie. In fact, they got the money for this shit. Is not that amazing? In this movie a man is killed and chopped in a mill for small bloody pieces, and a few minutes later, mother and child talk quietly at the table, because nothing happens and drink coffee. Please! Come on! Who gives money for such crappy movies? Oh, and the "tooth fairy" was lame. Not at all frightening and it was obvious that he was a bored stuntman with bad makeup.
