OK, to tell the truth, as an Orthodox woman who lives in Boro Park, I will be a bit biased towards this film. It seemed, however, that the only purpose of Boaz Yakin in making this film was to beat the Orthodox. Thanks to our wigs, modest dress and separate seats, we are quite an easy target. Yakin never crossed the surface. The result is a film with more holes than Swiss cheese: 1. Yosi tells Sonia that he loves him more than G-d or their parents. He then deliberately opposes the father's order that he does not go because of poor health. 2. Sonia throws her son on a bris. Why did the Chasidic woman from Monsey have such a strong reaction? It is hard to believe that she has never participated before. Let's face it, even reformed Jews today have bras milah ceremonies. 3. Did Mendel sleep during his classes? He should satisfy his wife's passions in bed and refrain from kissing her on the street. Especially in the middle of the busiest street in Boro Park! 4. Sonia and Mendel had to be married for over a year, and he just noticed that they were not meant for each other? A little-arranged marriage arranged does not mean that the girl must take the first guy with whom her parents set her up. It will not be avoided by the community if the marriage fails. 5. If Sonia really wanted to enter the jewelry industry, she did not have to go through her lustful brother-in-law. There are orthodox doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc. Sonia came out of being more tearful than compassionate. Instead of taking control of her life, she sat down and waited for something to happen, then complained that she did not like the result. It does not stand in defense of its own environment; it depends on the stereotype. Honestly, I think she got what she deserved.
