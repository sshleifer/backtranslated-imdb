To this day, when you talk about Japanese cinema, most people do not talk about Rashomon, Seven Ronins or Ran. For the masses, Japanese cinema means all these monsters that we have loved, destroying these Japanese cities repeatedly, many times in battles with each other. The first and largest of them is Godzilla, who returned a dozen or more times and in several films faced three heads, similar to the hydra, space monster, Ghidrah. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, the special effects have improved slightly over time. But part of the charm of these old films was that these paper city sets were destroyed, they looked so false, maybe three steps above Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> Some guests from the future have time to travel to Japan to persuade Godzilla to be destroyed from the moment he was discovered. In fact, it was first discovered as a living dinosaur during World War II, when it protected the Japanese garrison on the Pacific Island against these American troops. But later, during the atomic tests on Bikini, Godzilla, a friendly dinosaur, like Barney, became a vile device that we met in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Of course, you eliminate Godzilla, than you give Ghidrah a clean field to break Japan, so that it does not become an economic colossus, it was not until 1991 that the film was made. I will not say more, but we all know that Japan is doing quite well as in 2010. <br /> <br /> Like all other Japanese monster movies, just sit back and enjoy the chaos.
