Anurag Basu, who co-directed the flop KUCCH TO HAI made his debut in this film <br /> <br /> The film overtook its time in a sense, although it has a different story and is the closest to HAWAS, which was released a week earlier and fortunately was better and he did better interes <br /> <br /> The film starts well, Maliki's guilt is clearly visible at the beginning, although the scene with Emraan-Malika is too strict / vulgar <br /> <br /> Scenes between Emraan and Malika are well prepared and the turn in the story in which Ashmith confronts Emraan is genial. <br /> <br /> The pace moves quickly, and the viewer is kept on the edge, but the second track of the girl from Emraan is not fully convincing <br /> <br /> <br /> Finish is too much <br /> <br /> Director Anurag Basu is good. Music is the winner, all songs were great. Camera was stunning. /> <br /> Emraan played his naughty streak very well, it was the role that gave him fame and although he still played such roles and annoyances in this film that was great, Ashmith was also good at once, he did a good job and one of his only good performances and he looked good too Malika was brilliant in her role esp in the second half, but the delivery of her number was sometimes not entirely Unfortunately rarely showed such potential in other films Raj Jhutsi is okay
