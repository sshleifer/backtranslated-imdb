"The Triumph of Love" does not win anything. It's heavy, heavy, 4 hours torture. Actually, a little less than 2 hours, it seemed much longer. Even the thought of amateur performances by such great actors as Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw is even bothering me. Supporting players are not that horrible. Perhaps they were trying to be so exaggerated to be clowns, but if so, I did not see it that way. Mira Sorvino does not make an impression in one way or another. She (he) is there. My guess is that the game of the same title, written by Marivaux about 270 years ago, is much better. It could not be worse. Clare Peploe, screenwriter and director of this film, was inspired by the recent production of the show. I do not know what she was thinking about when she created the bomb. <br /> <br /> Maybe everything got lost in translation.
