I am a big fan of Karishma Kapoor and Govinda. I watched this movie after I saw Fiza, who was absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> There are movies that are bad, and there are movies that are cr * p. but this movie just takes a biscuit. <br /> <br /> We were so annoyed that we were deceived by paying our money expecting a decent movie. <br /> <br /> avoid at all costs, do not even rent it. <br /> <br /> 1/10
