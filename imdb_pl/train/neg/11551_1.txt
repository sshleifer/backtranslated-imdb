Seriously, there is absolutely nothing good about this nonsense festival. Randolph Scott, a gay homosexual who lived with his lover Cary Grant for twelve years, is the least wooden and boring in his least role. At the age of 57, he was definitely too old for these romantic roles, although it does not matter much because Gail Russell looks much older than 31 years and is so ugly about chronic alcoholism and smoking in the chain. Lee Marvin plays his usual wicked role, but it is not enough to save this trash. Thank God they do not make westerns anymore, they are simply outdated, racist, old movies that push weapons and murder. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
