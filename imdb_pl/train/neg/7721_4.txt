The battle scenes are played in slow motion by Jackie Chan, and the wit's attempts are pathetic (so far the worst punk: "Guess what? This time I heard you are coming"). The stars are an unmatched pair: Brandon Lee, despite the horrible lines he has to say, actually shows traces of charisma and the charm of the screen - things that Dolph Lundgren is completely free (at least in this movie). Note to the director: in the future, please stay away from the love scenes, especially when the main actress is not naked, and you have to rely on the double body. (* 1/2)
