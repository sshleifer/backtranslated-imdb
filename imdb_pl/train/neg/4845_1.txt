In this movie, there is no artistic value to earn any reward. Well, he does not deserve the audience either. Ironically, one of the awards is cinematography, but to be honest, camera movements are at least disturbing. Each frame, you feel that you get a "full picture", as if someone "trimming your view" from the edge. The story is pathetic. I will be honest, I could not stand watching the whole movie. The part that sucked the most, saw soldiers playing in barracks, and one of the soldiers urged to drink alcohol. These and many other similar scenes reminded me so much of Steven Seagal. <br /> <br /> Take my advice, stay away from this shit.
