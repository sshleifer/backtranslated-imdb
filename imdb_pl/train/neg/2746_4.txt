I was afraid to take my nephews to this film because I did not think it would be well done. Children, 6 and 10 years old, started to see it, so I broke down. I must admit that it was not as bad as I thought, but it was still far from the book. The film seemed to be in line with the understanding and sense of humor of a 10-year-old. I discovered that the six-year-old understood what was going on and presented solutions to the problems that had occurred. In the end, I had to explain that sometimes movies do not show the best solutions to problems, because it's cooler to watch what happens if they make "stupid" or "stupid" choices.
