I totally hated the movie. It was so late. They have to get acting lessons .... no, wait, it will not help, because Naked Brothers Band is delayed people. Do you know why I am here, although I am the haters of the Naked Brothers band? To warn people before they watch a stupid movie so that the NBB will not get any money from it, they will not be able to do more amateur, stupid songs that will be so delayed that any old guy will be able to write them in 10 seconds. The lyrics are not only delayed, they sing badly. Okay, I'm coming out of the movie ... anyway, it was boring and they behaved terribly. It was NOT fun, even though they tried very hard. I think they deserve some credit for this ... Well, the movie is not worth your time. Just look at his assessment. The film (and series) is very painful to watch for anyone who has even half a brain. Seriously, if you like it, you have to watch movies in which the actors actually play, not babbling their lines in a monotonous manner. I'm in a drama club at my school, and some people are actually LEPSI than those guys from Nat and Alex. Hurry up before it's too late! I really thought that Herbie Fully Loaded is better than this piece of poop. I do not even know why I went even half the movie. I think it does not even deserve the name of a movie ...
