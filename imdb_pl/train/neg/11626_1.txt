This may be the worst program I've ever seen. In addition to the lack of taste of the sitcom about Hitler, it is not simply fun or fun. It is very similar to the sitcom from 1950. In the mood of cornball and fancy situations, but although it can be well done, as in I Love Lucy, it just is not funny. I think the show was based on the new look, it was Hitler as an inept comic character, but it just dropped in every respect. The guy playing Hitler is so sick that it's hard to sit down alone. I wonder what would make the web think it would be a good idea to fly. I thought America had some distasteful show, but the British beat us this time. America would never broadcast the Hitler series, although we had a show about Lincoln's slave, the secret journalist Desmond Pfeiffer. You will probably never see this program because only one episode has been broadcast and will probably never be released on DVD.
