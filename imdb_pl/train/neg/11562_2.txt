Rich widower Anthony Steffen (as Alan Cunningham) is a sadomasochistic lover and British Lord. He brings sexy red-haired women to his castle, where he whips and murders them. Stripper with black shoes Erika Blanc (as Susie) temporarily escapes. Mr. Steffen is haunted by his wife, Evelyn, who died during childbirth. As a therapy, she decides to get married again after meeting with the beautiful blonde Marina Malfatti (as Gladys). At the end of the film, they will have to dig a few more graves. "The night Evelyn left the grave" is at least a great title. <br /> <br /> ** La notte che Evelyn usc√¨ dalla tomba (1971) Emilio Miraglia ~ Anthony Steffen, Marina Malfatti, Erika Blanc
