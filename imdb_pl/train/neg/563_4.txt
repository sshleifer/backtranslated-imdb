Does every good story have to be "improved" with added in-depth music on Broadway? Apparently, those who can not come up with their own conspiracies think that classic literature is just for plunder. I admit that Oliver Twist and similar stories are not my favorite, because it's certainly true that Dickens often wrote things that really ruined you, and that was a great example of this ... So of course, take this serious story and add boring music and camp it with every character from prancing the orphans of boys to grinding bobbies and suddenly it's uplifting? Argh. Bring me a sink. <br /> <br /> Four stars in my opinion come from the casting, which I could compare to My Fair Lady. Each of these films had a cast that could be a proud version of the game, but then they have to go and have them sing (see the complaint above). Unlike My Fair Lady, those who sing here can do it and fortunately have spared us the vocal voice of Oliver Reed (sorry, if I'm wrong, it's been a while). <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint I said. Why shame everyone, except the truly shameless, putting stupid songs in a completely good story? It has rarely been achieved. Generally, it destroys history. He did it with it. The jury still does not know if this story is worth saving, but it is impossible to say with all this gadget.
