When it comes to movies, it is quite nice. Funny characters, good dialogue, interesting story. I would really like it if I was not irritated enormously while watching with total disrespect that shows the city where it is located. <br /> <br /> Glasgow. In Scotland. However, each character is English (except for Sean, who is Dutch). Scottish accents are heard only briefly in atypical competitions and roles. As a Scottish woman (and as a viewer who enjoys her real life movies to be a bit more like real life), I do not really think it would hurt to use one of my innumerable talented Scottish actors ... at least I got Englishmen who could cast a decent accent! The futile attempt to use the word "wee" several times did not contribute to further insults.
