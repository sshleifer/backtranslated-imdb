A SERIOUS DOMESTIC / KARATE KID comes up with bad enough bad stereotypes to let the writer be sued and then shot. You can see the glaring use of stuntmen in almost every scene. Oh, and acting also sucks. Although I must say that the line: "I'm sorry, dude, I have to make a big big break" made me laugh.
