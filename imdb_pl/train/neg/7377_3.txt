Although the plot was very detailed and the plot was understandable, the fact that Steven Seagals' voice was named by someone else, was most disturbing for most of the movie because you were not sure who was talking. There were many parts in which he began to speak in his deep, husky voice, and then the next voice of someone else spoke for him. I do not know why, however, if he had difficulty with his voice during the production of the film, I think that they could repeat the events that did not contain his own voice when he regained his strength. I rated this movie on 3 out of 10 based on the quality of the film. When someone pays for a movie, whether it's in the theater or on a DVD, this movie was not worth the price. I have long been a supporter of Steven Seagal and all of his films that he has done in recent years. So far, I think that this is one of the worst that we have seen yet
