it could be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I do not understand how it can be described as a horror film or even a thriller? it is more like a drama drama. the scary music is PERFECT, but since there were no terrifying situations, the director thought it would be a good idea to use it for everyday activities such as taking a dump or going down the stairs. the film had so much potential. they had beautiful pictures (sp?) and interesting characters, but it seemed that the writers assumed that you already know them. they will go through peculiar activities without explanation or even hints as to what they mean. it's just one of those movies that talks about one thing and something completely different.
