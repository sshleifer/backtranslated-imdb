I registered with IMDb to comment on this video. <br /> <br /> I just finished sitting in this movie and the only thing that impressed me was that I somehow had the strength not to stop it. <br /> <br /> I've seen quite a decent number of action movies and no, but Princess Blade has some of the worst fights I've ever seen in a movie. Most sword fighting relies on wickedly swinging the swords back and forth, hoping that the enemy will not do the same. I have seen many student films about better action and stronger plots. <br /> <br /> So now we have a "futuristic" action movie with a bad action and virtually no trace of the future. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie does not even have action and shows evolving relationships with the princess and farmboy / terrorist and his disturbed sister. The film has many lines and none of them really worth anything. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem may have been that I was watching dub, which was pretty bad. The whole cast mumbled all the lines, so it was difficult to keep track of what was going on. But I have a general idea. (Knowing exactly what was said, I would not save the film in my eyes) <br /> <br /> If you've heard about it being a futuristic action / ninja movie, then you've heard it wrong. That's what I thought I heard about it, and now I lost 90 minutes of my life. Do not let this happen to you. Stay away.
