From horrible death scenes to guns without sounding to a character called the Devil. It's all tiring, slow, unimaginable bullshit. It was good to see a guy with a cape and a hunchback lurking nearby. Visually, it was frightening and probably occupied the viewer of those times, but even in 1936, one would think that there would be even more imagination and loyalty even to such a film. I was just waiting for something important because people stood around each other, giving speeches and acting like they were posing at a picnic in the office. And then there are the balls mentioned by the previous commentator. Perhaps the best guideline would be to look for somebody's pocket of pants.
