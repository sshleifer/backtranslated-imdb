After watching this movie on the SciFi channel, I can only say that this movie was made by a group of amateurs who have never seen a movie in their lives. The film is an endless sequence of bizarre events or "delights", as a friend reading my shoulder tells me. The plot is not worth commenting on, but basically, the plane carrying the players crashes into the Yeti territory. Before the film is over, we are treated to the yeti heartbreaking, yeti wading in an attempt to escape before the 50-meter jump, yetis breaks the man's legs and beats them, the woman kills the rabbit on a 30-meter javelin, the yeti surviving a few balls and fired without apparent harm, yeti hanging from a cliff, holding on to a male shoe, and then jumping down and a whole set of further, bizarre events. Basically, if you do not stay on Saturday with the clear purpose of watching the worst of the original SciFi movies, avoid this movie like a plague. Or how my friend reads over my shoulder: "This is the best movie I've ever seen." To which a friend on my right says: "Only battle-techno music could improve it".
