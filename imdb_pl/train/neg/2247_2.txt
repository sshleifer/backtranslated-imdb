Kris Kristofferson, at the drug summit in the mid-1970s, barely able to cling to the screen next to the huge ego and discount feminism of La Streisand. <br /> <br /> None of the characters is really nice; I was glad when Ferrari Kristofferson went over this hill and crashed. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good movie about rock and roll stardom, try _The Buddy Holly Story_ (made just one and a half years after this fall).
