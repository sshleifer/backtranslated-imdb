From the very beginning you know how the movie ends. It's so full of stereotypes that your typical NRA member will not like this movie. I give him 2 out of 10, only because of William Benton's action. I can not believe people voted 6+ for this movie. He is so focused on "a certain point of view" (once a thief ...). People are not born badly. They are not born well. They're born with a clean slate. It's society, parents and education that make them who they are. And if they turn in the wrong direction, it certainly will not be an American penal system that will lead them to order! In any case, avoid this movie like a plague. I bet you have better things to do with your time than wasting it on this piece of shit. <br /> <br />
