I was faithful to my respect for Mr. Glover and Mrs. Goldberg. I watched the whole movie with family and friends. I have no idea what the movie was about. After many discussions, we all agreed that this is not one of their better efforts. <br /> <br /> It does not fit very well. It is too small and there are few comedies. I'm disappointed. It could be a lot better. <br /> <br /> I've been waiting for months to see this movie based on line notes. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money unless you are complete and want to see all the films of Mr. Glover and Mrs. Goldberg. <br /> <br /> It was a bad way to spend the evening.
