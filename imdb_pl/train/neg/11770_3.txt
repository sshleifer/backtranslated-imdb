'P' (or Club-P) should really be called 'L' for lame. Each festival has a disappointment and it is the one who fails to fulfill his big line: "Thai Lesbians Fighting Monsters". It is rather a story about a Khmer girl from a country whose grandmother taught her some spells along with some strange (but specific) rules: "do not go under underwear", "do not eat raw meat" and "do not accept money for your powers". Guess what people, the girl moves to Bangkok to raise some money as a "bar-girl" and manages to break all the rules that her grandmother taught her, which then releases the evil spirit that comfortably kills "foreign john" who pay <br /> <br /> Although this film can not even be released in Thailand because of its controversial theme, most of the American audience will find this horror movie in the style of ho-hum as the cross between "Showgirls" and "Interview with the vampire" "directed Walt Disney. <br /> <br /> If it were not for a few scenes with a lot of blood, MPAA could probably judge it only for teenagers. There is literally television broadcast for adults, although one could expect at least a sex scene, given the fact that the film is about a brothel, and one of the actresses is a Thai porn star in real life. <br /> <br /> When it comes to the "lesbian" angle, there is one short smooch and a few "I love you" to prove that the two main stars really are a couple (brother). And the P-bar must be the only exotic dance club on the planet where girls are holding sarongs and doing carnival tricks (there is a fencer who cuts the cucumbers out of the girl's mouth ... ooh, phallic pictures). br /> <br /> NO NUDITY, NO real monster (unless you count five feet tall Thai spirit with yellow eyes), and no ADULT should ever pay to see this kind of stupidity except the DVD. You have been warned!
