Even for cocaine from the 80s, it's pathetic. I do not understand why anyone would want to waste the celluloid, time, effort, money and brain cells of the audience to make such nonsense. If you're going to do a comedy, make it fun. If you want to film trash, save it for yourself. If you are going to spend this as a joke: NO! It was a joke, right? Someone please tell me that it was a joke. Please.
