I read one more review, which expressed the view that Pluto was an endless series of marines who killed people, killed, used drugs and talked to garbage. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with this because the movie actually had more to it, but in a way I can see what that person is trying to say: it did not have a real conspiracy - which is the point I agree with. <br /> <br /> This is the stone of complacency in his Best. He really wanted to show, not only how war leads to death, but also how traumatic it is for those who survive. Unfortunately, the film seems to "glorify" this aspect, and the grand finale is simply too bubbly, impressive, the Oscar-winning "let's create a permanent picture" for my taste. <br /> <br /> The problem I have with Stone and other filmmakers, that they do not understand this simple concept: the presentation of terribly bloody fatal losses, which this war is not proven or even reflected on it, it was unjust or immoral war. We have seen that the same thing is happening with Iraq at the moment. If you do not hit the nail on the head, let me tell you bluntly: if you saw how truly bloody the Second World War was and how destructive it was to the survivors' lives, do you think it was an unjust war? If this fact alone does not convince you that it was an unjust war, then why images of the horrors of Vietnam should convince you that in this case it was wrong to go to war. <br /> <br /> Personally, I do not support America's decision to war in Vietnam, but I certainly disagree with the theory "this war is bad because people died and suffered." I do not think that motivation is always wrong by default, just because the war itself is terrible. <br /> <br /> This does not say anything about the fact that the ending or the last big "turn" was a bit stupid. However, this is not the first departure from stones. Wall street was a great movie, up to the last 30 minutes, when it did a terrible "bad queue". JFK is probably one of the few Stone films that ended very well. <br /> <br /> But it does not matter in that, because there was very little plot to the point where the movie spun around. And that's why I gave it such a low sign. It was practically historyless and ultimately boring - unless you fell because of the emotion you produced.
