Yikes. This is very bad. Art is not great at first, and the decision to transfer it to the film is not conducive - especially since Peploe does not decide how he wants to treat the theatrical origin of the material (sometimes we get the gaze of the theater watching the audience etc.) and decided on the lively an editing style that reminds you that you are watching a movie, when in reality it only reminds you that you are watching a very poor movie director who is overwhelmed by its material. The central performance of Mira Sorvino is incredibly poor: stage and plum, as if playing a role in the work of Helena Bonham-Carter's Merchant Ivory. Only Fiona Shaw provides a performance - and it may be that her pedigree means she can do the best with the material - but it's hard to watch a movie only for one performance, even if the performance is so light, real and whole like Shaw. Ben Kingsley changes into an average and uninvolved turn, and Diana Rigg's daughter, Rachel Stirling, plays this role. Unfortunately, none of Bertolucci's magic touched his wife if this film was to be proof.
