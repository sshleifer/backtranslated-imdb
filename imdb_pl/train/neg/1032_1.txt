Although I have never been a fan of the original Scooby-Doo (because of its horrible production values), it seems that Shakespeare compares it to the pile of nonsense brought by Hanna-Barber! Without a doubt, Scrappy-Doo is the most annoying and horrible character created for children (this applies to both Teletubbies and Tommy the Tapeworm). Whose bright idea was to create some short mutant and let him speak, and then saddle the Scooby-Doo character ?! Whoever it is deserves to die or watch this program (I think death is better). The most important thing is that the dog is simply unpleasant, irritating and restrains the nerves - and only in BETTER sections !! After many years, it would be better to end the franchise than create this mess! I can see why in the film Scooby-Doo they did the Scrappy-Doo villain live - because practically everyone hates him!
