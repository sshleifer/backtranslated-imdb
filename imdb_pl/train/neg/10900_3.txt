You can not resist this too much, knowing that it was done in four days, and I was expecting it to be camps anyway. (In fact, it's not all on campus.) With the exception of Kevin Kalisher and Huntley Ritter, who do not take themselves seriously, the rest of the cast is half-straight, Riley Smith is extremely bad). attention that shocked me; I assumed that the purpose of these ultra-low budget horrors was to satisfy the innermost sexual fantasies and not care about the story, but they use many words, such as "technological" and "physical" in the script to get their point across. (Although it is possible that history is only important to explain why there are so few cast members). Nobody cares about this stupid plot, and the only thing that's interesting in the movie is mockery of cults and soft-core homoerotics are not that nervous). I would be happy if there were no accidental killings for no reason. The film is grainy, with a television appearance and an acting level. There are a few "sexy" scenes that are okay - boys writhe in bed in boxers, feeling good; or being tied up and making orgasmic faces while the wine is poured on them - and some of them are a bit ridiculous. And I liked the excavations in L. Ron Hubbard and the intentional irony of stories about religious cultists narrated with intense gay subtexts, but it still is not good. 3/10
