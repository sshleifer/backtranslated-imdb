There was no point and it was so awful ... I think Hollywood has a lot of such movies ... you do not have to watch it. people cutter or eater what should I say ... it made me sick! Oh my God! The film is about people we do not know but we feed on people! they have teeth blah blah ... is not that familiar? I bet you saw it in another movie. the cast was great, but I think the script was really awful. and I should say that Bradley Cooper was amazing ... he is so talented ... I actually said horribly, but I think it's because of horrible scenes ... let me explain it. Have you ever eaten a language? but in the film it was done by one person! it was really awful ... anyway, I think the movie would be so good without these terrible human eaters or cutter scenes ...
