I was very, very disappointed with this film. it all started really well and created a great atmosphere and tension, but when it finally began to reveal the "monster" ... it turned out that it was only a psycho with skin problems ... again. Whoop-de-do. Another movie with notes ... as we do not have them anymore. <br /> <br /> To be honest, "creep" is really disturbing, looking at how it moves and strange sounds makes them quite scary, but I have enough of lending such movies just to discover that the monster is human, though twisted, mad and bizarre. When I saw all the rats' stories early, I was counting on some bizarre rat-monster hybrid ... it was such a disappointment when Creep was revealed. <br /> <br /> At the top of it, some things in this movie do not make sense. (Spoiler) <br /> <br /> Why the hell is Creep killing the guard? What's the point, besides sticking great honking, who says: "HI I'm A PSYCHO AND I LIVE DOWN HERE!"? It is stupid and it seems that it only prevents the character of Franka Potente from getting help. <br /> <br /> What the hell was he eating? I got the impression that he was effectively bricked up, and only an unexpected opening in this part of the tunnel allowed him to leave ... so he kept rats all the time, and if so, why are they turning him around? Why is it so damn hard to kill? He is skinny, undernourished and does not quite reach peak results ... but it seems that he continues despite the injuries that are equivalent to those that cause bad characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> The DVD comment says, they are meant to be felt in Creep, but I just find it repulsive. This film is effective enough, but he has wasted so many opportunities that makes me sick.
