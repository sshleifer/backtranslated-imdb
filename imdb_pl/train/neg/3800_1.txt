Calling the absolute most pathetic piece of film history is not an easy task, the candidates are so generous, but Nemesis 2 is my favorite since I saw it. It was so funny that we had to rent it the next day, and again I laughed so hard I literally rolled on the floor. (Usually this happens only when I see Monty Python "Scott of the Antarctic.") <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, the overwhelming feeling of "what-to-shit" strongly grabs the viewer. I am completely embarrassed that this clumsy home movie reached the production stage. This is to be a continuation, but there is no apparent connection with the first movie. The hero has the same name, but this time "Alex" is a woman, although we stopped guessing what happened to all the muscles and dress of the nomad barbarians! <br /> <br /> There is not really a story, it's just a prolonged chase scene, but it's so slow and senseless that calling it a chase scene makes it sound a lot more interesting than it is in fact. There is almost no dialogue, which is equally good, considering its quality, and then the movie suddenly suddenly ends up on the glaring action scene with a lot of gasoline explosion, never explaining what it's all about. Fortunately, it is never boring, because something stupid and false is always happening! <br /> <br /> Horrible movies are usually boring, but Nemesis 2 is such an excellent mix of excess seriousness and total unintentional crazyness that it's really fun. Rent this movie or buy it, you will not be disappointed!
