This is not the best movie to remember Paul Naschy. <br /> <br /> Gaston (Guillermo Bredeston) is probably the worst swordsman I've ever seen. Zorro would be ashamed! His only salvation came because the competition was equally bad. <br /> <br /> This movie is described as adventure and horror. Forget about the horror movie - it's gone. No nakedness, no blood, no monsters; only Robin Hood's adventure with the evil Baron (Paul Naschy) who wants to be King. <br /> <br /> The main feature of the film was a meeting with Graciela Nilson, who in two years made only four films and disappeared in our regrettable loss. Where did she go?
