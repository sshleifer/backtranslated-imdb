I saw this movie about 5 years ago, and the memory of it continues to haunt me to this day. I was fully aware of how terrible it was to be, so I just have to blame myself. But like most, I did not believe in all negativity. Being a Sandler fan, it just seemed unimaginable that one of his films could be really bad. I thought it was just Sandler's hatred. I could not be more angry. <br /> <br /> We have a comedy here that does not contain anything funny. This is actually quite a good achievement. One would think in a 90-minute comedy that they accidentally stumbled upon something even fun. But no, it's just awful. It's not "bad, it's good", it's just bad. You can not laugh at how bad it is, you can only cry. You wait patiently for a joke that will at least make you giggle but never come. <br /> <br /> Did you see The Ring movie? Where do people watch the video tape and die 7 days later? If this movie was on a videotape, people would die instantly, with their own hands, and a smile would appear on their faces when they realized that their agony was over, and that would be the first smile from the time the play was pressed. > <br /> You may be willing to watch it just to see how bad it is, not being able to stop your curiosity. No. Please do not. Trust me, I'm doing you a favor. There are two kinds of people in the world who think that Going Overboard is the worst movie ever made, and those who have not seen it yet.
