Maybe I'm getting old, but this is what has left me completely and the old Funny Bone. There must certainly be something powerful with this Irishman (it's me, Schultz!). Lord, what would I give to see the light! First of all, Phil Silvers' manic energy, wit and drive were part of a comedic upbringing and general education in life. Although it is possible that the series titled "YOU 'NEVER GET RICH" (1955-59 *) for the first time could be in the CBS TV Network with someone else in the title role of Sgt. Bilko, it is very difficult to imagine another actor / comedian in the business of wearing the belts of a sergeant master. <br /> <br /> Such strong identification is inevitable, although it is not the same type of strenuously throwing a nightmare that it turned out to be for other guys like Clayton More ("THE LONE RANGER"), George Reeves ("THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN ") and Charles Nelson Riley (" UNCLE CROC'S BLOCK "). <br /> <br /> One of the main obstacles to successfully adapting and updating such a work from the television screen from the 1950s to the movie from the 90s is our collective memory. Not sure what percentage of the crowd Bilko remembered from watching the original run and early syndication revivals, and their number was certainly significant; even a large proportion of young people have seen Bilko replays in recent times. It was obvious that the new film and source were miles; or even light years apart. <br /> <br /> To not be considered a completely square, old grouch, let's consider a few other points. <br /> <br /> Just here today, the 14th day of November in the year of our Lord 2007, let me swear and confirm under oath that I have been a fan of Steve Martin for almost 30 years. In addition, I enjoyed the wit and talents of Bilko '96 Co-Stars Dan Akroyd and the late Phil Hartman. In the end, they are the talents of such people and many others, graduates of "NBC; s Saturday NIGHT "and" SECOND CITY TV ", made the last quarter of the twentieth century laugh. But BILKO creates again; it just did not click. <br /> <br /> Maybe if the movie was shot as a service comedy (he always liked them!), but without Bilko Show names and gave him some identity more appreciated by crabby, old guys like me. <br /> <br /> So, we've had so many comedy series and series that have recently been turned into movies, what's next? Howse about someone who plays in the comedy series Sergeant Hal Roach from World War II, DOUBLEDAY and AMES, and about the first cartoon TV series "KRUSZARSKI KRÃ“LIK"? Remember where you heard him first! POODLE SCHNITZ!
