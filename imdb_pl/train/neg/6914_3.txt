I saw this movie some time ago (while working on the trailer of the film production company) and it was terrible. Hewitt is mediocre at best, Hopkins calls his performance (but he still blows Hewitt together), and Alec looks bored. Trust me: you should avoid this movie like a plague if it ever gets released. It seems that it lasts forever when the tired plot develops at a snail's pace. It is unrelenting, the pictures are poor and the direction is walking. Alec Baldwin should go to film school if he plans to direct again. As for his acting, his character is completely unacceptable, which makes it impossible to eradicate him. Dan Ackroyd is quite funny, and the surprising composition of the jury near the movie is charming, but this movie is simply awful.
