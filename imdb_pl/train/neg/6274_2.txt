I am generous giving this movie 2 stars. the line about "did you even see the wizard from" was the best for me! with horrible writing and behaving like in this film, it's no wonder that so many are being taken up by a worthless reality show. Do yourself a favor, leave the house and hit the royal baseball game, you'll be glad you did!
