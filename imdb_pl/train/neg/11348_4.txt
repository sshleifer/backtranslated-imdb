Six geographical indications to be sent home and discharged from the hospital, get drunk and sneak at the iconic meeting in Asia. Surrounded by hooded figures, two male dancers pretend to fight. Behind them, on the altar, a woven basket opens and a painted figure appears, which begins to imitate the serpent, finally biting one of the dancers on the neck. The snake imitation is dressed in several tights that look like scale. (It's definitely a snake imitating a woman.) A member of the cult who crept into a secret meeting warned six men repeatedly that the ceremony must not be interrupted, and you certainly do not need to take any pictures, otherwise they will be hunted down and killed. Of course, the GI take a flash photo, send members of the cult to angry hysteria, steal a basket containing a "snake" and flee with it to an Asian night. <br /> <br /> One of the guys, the most offensive and hoarse, dies from biting the cobra around his neck, although no one can explain how the snake got into his hospital room. <br /> <br /> After returning to New York, it seems that this is quite old news, because the dismissed men settle in their civil life, still maintaining a bond between themselves. Their work ranges from the bowling center manager (David Janssen) to the graduate student (Richard Long). James Dobson, Jack Kelly and Marshall Thompson are also part of the neighborhood. Richard Long has a pretty blond friend. Kelly is a slightly reckless womanizer. But everyone gets along well and everyone seems happy. <br /> <br /> Then a dark, shape-shifting, mysterious woman appears (Faith Domergue) and Marshall Thompson likes her and throws in a group. <br /> <br /> Guess what will happen. The first Janssen is terrified by the shadow in the back seat and dies in a car accident. Then Kelly visits Domergue. Something scares him so much that he falls over the window and dies in the fall on the pavement. Long and Dobson are beginning to suspect what the viewer already knows - that Domergue has something to do with death. They also think that maybe it turns into a cobra, which is happening. Dobson confronts her with his suspicions, and she proves his point. <br /> <br /> By then, Long and Thompson are completely stunned, especially Thompson, who is in love with Domergue and discovered that she is attracted to him too, although he must explain to her what "love" is. Irrelevant. The final reckless attack of a cobra on Long's friend - not one of the six original criminals - and Thompson must throw the snake out the window. On the pavement below, the body changes into the body of Domergue. End. <br /> <br /> I think I will skip most of the questions raised by the story. I will mention only one of the more mundane things. Who paid for the Domergue ticket from Asia to New York? Who pays her utility bills at the hotel? Who paid for her spectacular wardrobe? Why does he speak American so well? What the hell is going on? The writers and director evidently saw some of the modest horrors of Val Lewton, and although not much effort was made in this production, they shamelessly stole some of Lewton's tricks. For example, in Lewton's "The Cat People", a woman turns into a black leopard, but with one small exception, the threat is always kept in shadow and the more terrible for him. Most transformations also use shadows, but unlike Lewton, shadows are clumsy and unambiguous. <br /> <br /> Lewton also used sporadically what he called "buses". Lewton's first "bus" was literal. A potential victim rushes alone through the dark tunnels of Central Park only with footsteps. Something or someone is following her. He is dying of fear under the lantern. Something rustling over the branches of the bushes. He looks up. You can hear a loud, wheezing scream that makes the hair come to an end. It is a bus that stops with it using air brakes. The producers used at least two "buses" in this film and mean nothing. For example, a guy goes distracted by an intersection and suddenly comes to the violent rumble of a truck that almost hits him. There is no setting to shoot. It is clogged with the corner of the shoe. <br /> <br /> I do not care about films that perpetuate the stereotype of snakes as slimy, ugly, poisonous and phallic. In fact, no snakes are slimy, most are harmless, and many are extremely beautiful. What's more, they are more feminine than male in their twisty movements and serpentine approach to goals. Do you want a reptilian masculine symbol? Try the sixteen-kilometer racetrack. It's really a fast lizard. When he sees something to eat, he rushes up and devours him. <br /> <br /> In any case, if you want to see some nice, low budget scary movies, do not worry about it. Find "The Cat People" or one of Lewton's smaller masterpieces, which is an obvious copy.
