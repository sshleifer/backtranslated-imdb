This movie seemed too long even in 75 minutes. The problem with jungle horrors is that there are always too many people walking (through the jungle, up a rocky cliff, near a river or lake) to equalize the time of running. The movie is worth seeing for a funny and naked native zombie with large bulging, bloody eyes that always accompany the soundtrack with heavy breathing and lots of reverberation. Eurotrash fans will have fun because of bad English dubbing, free female body and very stupid make-up on monsters and native extras. For a zombie / cannibal movie it was quite light up, but I probably did not see the original version.
