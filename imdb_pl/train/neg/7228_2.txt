Good: <br /> <br /> Effective colors. Good costumes. Top-shelf production. Detailed CGI buildings and vehicles. <br /> <br /> Bad: <br /> <br /> A terrific mix of actors with all CGI actors mixes the Fifth Element from Final Fantasy. CGI actors look even worse than video games from a few years ago. Faulty logic. There is a gigantic pyramid and no one is researching it, no one is really questioning it? And there is no explanation why the god Horus was even thrown out, nor was there a reason why he would have to do something as trivial as Jill's impregnation? <br /> <br /> Brzydcy: <br /> <br /> Horrible script. So many unnecessary threads with many ideas that are not fully implemented. At some moments the dialogue was almost funny. Random characters and events that you do not need. Boring characters. Jill is supposed to be this secret, but apparently it was a secret for the writer. There is nothing for her. It's uninteresting and boring to watch. There is no substance, no texture. Her character has no features of redemption. In fact, there is not one character in the whole movie that has a purpose, any goals (except the obvious Horus), any motivation. They are weak and ill-conceived. There are no rates - a key for writing on the screen. Horus will not become immortal, but more importantly he is a bad guy. You can not even decipher if the main character is Horus or Jill. This is a problem: dedicating half of the movie to each character means that the writer never fully reveals one character, never realizes it. They are cardboard cutouts that walk and talk, and almost do nothing, but explore small pieces. The first stimulation of the director. Slowly, slowly, slowly. I'm still writing this movie. I can not pay attention because it is boring. Everything is flat. Even the action is not interesting because it is short-lived and sometimes unnecessary. <br /> <br /> In general: <br /> <br /> Not worth watching. Story history, character development below par, corny CGI does not save a nice set production.
