End of the World is a movie without events, which is strange because it is about the total destruction of the earth. The main character is a scientist, I'm not sure what kind. He has two jobs in a government institution (?) Guarded by four security guards. His first job is to monitor transmission to and from space (although it seems to be more of a hobby that he does when he is not at work # 2). Job # 2 requires him to put on a protective suit and go to a dark room ... at least as best as I can. Apparently the "plant" is not strictly secret, because the scientist brings his wife there. He moves away (they are on their way to dinner), when he discovers a message from space: A Big Earth Distortion, repeated over and over again. He says something about being the first space message he could ever decipher; his wife tells him that they will be late for the party. So they leave and go to the party (!?!). Moments later, he learns that China has suffered a major earthquake. From there the movie goes ... nowhere! Yes, Christopher Lee is in it, but it really does not help much. In addition, Lee gives poor results based on his performance at Howling II. This movie is boring, but it has quite stupid elements that you might want to experience if you like Christopher Lee or science-fiction Z-grade. Plus, there are a lot of film material about the destroyed earth.
