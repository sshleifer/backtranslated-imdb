I do not want to perform here, but ... it's the worst "movie" I've ever seen. Worse than The Avengers. Incompetent management, chaotic writing and terrible acting are the only consistent elements throughout the text. Filmed in a very cheap movie, it looks like a high school project, but without emotion. Lighting often looks like a single Sun-Gun. The sound is a bit better than a single microphone in the camera, but everything else in this case is just awful. The story takes place in strange directions without foundations or a later resolution, the techie elements are obviously absurd, and the editing looks worse than a rough cut. It's not even bad enough to be funny. Just bad. By the way, the packaging is deliberately misleading. <br /> <br /> Lion's Gate owes me $ 4.00.
