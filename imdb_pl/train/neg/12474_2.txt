I saw the version of "Deathstalker III" MST3K and I really liked this movie - even "unmoved" - that I decided to watch the whole series of films "Deathstalker". I bought I and II and decided to laugh. <br /> <br /> Nothing about "Deathstalker I" was fun at any level, and when I took out loans, I was embarrassed and I wish I had bought it! Too much ugliness and nakedness. I think that either "DS 3" was a much cleaner production, or MST3K really edited a lot, because I expected something similar, i.e. Stupid and carefree and simple. I was wrong. Even for 6.99 USD, it seemed a waste of money. I have not even opened the "DS 2" because I will return it tomorrow. Now I probably just throw this DVD away because I can not return it and nobody wants it - including me! So do not really worry about it. Even nudity (a lot, btw) is uninspiring and disgusting.
