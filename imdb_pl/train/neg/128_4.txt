This film, once sensational because of the forward-looking policy and imagination of free love and sexual liberation, has been reduced to mere curiosity over time. It seems absurd that this boring movie was banned and taken over by governments in many countries. Considering how socialist Sweden eventually became, the "radicalism" of its policy, once controversial, seems naive and almost mainstream four decades later. And the sex scenes, once the subject of sensational obscenity tests, look quite tame in a modern context. Nevertheless, the film and accompanying documents documenting its numerous controversies and influences remain marginal as an early relic of the youth rebellion of the 1960s. One part of the film, which is still maintained: its self-awareness in relation to the "fourth wall". Every now and then, the filmmakers make a film themselves. The satirical joke of this still provokes a chuckle.
