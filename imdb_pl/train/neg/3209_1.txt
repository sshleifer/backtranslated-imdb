I also saw this incredibly angry piece of "anime" at the London Sci-Fi Festival. If you MUST watch this thing, do it with a large audience, preferably after a few beers, then you can enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I found a funny dialogue, in my mind is the introduction of the Cremator. Animation is terrible. It is poorly designed and poorly made. It was a good idea for producers to employ at least one person who was not blind to colors. <br /> <br /> There is nothing more to say, this movie is a failure on every level.
