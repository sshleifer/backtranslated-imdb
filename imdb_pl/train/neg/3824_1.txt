I feel that the film did not present Smith historically. The aim of the film was to tell Smith's life in a way that would be "comfortable" for the leaders of the LDS Church, and historical accuracy does not seem to matter. The film was designed as an experience that "promotes faith" rather than a balanced look at Smith as a human being. I took this on myself to study Smith's life and read both LDS and LDS do not work. The film, like most LDS projects, has been beautifully made and well made. However, this was not a realistic representation of the beginnings of Mormonism or the relatively short life of Smith. <br /> <br /> A significant period of time was devoted to recreating the accident that Smith had when he was seven years old. Although the event was undoubtedly important in shaping his mental views, it seems that the main reason for including him in the film is to help establish a sympathetic view of Joseph Smith. Another point is showing the teenage years of Smith, when the film is silent about the Smith family's involvement in magical practices in the 1820s. Another problem is that while the movie shows Joseph Smith good-naturedly taking part in wrestling contests, he does not show how he sometimes lost his temper and became violent. <br /> <br /> I could go on. This film was in no way historical and should be considered a fictional film about a man. I do not recommend watching this movie for any purpose other than entertainment.
