I really wanted to like this western, being a fan of the genre and a fan of "Buffalo Bill", "Wild Bill Hickok" and "Calamity Jane", all of whom are in this story! Add Gary Cooper as the main actor to the mix and sound great. <br /> <br /> The problem was ..... it was not. I noticed that I looked at my watch in 40 minutes, bored to death. The character of Jean Arthur was a bit annoying, and James Ellison simply did not look or act like "Buffalo Bill." Cooper, too, was not at its best, sounding too wooden. It took several years before he hit the actor. <br /> <br /> In short, his western arrows. Go to the pass and look at another village because most of them were much better than this one.
