Ringmaster, pitiful Jerry Springer's excuse to waste a movie that needs to be recycled as toilet paper, has recently destroyed my confidence in film art. First of all, it was made. Second, people went to see him. Thirdly, some people have considered it the best movie they've ever seen. If a monkey could make a movie, I'm 100 percent sure it would be a billion times better. Most ugly movies have their moments (even Godzilla had some cool special effects) the moment of the movie was when I left the nauseating theater. The only thing that could make this movie even worse would be Jerry Springer. If I want to stare at shit for an hour and a half, I'll take a drop to the can. If someone does not despise this film, I feel sorry for your children and children of your children; However, contrary to the beliefs of Springer, I clearly do not tolerate the sex of children.
