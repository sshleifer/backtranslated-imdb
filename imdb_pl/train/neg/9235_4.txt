This woman never stops talking throughout the movie. She remembered every line and released everything without a little natural emotion. She also has the most unwavering lisp, and the tone of her voice sounds like nails on the board. This movie has too much Betsy Drake, and not enough Cary Grant, which in itself carries little of the film.
