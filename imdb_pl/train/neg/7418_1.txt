Oh God, what a horrible, awful movie. Wanting to be a commentary on the state of society, this is only a reflection of the worst of the worst televisions in reality. Interstitials led by Jason Jones and Don McKellar are the most repulsive part, written in a tone that may be reflective and insightful. These moments are rather paralyzing when they talk to the camera through a dialogue written by someone with a penchant for offensive, condescending speech that shifts the "meaning" of the film into the throat of the viewer. <br /> <br /> point for would-be filmmakers: long shots and quiet scenes are not equal to art. Neither extreme angles nor logic reach to the absurd. <br /> <br /> If anyone is interested in watching this movie, please do not. Seriously. Please. You have better things to do.
