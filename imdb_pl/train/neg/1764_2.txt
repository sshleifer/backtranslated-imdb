Although in many respects I agree with the comments of other reviewers. I think the plot and the idea are very good. Many supporting actors were very good. Ellen Pompeo is a big problem for this film. I'm sure I've never seen a less talented "actor". As this person has ever been in a movie or on television, I can not imagine. In my opinion, it would be better as greater at Wal-Mart. To see a person with such a low level of talent involved in paying roles, please ask ...... "Who does she know"? I would love to have this movie reworked with a certain talent. I'm not accusing the writer that this movie was not worth the time to see it.
