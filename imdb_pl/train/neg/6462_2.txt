This unfortunate film shows that even some of the best prizes are not able to save the real deposit of garbage dumps. <br /> <br /> I could spend a lot of time describing everything that was wrong in this effort, but it would require more time I've wasted 91 minutes watching ... IT. <br /> <br /> Looking at it now, after Brando's death, shows how tragic happened to the life of one of our greatest actors. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland? Why? <br /> <br /> I need to fill in more lines to accept this. I need to fill more lines to accept this. I need to fill more lines to accept this. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time on this movie. I'm late to do something interesting. PA.
