Well, I'm blown away, Woody Allen's movie, which I left after half an hour (I'm aware of the moral fragility of commenting on a movie I've seen less than half, but I hope you understand why). Basically, it turned out very early that we would be patronizing from the screen with the help of: a script that defines its presumption as with bullets; the cast who tried to be characters from Hannah and her sisters (with the exception of Chloe Sevigny) and was badly targeted; and the camera, which sat ominously, just to ensure that there was nothing to film, but a chat and actor delivering. Drama? No; it is partly before the narrative, but the action does nothing to develop a dramatic situation. <br /> <br /> Maybe in this case I left too early, but then I decided on another one and a half hours-kler-Allen clones. The script has its funny moments? I went almost completely on the basis of fragments of Will Ferrell in the trailer (again hooked on trailer, doh!) ?? but there is a small pace to let them fly away nonchalantly, as it is best. What's worse, there is no liquidity. To say that this movie is wooden makes the forest look like a jelly: the discussion about the opening caf√© is the worst case. The only thing that should be done by numbers is browsing? 2/10.
