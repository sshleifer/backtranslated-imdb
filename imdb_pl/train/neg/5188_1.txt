TV pilots, do not you love them? Quinn Martin has tried this after success in several other television detective films, but this one is nowhere to be found, except in the MST area to which he belongs. Roy Thinnes is the Diamond Head who accepts orders from Aunt Mary to find the super Lovejoy spy, I mean Tree. Zulu and Tso-Tsing are there to get relief from ethnic comics and not much more. The tree sucks like a bad guy despite all the disguises that make it look exactly the same as usual. There is a more unnatural clothing fiber than you can imagine (required in the seventies), and the show itself is so anti-climatic. Why did not he hit the series? You understand, it's pretty blatant. Again, it's great fun for MST, but not much more!
