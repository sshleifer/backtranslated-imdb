It hurts to write such a scathing review, but without doing so I simply encourage these people. First of all, just because the movie is made on a small budget, it does not make it good or endearing. In this case, a small budget is probably the only achievement of the movie, because it prevented you from squandering large sums of money on racing a single-legged racehorse. Have you ever seen a comedy in the theater? Have you ever heard people laugh and think: "What are Dickens on?" Well, even those aunts did not laugh. Halfway through, my cat took his first bath. This is not a movie, it's children .... no monkeys are taking pictures that make you feel like moving to France. I have to go, there is a clown in my door .............
