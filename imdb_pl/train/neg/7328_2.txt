I see that many people liked this movie. For me, it was a movie written on the basis of law 101, and the person did not pass the class. Ever since Lindsey Price showed up to the end, the film was very predictable. I watched all the time if it would not work anywhere. <br /> <br /> First we have a widowed young father. Cliché # 1 movies / TV always kill the parent's mother if the child is a boy's girlfriend or offspring, so a lonely father can swoon over his dead wife and seems completely devoid of his element, taking care of the children. Starting from My 3 Sons to 2 1/2 Dads. These films are usually dramas, and the comedies are TV shows. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 2 When a nosy woman has a video camera in her hand, she will play a big role in the film. And they will always have solutions, and even if the person is a pilot <br /> <br /> Cliché # 3 If the person in danger is a foreigner, he must be Latin. And they must be illegal. Apparently there are no legal Latinos or illegal Europeans, unless there is an IRA element. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 4 The aforementioned Hispanic must be highly educated in his native country. In this case, he was a professor who earned 200 a month. And this well-educated Latinos must now behave as if he has no brain in his head and let the head on the air take control. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 5 A crime committed by a person was not really a crime, but an accident. But because in this case he lost all the senses he had when he crossed the border, now he acts like a stupid idiot and now exposes his own daughter to danger, taking her to the fruitless pursuit of the border with the idiot party kick. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 6 You never get into a thug escaping from crime, but some poor, sweet kid. This is because the child's parents have to play a large part of the movie, and the person who accidentally killed the child may have a funny interaction with the parents. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 7 Call me one movie, in which one policeman is not an angry vet and is connected to the debutant. Even if they're homicide detectives who have to be the most experienced policemen in the police. The Sev7n and Copy and Law and Order cats come to mind right away. And the vet, though surly outside, has a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 8 Let's go and round off some unemployed Soap Stars. Now I like Lindsey Price. But Susan Haskell IMO can not get out of the paper bag, and when he uses it as One Life To Live as Martha, he rocked from right to left every time she opened her mouth. It makes me sick. It could now be better anchored on land, but it still can not work. <br /> <br /> The film could have been more insightful if it had not been filled with cliches. I think the film does not have to be expensive and the brain is good. But it was just bad. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER **** Now I do not intend to spoil the ending. Oh, damn it, because I feel that it would be unfavorable for humanity to let people waste time, they will never come back looking at this film. Includes Cliché # 6 and # 7. Unless someone has ever seen a movie before you have to see what's coming. The father even commits a stupid mistake from the cops at the end and is shot by a furious veteran who is suddenly very upset. You'd think she thought the poor guy was innocent throughout the movie, and she shot him by mistake. When not. Now for the little girl Daddy brought with him. Guess what will happen to her? The time is coming, she ends her life with a family whose child was killed by her father! Come on! You all knew that this would happen because she is a foster child !! That's why she did not want to live with Lindey Price. <br /> <br /> This movie was an insult, as far as I was concerned. Because there were so many ways that this film could explore and go down, but he decided to get a film. Two stars are for 2 stars, a little girl that I thought was very good, and Lindsey Price who was annoying, but she did what she could. My advice is to take a vise and squeeze your head instead of looking at this shudder
