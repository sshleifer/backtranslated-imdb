Interestingly, the eyes and lips of Rene Russo - not the Buddha of the Gorilla's - appear as the central point of the "Buddha", the production of Jim Henson Pictures by Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope. In some way, countless Russo faces have slipped over the post-production stages, and she literally fills the screen so many times that the poor monkeys are upstaged. Unintentionally funny real story adapted from Gertrude "Trudy" Memories of Davies Lint about a wealthy doctor's wife who turns her residence into a menagerie for animals and wild life. The film goes beyond good intentions ... it positively drips with honest honesty. The film never shines with the kind of magic of the "family film" that he needed, and for too long both humans and animals appear clearly programmed (nothing is true here). About ten minutes, two chimpanzeas batter in Russo's kitchen and start throwing the butcher back and forth (he misses Alan Cumming's head in inches); there are no eyebrows raised yet, because it's all during the day. Even so, when the adolescent gorilla of a Buddha goes crazy during a storm, the cops are called - and everyone is staring at the Buddha through the window while he picks up the furniture in the living room. Furniture should be the least concern of anyone in this stunning failure of charity. But at least we know that Russo was in good hands: whenever the director Caroline Thompson needs a good shot, he gives incomprehensible Rene another extreme close-up. I wonder what was the budget of the lipstick in this photo? ** with ****
