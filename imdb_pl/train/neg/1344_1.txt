Any movie with a title as ridiculous as "The Bagman" should automatically attract the attention of every bad movie lover, but the plot is much different than you would expect from watching the DVD cover. Bagman is not a good movie. It belongs to the category of films that appear to be (and probably were) filmed on a home video camera. Acting is terrible. I have not heard and seen such wooden actors from Troll 2. There are plenty of nudity and sex scenes, but they are clearly jumping in too fast. The heroes are morons and completely forgotten. The ending (which I will not ruin) can be easily predicted after watching the first scene. Due to the trashy nature of the film, nothing but horrible production values ​​is really scary (horrible attempts to realistic gore, driving scene in which the car is clearly stationary, etc.). Recommended only for bad movie lovers.
