This movie is even a big step down from the typical Bollywood tariff. The performances were terrible. Even Boman Irani, who always manages to shine, goes completely OTT as a villain. The soundtrack is also unforgettable. And despite the trouble, female leaders are not "sexy." Vivek Oberoi is capable of much better projects, while Fardeen Khan seems to be on a similar tariff. But this monstrosity is even below his limited capabilities as an actor. Esha Deol and Amrita Rao are awful in badly written, banal roles. It's time for Indra Kumar to hang his hat on the director. I hope he never looks like that. The future of Hindi movies is now in better hands. In conclusion, stay away from celluloid waste.
