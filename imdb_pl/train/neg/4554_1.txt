Bingo is a game, nonsense is the name. Rarely the screen was smudged with such a mixed set of half-burned conspiracy theories, puritan prudery and the babble of a new era. Most of the story takes place in Viciente, a Cristian resort in the Peruvian jungle. Think of the fact that Rivendell Tolkien meets the Baku Star Trek Planet, inhabited by wicked followers of a not so mysterious but surprisingly limited cult of love and peace. Thanks to macabre acting and trashy production (rainbow visualization of the mysterious, completely healing "energy" is particularly hideous), "The Celestine Prophecies" looks and looks like a rejected episode of "Twilight Zone" from the 80s. Abundance of factual errors regarding the history and nomenclature of the church. I can not believe that Hector Elizondo agreed to be part of this. Maybe it was made without his consent, in the Bowfinger style. May the Lord have mercy on the director, screenwriter, author of the novel and the poor souls who see the movie or read the book.
