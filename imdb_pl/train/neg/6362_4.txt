I am a huge fan of Italian films from the seventies and I would not hesitate to mention the beautiful Barbara Bouchet among my favorite actresses of all time, so I went to this movie with some hopes. However, it soon turns out that it is a largely pointless film that will not go anywhere. Obviously, no one would have expected it, expecting much more, but the fact that it is pointless becomes more irritating if one considers that it is rather boring and none of the characters is interesting. As the title suggests, the film focuses on the "rascal"; in this case, one who steals, women and smuggles things. It's basically the whole story of this movie. The film has a real "seventies style" and the idea that everything is very carefree, it is doing well. Sometimes it seems that the directors Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson tried to describe a point, although whatever it is, it does not go very well. Watching Barbara Bouchet on the screen is always a pleasure and it is also in this case; is by far the best thing in the movie, and the sequence in which the car hangs in the nude is the best part of the movie. In general, The Rogue will probably have something for people who love the style of the seventies, but unfortunately there is not much to offer.
