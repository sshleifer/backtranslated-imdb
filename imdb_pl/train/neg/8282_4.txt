Right now you should know about this film, the "bomb" by Jessica Simpson, who almost immediately went to the video (limited, anemic run of the theater). Essentially, Katie, Mrs. Simpson, is leaving a small town in Oklahoma to visit her boyfriend, surprise him, only find him in bed with another woman. She is orphaned, but has one friend (Rachel Leigh Cook, whom I would like to see more often in the film), which allows her to stay. Katie finishes work through two collaborating collaborators (Penelope Ann Miller and always entertaining Andy Dick) who are just using Katie to remove the company's president (Larry Miller). This is strictly a movie "b" that is not meant to be deep. Jessica Simpson is not a great actress, but she is quite beautiful and she is never really annoying. The film is visible because it is not an abomination, but a fluffy down. The episode of Penny Marshall is funny (a subtle joke about Milwaukee made me giggle), and there is also a funny scene with the participation of Norwegian priests (do not read too much) Yes, not terrible, but easy to miss. It's your safe assumption to watch it on TV if it ever happens. Again not good, but not a deep catastrophe.
