OK, I looked at the original French version. But I can not imagine it would be better with subtitles. <br /> <br /> I just have to say that this is the most boring movie I have seen in a long time. This movie has almost no advantages. That's why I can not understand all the positive reviews. This may be somewhat realistic, but some real stories are best left unspoken. <br /> <br /> I usually like slow motion movies, as long as they serve the purpose of the movie. Tarkovsky's Solaris is extremely slow, but allows for introspection and, for example, sets the mood of the film. But in this case the film is simply filled with mindless dialogue, which does not tell us much about the characters. None of them could identify or care for him. In many scenes, I thought: "When will it close"? Acting was very bad. Not obvious. But it seems that none of the actors took care of their characters and they all looked as if they wanted to be somewhere else in most of the scenes. This may be due to the uninspiring dialog box. Also, the entire film flow was quite mechanical. Moving from one scene to the next. It looks like this movie was written (wrong), but it has never been directed. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few films I can say that did not trigger any emotional reaction in any of the scenes. No tension, no fear, no waiting, no sadness, no introspection, no intellectual stimulation, no interest what ever. <br /> <br /> A great example of what I call an anti-movie.
