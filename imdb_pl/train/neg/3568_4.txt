The truth is that the film based on Harold Robbins' novel will not win any prizes. This is no exception. "The Lonely Lady" is a pure B picture in the budget, cast and executions. From a technical point of view, it looks like a film made to order. Acting is very uneven. Joseph Cali is particularly horrible. Anthony Holland is embarrassed. As one of the reviewers about a certain performance of Katherine Hepburn said, her reach goes from A to B. Mrs. Zedora manages to reach G. The rest of the cast is solid (and wasted in their roles). Lloyd Bochner and Bibi Besch deserved better. After all, all this fun can be great fun. As befits Robbins, everything revolves around sex and nakedness. If you are looking for fun ... and you are not too sober ... it may be for you.
