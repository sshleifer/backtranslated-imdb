Instead, the long dance sequences and close-ups of characters that made the movie stretched - the movie would be better if it explained the story and motivations of the characters. <br /> <br /> The marginalization of minister Nubo, aunt, mother - and the suppression of the dynamic and IMPORTANT rivalry between hatsumo and mameha, hatsumo and sayuri meant that the film lacked any real depth. If you had not read the book, you would not understand why Sayuri loved the chairman and why Mameha had become her mentor at all. <br /> <br /> Visually, the movie was stunning - and all the actors did their best with the C rate script they received, but it was all good in this movie.
