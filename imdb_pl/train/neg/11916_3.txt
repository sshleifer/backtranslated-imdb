Yuck. It seemed strange to me that their ancient book on curses was created using a simple script instead of a handwritten font. Acting is sometimes so apathetic and sometimes too dramatic. Why would "demonico" kill two suspicious silent doctors who helped him make him immortal? Only heck? And is it really necessary to show the Lilith motorcycle every time it's somewhere. We understand! You spent some money to rent a third rate crotch. It does not mean that you have to show it all the time! The "Faith" bed looks like a set of old Battlestar Galactica school with some last-minute changes. There is a scene in which we are presented to several people on a talk show for about 30 seconds before they are killed for no apparent reason or meaning. Everyone is a one-off character. Unforgettable characters and an even more unnoticed plot make it one of the most misunderstood movies with which I saw the SciFi channel. Stay away, unless you have bad movies.
