There is so little here, fantastic book by Anne Rice, that what IS HERE here does not make sense. Some characters - intense and surprising characters - do not hit the screen at all, and those who do it are getting so diluted that there is no reason for their existence. <br /> <br /> Where is the relationship between Christoph and Marcel? Where is the continuous affair of Marcel with Juliet? Why does Dolly Rose appear when her story has never been explained? Where is the rape and redemption of Marie, whose greatest attribute (and downfall) is that she can go white - and her marriage to Richard? Why does the film end with Marcel's beating from his father's hands? We do not know anything about Aglae except that she is a woman who hates her husband; why no history explains this hatred? <br /> <br /> When it comes to performances, there is no one that is better than average, although it's probably because of a bad script. The best of them is Richard's actor - but Richard is not on screen enough to save the movie. The worst is Jasmine Guy as Dolly Rose, but again, the actress has nothing to do with what she has to do. <br /> <br /> All in all it's just terrible. It seemed to me that it would be impossible for any movie in Anne Rice's book to be worse than EXIT TO EDEN, but FEAST OF ALL SAINTS makes this mess look like a critical blow. How is it that Rice is such a slut that she will allow her best work to become such a trash on the screen?
