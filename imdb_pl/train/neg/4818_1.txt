I was about 7 years old when this DIRE MONSTROSITY film was released. In Britain, he was advertised on television in the summer of 1977. For several weeks, it was like an amazing cinema hit. It was actually the first movie I've ever seen in the cinema, and put it off later. The following week I was invited to watch the new movie "Star Wars" and refused. I have never seen it until today, in protest against the need to watch Sasquatch! Seriously, even at the age of 7, I could say I was watching garbage. It's so bad, it's almost unbelievable. Useless nonsense that NEVER should go to the cinema. I was, however, amused when I read all these years later that the director never directed anymore, just as I am concerned. AVOID ALL COSTS !!!
