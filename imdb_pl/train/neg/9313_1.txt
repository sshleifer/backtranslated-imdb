This was by far the worst low-budget horror movie I've ever seen. I am an open mind and I always love good horror. In fact, when I rent movies, I am looking for particularly good underestimated horrors. They're always good for laughter, I believe I know, I've seen a lot. But this movie was so horrible that it was not worth chuckling. I was considering turning it off in the first five minutes ... which I probably should have. There is nothing good about it, first of all team suck3d A $$. Intro was stupid, as did the ending. Activities and special effects were terrible. I am begging you, DO NOT watch this movie, you will hate it absolutely.
