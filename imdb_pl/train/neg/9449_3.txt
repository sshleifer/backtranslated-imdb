Dr. Seuss would certainly be furious if he lived. Cat in the Hat proves that film productions can take the classic story and turn it into a mindless pile of goose bumps. We have Mike Myers as the infamous Cat in the Hat, a big mistake! Myers proves that he can not play in this movie. It behaves like a prissy show girl with a thousand tricks in the sleeve. The children in this movie are fine, somewhere between boring and annoying lines. The story is like an original with a few revisions and like most movies based on other stories, never improve the original story! Bringing in Quin's bad neighbor was a bad idea. He is a stupid villain who will never get in his life. This movie is like a rejected comic strip from the newspaper if you think about it. The film certainly looks cheesy! Sure, there are fun jokes for adults, such as those in which a cat cuts a tail, and censorship disappears before uttering a naughty word, slightly ridiculous. At least Grinch had courage and the film was really good! This film is a cartoon snot with bright colors and poor mediocre action. Was Mike Myers even in this movie? And one more thing, a fish. What about this stupid fish! The first time you see him is a real fish. The next time you see him, he's animated and talking. But it looks like an animated piece of rubber cake to play! This movie is a complete wreck. Good joke, bad joke, bad, bad, bad, good joke! I'm surprised that even good jokes were just like a joke in a water park, it was good. So please, if you have a choice, look at Grinch instead of this mess.
