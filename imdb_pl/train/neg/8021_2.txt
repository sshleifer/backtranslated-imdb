Visually dismembered and full of himself, the director apparently decided to look for artificial depth to expand the 5-minute plot to 81-minute snoring. <br /> <br /> The moments that work in this movie are VERY limited, and the characters do not even feel real. How would you feel invested in the main character who has become so surreal? <br /> <br /> Significantly and stylistically, it all looks like a strange sequence of dreams. Move irregular camera operation, awkward silence and interruptions in operation, and what about a small picture of a spider crawling on the screen? Whoever thought about it must go back to film school. It did not matter, only cheese, and did not even work stylistically with the rest of the movie (assuming that the movie even had a style that is close). What a flap.
