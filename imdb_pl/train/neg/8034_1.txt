I know the bastards are always going to be bad, but come on, what the hell is that? It's like a group of 10-year-olds saved their lunch money and started filming it at the end of the week. <br /> <br /> Anyway, six young people are going to the same house to die from the screen. We have a brainy, a whore, a second whore, a black guy, a killer, such stereotypes. After someone has eaten the shaking of a boat, everyone else is persecuted by some guy who wears a mask rejected by people in a poor box. Somewhere in the middle there is one quite decent murder, but then it comes back to even more boredom, and especially more false dreads, we actually know that it can not be a killer when someone is attacked because the guy certainly loves to spend sweet time on everything. <br /> <br /> After every character you expected to die, a standard ugly blond chick and her soon-to-be boy will eventually be captured by the killer (they like to be pushed and then pass out) and the killer reveals himself. I think the authors of this film took the eyes and pen and put it somewhere on the list of characters. The motif is simply bad and do not even start with this damned secret. too much time to explain everything (and then about 10 minutes, in which for some reason gets his arm) and finally becomes overpowered by a guy with a gun. Hey, it's not fair! <br /> <br /> Really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I could have enjoyed watching Lindsay Lohan, I swear. I mean, most of the 80s slashers are sucked, but at least they've quit a bit of T & A. There is nothing to do.
