A good movie lurks here, but that's not it. The basic idea is good: explore the moral issues that will meet a group of young survivors from the apocalypse. But logic is so tangled that you can not get involved. <br /> <br /> For example, our four heroes are (understandably) paranoid when it comes to catching the mysterious airborne plague that has been destroyed practically by all humanity. However, sometimes they wear surgical masks and others do not. Sometimes they are fanatical when it comes to bleaching any area affected by an infected person. At other times they seem completely indifferent. <br /> <br /> Worse, after they've apparently survived a few weeks or months in this new world of killing or killing, these people are still behaving like total newborns. They do not bother about collecting the right equipment or food. There is no fuel inside. They do not take basic precautions when they meet strangers. And after wading through the rotting corpses of the entire human race, they are as sensitive as the protected debutants. You must constantly wonder how they could have survived for so long ... and even if that were the case, why would anyone want to make a film about them. <br /> <br /> So when these dweebs cease to tire of morality the dimensions of their actions, one can not take their soul search seriously. Their actions would have to have some minimal meaning first. <br /> <br /> In addition, we have to fight the dubious acting skills of Chris Pine. His portrait of an arrogant young James T Kirk could seem clever when he looks in isolation. But in Carriers he plays exactly the same note: arrogant and stupid. You can not but suspect that this is his entire dramatic range. <br /> <br /> From a positive point of view, the movie * looks great *. It has a very sharp, saturated look that really suits the southwestern part of the USA. But this can not save really poor writing or paper-thin (irritating) characters. Even if you are a fan of the genre of the end of the world, you should spare yourself the agony of watching Carriers.
