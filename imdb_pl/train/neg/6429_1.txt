Personally, I would advise people to stay away from the movie. In total, boredom is watched and the fights are poorly choreographed. Slow and not very convincing. If you buy a DVD with this movie in Hong Kong Legends, the only thing worth listening to is the Bey Logan audio commentary. <br /> <br /> But in any case, ever since the Ninja movie used to be worth watching. I can not think of one, and to be honest I do not want to. <br /> <br /> In general, when it comes to movies, I have one golden rule: avoid films containing the word "Ninja".
