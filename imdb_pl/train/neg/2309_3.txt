I have a high tolerance for strange, but honestly, some movies go far beyond the weird ones - so far that they make your brain hurt. It's a movie. An attempt to understand this or even explain it is impossible and I think that the film is best understood while taking drugs - it is incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a very charming Japanese animation with the participation of a cat. However, from the sky there are tons of twisted and sometimes disturbing things - which makes me wonder if I'm losing something in translation. However, even if it is so, why did we have to be treated as an image of a magic trick involving dismembering a lady with wise, defecating, vomiting, lighting animals on fire, etc. Everything seemed random and quite awful. Oddly enough, and I do not know why, some consider it a work of genius. I just do not understand it.
