Mr. Mike was probably the most misanthropic comedian of all time, so I wanted to see what he would do with total creative control over the movie. Unfortunately, you can not watch it, but not because jokes are not fun - some of them (most will not say) are in fact, and Mr. Mike did a good job explaining his mentally unbalanced bases in visual gags. The problem is that the technical quality (sets, lighting, sound, editing, what you call it) is so horrible that the movie is unbearable. Some costumes called "PKO Productions" are appreciated, but they do not look manufactured at all; it looks like Mike stole one of the SNL cameras and did it all in the afternoon. I realize that Mike's goal was to torture the audience, but even this deserves some basic standards, such as the ability to see, hear or understand what is going to be shocking. Nevertheless, the DVD is not a total loss: it includes Bill Murray's O'Donoghue praise and three "Mr. Mike's nicest good night stories" from the SNL. In addition, the "Cat Swimming" section of the movie is a great scene that you can catch if you want to scared someone. 3/10
