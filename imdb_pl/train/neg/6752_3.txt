Unfortunately, more falls than ups. The plot was quite decent. I mean, nothing out of the ordinary, but it had a story, unlike other modern horror movies. The second good thing was cast. I'm not saying that acting was good because it was not, but every actor / actress was hot and attractive. <br /> <br /> One of the disadvantages is that the movie becomes exciting only after the first 40 minutes. The rest was quite boring. Another disadvantage (or you can consider it if you want) is excessive nudity. All four girls were topless for several minutes, and all the boys showed their butts for a long time. It's not that I'm against nakedness, but it was a horror movie, not the Dreamers. <br /> <br /> Unless you are very desperate to see some guy take off his bathing suit and run naked for a few minutes, either watch the girl naked for no reason, or you're an avid fan of Debbie Rochon, than this movie for you. But if you're looking for a good horror movie, stay away.
