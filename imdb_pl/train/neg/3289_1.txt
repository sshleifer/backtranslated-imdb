I will tell you what happened, some people with money thought it would be nice to ruin one of the best programs on TV. Do we really need re-make a big screen? Did they ask fans? I wonder how everyone would feel if they did a remake of the "Rocky Horror Picture Show" with actors such as Ashton Krutcher, Steve Martin, Britney Spears and Kiefer Southerland, they took out all the music and made it a drama. You think they will like it! This movie does not have the same impression as the original. Sure, the original was sometimes a bit banal, but Bo and Luke were always nice, they got in trouble because they were always in trouble, and their main purpose was to help people who went through the city. It did not matter to the people who made the movie, they might never even see the original program. My big question is: what are they going to ruin?
