I just bought VHS in this movie for two dollars, I lost money! Hey, copy of Adam "Batman" West and Tina "Island of Giligan" Louise, but hi! This third production is a modification of a dozen other motorcycle films; a crazy group of biker psychos enter the town, beat everyone and everything, and then be defeated in a man by a stunning hero. Adam West looks like a hero, but he lacks Batman's cloak and uniform. I'm sorry, it's not the same. Tina L. looks very nervous and scares the whole show, but at least we know what happened to "Ginger" when she was saved from the island ... LOL! Motorcyclists are a graceful group, and the well-known of them have always acted again, or at least they should not. Hell Riders to Hell to Watch!
