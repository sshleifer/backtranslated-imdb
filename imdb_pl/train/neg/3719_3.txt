Imagine withdrawing the mask of a deadly killer and finding Barbara Cartland there ... this is what happens with this film. <br /> <br /> The opening was promising, but will soon give up all pretensions to being a thriller (or even an ingenious love story) and the only reason why this story has become clear: fill the gap in the women watching market by creating another replay. " misunderstood, meditating evil boy "(Andrei) meets" innocent ", capricious beauty" (Paula). <br /> <br /> Instead of wasting time on creating original assumptions, the creators went straight to the shot: the bad boy was tamed by the capricious beauty. Thence follows a series of insincere and hard cliché love scenes sprinkled with a pseudo philosophical / poetic down. Andrei's admission that he is (eponymically) a "poet" is drawn to complement the perceived features that Byronic's protagonist should have - but even when it's hard to say, emphasizing what and who it is, it's still hard to believe - or caring. <br /> <br /> Byronic hero / antihero can work, history requires subtlety, style and innovation - all of which are completely absent here. This is not a modern phantom in the opera, this is what happens when a weak and rather stupid woman (with a loose elastic band) meets an evil man who after her meeting seems as dangerous as the bunny slippers. <br /> <br /> The performances could have saved the movie if they were good: a woman's voice is busy looking sexy and "unearthly", no matter how forced or funny; and the poor Dougray Scott seems drugged as he searched his part. This is not his best job. Jürgen Prochnow's "Vashon" brought rapid interest, and Andrew Lee Potts as a young photographer / brother. A better movie would undermine my sister and stop my brother.
