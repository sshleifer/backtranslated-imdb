Imagine that the real Hitler, who was the master of propaganda and speech, would be such a slurred moron as Carlyle introduced him in this film. <br /> <br /> No one would follow him, not even a desperate, unemployed guy in the 1920s. <br /> <br /> It's just a Hollywood piece of propaganda in itself, disguised as a "real story". <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for everyone who really believed in all this. Carlyle and the producers had nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> Why was Hitler able to win so many people, the whole county for his ideas, if we were such a sausage? Why did people follow him to death? Presenting him as such a loser, they make their own movie completely unbelievable. This film is a mix of old WW2 propaganda and urban MTV myths about one of the most important people of the last century. Imagine a movie about Churchill, where the director shows him only as a drunk for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie is a disgrace and I wonder how they could talk to an actor like Carlyle with this bastard.
