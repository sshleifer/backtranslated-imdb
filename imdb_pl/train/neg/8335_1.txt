Pakage suggests that Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn are making a huge bank robbery, but that's not what I've learned! I did not get anything! In the first half there is a new character (without introduction) in any other scene. The first half hour is completely incomprehensible, the rest is just one long, irritating, highlighted chase scene. In the background there is always an annoying sound, be it the loud ticking of the watch, the roaring siren, the whistling of the train, or even the horrible result of Quincy Jones. There are also many parts that are ridiculously bad. For example, bad guys chase Beatty on thin ice with CAR! Or the police come to the stage about fifteen times. I really hated this movie!
