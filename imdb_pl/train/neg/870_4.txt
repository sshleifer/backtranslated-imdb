At the end of this thriller, the emaciated picture of Ally Sheedy from the last days is used creatively to create more than one terribly bad image. He convinces her that if she had a nasty role like Bette Davis, she could do it brilliantly. Unfortunately, I can not find many other reasons to see it. If you've wondered what Sheedy looks like in old-fashioned glasses (but why somebody?), Here's your answer. The rest, the hungry sex woman Sally Kirkland is really tiring, and even if you like this type of thing more than I do, you have to admit that the tension in these scenes decreases. Dr Savage's savage brute is equally unpalatable, but at least he has a small role. Among the leading actors Nicholas Walker does not arouse sympathy for the hard situation of Paul Keller, and his acting is wooden. Dara Tomanovich is better, and during her scenes with Sheedy the level increases a little. Sheedy's scrupulous, understated performance (although it often seems to be on the automatic pilot) is admirable in itself, but from context to the rest. The sets are colorless and the camera does not stand out.
