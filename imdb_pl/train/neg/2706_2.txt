Yes, people are racists. People are even racists in college. This is a good point, and the issue of racism has been repeatedly considered in countless films. What distinguishes higher education from the package is that it deals with the issue of racism in the most inhibitory and predictable way, oh yes, it is also in college. <br /> <br /> This film deals with this problem of racism in the way that Frankenstein copes with most problems, several times storming you in a brutal and slow way. Most of the characters are caricatures, one-dimensional caricatures (a lesbian feminist, a furious black man) that react to situations as dramatically and predictably as possible. Instead of opposing stereotypes, this movie is filled with them. Furious black men feel cheated, feminists hate men, etc. (One feminist even has a sign with the inscription "Dead men do not rape." I see what I mean?) I do not want to give away, but in this movie, if someone looks like a changeable a loner or a date rapist, he will probably behave exactly as you expect. The changes that the heroes go through seem obvious to everyone, except for the people in the film. A big turn of action depends on whether the brutal neo-Nazis will behave like brutal neo-Nazis. I guess you'll just have to watch to find out what's going on. <br /> <br /> Another problem I have with this movie is that it is supposed to be "hard" and "hard", but they make the Nazis angry. I agree that the Nazis are bad, but that's what I mean. Everyone thinks that the Nazis are angry; we do not break any new ground here. The Nazis were depicted as villains from the 1930s. The film does not undermine any points of view or makes bold statements. It deals only with matters that we all know in a clumsy way, such as after school. Being anti-rape, anti-racist and anti-Nazi is not a decisive occupation on a controversial issue. <br /> <br /> Higher education is predictable, cartoon and, in a word, stupid. Avoid at all costs.
