my friend bought a movie for 5 ?? (Its value is not even one cent) because they wrote it was like an American cake. but soon we will find out that there is a long way to go from an American cake to a piece of shit. it's not even a comedy, it's more like a really bad documentary. not only is history bad, but also picture and sound. they put in some alcohol, chicks, dwarfs and drunken teens. and the result is a catastrophe. if you see this movie, do not buy it, or rather spend money on something else and better. if you're going to torture yourself, do not invite your friends unless you really hate and want to get rid of them.
