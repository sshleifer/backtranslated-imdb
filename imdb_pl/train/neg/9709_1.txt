30 seconds after the opening credits I had the impression that it would be a bad movie, but I did not know how bad. Then the actor playing the evil Nazi scientist opens his mouth and my friend and I decide that in order to survive this movie, we will have to reduce the volume, create our own dialogue and double the speed on the DVD. But it did not help. About halfway we turned it off. I have already had some very bad movies, both with and without the assistant "Mystery Science Theater 3000" and "Svengoolie", but there are only some movies that I doubt that even Bots can save them. The biggest part of the movie that disturbed me the most was that people hypnotized to believe that they are zombies have rotting green skin. I think everyone was hypnotized into death and then hypnotized to decay. Stick to the real classics of iconic B movie, such as "Plan Nine From Outer Space".
