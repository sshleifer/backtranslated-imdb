I just finished watching El Otro. I always took off my hat from Julio Chavez's performances because he is a great actor, but this movie is really depressing and slow. I think it would be even worse if it was not for Julio. In any case, this is definitely a movie that you will never understand if you are not from Argentina, and even if you are, I advise you not to rent this movie to spend a nice time with your girlfriend, boyfriend, family or friends ... it is really depressing and incredibly slow, and the plot does not make much sense. Probably the director wanted to show the fragility of human life, but what he does bores and delights the audience with scenes that shock you a bit. It makes you think, but not in a good way. Overall, I definitely did not like this movie.
