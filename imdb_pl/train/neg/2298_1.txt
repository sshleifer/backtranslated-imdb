Here are some examples of Pat Robertsons, who dubiously claimed he has relatively good results in forecasts. <br /> <br /> In his widely commented comments from the 2nd of January on the 700 Broadcasting Network, in which he predicted that "very serious terrorist attacks" and "mass murders" in the United States in the "second half" of 2007, host Pat Robertson boasted that he had "relatively good results" in earlier predictions. However, a review of Robertson's 2006 New Year forecast undermines this claim. He predicted for example that: <br /> <br /> * "President Bush will strengthen himself."

He said that the proposals for reforming the social security system will be approved INCORRECT YET! <br /> <br /> He claims he is talking directly to God ... So if God has enough sense of humor, watching Pat make a fool of himself ...
