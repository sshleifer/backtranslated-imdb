I can not really say anything bad * or * about this thing. His characters are quite nice, they can be produced and designed and look professional (except for this bad monster costume). However, there is no originality, ideas or anything you have not seen in ALIEN, PREDATOR, ARMAGEDDON and / or OUTLAND. It's just another formula, cookie-cutter, "dirty corporate drones in space compared to an unstoppable monster." It's a waste of time.
