I just got back from this free show, and this "Osama Witch Project" is the worst movie I've seen this year, worse than even a "Catwoman" - who had the decency to at least consider himself a fiction. <br /> <br /> In "September Tapes", "film crew" of "documentary journalists" he goes to Afghanistan - although he is completely unprepared for travel, conditions and, oh yes, psychotic and funny vendetta their leader filmmaker who will avenge his wife's death on September 11 - to track Osama bin Laden. <br /> <br /> "They made" eight tapes during their journey, which now "document" their journeys and, of course, try to kill the terrorist leader. (Fortunately, eight tapes end in points of importance in the narration, which is convenient for a "document.") <br /> <br /> Psychotic, idiotic hero - who was given long, meaningful speeches, which he probably learned to watch "MacGyver" "- he does not care about his life or the life of his innocent crew, because the series of completely silly mishaps is becoming more and more threatening to them. I do not know why he just did not wear a mark on his back that said, "Shoot me." <br /> <br /> The crew translator, presumably their reasonable voice, does little more than moan and embarrass when an idiot leads them to destruction. <br /> <br /> You want them to take someone on a trip with you to call all morons. <br /> <br /> Around "Tape 4", I started cheering the terrorists to shoot the film crew.
