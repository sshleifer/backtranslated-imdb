In 2004, I liked it. Then it became very stupid. This suggests that children are miserable. It offends children. Cartoon Network was once great. One of the shows I liked was Hamtaro. He managed to be interesting and inventive in the approach to children's programming. The presentation (Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends) is like placing 20 tablespoons of sugar in Sprite. It seems that today's TV producers are interested in making money, instead of engaging the imagination of children and making money! Recently, my children tune in to old programs (60's) to find something interesting to watch. Perhaps, in the absence of originality, television looked into the past and processed programming of children from old times.
