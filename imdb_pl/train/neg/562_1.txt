I like musicals, but as a fan of Dickens I hate that. ** MILD SPOILERS ** Starving boys who have enough energy to sing and dance in the workshop? The poor in London are coming out to sing? Fagin and Dodger going to the sunset? Not entirely faithful to the novel. As I recall, Dodger was hanged in public, and Fagin went crazy in prison. ** END OF SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Oliver Reed is very weak as Sykes, doing little more than growling to show his evil. The worst, however, is Mark Lester as Oliver, who often finds such awkwardness and passivity that you wonder if he really is the main character. His portrait is in no way supported by the fact that the best they can do when singing is dub in the girl's voice. They think they did not realize that boys' fights can be found in almost every church in England. <br /> <br /> Self-respecting fans of Dickens: stick to an amazing David Lean movie from 1948 or a 6-hour BBC adaptation from the mid-80's. Avoid this bloated whitewashing of the musical.
