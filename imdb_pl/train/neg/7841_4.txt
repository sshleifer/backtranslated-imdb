I really liked A Man Called Horse when it was released in 1970, but Return played like a typical sequel. Everything about it - budget, script, plot, casting and acting - was worse than the original. Gale Sondergaard as Elk Woman, the older of the Yellow Hand tribe, does not look like an Indian, or half the other "Indians" played by Italians, Mexicans and Hispanics with cheap wigs. And the old guy who played the chief, he was more like a fat old squaw than a fierce warrior leader. He even used the bow like a woman! Finally, Richard Harris, who did such a great job in the original, seems to run this time. I think that he could not resist the easy payment he got for rebirth of his horse role. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there are some interesting moments in the movie, such as a horse undergoing a painful cleansing ritual to find his vision "and gather Yellow Hands against their Indian enemies and white persecutors, but in general, Return is uneven , boring, trivial and predictable - like most sequels.
