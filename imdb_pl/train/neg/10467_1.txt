If there ever was a call to make a bad movie that would reflect how stupid humanity could happen, this movie would take away the prize. The plot focuses on biblical prophecies that are hidden in the hidden scriptures that lead a group of power-seeking thugs to take total control of the world. How stupid is this writer that people really are? <br /> <br /> Acting was bad at best. Casper Van Dien has wasted his talent by making this film. The work of Michael York suited the role well because it was the center of the film and did a good job. <br /> <br /> This thread was nauseous and very disturbing. No delicate or immature mind should watch this movie. This is how the basic good versus evil can go astray. <br /> <br /> There must be many mental diseases floating in the film circles who are looking for ways to sell this type of garbage. There had to be something censored to get the PG-13 score, but it was still awful.
