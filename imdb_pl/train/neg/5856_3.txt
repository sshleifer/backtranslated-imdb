T. Rama Rao made extremely beautiful films in the 1980s, but he seems to be a filmmaker who can not see in changing times, styles and fashion. He is stuck in the same old-fashioned movie style. <br /> <br /> The actors are not bad either, they are not good. Anil Kapoor generally works convincingly in the two roles of father and son, but a faulty script often makes him look funny and miserable. Rekha is good, but then - it is always good, and here is nothing more. She uses what's given her best, but she always does. In summary, no big deal. Raveena is fine, which means ordinary, not bad, not good, nothing. <br /> <br /> This movie is melodramatic, sometimes stupid. Maybe this video is delayed? Well, even then it will still be below normal. The script is horrible, the movie is exaggerated and the story is nowhere to be found. It feels like a movie made in the early 90s, but the script makes it look even older, the style resembles a style from the 50s. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend unless you're a big fan of the first actors.
