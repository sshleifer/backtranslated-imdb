I was one of the few non-liberals who came to see Steve's video. It was a great experience ... in propaganda filming and boredom. <br /> <br /> I hoped the film would be a real document of Michael Moore's visit to my local UVSC school, but it turned out to be another liberal effort to overthrow the conservatives and the local religious community. The filmmaker seems self-sufficient to make a document that only reflects his prejudices in matters. <br /> <br /> What's more surprising, you can see all the voices "10", which his family placed there. Did they even see the video? Luckily, Batman, it must be ranked among the People of the President! Their grades are as obvious as the bias in this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, like making votes in IMDb will help you lame a movie. Maybe my voice will help balance it.
