Despite the title (English), it seems that it has little to do with the Devils and much more to deal with the power-hungry ruler who is looking for the Philosophers' Stone and wants gold from lead (and blood of the virgin). Jacinto Molina plays Gilles de Lancre and there seems to be no problem with killing people when he thinks they threaten his position or when he needs virgins for blood. Essentially, he is attacked by his love and the alchemist he hired, and it is more greed and madness that seems to be his problem rather than demonic possession (unfortunately). There are parts that are at least somewhat exciting, like skirmishes and adult men who try to knock down big sticks, and the film looks good at least, but there is not much to say. A bit off the beaten track and nothing to be afraid of, and the most unusual, as for the film Molina / Naschy, and not any unintentional humor. Therefore, 4 out of 10.
