Somewhere deep buried in this film is a half-decent film trying to get out. The only traces are a few early scenes in Los Angeles (at the bar and in the cemetery), followed by several production projects. As I say, buried very deeply. One of the biggest challenges facing films with supernatural phenomena is the way characters react reliably in unbelievable situations. Annie Mcenroe's reaction to being told that her sister (probably Dee Wallace from the first movie) is (was?) A werewolf, is, if I recall, pattern; "Really?". Not one of the better answers to this challenge. The non sequitirs continue when history moves to Trannsylvania in search of Stirby (apparently self-proclaimed) "Werewolf Queen". Like Stirba, Sybil Danning is the two best things in the movie. Yes, even better than the werewolf group sex scene, acting Reba Brown and weird looking werewolf suits. Endpoints have the status of a legend and are available in all its glory (at least until censorship finds them) on Youtube. Check them out to see why and remember, the whole movie has about the same sense. If you happen to catch this on American television, the subtitles have been re-written to replace the endless repetition of Danning's shot breaking her top with another, infinitely repeated shot, from which she was tearing the coat only this time that she has some top down. This is a kind of absurdity, a moment at the top that defies the satire.
