I just saw it yesterday at the Sao Paulo Intl Film Festival. Just before leaving, I came here to see how it was rated, and then it was 7.4, quite a good pace ... <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes I was dying to leave (I never did), but I felt embarrassed because the film producer was at the show. <br /> <br /> I did not like it at all, the dialogues are shallow and nowhere run, characters are shallower than dialogues, nothing to lead everywhere, and the worst and worst: lots of Siemens and Organics advertisements on film. Despite the fact that I already paid for going to the movie and having fun, I still have to be bombarded by the main character who is talking on the Internet, and the Siemens cellular phone appears all the time on her lap; or another character having a bath or cutting hair just so that the Organics shampoo is displayed immensely on the screen! All this would be bearable if the plot, characters, romances, whatever was good, but it was bad, really bad! "I do not know how to do sex in the city. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time or money.
