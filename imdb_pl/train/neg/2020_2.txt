It seems that these are two films: one gloomy, pretentious, long saga about an actor who takes over the parts he plays; the second is a great social commentary on a middle-aged divorce, which is picked up by the waitress. Shelley Winters is wonderful as a waitress with another company on the side. Leaving heavy tips on the need to make calls, massage certificate and the desire to enter the game modeling. I love the glimpses of her dingy apartment with a kitchenette behind the curtain and her terrible seductive outfit revealing crochet navels with sleeves. <br /> <br /> Do the actors get Oscars for Shakespeare? We know their Oscars for impersonating people with disabilities, wearing many dentures or pretending to be crazy. Shakespeare scenes (which turn on and off) are embarrassing and obsolete. Like "crazy" scenes in which Tony looks distracted, listening to his own voice. <br /> <br /> By the way, Anthony John is not aristocratic. He makes it quite clear on the early stage that he was a choir boy. When he quotes his father's advice, he falls into Cockney's accent.
