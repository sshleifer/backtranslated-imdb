He follows the usual formula of introducing a new recruit - this time the first African American (Kuba Gooding) after President Truman removes the segregation of armed forces - through the US Navy deep-sea diver training program, led by a racist fanatic (Robert De Niro). If the program was not bad enough, it must be located in Bayonne, New Jersey. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with the performances. Robert De Niro activates his southern accent and effectively screams gibberish. Kuba Gooding, raised by a strict father as a poor black farmer in the south, is an expected model of righteousness. Girls - hard to call women - are Charleze Theron and Lonette McKee. They have minor roles and usually claim that their men should keep common sense. Other decent performers - Powers Boothe and Hal Holbrook - have even more casual roles. <br /> <br /> That's it. Almost everything else could be assembled by a computer. The ship is called a boat. Robert De Niro salutes at home, outdoor. After a brutal attack on the hospital staff, he was transferred from his outfit instead of being caught. In the early 1950s, someone was shouting "I am here." (Maybe then it was a common expression. If so, "my bad".) People turn to each other according to rank - "Lieutenant", "Boatswain colleague", "Commander", as in the army, while in the Navy are simple "Misterami" (if an officer) or recipients are their surnames (if they are taken). I did not bother to check if in 1950 He was a senior called "Senior Master Chief." <br /> <br /> Kuba Gooding has a difficult government. Looks like everyone in the navy hates blacks, except one guy from Wisconsin. He is eating and being despised by others in his class. This is like a scene in the "Animal House" in which the applicant, up to a ton of fraternios, is asked to wait in a room with Sikh, a black man and a blind child. <br /> <br /> Gooding is a married man, a second-class non-commissioned officer. He manages to marry a beautiful woman who has just graduated from a medical school. In one of his arguments, he begs him. He just wants to become a doctor, and he should join her, leave the navy and lead a peaceful life. "And just let life go past you?", He answers. Yes. Yes, be the husband's wife and let life pass you. You can wave to him from the golf course in Boca Raton. <br /> <br /> These kinds of films were quite common during World War II. Bombardier, Airial Gunner, that kind of thing. Cheap, as it often did, had some educational features. You've learned something about becoming a bombardier or rifleman. Here the technical details are skipped, perhaps because the writer knew nothing about them (except Boyle's law, which we learned in secondary school chemistry). <br /> <br /> I could not follow what happened during emergency situations, without which such a movie would not exist. If I have problems with mechanics, it's because I guessed correctly. The direction does not help either. The film abounds in rapprochement, so much that they lose the dramatic impact they could have. And emergency situations are misleading because they are misdirected. <br /> <br /> Why next? Want to see a better example of this type of film? Almost everyone will do - except maybe "G. I. Jane ", in which the hero is abused heroin. Try the scene of the training camp in "The Young Lions". There the victim is a Jew. Or try "From Here to Eternity" in which you do not push easy buttons of sympathy, and the victim is an adult male who does not want to bend and actively introduces a conflict, just like "Cool Hand Luke". There are no easy excuses because easy excuses are too easy. <br /> <br /> Accurately formulated and not very good.
