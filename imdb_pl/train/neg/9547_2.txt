Below, the average-looking video game transforms into a conspiracy to find another terrorist in the US yard. Welcome to the madness of cheap movies directly to movies. It is full of nameless actors and actresses with a small, valuable plot. <br /> <br /> In any case, this strange game goes on, and our "hero" bets real money and does it well. It's kind of like gambling, except that some gambling has disappeared and sucks. Instead, it's an online game with little real value, and if you do well, you'll get power on your tail. <br /> <br /> What's even weird is that two strange computer programs are struggling somehow with it and everything is saved end. I will leave the viewer to see how it all happens. <br /> <br /> In general, it is not even worth renting 1 USD. Borrow him, please. "RE-"
