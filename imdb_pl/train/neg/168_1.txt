Despite the decent first season, this series has never been close to its potential. As a prequel to the original series, "Star Trek" was condemned almost from the beginning by executive producer Rick Berman, who felt compelled to artificially limit and limit the definition of what the "Star Trek" series might be. This futuristic show is increasingly anachronistic from a dramatic point of view ). The actual show-runner, Brannon Braga, did not help through his uninteresting and tired reworking of previous episodes of Trek and recklessly disregarding the franchise's internal mythology (it was painfully obvious at first that he was only paying for it). I have never seen a series that has so consistently harmed the cast of talented actors (with the exception of Jolene Blaylock), which has lasted so long. It is as if the whole series was created in a bubble existing outside the contemporary television landscape, where the audience (even Trekker's audience) is more demanding and sophisticated in their dramatic desires and desires. Unfortunately, it looks like Berman and Braga have managed to convince higher positions at Paramount that "Enterprise" suffered from "franchise fatigue" and that its indigenous audience did not leave, but was pushed aside. Create a high-quality offer that meets the highest ideals and standards of its predecessors, and they (the audience) will come. <br /> <br /> Simply put, in the TeeVee universe, where we receive programs such as "Battlestar: Galactica" and "The Shield" are the powers that must give the viewers "Star Trek", which is measured and is dramatically competitive. It is so easy and easy.
