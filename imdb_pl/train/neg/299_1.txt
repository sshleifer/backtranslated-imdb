It was the third remake of SLEEPING WITH THE ENIEMY Po YAARANIE (1995) and AGNISAKSHI (1996) <br /> <br /> AGNISAKSHI was the only one who worked and was a better movie. DARAAR is directed by Abbas Mustana , which unfortunately did not succeed in this attempt <br /> <br /> the story was good, but the lead was not so good, and the heroine was too regressive, and the culmination was also disappointing. <br /> <br /> The direction is bad Music is good <br /> <br /> Rishi returns to the role of YAARANA (which is strange, which was also a SWTE remake) and looks too thick for the lead and is okay Juhi is decent, while Arbaaz is trying too hard to his debut and coped in many scenes to freeze the audience, but his voice was terrible Johny is too loud
