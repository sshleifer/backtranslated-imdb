Three Stooges - Have Rocket, Will Travel - 1959 This was the first full-length movie in which Stooges performed and he is quite bad. It makes THREE LOOKS STAY IN THE WORLD IN DAZE (from 1963) they look like a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Stooge are janitors at the place of the rockets. They go rocket and go to Venus. They meet some things there, including the talking unicorn they call the "Uni" they brought with them to Earth. "Uni" says like the average, nice person - "Oh, hello. How do you do? Lovely planet here. I hope you will like it.' Hilarious. <br /> <br /> Very few gags and so many scenes just last and last. <br /> <br /> Stooge are coming back from space, and the film ends with the story going on, but no one has said that the filmmakers are going on for another 10 minutes at an event where nothing happens. The Stooges leave the party, and then the movie almost ends. <br /> <br /> The climax of the movie - the end in which Stooges sing an elegant song about their journey. Larry and Curly Joe hit Moe in the face with two cakes. Brute. <br /> <br /> Another writer mentioned a great musical score. What? The only music I even noticed were two classic melodies - I'LL TAKE ROMANCE and AGAIN WE ARE SONG, both played at the party. And * this * really is the highlight of the picture - music from old Columbia films. <br /> <br /> The tall sexy blonde was nice. <br /> <br /> Awful - a brand new VHS movie with a 99 cents shop only.
