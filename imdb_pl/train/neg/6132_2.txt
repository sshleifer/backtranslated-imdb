As children, me and my friends believed that Gymkata is the most brutal, bloody film ever made. I'm not sure who started this rumor. Probably born of the frustration of 10-year-olds who were not allowed to see it for another reason. Years after the premiere, Gymkaty became an eternal cable film of late night, and as a result, I managed to make up for the lost time. I had to see scenes from this terrible justification for the movie several times and I can always see it from 1-2 seconds of time on the screen. However, apart from a forced combination of gymnastics and martial arts, bad dubbing, stiff dialogue and a scandalously difficult plot, the film has many things to it. With all that is bad in the movie, the sound is really funny. Never before has a punch or kick been landed with such a small force and loudness! Kung-fu sounds in cans are brazen, but the slow and resounding music and almost 5-minute slow-motion scene are really strange. The pursuit of a crazed, hungry peasant's blood is not as tense or annoying as it is, and there are enough bad wigs and extras that all look at the camera and wave to make the wreck a little fun. Can it aim for the status of iconic classics? Where is MST3K when we need it?
