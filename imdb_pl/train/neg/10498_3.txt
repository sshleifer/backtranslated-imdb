I caught it at the trial show. I can only say: what ... hell? This movie is played as smoothly as Mickey Mouse reading the script for "Scarface". It's strange, but it does not make any sense; and even if you leave your brain in the car, the movie is still so bizarre that it's not even fun. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a crocodile hunter Steve Irwin, who is trying to "save" a crocodile that contains a CIA probe. CIA comes to Irwin to recover his probe, Irwin makes mistakes against poachers and sets off to "stop" them. <br /> <br /> It's all about history; the rest is a scuffle of Australian culture ("Didja see dat?" and "Crikey!") and strangely choreographic sequences of action. At one point, Irwin assembles a speeding RV, and the knife fights a CIA agent. Yes, that's right: Steve Irwin's knife fights a guy at the top of the RV. Let this be your guide to this ridiculously bad movie.
