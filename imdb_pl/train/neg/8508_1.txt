It was a terribly bad movie. Your heart will be gone when you watch. I am begging you: do not watch this movie! You hate you, losing 1.5 hours of your life! It's not that some movies are so bad that you can watch them and enjoy ... this movie is boring like ... there is nothing as boring as this movie. You hate yourself after watching this movie to the end. And you hate yourself for not listening to me. <br /> <br /> I hate myself. I tortured myself and watched the movie to the end. I'm sorry, I'll shoot myself. I saw everything. <br /> <br /> Please. Read this very carefully. Do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Please!
