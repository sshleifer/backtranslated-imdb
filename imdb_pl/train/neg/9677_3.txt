somewhere I read that this movie is supposed to be a comedy. after seeing this, I would call it nothing else. the point of this film escapes me. the dialogue is extremely superficial and absurd, many sets seemed to be a reflection, and despite all the nudity and alleged sexual content, there is nothing erotic in this film ... all this leaves me to wonder what the heck is about! the title premise could be the basis of a funny (if politically incorrect) comedy. instead, we treat cheap, amateur, unfinished sketches and depravity and weirdness for ourselves. if that's what I want, I'll go and buy the favors of jones cd.
