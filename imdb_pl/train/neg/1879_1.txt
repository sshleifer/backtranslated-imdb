It is hard to believe that this is a continuation of Henry Fool. It's hard to believe that the same director and actors were involved in both films. While Henry Fool is refreshing, witty, comic, Fay Grim is slow, boring and does not go anywhere. Where did the joke go? I am amazed. <br /> <br /> It's been 10 years since I saw Henry Fool and many of his dialogues and scenes are still alive in my memory. Fay Grim is painful to watch. It's not the fault of actors who are good (Parker Posey) or great (Jeff Goldblum) - the fault lies solely in the plot, dialogue and even some films (low budget is not an excuse). A huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I could not pay attention to the story, I was so bored, so disappointed ... if you liked this movie, maybe you will not like Henry Fool so much ... two movies have absolutely nothing to do with each other ... there is no continuity in the characters' personalities ... it's a scam to encourage Henry Fool fans to watch the sequel. <br /> <br /> I'm turning it off now - Henry in some kind of prison with the Taliban?!?!
