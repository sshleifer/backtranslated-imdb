In 1967, mine workers find the remains of the ancient disappeared civilization of Abkani, who believes that there are worlds of light and darkness. When they opened the gate between these worlds ten thousand years ago, something bad got through before closing the gate. Twenty-two years ago, Office 713 of the Governmental Paranormal Research Agency was headed by Professor Lionel Hudgens (Matthew Walker) who conducted experiments with orphan children. Nowadays, one of these children is the paranormal investigator Edward Carnby (Christian Slater), who just got the Abkani artifact in South America and is being hunted by a man with abilities. When an old foster friend disappears in the middle of the night, he reveals that the demons are returning to Earth. With the support of anthropologist Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid) and Office Leader 713, Cmdr. Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff) and his team are fighting against the evil creatures. <br /> <br /> Despite the charismatic cast of Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, Dark "never works and is a complete mess, without the development of a character or story.

In addition, its target target group was people between the ages of twelve and twenty-five. I am sorry, but I find both statements disrespectful for younger generations. I have a daughter and a son and I know many of their friends and they are not the type of stupid stereotype that the director says. In addition, IMDb provides excellent statistics to show that Mr. Uwe Boll is completely wrong. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Alone in the Dark ??
