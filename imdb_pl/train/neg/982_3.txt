The real star of this funny story is the wonderful technicolor. A visual feast for the eye, the film does not stimulate the mind and heart. At first I was intrigued by the idea that Dietrich and Boyer would leave religion to "find" their ability to love. What follows is a huge disappointment. Boyer is the only real actor in production and feels his passion. Dietrich's amazing wardrobe overshadows her performances - sometimes her face scares to look at her - a mask that is not sensitive. As a monk, Boyer kept the formula of the monastery liqueur (which reminds me of the true story of Chartreuse) - when he leaves his "marriage with God", his monks' reaction evokes shock and fear, which perpetuates organized religion. The viewer thinks that Boyer got rid of the past. However, the journey that follows is too predictable.
