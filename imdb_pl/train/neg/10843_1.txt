It could have been done for hell, but it was probably the worst movie I've seen in years. I'm surprised that people have taken the time to do something so ridiculous, and at the same time spend money on it, I'm glad I just hired. I suppose the real fans of this movie would probably have to be sadistic and gothic to worry about it, not taking into account any CGI or any other effects, I hope Alex Chandon will learn a lesson about lighting and SFX to make a better movie of the future, I mean, if it's still working. <br /> <br /> Comments for buyers are very disappointing, DO NOT BUY!
