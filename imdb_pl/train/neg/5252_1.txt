I have read some comments on the Internet about this movie: "... harder than Hostel ...", "the camera never displays when it gets really rough ..." But none of them is real. The camera never displays the screen because there is nothing to display. The same scene repeats itself hundreds of times. Women lie on the table, the killer rapes the woman several times, the killer cuts women into pieces (you can never see it during the whole movie!). The police come and arrest him. The killer cheats the jury. Shoot. In Germany, we would say: "Viel LÃ¤rm um Nichts". In total one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Absolutely not recommended.
