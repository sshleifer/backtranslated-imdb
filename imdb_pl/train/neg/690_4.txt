If you've ever seen someone in the eighties, there's no reason to see it. Originality is often not one of the strong points of cinema, and something is seriously lacking in this film. You can not really say much about Pranks, so I'll do it quickly. The film was one of the 74 films on the DPP Video Nasty list, and that was my only reason to see it. The story follows a group of children who stay in the dorm during Christmas. When they are in the cut, someone decides to pick them up, and this leads to one of the stupidest secrets I've ever seen in a slass movie. The fact that this movie was on the Nasty video list is strange because despite several bloody scenes, this film will hardly spoil anyone or corrupt, and the bastard fuckers than for example (Friday 13) for example, Forbidden. But on the other hand, movies that are much less bloody than this (for example, the Witch who came from the sea) are forbidden. Either way, ending the movie is the best thing because the audience really does not care who the attacker is; it's rather well done. In general, it is a grim and gloomy slasher that even slasher fans will do well if they miss.
