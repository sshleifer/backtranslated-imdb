He has his merits; Morvern Callar is both advantages and disappointments. It's so mysterious, so original. Is this her method of dealing with lost pain, which makes her so far away and unbelievable? Or is she one of the reviewers who calls her a revolutionary? Personally, I would call it dysfunctional. <br /> <br /> Morvern breaks off completely. Getting rid of her boyfriend, not thinking about informing her family or using the money he gave her for the proper funeral, selfishly splatter when traveling to Spain. It seems to be so devoid of anything that is human greed. The only element that allows the audience to see her human side is her close friend who takes her on holiday. Although at the end her friend is abandoned, and Morvern has nothing to bind her to humanity. She might as well have killed herself. <br /> <br /> Although Spain has managed to look as gloomy and blandish as in the UK, the director's pictures were great, the lighting and color made the film stunning. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the film has nothing that interests him. It's just over 90 minutes, but it feels much longer. They manage to make Morvern seem interesting to attract your attention, but do not do anything with her, just make her more discouraged that you do not care about the characters or the movie.
