Quite an interesting exploit movie in black and white written by David F. Friedman. The main actress Stacey Walker is well-mannered and strangely attractive. It resembles a mad Renee Zellweger with a bad haircut. This chick only made two of these films and then returned to Texas. Music is terrible. One of her boys plays Sam Melville (from the TV show THE ROOKIES) under a different name. <br /> <br /> The best line in the movie from Tony - "Do you put me in, doll? the chicks founded me. " Good B / W cinematography from Laslo Kovacs (EASY RIDER & TARGETS and many more). Good locations (nice pool, also used in THE DEFILERS). Strange ending, but matching. 4 out of 10. The best performance of Stacey Walker.
