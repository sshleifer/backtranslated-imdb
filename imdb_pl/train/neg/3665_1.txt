Apparently this happens when the director allows his 14-year-old nephew to rewrite the dialogue on the set while in the meantime he indulges in alcohol; as I said earlier, although I always wanted to catch one of the images of the werewolf Paul Naschy, this cruelty served as my introduction and, although it is certainly horrible, I still intend to pursue other items in the series, albeit very gradually. <br /> <br /> Despite some disappointments at a high level, such as THE HOWLING by Joe Dante (1981), I love the photos of werewolves in general, but to be honest, I quickly lost interest in the story and just stood there looking at my television screen counting his absurdities. There were far too many of them to mention, but I must say that the two schizophrenic features of Werewolf's personality were especially striking to me (ie. The transition from a raging beast in one shot to the dazed zombie state in the next - as if it were informal walk at midnight in the village and had a completely different wardrobe to boot ... and yes, I knew the reasons for it earlier), and also the "Phantom of the Opera" look of Wolfstein's character! But what do I know - perhaps the elusive version of this mess could be a classic horror story in good faith!
