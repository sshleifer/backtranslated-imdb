This movie has a poor storyline, poor characteristics and really poor special effects that question why I lost my precious life by watching them. He has random characters that bring nothing to history and seem to be an excuse for the director to get a girl to the film. Robots are sad, and the main "hero" bot is turned on by a huge knife switch. If this movie was not so bad, it would be funny, but there is nothing funny about it. The main antagonist is one of the only redeeming figures and is killed. It's sad when you eradicate a bad guy because he's the best to cheer on. When everything was said and done, the film was better left on the floor of the cutting room or never financed at all.
