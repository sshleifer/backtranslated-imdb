This nasty movie was initially banned in the UK and allowed in November without cuts. <br /> <br /> It contains Playboy Playmate of the Month October 1979, Ursula Buchfellner. The opening stretches back and forth between Buchfellner and foggy jungle photos. I'm not sure what the purpose was. It would be better to focus on the bathtub scene. <br /> <br /> Laura (Buchfellner) is kidnapped and held in the jungle for ransom. Peter (Al Cliver - The Beyond, Zombie) is sent to find her and ransom. Of course, one of the hijackers (Antonio de Cabo) manages to spend time productively, while another (Werner Pochath) moans constantly. <br /> <br /> The exchange of the ransom goes to hell, and Laura falls into the jungle. Will Peter save her before cannibals eat a meal? Oh, yes, there are cannibals in this jungle. Why do you think it was a nasty movie! Muriel Montossé is found by Peter and his partner (Antonio Mayans - Angel of Death) on the abductor's boat. Montossé is very easily dismantled. Peter leaves them and goes alone to find Laura, who has already been caught. They have time for sex and they do not see impending danger. Someone? A great fight between Piotr and the naked devil (Burt Altman). <br /> <br /> Blood, beheading, guts, lots of full frontals, big snakes through a cannibal priestess (Aline Mess) and the poem "They torn her heart", which is fun if you see a movie.
