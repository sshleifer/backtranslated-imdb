Well then. I just watched a lot of movies - all with varying degrees of quality. I was not too sure which one I would like to see first. Then it struck me like a rat sack: Rodentz. Warn people against Rodentz. This monstrosity does not play anyone and is painfully boring. And it's about mutant rats killing people. Yes ... a real crazy original. "Food of the Gods" or "Willard" someone? It was better than this, and it does not say much ... <br /> <br /> ** POSSIBLE SPOILER ** Okay, here's the story: the lab The other scientist and his lethargic assistant are experimenting on rats and their lab is in the shit neighborhood and shitty building, and moron friends of moronic assistants appear drunk and all become food for crazed rats and almost everyone is dying, and yes, there is one giant rat that looks like shit but is killed, the end. There, all in one sentence! Spoiler, you say? Ppfff !! I beg to differ! Second, we all realize that there is a giant rat, we all know that eventually he will die !! ** KONIEC SPOILERA ** <br /> <br /> Here is the division: <br /> <br /> Okay: <br /> <br /> - Well, I watched it for free, but for everyone else ... hmmm, no. There is nothing good here. <br /> <br /> Does not hurt him, does not help: <br /> <br /> - Um ... well. the blood was decent. - Very average photos. <br /> <br /> - CG rats are not as bad as they could have been in some shots ... <br /> <br /> Bad: <br /> <br /> - .... In other shots, CG rats were woefully inexpensive. Look, if your movie has a low budget, maybe you should not rely on CG. Lesson to heart. <br /> <br /> - Acting is very weak. <br /> <br /> - Characters are uninteresting - we have a pinch of stereotypes and none of them is so well done. <br /> <br /> --Booooooooooooring. <br /> <br /> - Earlier - many times. <br /> <br /> - Stupid story, just stupid. <br /> <br /> - A giant rat looks like a fat man in a bad bear costume - it was quite funny - but not quite fun to give this movie any value. <br /> <br /> - Another unrealistic and boring dialogue. <br /> <br /> - All students of rats drink tequila from huge plastic milk jugs - yet they do not seem to be drunk for more than a few seconds. A way to maintain continuity, guys. <br /> <br /> Brzydcy: <br /> <br /> - This movie is bad. Just horrible. Worse than you can imagine. It is not even ridiculously bad, like "Scarecrow" (2002) or "House of the Dead". Now these movies are nonsense that you can enjoy. Even if they make you stupid. <br /> <br /> Unforgettable scene: <br /> <br /> - A lame ending of the action movie, along with unmoved heroes and an explosion. Because I did not feel like the rest of this monstrosity - but it still sucks. <br /> <br /> Acting: 2/10 History: 1/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Cinematography: 4/10 Character development: 0/10 Special effects / Makeup: 4/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 1/10 ( from time to time I took care of my son during the movie, so I could miss him, but apparently I was there) Przemoc / Gore: 4/10 Dialogue: 2/10 Music: 1/10 (on average) Writing: 1/10 Direction: 2/10 <br /> <br /> Serinity: 7/10 Biting: 9/10 <br /> <br /> In general: 1/10 <br /> <br /> Watch only if you like horror movies based on rats and vermin. Wait ... Check it out. Do not watch this. It's shit. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
