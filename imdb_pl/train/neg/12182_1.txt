Where should I start? I think it's very offensive to Annie from Aileen Quimnn. I love Annie's movie and I expected it to be a brilliant movie, but I was very disappointed! acting is terrible, original Annie left a few years before my birth, I'm 25 now, and Annie is still one of my favorite movies, so I was really excited to see Annie 2. Acting was terrible, was any of the characters original? very badly written, directed and acted. This is not a movie that I would like to see again, and every fan of Annie recommend that you do not watch this movie, because it will leave you very disappointed. Singing young girls is not bad, but still does not match the original
