When I was a kid and lived with my sister, she bought every horror she could find, and that was one of them. VCRs have just become the subject of the household, and we did not have only about 150 movies and we watched them all from hell. <br /> <br /> I used to be selling a shipyard and I saw a VHS copy of BLOOD LEGACY and I am buying any horror film I do not have and I knew that this movie looks familiar. For a moment I thought and realized that it was the one my sister bought. She sold it years ago for sale in the yard I'm guessing - who knows. <br /> <br /> I did not remember anything about it at all and watched it at night when I bought it and it refreshed my memory because several scenes. I'm not sure how I felt about it as a child, but I'm sure that I liked it because it was new to me and then I watched and enjoyed something. <br /> <br /> I am a freak of horror, but there are certain requirements that I could consider it "good", and this one was very short. It was one of those talking talks and boring me to death. What death scenes you see are done using a shadow on the wall, followed by blood splatter, and if you're lucky, then you have so much. <br /> <br /> The story is good and I have seen a few with similar threads, so I think this one should be buried and forgotten. Do not watch these people unless you're tough.
