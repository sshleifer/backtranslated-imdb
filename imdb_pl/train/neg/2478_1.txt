This movie is S-L-O-W. Most of the film actually waited until it "started". <br /> <br /> The setting was grim, the script was bleak, the pictures were bleak, the plot was bleak, the budget was low (not all low-budget movies are bad, but this one did not have a redemption function). <br /> <br /> The plot was more absorbed by the vengeful, slightly mad hunter than the real Wendigo, who appeared very shortly at the end of the film. That alone was disappointing because "Wendigo" was just a weird mix of tree and deer. Everything in the film was uninspiring. <br /> <br /> The parents of the little boy seemed rather reserved and sometimes seemed completely detached from their son. I am not sure if it resulted from bad actions or bad scenario, but it only increased my disappointment and boredom level. <br /> <br /> There was nothing to think about, nothing aroused interest. Without real intrigue or cold, this movie creaked so much that you did not care what happened at the end. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere of Wendigo reminds me of the boring movie shown at the award ceremony the end of "Mr Bean's Holiday": a film that is artistic and nonsensical, too difficult to be deep and meaningful, but proves to be pretentious and boring. <br /> <br /> I would never like to see it again. I only watched it in the vain hope that something interesting might happen ... but it did not happen.
