First, let me be honest. I did not watch the whole movie. I watched the first five minutes and when I realized I was almost asleep, I decided that I might as well move forward and see if later it would become more interesting ... No. This film is simply a collection of lame attempts to create a story that is already uninteresting and badly told in something that will never happen: a decent horror movie. Because I think it's important to say that even a movie with weak special effects can still be good if it's well made. This movie is not and will only lead you into a deep sleep if you try to watch it. Finally, I think it's important to say that I think this movie is in the public, so if you think you have to watch it, not a small search on the Internet, it will definitely show you a place where you will not have to pay to watch this pile of cinematographic dung.
