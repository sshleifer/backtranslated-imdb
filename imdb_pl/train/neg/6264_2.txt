Nightmare Weekend is proof that some people are so desperate to be "in movies" that they are ready to do almost anything. <br /> <br /> I do not mean countless women who seem to be quite happy, that they appear completely surprising in this terrible piece of garbage (after all, the naked female form is a beautiful thing and there is nothing to be ashamed of). No ... I am talking about those who are more than willing to cooperate with a badly made puppet called George. Now it is embarrassing! <br /> <br /> Bioelectronics created by the brilliant scientist Edward Hamul (Wellington Meffert), George (who looks like a mad clown with green wool on her hair) is an artificially intelligent interface for an advanced computer system that supports a revolutionary device (silver sphere size golf ball) that can reverse the form's disorder after ingestion. <br /> <br /> Experiments changing Edward's personality have been successful in the laboratory animals, but a cautious scientist reluctantly carries out tests on humans, fearing that side effects may still occur. However, his evil assistant Julie (Debbie Laster) does not have such scruples and uses three beautiful young women as guinea pigs. Inevitably, they all turn into hideous deadly mutants. <br /> <br /> With occasional special effects in the basement, cast completely devoid of talent and story, which you can hardly follow (I took notes when I watched the movie, and even then I'm not completely convinced that my summary is accurate) Nightmare Weekend is a complete and complete disaster that can not be saved by even a few soft sex scenes and a bit of gore. <br /> <br /> This movie also contains one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen in a horror movie: Tony (Bruce Morton), Walkman in an idiot who rejects nonsense with the music of the '80s in a way that makes I look like Justin Timberlake in comparison.
