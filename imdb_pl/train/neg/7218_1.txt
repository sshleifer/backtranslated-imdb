Near the beginning of the scene after the shooting in which the horses run. If something red catches the eye, it happens because the white van is parked behind the bush by the trail. I thought I saw wrong, but that's it. White van in the west. Did they not catch it? Well, I paid the upper dollar for renting. It will make you want to grab your buddies and make everyone put in 10 songs and make a better movie. The conversation was so slow, the game was mostly OK, but could not be taken seriously because of the bad nature of filming. There are doors in sheriffs that today look like doors with a special finish. I say, watch this movie and move the boy from the cab to number two at the worst.
