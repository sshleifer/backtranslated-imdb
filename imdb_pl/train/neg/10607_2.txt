Jean Claude Van Damme is trying to save his career by creating a sequel of Universal Soldier. But did this movie save him? I think he goes to hell after death. <br /> <br /> In the first minute we see the interior of the object, where you can see the evil guy from the movie. Terrible, eh? But not as scary as acting (details below). <br /> <br /> Then we see Van Damme with a black girl (I do not remember the name ... well, it does not matter anyway), trying to get away from some muscle men. Of course they are new universal soldiers. More muscles, less brain (just like in the movie). After some time, Van Damme fights Goldberg, but then the "mission" is interrupted. It was just a test (is this movie a test for our nerves?). It turns out that Van Damme is working for the government on the new Universal Soldier project (who saw the first movie, may think that this is the most illogical thing you could do the hero Van Dammes). But this is a continuation. And "history" must appear. Ah, I forgot. He has a daughter. Very important for the "story". <br /> <br /> Well, after about 20 minutes a super computer hears a conversation about turning off and finishing the project. Of course, the ankle is angry and activates all soldiers to kill everyone. Van Damme escapes from the object, but the computer sends soldiers hunting for him (he wants Van Damme to be a soldier - because he is the best (really?)). And guess, Goldberg is one of the hunters who has always been stupid to the audience before he was deleted. Funny? Yes, like the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> After some "history" Van Damme tries to save his daughter (his wife - the reporter in the first film). It comes to the last show in which Van Damme fights Bad Guy and you can see the most expensive scene in the whole movie (see for yourself. It's just too funny to say that). <br /> <br /> You will see that this movie is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> So do not watch it. But if you do, keep the six pack with you!
