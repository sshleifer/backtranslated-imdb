Goremeister Herschell Gordon Lewis fans should look elsewhere if they collect this film from their usual buckets of blood that they spill because there is not much to drop blood in this film. Instead, Lewis decides to try to tell a bizarre story, based on special special effects in the budget, which would probably be doubled if the cast ever threw pockets for change. Oddly enough, although cheap and very poorly preserved (especially by McCabe as Mitchell), the total bizarre plot always attracts attention. Imagine what this movie would be like with a decent budget! In general, it fills with the taste of champagne in the beer budget.
