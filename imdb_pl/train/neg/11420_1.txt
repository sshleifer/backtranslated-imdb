Fire of Saint Elma has no influence on life after the university (for most of us ordinary people). Why was this trash done? Who can really involve it? Who lives like these characters? I really feel sorry for the actors who have to deal with such a horrible scenario. In this "film" there are several talented young actors who have done a good job elsewhere. It must have been only a joke on the set for them. <br /> <br /> Actually, the "movie" insulted my intelligence. The only joy I have gained from this is the hope that Sir John Hughes had a good laugh when he saw the show of the same year in which his masterpiece The Breakfast Club was published. the same mistake I watched because you like movies from the 80's. It's really offensive to the genre.
