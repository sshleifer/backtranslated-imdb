this movie had more holes than a piece of Swiss cheese. Ben Affleck was seriously NOT trying to act in any shape or form. He simply sucked. Nothing about the film was reliable. The first problems concerned a situation in which a man gives everything that has the value of Santa's Salvation Army, but does not show why. And then Grandma puts her head into the oven - really beautiful and has nothing to do with the movie - it's not even in the same tone as the movie. There was no explanation of the motivation for which Ben Affleck chose the house he had chosen; there were no reliable reactions from the family he chose; and people are swayed here and there for no reason to rock (example: Christina Applegate and Ben Affleck's characters are sledging along a steep slope - this incident makes him suddenly fall in love with him.) Riiiight ...) event, it was a funny moment or two - but they were rare in the movie. He seriously needed another rewrite (or 4). I hope you like it!
