This is the most saccharin romance I've ever sat in. The perfect movie for an idle housewife in a handkerchief, housedress and high-heeled mules cut into pods, watched in the afternoon, lying on the couch and eating bonbons. In fact, bonbons play a significant role in the film. <br /> <br /> The only reason I could see to the end is the fact that in the end I could look at the dreamy face of Keanu Reeves in almost every scene. In most of his films, he moves too fast to get a good look. The only quick action in this program is Giancarlo Giannini waving his hands with Latin emotionality - more Italian than Mexican. <br /> <br /> The dialog box is stiff as wood. Unfortunately, there are no torn corsets - the hero is shamefully perfect and gentle. The aristocratic family phrase from the old world is as old as the hills. What does it matter if they are Irish, Italian or Mexican? It's a fairy tale. <br /> <br /> I knew before the titles ended, it would not be the movie I was counting on. Glowing grapes looked like the pattern of all food ads in Women's Day Magazine. I did not see his name, but the artistic director was certainly Thomas Kinkade, who paints canvases of Irish homes in millions of dollars in fuchsia. This film was literally seen through pink glasses. If you like dreamy roses and blue sky, this movie is for you! (Bonbons also looked really good!)
