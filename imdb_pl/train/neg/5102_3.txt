Nicole Eggert is on the list of stars, although Micheal Dorn and Stacey Keach are much bigger stars than she is. <br /> <br /> Essentially, this is a bit of filming in the movie "Alien lands on Earth". Eggert plays a girl who feels sorry for someone being hunted by the army and takes a fleeing creature in her very sexy disguise. A little nudity and partial nudity, a senseless sex scene - all this comes along the way. <br /> <br /> The film goes through a few obvious passages and jokes about showing pictures. I really enjoyed the Star Trek jokes when Micheal Dorn was taken over and he got a really cool death scene. <br /> <br /> It was pretty obvious that Stacey Keach would be taken over and the film had a pretty good ending it would be nice to show exactly what talent the alien gave Eggert.
