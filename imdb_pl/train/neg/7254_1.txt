Who ever wrote two or three glowing reviews, or got involved in making this movie, the term used loosely, or in a bank, and if that were the case, I'd like to get back my seven dollars! Actors, again the term used loosely, they are terrible, in fact almost none of them did anything more, which is a relief. Scenery and everything about this scream, we had $ 7 to work and one day to do it. Was it filmed in someone's backyard? Everything about this project says low budget. The best actors are the list D. Do not waste your time unless you want to take it back and try to get your rental back. The main villain looks like this punk from the 70s who married grandma dummee moore. My local hit movie store contains a list of what came back most with a sad comment attached. Even in the case of renting 99 cents, this move collects dust. Someone really must have owed a few favors. This is a super smelly and I give him 10 turds.
