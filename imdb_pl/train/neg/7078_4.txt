This movie could be a decent B movie if 3/4 of the movie did not focus on sex scenes. I mean, he's addicted to sex and I'm sure it's with sex addicts who do not have sex permanently. Michael Des Barres did a good job considering everything he had to do, which was not very much. At one time or another one would have to laugh at him because his character was so pathetic. Nastassja Kinski was fine as an interested sexual therapist, but she could have done more and did not suggest her to have sex. The person who stood out the most in this film was Rosanna Arquette in her convincing role as a loving and disturbed wife. There is something beautiful inside and outside, which draws me very much. She played the role, and when you watched the movie, you start to feel bad for her. <br /> <br /> "Diary Of A Sex Addict", while it is not an Oscar material or a modern classic of anybody's standards, it's quite instructive to do a good job, showing you how personal demons can take control and ruin things, about which you think in life.
