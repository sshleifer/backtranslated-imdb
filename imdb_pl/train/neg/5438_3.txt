I'm a fan of novelist / scriptwriter Michael Chabon. His novel "Wonder Boys" became a fantastic film by Curtis Hanson. His masterful novel "The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay" won the Pulitzer Prize several years ago, and he had his hand in the "Spider Man 2" script, probably the best comic book of all time. <br /> <br /> Director Rawson Marshall Thurber also directed great comedy songs, such as "Dodgeball" and the brilliant series "Terry Tate: Office Linebacker". And with the cast, which includes Peter Saarsgard, Sienna Miller, Nick Nolte and Mena Suvari, it seems that it is thoughtless. <br /> <br /> Yes. Literally. <br /> <br /> Jon Foster stars as Art Bechstein, the son of a gangster (Nolte), who recently graduated in economics. Jon is in arrest: he works at Book Barn on a minimum wage, has a deplorable relationship with his girlfriend / boss, Phlox (Suvari), which is little more than a plentiful amount of sex, with no plans other than to break away from a career in which he does not he has passion. <br /> <br /> One night at a party, a roommate presents Jon Jane (Miller), a beautiful, intelligent violinist. Later that night they go out to the cake and ask Jon for a question that begins to shake him from his catatonic state of existence: "I want you to tell me something you have never said one soul. make this night irremovable. "Jon then repeats her repetitive dream, in which he wanders around the city, looking at the faces of strangers passing by, but none of them looks in his eyes. "I imagine that it must be death," he says. <br /> <br /> The next day, wild boy Jane Cleveland (Saarsgard) kidnaps Jona from work and takes him to the huge, abandoned glassworks, and soon Jon, Cleveland and Jane spend each waking moment at punk rock concerts, drugs and drinking alcohol. It does not fit Phlox, who pushes Jon to a more personal relationship, namely to meet new friends and father. The film tries to take us on a journey of Jon, when he shakes the fetters imposed on him by his father, Phlox and his blind work, because he finds freedom and expression through his relationship with Cleveland and Jane. <br /> <br /> There is a problem with following Jon throughout the whole movie: it's completely uninteresting. There is no ambition, passion or goals. He goes through life like an invisible ghost that Jane described the night they met. At the beginning it is not a problem. But it is never more interesting. He is a completely passive figure. He just follows the artistic Cleveland and Jane, but he never tells us what he wants or what he wants to do with himself. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the film and its supporting characters have no place to go and do little, except for the party, have sex and get into quarrels. In other words, a lot of talk about nothing. We have here the shallow skin of a good film with nothing inside. Extensive pictures, heavy voice with figures staring into the distance, lots of sexual scenes, both simple and homosexual, big quarrels, more evil sex, chase scene and tragic death ... but it does not matter. Ironically, at some point, Jane, confused by Jon's many aimless actions, asks him, "What's going on, Jon? What is it all about? " Yes, Jon, tell me. We also know in the audience. <br /> <br /> The title "The Mysteries of Pittsburgh" must refer to the characters themselves, because that's the way it is. These are all facades, one-dimensional stands for real people. The film never lets us in. We never know what makes one of them stick. We see that they do many things, but we do not know why. And the lack of "why" is one of the worst things a movie can have.
