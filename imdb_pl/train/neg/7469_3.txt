The screenplay of this television soap opera is so bad that even A. Hopkins at some point had to play like a drama student actor to bring some life into his dead scenario. I do not know if that was the director's goal, but Ciano Hopkins smelled only of vanity, fear and lack of self-esteem. A real Ciano was probably all, but why create a movie about him? Mussolini was a bit more convincing, and his long way down was as if closer to the truth. Edda Mussolini was ridiculous (not because of Sarandon, but because of the powerless scenario), while she had to be the main character of this alleged family drama. Watch it only if you like Venezuelan telenovela.
