Wow. I've seen some really bad movies in my time, but this one really takes the cake. This is the worst film I've seen in the last decade - without exaggeration. <br /> <br /> As a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, in the American army, I could not even finish watching this funny movie, not because it brought back memories - far from it - but because there was absolutely no attempt at "authenticity" anywhere in the movie. Not as much as the smallest minor shreds. It looked like it was written by an 8-year-old child who received all his concepts of war (and soldier's behavior) straight from the comics. The film was made in Honduras, which should be a clue, but even this is not able to fully explain the horrible value of producing this trivial piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> I could try to replace all the endless technical flaws, but it would take virtually forever. From ancient patches on arms that have not been seen or worn since World War II, and plaques with character names such as "ColCollins" (worn by the character of "Colonel Collins"), which was written using an inverted mirror image "" of the Russian alphabet (not from the American alphabet) the list simply takes and continues. Uniforms, equipment, plot, and especially the behavior of the heroes - each scene was full of absurd flaws, inaccuracies and completely mindless stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Neither the plot itself nor the characters were the least credible or reliable. Everything was ridiculously childish, in the extreme. It was, of course, a film that was to appeal only to boys before puberty, and I have no doubt that even they consider this film completely absurd. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie has absolutely no advantages at all. It is a total waste of time. I strongly advise anyone who reads this, give this trash; it's really not worth wasting any time in your time.
