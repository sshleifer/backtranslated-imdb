this movie provides. best when a clumsy teenage neighbor tries to leave the guardian, and in the background he looks like he has never been near a bicycle in his life because he is trying not to fall. <br /> <br /> but this movie does not end when less than 5 minutes later it delivers a scene with nothing but an arm reaching across the fence and into the fridge pulling out the beer. <br /> <br /> stereotypical fathers on the grill, a few plot lines that are nowhere to be found, and the former SeaQuest actress with a bluetooth cell phone makes it an ideal Saturday night at home.
