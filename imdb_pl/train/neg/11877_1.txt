I think that's almost all I have to say. However, I feel obliged to explain my actions. In fact, I've never seen such fittings and I mean what we understand in all respects. Although physical work with the camera, the operation of the MIC boom and other technical aspects of the film are funny, unfortunately these are not the only areas. <br /> <br /> Unlike some classic independent films that have been saved thanks to great scenarios and story, it unfortunately has a horrible scenario, horrible acting and the worst of all, horrible annoying characters. <br /> <br /> It's a crime that there are 101 other independent films that have died in silent death for every independent film that's been distributed, like Haiku Tunnel. I do not know who the Kornbluth brothers are in Sony, but this may be my only explanation of how this amateur family production ever took place. I'm quite surprised why they chose it. <br /> <br /> The only part of the movie that contains all intrigue is its title. However, the reason for this is even disappointed. I hope this review will save a few people who may be intrigued by the title of this movie from watching it. I've seen a lot of movies in my time and I'm very forgiving when I'm at the cinema, but that was too much. I will never forget the "tunnel" for marking an important point in my life experience of cinema. It is a pity that it is such a low point.
