About her. Some of the best talents on British television created this series, so I can only assume that they worked under incredible time pressure and had to settle for the first shots of many scenes. <br /> <br /> There are some scary scenes in this Highland mystery (mainly when attacking "monsters" and we see it from his point of view), but I'm afraid that most stories were involuntarily funny! Just like when the hero discovers a quartered corpse on the golf course: Oh look, there's a hand ... oh, and there's one more hand ... hmm, that's a little bit mysterious ... <br /> <br /> For many years, fans of British iconic television programs have campaigned to release the series on VHS or DVD, but the BBC has always refused. Now I think I understand why!
