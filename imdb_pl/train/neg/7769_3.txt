A real predator of Bill Rebane's film, which in the eighties became worse and worse in trade. Three crazy millionaires invite nine people to a distant hotel to take part in a contest for the last person, in which the final participant will receive a million dollars, provided he reaches that far. A number of lame jokes are drawn into some of the guests, while others get involved in what most adults will do under these circumstances, namely they will be broken in a hotel bar. Most of the scenes are just an excuse to focus the camera on different parts of the female body, including the opening dance number, which is a cross between American Bandstand and geriatric aerobics with prostitutes. If there was any hesitation that white people can not dance this scene, then the last nail in this coffin. Pay special attention to the slide of the pacifier. This takes about forty-five minutes until Bill Rebane starts throwing darts at various twists and whatever hits he will inspire the next scene, making this one inconsistent mess. It's a game until it's a game. Three old coots have full control until they are. The hotel is controlled by supernatural power until it becomes just a prop. They do not live until they are. Even the narrator at the end replies that he does not know what happened. I am opposed to anyone who has a reason why Rebane is going to do it. The actor is the caliber in the dinner theater without dinner. Most of the actors probably came back to their daily work at local Stuckey's. I give a few points for the stage in which the wide yuppie opens the wardrobe, and the skeleton is in the skull that despises itself. Let's see how it passed with the wind! This Chilling Classics collection is a nightmare for me. Bane, take it! Like Rebane! I hate myself.
