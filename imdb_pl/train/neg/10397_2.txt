Just not the quality I expected from Morris (Brass Eye and Blue Jam love). It's very similar to not so bad student film. What bothers me, is WHY THE BAFTA WON? ?? Morris makes fun of "saved mediocrity" (Ayn Rand) in a large part of his work (Nathan Barley), but thanks to this song he urges the urine of talented back and tells us that it's raining! <br /> <br /> I just hope he chose a topic that I would like to move (the humanity of terrorism - Four Lions) that he will not be swaying on it, wasting the opportunity to make a statement about the mainstay of ignorance and opinion on this subject emotional and highly spun phenomenon.
