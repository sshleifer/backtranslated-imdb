Despite positive reviews and shows at international festivals, this film is not for everyone. <br /> <br /> The story is very similar to other films in which a teenager from an immigrant family has to overcome many typical personal problems of her age, as well as to fight the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family. He does this by choosing a type of sport, and with the help of a local boy who for some reason falls in love with her, confronts his problems and wins. <br /> <br /> In Girlfight it's boxing, in. Do it like Beckham is football, and now it's Kung Fu. <br /> <br /> But Fighter is a much worse product than the two, watching it was simply embarrassing. Semra Turan, the "actress" who plays the role of a teenage girl, can do many things, but one thing she can not do is act. Her presence on the screen is anemic and clumsy, dramatic situations in which she tries to show certain emotions, are terrible, her body and facial language are amateur actresses, misguided by the director. The rest of the cast is a bit better, but they simply can not save this stereotypical film with stereotypical characters and a shallow story. Apart from a few relatively good moments, this movie has nothing new or interesting to offer. <br /> <br /> Even the kung fu fight is not a reason to watch it, it's just boring. Slow movement was really unnecessary, the choreography was basic and lacked inspiration, and most of the kung fu scenes are just training or standing in all kinds of kung fu positions, not fighting. Not to mention how funny it looks, when a thin and skinny girl fights with big and muscular boys and throws them off her legs. <br /> <br /> The only reason the movie was noticed is because it is European. It is very easy to publicize this film - The first film about martial arts from Denmark, but do not be fooled, it is not. It's just a drama about a stupid teenage girl and her problems, which, by the way, are not very convincing. <br /> <br /> A bad movie with embarrassing lines, acting and history.
