OK, as everyone has noticed, this movie is a complete dog. To some extent, this is because it was a sex movie that was cut from many materials (or dimmed to almost invisible) to escape the assessment of the X censor; but the film also has many other disadvantages. <br /> <br /> In the beginning the screenwriter seems to have mixed up werewolves and vampires. The bad guys in this movie are furry and do not like silver, but in all other respects they behave like vampires. Now you can not do it with a bad genre, you have to stick to the rules of the genre, and the fans will be confused and irritated by suspending disbelief in the wrong thing. In fact, the whole (misleading and poorly presented) plot is something that has already been done for vampires, but there is no point in the movie about werewolves. <br /> <br /> Second, werewolf costumes are the poorest ever to see. Everyone in the werewolf film industry should know that costumes and werewolves are something that critics critically applaud, but some of these werewolves are simply stupid. <br /> <br /> There are several slightly good pieces. Actually, I really liked the result. Others recalled Sybil Danning's boobs. I ... <br /> <br /> (*** SPOILER ***, if something like that can exist) <br /> <br /> I also liked the plan of attack on the werewolf stronghold. There are so many horrors that rely on stupid characters, but in this case they first gain a very sensible and effective arsenal against werewolves and kill monsters. I mean, you can kill werewolves with silver bullets, and we now have quite a powerful firearm. It should not be too hard to connect two and two together, hmm? But in a typical style this movie goes up and adds other very funny and funny anti-lycanthrope weapons.
