It must be the worst and I mean the worst motorcycle movie ever made! That says a lot, because the stinker's line is long and smelly! <br /> <br /> Now at least we know what happened to Ginger after she was saved from Gilligan's! Terrified Tina Louise (she was probably afraid that someone would see this mess!) This is an orphan driver who is tormented by the most repulsive motorcycle gang in film history. But do not worry about the fans! Batman, I mean Adam West as a doctor in the city who comes to the rescue! Pow! Crush! Boom! Saint Toledo Batman! <br /> <br /> The only advantages of this "bomb" are lovely women, funny fighting scenes and still "sexy" Tina Louise!
