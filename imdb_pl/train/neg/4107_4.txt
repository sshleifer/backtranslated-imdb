The problem with "The Killer Elite" is that by looking for this movie and taking the time to watch it, you put more effort into the experience than many of its directors, especially director Sam Peckinpah. <br /> <br /> Already this unstable Peckinpah was in bad weather in this film. According to at least one biographer, he got acquainted with cocaine. Add to it his getting drunk and it's no wonder everything fell apart. <br /> <br /> It's a pity, because the concept of the film is good, and the first ten minutes promise a lot. Mike Locken (James Caan) and George Hansen (Robert Duvall) are private performers who do a lot of dirty work for the CIA. They move quickly, live well and look like the best friends - then something happens to break up their brotherhood. <br /> <br /> The opening scene shows that they blow up the building - why exactly we were not told, couples on the course in terms of the dark motivation of the film. But the implication is that these guys hurt people and do not really care about them - antiheroes very similar to the Wild Grapes of Peckinpah not so long ago. The opening title tells us that they work for ComTeg, and then adds with an obvious expression on the face: ... the idea that the CIA can use such an organization for any purpose is obviously preposterous. It's quite a smart way to let viewers know that all bets are off. <br /> <br /> Add to this the traditionally strong cast of Peckinpah, including Burt Young, Gig Young and Peckinpah regular Bo Hopkins in the plumage of a madman who can not give up the opportunity to be shot for $ 500 a day, and wish you just to make screenwriters, including the famous Sterling Silliphant, try to do more with this story than to turn it into a platform for lazy-liners and bad knockoffs. An attempt to inject a dose of liberal social commentary is inconvenient. "You're so busy doing your dirty work, you can not say who the bad guys are," says Locken, as if either he or we need to point it out. <br /> <br /> An even worse is the clumsy Peckinpah direction and slow gait. We have 40 minutes in the film before we get our first battle scene, a completely chaotic collection of random shots, in which a group of people whom we have not met yet, fighting at the San Francisco airport, their battle interrupted by conversation in an office apartment. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, after the cast the battle inside the fleet surrounding the Victory ship remained, and the ninja flee in the open to be shot while Caan throws one cartridge that cuts all traces of real tension. "Put me from seven to five, I'll take this little guy", he jokes just before the climate samurai duel between two ninja warriors - from China, which we all know is the land of the Ninja. (The battle takes place in San Francisco, but surprisingly, no Mounties arrive to spoil anything.) <br /> <br /> Caan is much better in smaller scenes, for example when Locken, after recovering from a few serious injuries says one of his bosses, played by the sleek Arthur Hill, that he was "thrown" by the organization. Caan refuses to stay below, and his recovery scenes, although lost in the breakup of the film, are characterized by great acting from him and Amy Heflin, Van's daughter, as a supporting nurse. Caan was one of the best actors of the 1970s, and his laconic game with Heflin, Duvall, Hopkins and both Youngs gives the "Killer Elite" real audience. <br /> <br /> But you do not watch "Killer Elite" think about it. You watch it thinking about the movie that escaped.
