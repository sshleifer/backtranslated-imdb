There are not many interesting things to say about it, but I can mention that Matt Dillon is doing everything in his power to do something out of nothing and many divided screens and graphics that are worth it. Because most racing movies are suffering from the assumption that car enthusiasts are not so intelligent, we end up with such movies. <br /> <br /> Lindsay Lohan, who surprised so much in Mean Girls, must make better decisions about which roles to take. Here, it can only fall. <br /> <br /> Children will have a little fun because they try to appeal to adults more than to children (though still quite stupid). Those in the theater where I saw them showed no interest after a few minutes. And as a sports movie for families it is terrible. The better moments are at the beginning of the junkyard, creating some sentiments, and later at the car festival, creating some tension. If you develop a car as a main character, you must develop it better than here. After a few mandatory racing scenes you're in the best shape: you can leave the multiplex in your own car.
