Seriously. This is one of the stupidest family shows of all time. <br /> <br /> Plot - a family without a mother and 3 "fathers" raise 3 young girls in San Francisco, California. <br /> <br /> Characters - Shapely freak Danny, loving cartoon Joey, obsessively hairy Jesse, spoiled brat Michelle, stupid DJ and almost normal Stephanie. The creators of this series really want you to hate the heroes, right? <br /> <br /> That's why I do not think anyone will watch this program. I only giggled for a few moments throughout the show's run, and I think that instead of lethal injection, all criminals should be forced to watch this program, torture much worse than anything else. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10 or: D
