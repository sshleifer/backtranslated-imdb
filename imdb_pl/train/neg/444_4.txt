(SPOILERY W TYM) <br /> <br /> "Rosenstraße" is a film about heroic women in the German Nazi period. But it is too long, does not touch, and sometimes even boring! There are too many stereotypes and not quite good acting. <br /> <br /> Story (plot) is bad. Like James Cameron's Titanic, an old woman remembers the events of her life. Okay, now we have a point of view. Then another woman appeared who does the same. The misleading thing is that they both mention events from other people's lives! Come on! This is a lack of knowledge about basic stories ... How can Riemann know, for example, the fate of a little girl's mother and her interrogations? <br /> <br /> Scenes are shown in the wrong order and you rarely know when it happened. For example, a scene in which Riemann proposes to Fabian. When did this happen? The scene looks as if it was set in the 1920s ... <br /> <br /> Riemann's character is of course a talented pianist, well, he is even Baroness! Wow. Her brother returns from the Eastern Front, he received "Ritterkreuz", which shows in some scenes. So he is a war hero and still a great man who has kept his conscience. He gained knowledge about the massacres committed by the Germans. He even took a few photos! And that's how it happens, cliché after the cliché and that's why the movie does not work. <br /> <br /> Basically, von Trotta forced the chick to do something that could be a decent movie. In the end, everything is very simple. Riemann finds a way to bring Goebbels to bed and - he will! - everyone is free. Which is not a historical fact, but a pure imagination in spite of the theorem "true history" at the beginning. Like "Sass", it is BASED ON a real event. <br /> <br /> It's sad but true, it's a typical German movie these days. It's bad! Macaulay J. Connor <br /> <br />
