This film seems to be a rip off of many films that have been dealing with the same subject in the past. Let the future viewer be forewarned that Art Heist adds nothing to the genre. Director Bryan Goeres has no idea what to do with the film. <br /> <br /> William Baldwin still appears in the movies and, to be honest, he wonders if he has a great agent, or whether the directors and producers love his extraordinary silly looks, complemented by the strange hairstyle he plays in most of his films . The only good movie in which he appeared is "The Squid and the Whale", in which he speaks only two or three lines. Ellen Pompeo, his main lady, does not do better; there is no chemistry between Mrs. Pompeo and Mr. Baldwin. <br /> <br /> A movie that you can see at your viewer's risk.
