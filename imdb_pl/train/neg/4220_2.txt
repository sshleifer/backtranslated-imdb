Short overview, but ... <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs of wasting 90 minutes. At the end of the movie, I was not smarter about what really happened. It's full of episodes (Stephen Fry (3 minutes), Jack Dee (30 seconds), girls from "Philadelphia") and a few people who are recognizable, but it just does not make sense. Did history get lost in the edition, which I do not have now, but jeez ... <br /> <br /> Instead, insert a DVD or go to bed and rest !!! <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 (for the stage and pursuit behind the car Morris Minor) <br /> <br />
