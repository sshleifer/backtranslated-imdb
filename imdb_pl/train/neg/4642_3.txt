I saw "Attic Rachel" thinking that I would have fun, ride. However, it was not like that. Yes, yes, but nice? It would be big, thick, no! In fact, the only reason I gave him "3" is because Gunnar Hansen appears (as short) as one of the blameless characters in the movie. As they have ever lured Mr. Hansen to this piece ... of work, I will never know. The idea for a story is interesting but badly made. The direction is pedestrian, and the acting average. The only worse thing is special effects. YIKES !!! I've seen better effects in the class game. Come on, Mr. W, it's time for a career change ... I hear they're hiring at Mel's Diner! There are very few well-made Inde movies from Michigan ... and Rachel's Attic is not one of them.
