Where do they get the money to make such movies? I mean, there's nothing redeeming in this movie. None of the actors is known, writing is awful, photography is not clear, the story travels between being a bad version of Repo Man and a nickel-western western, and acting is unbelievable. For someone who watches all kinds of movies, good and bad, I have to admit that this movie is about the worst I've seen since the Eye Attack of People in the 1950s. I really do not like to destroy the effort of people who try to create some entertainment, or God forbid, but this movie will not appeal to anyone. History turns the mystical contamination of a person who is a bad version of the Celtic soul eater, although it functions more like a male succubus without sexual undertones. Bad people must cooperate with good people in the city from which they can not escape. Take it from there, because unfortunately this is the best part. My advice is that if you do not fall into evil mythology, amateur writing, unconvincing acting and arduous settings, it will be best to serve you, leaving it on the shelf when you rent movies.
