Painful to watch, not empathy with heroes' fights. Two main heroes, Cynthia, mother and acknowledged daughter Monika, devote a large part of the movie pitifully mewing and bitterly poking fun. Their characters are so firmly established that their redemption in tolerated personalities after a quick family catharsis is unbelievable. It was not worth waiting. I would like a decent position for family integrity to be less painful.
