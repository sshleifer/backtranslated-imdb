This may not be the worst comedy of all time, but it is close. The producers of this movie stole an hour and a half of my life and I want to get it back! <br /> <br /> Chris Kattan is funny for about 10 minutes. His high voice and crazy waving begin to age, and then you realize that the rest of the movie is much worse. He falls into a long line of former SNLs who have tried films. Some were brilliant, some were defeated. There is not much average in this category. Although Chris Farley was brilliant and then okay, then not so funny and then dead ... so I suppose he hits the whole spectrum in one career. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie as plaga br /> <br /> c
