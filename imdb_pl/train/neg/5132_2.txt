I learned about this film because it was the Jewish Ben Chaplin of Game On. Game On is a funny British sitcom and apparently he left because he wanted to break into Hollywood and play in this movie. He did not fail thanks to God. <br /> <br /> The film is a very simple romantic comedy in which Janeane Garofalo plays an ugly woman who uses her neighbor Umma Thurman to make an appointment with Ben Chaplin because she thinks Ben Chaplin will not like her because It's ugly. The film is simply bad for many reasons. The plot is unbelievably predictable, from overt slapstick bits to serious nonsense: only this assembly, in which all three are having fun and then a piece of photography. These two scenes made me ashamed! Janeane's character is disgustingly arrogant (and guessing her role as a "comedian" and the arch-deputy lady is also in real life). He claims that the film is "anti-feminist" while in reality it is simply realistic. Men more often than not look at personality. It is also interesting to note her hypocrisy. For many years she was a feminist and a "comedian", and then suddenly decides that the film is bad. I imagine that she hated the idea and script of the film before it was released, but she made sure that it was so quiet that she could pay for this parody of the film. Come on! She was active in this for the good of Heaven! What the film really was was anti-human. He presents men as silly animals whose brains are in the groins, and men do stupid things to attract the attention of Noelle Uma Thurman. <br /> <br /> There are other bad things about this movie, like the character of Ben Chaplin the Brit who every American girl thinks is sweet, and Jamie Foxx is Chaplin's best black friend, and of course Foxx had to try to imitate his accent several times on good. Is this the best that writers can come up with? Blimey, they've never done it before, except for every Hugh Grant and Dudley Moore movie ever made. There is also a terrible telephone sex scene that is simply grotesque and proves how cheap the movie is. Other comments here say that Janeane Garofalo is not ugly, but she is really beautiful. Did I watch the same movie, what did they do? She certainly does not look at her, and the only good thing about this movie was that she was rightly considered ugly. Still, I do not see the appeal of Uma Thurman: she is skinny and emaciated. <br /> <br /> I guarantee three things in this movie, if you have never watched it: <br /> <br /> You'll find out what the ending will be; <br /> <br /> You will find that the phone sex scene is painfully embarrassing and; <br /> <br /> You will be bored after ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Watch at your own risk.
