I felt that Rancid Aluminum was a complete loss of two hours, the plot was thin and confusing, and the prestigious group of players had a horrible dialogue and extremely dubious accents. Working with cameras was somewhat experimental in some places, and although you could see what the director was trying to convey, it was just harder to see it. One of the most annoying aspects of Rancid Aluminum is the excessive use of narrative throughout the movie almost as if the entire plot was dictated to the public. The best performances had nothing to do with acting. Probably the most convincing performance from Dani Behr of all people, though he does play a stereotypical secretary. NOT IN ANY CONDITIONS, go and see this movie, unless you need a reason to make up for a lost dream, there are certainly better ways to spend hard earned cash.
