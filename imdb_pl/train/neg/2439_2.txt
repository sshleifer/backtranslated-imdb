"Intensive Care" by Dorny von Rouveroy is certainly one of the worst horror movies ever made. This incredibly cheap Dutch movie slasher offers a bit of anger and plenty of absurd situations. miserable, the action is slow and the culmination is ridiculous. The famous surgeon has a car accident. He's in a coma for seven years, and then he wakes up and starts a bloody madness. including the series "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th". The killings are fun and the dialogues are painfully stupid. If you're in the right mood, you can give this piece a trash look. You will laugh until it hurts one - you can believe me!
