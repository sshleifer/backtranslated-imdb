<br /> <br /> I am a fan of great horror / science-fiction regardless of budget, but after watching countless horrors late in cable and video, this must be the worst of all movies. With bloody special effects (what looked like a roast covered with fake blood or ketchup, which were still shown) and people running around screaming from the left, then to the right, then back. He should stay with the initial scene of the grocery store and stay there for 15 minutes. Instead, it is dragged for a very long time. It's a very, very low x5 budget. Many of the scenes were very long. The narrator sounded very amateurish, as if talking to a casual middle school person. This is the only movie that in my opinion is lower than Manos, Red Zone Cuba, Benji and Godzilla. megalon, despite their higher budgets. 10 naps, try not to fall asleep throughout the movie in one setting or better yet, avoid it as if you were an undead mob.
