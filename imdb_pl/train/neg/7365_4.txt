Not bad, but not as big a panic movie. Kirk Douglas is recently dismissed from a prison criminal who decides to do the job himself after rejecting the offer from the Mobs. He recruits gymnastics of the circus Giuliano Gemma. Chaos follows. Douglas and Gemma are soon pursued by the mafia Goon Romano Puppo and entangled in a truly stupid love triangle with the infinitely patient girl Douglas (Florinda Bolkan). Director Michele Lupo keeps pace fast and there is at least one perfect and creative sequence of a car chase involving Puppo and Gemma. Although Italian production, most of the photos seem to be made in Germany. Douglas is doing well, not only by killing him on the Giallo number. The striking Bolkan gives amazing performance. The music was written by Ennio Morricone, and the photos were taken by great Tonino Delli Colli, who managed to cooperate with everyone in Italy (from Wertmuller and Fellini to Pasolini and Leone).
