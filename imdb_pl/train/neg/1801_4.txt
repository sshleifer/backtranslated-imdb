Istanbul is another of the immigrant films that Errol Flynn has been doing in the last decade of his life, trying to support the family and avoid the hassle of the IRS. This is a remake of the film by Fred MacMurray - Ava Gardner from Singapore from ten years ago. <br /> <br /> In contrast to this studio product, Istanbul has the advantage of offering a great location for photos at the view of the Golden Horn. But Errol Flynn, who is aging in front of the camera in every movie, was much too old to play these types of action / adventure. His scenes with Cornell Borchers are really unconvinced. <br /> <br /> As for Cornell, she plays the former beloved Errol, who now has amnesia through the trauma of saving from fire. They both do not remember Errol and now she is the wife of Torin Thatcher. <br /> <br /> But Errol has nasty people under the command of Martin Benson and Werner Klemperer, who are after the diamonds that came into his possession. We must deal with them. <br /> <br /> The best reason to see Istanbul is to hear Nat King Cole singing and playing the piano. Most people do not realize today that Cole was a great jazz pianist, they only consider him a singer. In fact, he was the first pianist, the singing was a reflection. <br /> <br /> Istanbul is a routine action / adventure film for fans of this type of film.
