Having decided some time ago to collect Billy Bob Thornton's films (based on class films such as "Sling Blade", "Simple Plan" and "Man Who Was Not There"), it was inevitable that there would be a strange turkey there. I did not realize, however, that there might be one THIS evil. I'll give you an idea of ​​how unbelievably poor this movie is - the funniest dialogue in it sounds like "Knock Knock", "Who's there?", "Big smelly man", "Big smelly man who?", "Big smelly" man - IT IS! " Yes, people are really so bad. Billy Bob has been in this for only about two minutes (I think he needed to work at that time in his career), and the rest of the movie is painful. For some reason, although it's undeniably horrible, I do not hate it. Probably because I save anger for every high budget, trash with special effects, such as "Fast and furious" instead of "no budget" like this one. 2/10 after pressing.
