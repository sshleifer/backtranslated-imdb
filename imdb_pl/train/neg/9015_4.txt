The first 45 minutes of the game Dragon Fighter is completely acceptable and surprisingly possible to watch. Characters are reliable and interesting. The cloning lab really looks really high. Then everything breaks down. The characters begin to behave idiotically, and the new thread is nowhere introduced about the fusion reactor (and this is supposedly "today"), which becomes critical, and the only justification for the story is the need to kill the dragon - only this is done. Finisz is incredibly weak. One wonders what made the movie that started so good so bad. <br /> <br /> All characters except Dean Cain are played by the Russians. This causes some strange situations and details, such as the character played by Vessel Dimitrova called "Bailey Kent" in spite of her heavy accent (and despite this, in one case, inexplicably switches to * Spanish *!). <br /> <br /> Due to a decent start, I considered the rating of this movie at 5, but it really was more disappointing than this, so I give only 4.
