I saw an early screening of this film in New York, and I, along with my friends and almost all of the audience, was very disappointed. The movie was not even so bad that it was good; he was as dead as the snake's biting victim. Samual L. Jackson looked surprisingly tired by the majority, and the snake's effects were poor. It reminded me of one of those bad SciFi movies, except that the cheapness of the movie was not fun or even campaing. Everything seemed worn out, flat and formally open. I'm shocked when I say that I really think Anaconda is more fun. It's easy to understand that SOAP realizes that this is a piece * and plays with it, but what the movie fails with is a script that has horror. This is the worst kind of lame movie: it is without joy.
