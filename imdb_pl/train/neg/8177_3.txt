Mindy's 90 minutes ... Mindy is irritating to Bill's boyfriend ... Mindy is tearing up in high school dance ... Mindy goes hitchhiking to Big Sur, she's shopping for a loaf of "shepherd's bread", Mindy almost gets raped by gangs. Ah, pleasure from driving at Crown International. You must remember that these movies have never been intended for viewing on DVD devices. They were made in a 90-minute atmosphere, so teens of the '70s would have a soundtrack, as in their Pintos and Citations. Lack of stimulation and structure did not matter to the original audience - they probably only tuned in when the T & A on the screen matched what they were doing in the parking lot. The movie is really annoying when it's viewed as a story. It's much nicer to talk about it than to watch. My favorite misfortune: 1) Bill and his friend accompany the teacher to find Mindy. Without luggage or changing underwear, they spend 2 nights sharing a teacher's room with a teacher, just like in real life. 2) After kidnapping and almost being raped by depraved cyclists and after their innocent friend "Lord" is brutally beaten, Mindy and her girlfriend find the motorcycle unattended on the road. Mindy immediately brightens and a chirp of "I'm going" to Big Sur !! "But again it is much nicer to talk / read than to sit.
