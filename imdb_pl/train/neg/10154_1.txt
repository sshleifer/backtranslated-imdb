how this movie can be 5.5, this movie was a piece of skunks **. first the actors were really bad, that is Charlie's chainsaw was so late. because at the very beginning, when he puts his head in a wooden hut (which happened to be about a quarter of an inch thick (it's really cheap as a thin piece of wood) and he did not even think he could throw it, the person who made the set sucks like * delivering things that he can build with. The only good thing about this movie is the idea of ​​this movie, show the bottom line DO NOT waste your hard-earned cash on the portion they call film. <br /> <br /> rating: 0 3
