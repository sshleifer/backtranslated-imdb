The guy has done many title projects for several films and I think he said one day; I should choose a cheap script, try to put as many titles as possible in it (because I'm the title designer) and try to convince people that it's really a movie. One of the worst I've seen is for sure. If you wanted to see nice titles, check out some posters without wasting time watching this. <br /> <br /> It's kind of ironic, do not you think you saw the poster? the only part of his project that SHOULD have a title work done is almost none!
