End Game started well, the least said about the end, the better. it seemed that this was done to make it work, for example a reporter who is at first a very inquisitive, intelligent person, doing something really stupid and completely devoid of character halfway, we have no reason to do so without her, the next scene would not have sense. The whole story could be told in about 30 minutes, it would be an average political drama on television. Brilliant Cuba Gooding Jr. he is very visible, but James Woods does an admirable job considering. <br /> <br /> The end of the game was really one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... and it says something, I saw Gigli.
