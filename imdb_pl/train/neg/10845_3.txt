AMAZING had a story! ;) I've seen movies with a smaller story (I do not want to mention Asian movies, but ...). I thought that the camera was not bad at such a cheap movie, and the atmosphere was not so bad either. There is no real reason why most things are done and how they react to what is happening. Although I think it's about a lot of movies, in this case it was obviously awful. <br /> <br /> Some movies have been broken so badly only for single scenes. Acting was bad, but I saw worse. The film was bad, but I saw worse. Watching this movie is an experience between boredom, laughter, death wish, sadism, horror and entertainment at a low level. <br /> <br /> So if you like bloody videos with stupid threads, then this movie is right for you. <br /> <br /> I gave it 3/10, because it CAN be fun if you do not expect a good movie and you have the right mood.
