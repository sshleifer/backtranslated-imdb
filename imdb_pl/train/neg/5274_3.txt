If you like movies about terrible cities, hotels, homes, states (ala the Eagles "Hotel California") etc., which have people who "just pass", read almost every novel by Stephen King. If you like the "disappear" setting, start by reading "Desperation" King, but also check "The Shining", "Flight Salem" and "Needful Things". <br /> <br /> The motif of the raven, the desert, the family driving in desperation to escape or avoid being possessed, is tired. Why did not they just make a movie from the novel "Desperation"? Maybe they approached King and he turned off? Must be. <br /> <br /> Susan Dey and Harry Hamlin look happy to be connected and both have fun for years, but they are still TV actors and direct DVD calibers.
