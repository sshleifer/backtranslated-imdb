The blue monkey is indeed mentioned in the movie, but not in any way that could make any sense. At some point, some children are wandering on deeper levels, exploring. <br /> <br /> They start discussing what they will find there, and one of them (the girl) says that she bets she will find a blue monkey. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's it. Completely irrelevant in this story, the only sad relationship with the title, and has no idea why she would suppose she would find a blue monkey in the basement of the hospital. <br /> <br /> I am embarrassed that I remembered it, but someone had to remember, I suppose!
