Pretty the worst movie I've ever seen. When did Hollywood ever make a successful movie that attacked the Republicans? Why do not they learn. Dixie chicks no. These leftists live in their own elite bubble, interacting with each other; unaware that most of America is far more good than they are. <br /> <br /> The best Hollywood productions are not partial and are rarely political at all. Cheney was angry. <br /> <br /> I thought Cussack could land better movies. <br /> <br /> It was not funny.
