WOW is all I can say if you read it or watch it or you think about it. trust me, look at it! <br /> <br /> I have laughed so much in so many parts of this movie that the worst acting ever created is very fun! I can not believe that they overlap the school sign! I had to play this scene again and again to laugh more and more each time. If you can make such a movie, it gives us all hopes to create your own movies. even the costume was bad. it looked like my 7-year-old cousin could do a better job. heck, I'll bet he could write and work better. All I know is that I have to watch the second part to see if it was as bad as the first one. it's a cool idea for a deadly scarecrow, but you could do a much better job. I hope that there will be another scarecrow movie, not like this one.
