It is 1982, two years after the Iranian siege of the embassy, ​​which entailed a dramatic SAS Rescue from Balconys and a war with Argentina for the ongoing Falkland Islands, which is a better film than the movie Gung-Ho "SAS", which again - creates a siege of hostages Iran, while the hero of British action number one, Lewis Collins. Throw Edward Woodward and some other famous actors and you will win the winner? ... May not! The film itself does not make the situation serious enough, while acting is quite common. it's like a long episode of The Professionals, but without a formula. This film does not go anywhere quickly and is quite predictable. Maybe Cubby Brocoli watched the movie and decided to abandon Lewis Collins as the advertised deputy James Bond for Roger Moore. See if you're a fan of Lewis Collins or SAS general, if not, save your time.
