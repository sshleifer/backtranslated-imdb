It's hard to praise this movie. CGI for the dragon was well done, but he lacked proper modeling of light and shadow. Also, the same film material is used indefinitely by a dragon that passes through the corridors, which becomes somewhat tedious. <br /> <br /> I was amazed to see "Marcus Aurelius" in acting, wondering what the former Emperor Roman Empire played in this movie! Like "Whoopie Goldberg", it must be a pseudonym and whether it can be blamed for using one if it appears in this smelly one. <br /> <br /> The story may be interesting, but the acting is flat and the direction is boring. If you MUST watch this movie, go to your friend's house and get drunk during this - then it will be nice.
