It could have been a morbid fascinating look at the life of one of the most famous serial killers in America, but unfortunately it is not even approaching. Terrible edition, direction, bad acting. This movie is literally about a 10-minute plot stretched to 100. The only feature that can be a salvation is Bruce Davidson as a father, but that's not enough to save this stinker. 1 in 10.
