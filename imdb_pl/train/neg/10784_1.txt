It was disgusting and painful. What a losing cast! I swear, the audience (1/2 full) laughed TWICE after 90 minutes. This is not a lie. Do not rent it even. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones was too vicious to be credible. <br /> <br /> Cusack was fine. Just okay. I feel sorry for him (the actor) in case people remember this mess. <br /> <br /> Roberts was the same as always. Charming and sweet, but without a goal. The "romance" with John was totally unbelievable.
