I enjoyed this movie most of the time, but I still had the impression that I was watching a movie for children. I honestly think that someone wrote a pg script, and then during the filming decided to add some blood, nudity and language. it was a big disappointment. there is such a belief in the magic of children, which exists in films such as "babe" (pig) or "angels in the field" that defeat the fairy of evil. parents believed their daughter in her ability to see the spirit and use this skill to supernaturally defeat the tooth fairy. when I bought this movie, I thought it would be a b-movie response to terrible darkness; somehow they manage to make a better movie with 1/4 of the money, but they do not do it. they made a worse movie and probably lose the same amount of money lost to the falls of the dark.
