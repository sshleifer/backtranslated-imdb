I usually check MTV movie awards to watch a witty, fun program that provides a unique show of prizes (Chewbacca wins the lifetime achievement award). So this year was not different. Although I am not a fan of Justin Timberlake, Seann William Scott has always been funny to me - albeit-stupid. I was laughing at Stiffler in both American Pie movies, and even liked Dude Where's My Car? But the MTV movie awards were simply awful. Nothing was consistent, fun or funny. Justin Timberlake should stick to singing and dancing; it certainly can not work. <br /> <br /> I wonder who the writers were for this concert. Last year's performance of Jacek Black and Sarah Michelle Gellar was extremely funny (the parody of the Lord of the Rings was worth watching the whole show), but this year was completely different. Did anyone understand Timberlake's comments about Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson ("They stare at the film together, but they never met ... Here they are ...") Where was the joke? Kate and Luke simply went into their lame dialogue, never referring to Timberlake's "joke". And Seann was completely wasted as a talent, not even making a smile, but laughing. What was the meaning of one Harrison Ford linear car? Did anyone make ANY meaning to you? Perhaps the MTV creators came to the conclusion that the young viewers know only an aging Ford, like Han Solo, Indiana Jones, or the president of Air Force One. I am surprised. Will anyone tell me a contract with Adrian Brody? How old is this guy and how does he think he is? The guy looks 30, he's trying to act again 19 ... give up, show some class (like in the best speech from the acting academy) and act like an age! from 4, simply because of Gollam's speech about the best visual performance. It was very creative, very well done and caused the only real laugh of the evening.
