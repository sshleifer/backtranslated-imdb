In 1993, "Guests" were a huge hit in France. So the sequence was inevitable, and unfortunately this sequence is one of the worst in history. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that does not keep its promises. Indeed, this is to be the only story. Jean Reno must go in the twentieth century and take Christian Clavier back in the Middle Ages so that time can usually follow his lead. The problem is that Clavier feels completely at ease in the world of the twentieth century, so he makes his return to Middles Ages is rather difficult ... Instead, the film goes on a few other stories, failing to follow the main thread. As a result, the movie sometimes becomes chaotic, sometimes a bit of a mess. <br /> <br /> But the film also suffers from the performance of almost all actors. Reno and Clavier fall into a trap that they could avoid in the first movie: they go up and become annoying. So, why was Jean-Marie Poiré the director involved Muriel Robin in the leading female role? He made a mistake because he seems sick and is absolutely pathetic. The other actors are not better: Marie-Anne Chazel is non-existent and Christian Bujeau unbearable. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie contains some good moments with effective gags, but often falls into vulgarity and ease. This applies to certain sequences and dialog boxes. It also seems empty, because Poiré receives the elements that ensured the success of the first film. In this way, the young girl takes Reno as a close relative of her family and asks him to take part in her wedding. <br /> <br /> Hard-working and disappointing continuation. In any case, what is the interest of this film, otherwise commercial? <br /> <br />
