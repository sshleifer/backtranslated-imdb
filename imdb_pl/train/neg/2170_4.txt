This film creates a thin line between satire and stupidity. While the bridges system, which has no rules, can promote marital harmony, it certainly can not promote the winning bridge, so the satire did not work for me. But I still found some things I liked, especially with the great bridge match between Paul Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk at the end of the movie. It is treated like a championship boxing match. Not only the arena of the competition is limited in a square field, like a boxing ring, a referee rises between players, and radio broadcaster Roscoe Karns provides constant talk about events. At some point, he even enumerates "One ... Two ... Three ... Four ..." as if the offer of four diamonds was a devastating event. And people were glued to their radios, which was a common event in the boxing matches of the championship. This parody worked very well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, few actors provide the comedy needed to sustain the intended satire. Paul Lukas does not have much talent for comedy and is poorly manned; adorable Loretta Young and the usual comic Frank McHugh did not get enough lines; Glenda Farrell has a nice comical phrase as a forgetful blonde at the beginning of the movie, but then virtually disappears. What a waste of talent!
