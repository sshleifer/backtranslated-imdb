Well, I can not go into the story, but maybe it's just me. Leading camera movements sometimes, but this movie has a charming vintage quality. Acting is sometimes authentic and entertaining with an occasional pursuit sequence involving sparsely clothed ladies, which was nice. The climax is confused and chaotic, but still ... mistaken for riveting Stella Stevens. <br /> <br /> Stunts are interesting, especially because of the 70's las vegas background. At the end there are some sudden camera movements that guess me for a moment. But I do not think I would be pursuing the DVD yet.
