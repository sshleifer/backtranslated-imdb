Jason Alexander is a great actor, but it's ridiculous to man him as a cozy, romantic hero. The fact that he dances so well bores so effectively and throws himself in such a complete role that he seemed even more frightening. In his more charming moments (with a girl at the train station, in the last issue with Rosie), I could not take my eyes off him, he was so repulsive. You still expect him to throw the act of a nice guy and start growling. Vanessa Williams was a real star, the only show that was better than the 1963 movie. By the way, if you see the production of the stage musical, the 1963 movie and the 1995 movie, you will see three versions that have more versions (different songs, the same songs assigned to different characters and in different situations) than any other musical ever I have seen.
