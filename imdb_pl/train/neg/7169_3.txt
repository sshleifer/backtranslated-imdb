This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. However, this little slave girl, Alice and Jared Harris, imitating Christopher Walken, makes this movie fun. Smoking, drinking alcohol and the amazing way Alice appears when her name is called is strange and interesting. I have to praise Jared for his imitation of Christopher Walken and Christopher Walken for being in the movie.
