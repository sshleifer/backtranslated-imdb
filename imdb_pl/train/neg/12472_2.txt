Imagine that you are turning the American national anthem into a cartoon. Throw in a few lovely animals, some horrible puns and a pair of roller skates, and you'll find yourself in an almost exact replica of this movie. <br /> <br /> I remember that I saw it when I was younger; I ordered my mother to borrow her from the video store about 5 times. The story itself is not so bad, just every Marxist would certainly complain. <br /> <br /> If you do not like America, you will not like this movie.
