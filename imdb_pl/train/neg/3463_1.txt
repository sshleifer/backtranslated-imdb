I saw this movie that night and I must honestly say it is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Acting is fair, but the plot is completely absurd. A killer was born because of all the "energy used to make a movie" and if the movie is burned, the killer will die? What is unbelievable? Characters were poorly developed to say at least ... for example, a man suddenly remembers, "Are not you trying to finish the movie because your mother could not?" So, should we put up with it? We had no idea it was her daughter until halfway through the movie. The film really did not pay attention to anyone, we did not know anything about the main survivors, except that Ringwald's character was a stupid actress, the guy was on set when people died and Raffy wanted to be a director like her mother. I'm not really diving to know who they are. It seemed that the case had been thrown just to get to the killings. The whole story is too poor for my taste and I was very disappointed. Anyone who likes this shit, of course, must learn something about making movies. I can not believe that anyone would agree to play and even work on this image. It is not funny, it was not scary and it was trivial in the whole movie. I found myself in a situation where I predicted what would happen in front of each scene, and I believe that it was not difficult for me. It is a disgrace and I am very sorry that I wasted an hour and a half looking at the mess. 1/10.
