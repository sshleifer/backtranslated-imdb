I really enjoyed the movie until the end. Sure, it was cheesy and unlikely, but it still caught my attention on a rainy afternoon. That is to say the end. What is the main character of her last performance at the prestigious classical conservatory in which she fought with other classically trained students? Wow them with her understanding and making this honorary musical tradition? No. He tortures and massages the great sensual Habanera from Carmen and turns her into a completely forgotten song Pop Brittany Spears. My ears were bleeding! And at the highest moment of horror her teachers gave her a standing ovation! Any teacher who was not in the fantasy of the Spears would fail her on the spot. Save your time, save your ears - skip this video!
