While exploring the caves with his wife, the doctor is bitten by a bat, which causes disturbing side effects ... Sometimes a terrible atmosphere and some decent (if not sufficiently used) effects of makeup do not save Horror B from being a veritable story about a man it becomes a creature. The Bat People aka It Lives By Night suffers from a nonsensical story that is clumsily plotted and colorless. It seems that the story is nowhere to be found, and the film never explains what is happening or even a satisfying conclusion. The cast is quite mediocre in their performances. <br /> <br /> I still give the film a few points for his haunted song and nice places to film. The make-up of the late Stan Winston is also quite good, but there are not many occasions. Certainly a missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> Definitely one of the smaller creations created by man. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
