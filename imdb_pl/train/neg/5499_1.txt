I saw this bomb when it hit theaters. I was laughing all the time. Why? Because this stupidity seemed crazy to me. I look back and realize that there was not ONE funny thing in the whole movie. Under no circumstances is it intentional. It's terribly funny that Lizzie cn chews on Nurplex and becomes a gigantic, carnivorous demon ... but her finely dressed little dress is completely intact, even though she's now hundreds of times bigger than her when she was first. Put it on. Or the type of film in which a man can be shocked by a defibrillator and only unconscious, and return to consciousness without ANY medical help. And do not let me start with the absurd fate of the "villain" who they decided to create a "conflict." Uh huh. <br /> <br /> To the person complaining that Disney only targets children - Strange parts of this movie seem to refute this statement. Do we really need Daryl Hannah accusing Jeff Bridges of having kinky video tapes? You do if you're Disney and you have no ideas for the movie to speak to a crowd of over 8 people without writing a smarter script! I am absolutely convinced that Disney pays for management, so his films can escape the murders and continue to get family-friendly assessments. <br /> <br /> What a waste of the DVD format.
