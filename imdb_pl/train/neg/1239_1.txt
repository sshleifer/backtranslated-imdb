Being a big fan of "other" PLANET OF THE APES movies, I hired this DVD despite my dislike of everything Tim Burton did. Once again, he does not fail in his inspired direction. Even monkey makeup looks like a second, which is unforgivable considering the monstrous budget of this monstrosity. Mark Wahlberg proves once and for all that he is not an actor (as if BOOGIE NIGHTS was not enough proof). I was ashamed of real talents like Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter. Undoubtedly, their salaries were motivation for them, because it could not be a prescriptive scenario. I rented this DVD for a special $ 1 per night and I still feel cheated.
