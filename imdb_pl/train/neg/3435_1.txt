I ordered this extremely rare and highly overrated movie on eBay with very high expectations. I think I paid about 50 $ for this movie. As an eternal horror fan, from the cheesy American slasher from the 1980s to European zombie movies, I told myself it would be great! I can not tell you how wrong I was. First of all, I thought it would be much better than it really is. After all that I heard about this film, I was almost afraid to watch it. Murders are boring. Acting ... forget, there is no acting! History, even if we do not care, is incredibly evil. It looks like they tried to attract your attention with strange sexual scenes and naked girls, but unfortunately the movie does not help in this case. Why? There is no atmosphere, and this is the worst in this movement. It's just a bad movie from point A to B. Although it is extremely fun and funny, when you watch them with your friends and many beers, do not make any effort to get on with it. There are so many movies in the world, do not waste time watching Necro files!
