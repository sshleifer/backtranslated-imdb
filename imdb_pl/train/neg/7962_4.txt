Sequins have a nasty habit of disappointment, and the best merit I can give is that it maintains this old tradition. These three stories are not as good as those from the original Creepshow. <br /> <br /> Definitely the best in the trio is a wooden idol who comes alive to get revenge on bandits who killed his owners. The second story is about the monster from the lake, which seems nothing more than a lot of floating streams, makes you wonder how anyone could be afraid of him. The third story contains an episode from Stephen King as a truck driver, but otherwise it is quite an unforgettable story of a road accident victim who returns from the dead for the person who knocked him down. <br /> <br /> Instead, look at the original Creepshow, or if you've already done so, be happy with it.
