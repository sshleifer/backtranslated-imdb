Wow ... without a word about creating this movie, I can not say much. Coverbox in the local videostore should say it all ... only 6 actors / actresses that get lost in the Scream set and decide to make a movie! <br /> <br /> Acting was not on the budget, but they could afford nakedness and handsome actors! The style over the substance is almost there, except that most of these actor-class failures still forget that there is a conspiracy that must go somewhere when reading this script. After only 4 or 5 killings by the so-called masked murderer and confusing story associated with the Murder Club, which stupid actress considers a real club to which he can join (only if he can beat a girl who falls on her car), you want to stab your hands the nearest sharp object to remind yourself that you will never be overly excited about such a good movie as this one. <br /> <br /> I feel bad because of the people who bought this movie and I can not find anyone who could take it off my hands. Another example of what is wrong with the growing number of horror movies straight to horror movies, without thinking about the essential elements. Throw it away if you bought it.
