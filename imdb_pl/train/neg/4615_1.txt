Perhaps I do not have the longest attention, but this is the second movie that I did not want to see all the time, and even bought it on DVD because of its "classic" status. <br /> <br /> At first I thought that the director was playing a big joke, so I was waiting for a solution to what to laugh about, something that interests me, but this resolution never came. Writing was rather ridiculously amateur, the film stretched and felt chaotically, as someone cut out a television series for full-length. The academy had to be on drugs when nominating the film for not less than eight Oscars. <br /> <br /> I repeat again. This is the second movie I did not want to watch all the time. The first was "Exterminator". I hope this will show you how bad it really is. 1/10
