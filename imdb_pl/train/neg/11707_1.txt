This TV movie from 2003 was of course shown on the women's channel. As a man, why do I even try to watch it? I do not know, but I should examine my head. And the director and writer Simon Gornick should be ashamed to give people injustice just like him. He takes away all the strength and conviction that a man could have had a few boring women made him. The number one is Joyce Hyser as a wife. I could not wait to drop it. Her revenge was stupid and stupid and very muddled throughout most of the movie. The second femme fatale was Nichole Hiltz, the coldest man you would ever want to meet. Her appearance did not guarantee that our leading man would manage her, and her acting was so obvious that only a fool would miss her. Definitely a loser. Temp Locke was quite good, but slow in approaching a slut seducing his own husband, he played again as a guy who is lost by David DeLuise. Completing our losses is Anthony Denison as the boss who has little to do, but he looks at our hero. Stephen Jenkins as our hero, or rather I should say the victim, was not so good. At first, I thought he was just a bad actor, but later I believed it. He never took a part off the ground and was repetitive all the time. Although as a man, I got angry when both women fled. Men, beware of this channel that plunges people, and women even run away from murder. LMN is a channel. Beware. Note: After seeing this mistake for the second time, I am convinced of my initial thoughts. Especially for the screenwriter / director Simon Gornicka. I still think that he has disgraced male species and should be beaten by a horse. The only saving grace in this movie is Tembi Locke, who has no chance to show his talents with the horrible effects of Jenkins, Hyser, Hittz and DeLuise around her. Plus a stupid plot that only makes the situation worse. Down with the movie Gornicka and his empty stars. Please, LMN do not show this banality.
