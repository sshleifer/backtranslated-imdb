Ever since I fell in love with the cartoon Inspector Gadget in the 80's, I went to see this movie. I wasted my money. The plot was very thin. In addition, the movie could not interest me for a long time. I am glad that this is the end. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the Inspector gadget, look at the cartoon instead. It was much better than a movie.
