The First Power (1990) was a horrible movie that appeared in the late 1980s and early 1990s in cheap horror production. I find this film very boring, but in some parts very funny. This movie does not have so much sense and credibility that it is not even funny. The rapid justice system in this film makes Texas look weak in comparison. In this role Lou Diamond Phillips is on the right track (playing on hard clay), and Tracey Griffith (more attractive sister Melanie) plays the psyche. Do not waste time on this because it is bad. What a minute, I'm going back. This movie creates a great party movie. Check the nun packing the crucifix, which has the most beautiful legs I have ever seen on a nun who were not in the film "Invisible Jesus". Yeow! <br /> <br /> It meant the end of the era for L.D.P. His star was tarnished and he could not pull the flies to the pile of dung. It was D.T.V. for him until his "ressurection" a few years later. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend unless you're desperate.
