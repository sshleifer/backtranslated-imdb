As fans of horror movies, we all know that renting blindly is shit shooting. Sometimes we find a real jewel, but many times we find that the movie we have just spent on our hard-earned money is nothing more than a rotting steamer that has deteriorated thanks to the completely undeserved enthusiastic reviews and prizes at the film festivals listed on the box. This is the case with Five Across the Eyes (title, which is certainly a double theme referring to both the budget of movies and coercion, which everyone who watches would have to use all five fingers to strike them). <br /> <br /> A story, or at least what they think * ahem * writers, focuses on a group of teenage girls who ill-advised to go to a funfair late at night after leaving a football match and run away from a crazy woman who He plays with the cat and mouse as punishment for what he thinks is found in a car on a fender bending machine in the parking lot of the gas station. <br /> <br /> In an honest way, it's an interesting idea. Some of the best horror movies have very simple storylines. It is in the performance of Five Across the Eyes that this idea collapses. The film attempts to be the intersection of The Blair Witch Project with its shaky camera image and Texas Chainsaw Massacre in its naked approach to material, but it manages to not be. Instead, we get unnecessary scenes of pursuit, torture, release; chase torture, spend, in this order for 94 minutes, with long intervals of bitching, moaning and incoherent vagabond, acting as a ton of complement between the pursuit sequences. <br /> <br /> The movie's appearance is incredibly grainy and dark, which in a better prepared film could strengthen the tension and realism. Here it is only annoying. Characters are undeveloped, and the viewer has difficulty finding anything that would be sympathetic to them. One character stops getting a first aid kit and has a tendency to scratch his face, while shots in the background indicate that her friends may be killed. Another girl is muttering funny silly lines, such as: "Do not go out there, she will get you, if she catches you, she will kill you, and if she kills you, you are dead." <br /> <br /> It was a distinction from the magazine Fangoria and Dreadcentral.com listed on the box that forced me to check it out. Talk about a false orgasm! Perhaps my expectations would be met if it was in the comedy section. I am for a low-budget independent horror, but this one has nonsense. Give Five Across the Eyes (or FATE? Get it?) Pass. <br /> <br /> RazorFriendly gives FATE 1 slash z pięć /
