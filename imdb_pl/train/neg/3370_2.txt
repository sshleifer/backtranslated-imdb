Only a stupid old movie. Stanwycek's first son imprisoned his foot in a really stupid way, and then her husband imprisoned his foot in another really stupid way. To save him, Stanwyck is unlucky again and meets an escapee. He has the chance to kill him, but he fails in a very stupid way. After all, her husband is saved, and Stanwyck tells us through a narrative of what the stupid message of the film is. Everything is better than the stupid end. <br /> <br /> I could never understand how an unattractive woman, like Stanwyck, ever made her a leading lady in the Hollywood sex-oriented era; This nose is so beautiful? So photogenic? The film is fortunately short, lasting a little over an hour. It's as if the director senses that he's making nonsense, so he thought it would be best to keep the bullshit short.
