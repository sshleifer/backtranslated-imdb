Summary: According to legend, Valkyrie Brunhild opposed Odin and was chained to a rock surrounded by eternal fire. Only a pure warrior in the heart can go through the flames, free Brunhilda and free her from Odin's claim and have it for herself. Now the war is in the Nordic lands, and the king needs an alliance with the Berserks. Berserkers are warriors claimed by Odin valkyrie, lusting for war, blood and body, and therefore outcasts, but higher in battle. The leader of the Berserkers is the despised son of the king, Dzik, and his price for the alliance is his brother, the future king, Barek. But after the victory of the king in the battle, he refuses to give away the only remaining son, breaking the oath of Dzik, betraying him and killing him. Wild boar only saves the call of Barka to Odin. But this is just the beginning of the struggle between the brothers, and their final battle is about to begin thousands of years later ... <br /> <br /> Comments: I was hoping it would be a movie based on some land of Vikings, too little quality film was made about Vikingu. It started very well, with detailed longships and armors, nice and fitted scenes and OK battle. <br /> <br /> The basis of the Aesir myths is thin and seems to me very broken. Odin is much more vindictive, malicious and absent than I remind him from school, and the fights have been turned into vampire demons. I'm not an expert, but it seems completely wrong. <br /> <br /> But the fatal mistake made by this movie is to shift the time setting from the original period to today. If both brothers fought at the right time, with a few decent battles, this movie would be much better. Now the setting suddenly changes to today's Stockholm. Nevertheless, Odin is present and sends Boar and his berserkers to Brunhilda and Barka, which gives stupid scenes when dressed in armor and painting Berserkers battles with Barka among the industries. Beautiful mountains and forests have been converted into cement. And when allowed to focus on individual duels, instead of mass battles as in the beginning, I quickly noticed that the fights and skills of the actors are slow and clumsy. <br /> <br /> The end result is sometimes a thin story difficult to follow, and sometimes stupid, and the only thing that could save him, action, comes from slow, boring and clumsy swordfights. It draws very little from the Aesir myth or the tradition of the Vikings. So the story and the action fail, and the movie is just bad. <br /> <br /> Finally, as a Swede, this movie is a bit confusing. Apparently filmed entirely in South Africa, it still contains some famous Swedish characters, boards and what appears to be an authentic police car. However, the effort is weak and goes so far as to really happen in Sweden. No names are Swedish (maybe Anya as an exception), no known sceneries are Swedish, (apparently) speak a bit (ancient?) Norwegian, not Swedish. And uniforms, both police and medical, are not clearly Swedish. If they did not even try to do it correctly - and really give the illusion that it is happening in Sweden, why bother? <br /> <br /> 4/10
