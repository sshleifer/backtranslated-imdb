How best to express your feelings about this movie: hideous? Headache? no consistent writing? ordinary stupidity? Try it all for this parody. And that's just for the direction. <br /> <br /> History? Well, I think there is a story. Two silly blondes are looking for a job after they collide with a plane on a golf course. They are confused with the "renounced murderer of the world" (sarcasm) and are "rented" by two "gangsters". It is believed that "taking him" means a date, while the other has a smaller actor he's dreaming about. And of course, a turtle's reserve for an earthen turtle, which they build thanks to the casino winnings. <br /> <br /> Sounds all this can be fun? Guess again. They try it fun but it is not. Movie sequences are not well made. I've seen better filming in Hong Kong movies. The graphics are average for the film from the late 1980s. But the problem is that it's a 2007 movie. <br /> <br /> It's not worth my time to watch it again. He still does not beat Danny Glover's "Out" movie from the early 1980s as the worst movie of all time, but on the other hand, the film is a class in itself. "FA"
