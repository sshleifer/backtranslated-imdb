It's a bad movie in every standard. The history at Match Point had a certain intrigue, and the direction and writing of a certain fascination (Woody Allen mixing his own culture with the classic English murder and investigating what can be done with it). <br /> <br /> Scoop, however, does not have this. It's poorly written, two wires are hopelessly wooden, and the story itself has no interest. A genre that falsifies requires at least some plunder with witty explanations and connections (why are tarot cards and keys kept under French horns in enclosed spaces?). <br /> <br /> Gorgeous and witty versions of Allen, different genres of Hollywood (Curse of the Jade Scorpion / Purple Rose of Cairo, etc.) have given us so much pleasure over the years. Even Hollywood Ending had a great idea. Unfortunately, his inspiration left him this time.
