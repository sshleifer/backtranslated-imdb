Recognized Japanese director Takashi Miike can not make circles move because of this hopeless thriller, adaptation of Yasushi Akimoto's book about a bad old woman (and the perpetrator of children!) Which is part of a new urban legend: if your mobile phone rings in a strange tone - and you'll see the message "One missed call" - you will repeat the message just to hear your last words before you die. The most successful part of the movie is the defiant satire from the Reality television cameras, which bothers future victims, but not too complicated deaths (including a hidden piece of red candy!). They are disappointing and discouraging. Frequent shots of ravaged dead bodies are in fact discreetly presented, and this general kindness can be the reason why the film is so stable. Hollywood predictably jumped on a far-fetched plot in 2008, but the American version did not perform better. NO STARS WITH ****
