There are many problems associated with this film that make it disappear like a low-budget class project from someone from the film school. But I must acknowledge him for his abundance. Many times throughout the film, I laughed hysterically. Sometimes it was so bad that it was comical, which made it a funny watch. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a low quality slasher movie with a bit of psychological horror and a bit of dingy, then throw a bowl of popcorn, invite some friends and have fun. <br /> <br /> I agree with other comments that the sound is very bad. The dialog box is almost impossible to track most of the time, and the soundtrack is right there.
