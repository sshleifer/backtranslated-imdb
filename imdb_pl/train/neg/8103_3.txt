It's probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I do not care what critics say, it's bad. I think the problem lies in Kundera's novel. It's not that it's not possible; it is so that 99% of his work is pretentious and exaggerated. It looks like he is in love with himself, his characters look like a navel, and his novels as a whole are misogynistic. I have read many of his works (even his socialist realism poems. It was really horrible) - I just do not understand what's in this mess. Characteristic features (such as self-absorption) in his novels cause irritating reading. In the film, all the things I do not like about Kundera have been enlarged. Maybe I missed something, but I do not think so. By the way, I can not believe that this is a Criterion Collection disc. This film is NOT necessary.
