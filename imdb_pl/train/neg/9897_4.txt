I think it's a good movie to devote your time, but not by accident about any historical value. Cleopatra's portrait reminded me of a cheap soap opera. <br /> <br /> The return of facts is ... funny! She was born while feeding her people!?!? Please ... The pregnant Queen of Egypt (especially this one) would not bother to go from one room to another because of that! They tried to make her a saint for God's sake! And the way they tried to justify her murdering her sister ... except the description. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra was the greatest politician of her time. Her decisions were based solely on feelings and morals. She did everything for two reasons: power and self-maintenance! She was transferred to the family where she had to fight for survival, something she did very well. Everything that stood in her way was either murdered (her brothers and sister) or seduced (Ceasar and Marek Antoni). So it was its end ...
