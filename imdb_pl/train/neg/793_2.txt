I was not sure how to rate this movie because it was so bad it was very funny. I am not a fan of Gackt in any way, although he is talented, despite a strange pseudonym, which sounds like a cat coughing hair. I always thought that Hyde is talented, Faith is an interesting album. <br /> <br /> But about people here. This movie is funny. It is so oversized and senseless that it resembles a parody of supernatural action movies. <br /> <br /> The movie has almost no story, but it's about vampires with gangster friends. In a sense, this movie almost reminded me of Spider-Man 3, as there were too many ideas, which meant that there was not enough time to pay attention to one of them. <br /> <br /> The action scenes were funny. Quickly edited, almost difficult to understand, with choreography that is so ridiculously bad. Although Hyde looked very stylish during action scenes, but it's just a movie. I am a sucker of good action movies, but the action was terribly done. Although the last shootout was fine and the most important element of this depressing movie. <br /> <br /> Still jumping between species, not good. He wants to be a drama, action movement, horror or romance ... what the hell. <br /> <br /> If this review drives you crazy, why? Is it because Gackt and Hyde are your love? Do not fool yourself, this movie is bad.
