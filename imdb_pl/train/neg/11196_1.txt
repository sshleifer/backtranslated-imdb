My friends and I left after 15 minutes and we were not the first. Then we tried to get our money back. Cinema management did not allow it, but they agreed to see another film. The only time that worked for us is to see Dickie Roberts: The Former Baby Star. As you can see, it was not an unforgettable night. Probably one of my worst movie nights. A close second must be when I saw the double header Domestic Disturbance and Heist. To sum up, please do not see the Order for the good of humanity.
