A film about a group of filmmakers who want to make a documentary about a new type of surfing in shark-infested waters. As an absolute movie fan, including some malicious animals or monsters, I thought it could be my kind of movie ... it was not !!! This should be a better indication of how not to do it! It has a lot of accidental humor, and the evil beast is an amazing joke, in the final scene goes for the main characters * rolling *, the feet apparently wave in the air! It looks funny! Good for laughter. If only the lack of talent between actors, embarrassingly silly dialogue and comically stupid crocodile would be at least worth laughing, but it is even worse: I guess that the people responsible for the film noticed how weak he was, so they were thinking about the old idea of ​​"sex sells". .. I totally mean TOTALLY without any reason one of the main actresses shows his beast's breasts. And somewhere in the beginning there is a senseless "makeout". This is the last ingredient that makes the film an absolute trash for me. It's amazing how people spend their time producing such garbage! If you are looking for a real loss of time: watch this movie !!!
