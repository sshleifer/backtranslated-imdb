What more can I say? Acting was almost without exception. Direction and continuity were pathetic. Sceenplay was predictable up to the last scene, and the dialogue was boring. One of the functions on the DVD was marked as "Gag Reel", but it could be a description of the viewer's reaction to the majority of the film. <br /> <br /> One of the most fun things was in the director's comments on DVD. He said with a simple expression that he decided to make a movie with high production values ​​and name - and that he did it. With such delusions, it is easy to understand how the film has gone. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most disappointing aspect was the monster. The suit of the dark wolf was a modified monkey suit (according to the "creation" function on DVD) and rather looked like. The mask and claws were a little better than the shelves from any costume shop. The cgi effects were painfully obvious and had quality similar to an inexpensive video game.
