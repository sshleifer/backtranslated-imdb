The basic film premise, 3 young ladies destroy their car and stay with a terrifying family. YAWN. <br /> <br /> Watching 36 minutes of feeling the OJ car chase with white sedan instead of bronco. YAWN. <br /> <br /> An elderly lady with hot and cold dementia controlling her daughter ... YAWN <br /> <br /> 23 minutes watching eating actors - YAWN Trying to figure out what the hell they are eating ... OK, it can be here gra o piciu ... nie - YAWN <br /> <br /> Free scenes with a shower ... OK interested me for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Totally random and boring killings ... YAWN <br /> <br /> Finishing ... old! this psycho is insane - why the rest of the movie can not be like the last 5 minutes ... unfortunately it is - My advice - fast forward to the last five minutes and watch it, then put something good in the player - I come back to sleep for me.
