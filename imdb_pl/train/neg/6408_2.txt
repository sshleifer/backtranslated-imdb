UPA films are surprisingly well rated on IMDb, although the quality of animation is many years behind the quality of Looney Toons, Disney and MGM. Unfortunately, due to the growing costs of creating nice cartoons with a large number of frames per second and beautiful backgrounds, the UPA style (which debuted around 1950) began to dominate at the end of the 1950s and 1960s. In the end, the films were cheap to produce and received several Oscars to "prove" that animated films are now mainstream. As a result, wretched animation has become the norm and this trend has not been reversed until the 1980s. <br /> <br /> This UPA film is one of the first. The characters are very simple (easier and would use figurines with sticks), and the backgrounds were ugly - simple line drawings with colors added in a very simple way (often a sponge and rarely completely filling objects). <br /> <br /> When it comes to the story, it's a story with a strong approach to jazz style. Some will love it, others will find it very, very loud. This is the traditional story of "Frankie and Johnny", and because of the shooting and everything, it's probably not a great movie for children. Heck, because of animation and jazz, this is not a particularly good movie for me! Some will read my review and no doubt I think I am a crank (to some extent I am). However, I love animated films and some of this minimalistic style of UPA goes very, very long and you can not seriously treat them as great works of art - just very, very quickly created fairy tales. Ignore the Oscars and try to watch classic cartoons or something else!
