** SPOILERS ** KHAMOSH is completely unrealistic, he lacks a plot and was essentially created just to see himself portraying the stars. The most tense scene in the movie was that Shabana Azmi is in the shower, and then we see her TV playing on the stage in the shower with PSYCHO. This film actually expected users to believe that Naseeruddin Shah's character had enough memory to remember where shots were shot and how many! <br /> <br /> *** THE SPOILER'S BEGINNING *** <br /> <br /> Finally, the killer spills his insides on Shabana Azmi long enough to let Naseeruddin Shah run and shoot him! <br /> <br /> *** THE END OF SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> At the beginning it is a bit fun (just a little bit) to hear the director and cast members throw off insults and hear Shabana Azmi exclaims: "Oh sh-t!" <br /> <br /> In general, baaaaaaaaaaad movie! <br /> <br /> Rating: ** from ********** (2 of 10)
