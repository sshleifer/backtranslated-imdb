"A Christmas Story" is one of the most beloved films of many people. ACS was able to bring the viewer to the time and place in a way that few films ever had. He had sweetness and goodwill, which is rare. <br /> <br /> So I expected (and expected) his continuation of "It Runs In The Family". The film was almost released several times, just to get it out at the last minute. When it finally came out, IRITF was (and I think) a total failure. <br /> <br /> The scenes and photos were fine, but the directing completely missed. The film was nothing more than a formula of cash flow of lazy casting, lazy writing and unrelated acting. <br /> <br /> Narrator, Jean Shepard, who was one of the great American humorists and storytellers of history, we were forced to make a false repetition of the warm joke he used in ACS. He abused emotions and why he did it, I will never know. He managed to somehow become an irritating, overgrown parody of himself. <br /> <br /> Writing and working in IRITF is inauthentic and forced. Actors could see ACS, but any humor and nuance found in ACS could not be registered at any of them. Acting was embarrassingly slapstick and devoid of any Shepard's dry humor. <br /> <br /> ACS will always be a real treasure, but calling the IRITF sequel is supposed to insult all fans of Jean Shepard and ACS.
