Wow, what can I say about this movie? It's a bad piece of nonsense. I'm surprised he was rated as high as he was. What's wrong with this movie? Here's a better question: what's wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> The story itself is simply nonsense and banality. It's all about what's going on ... A nervous kid without friends is taken, killed and returned as a scarecrow. "Everything" is packed in 86 minutes of worthless film. If you have not seen this movie, do not waste time watching it. Also the second one is not much better, so do not worry about watching this ... I rated this movie as three, because I liked the scarecrow outfit, not because there was something good in the film. I think you know what's going on.
