Several unrealistic film spoilers included. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, this film has disappointed from real life experiences. I am currently deployed on my second route to Iraq as an infantry man. This movie has nothing that could happen in real events. From the very beginning, just name a few: a bomb bunk, EOD elements rolling solo without escorts, EOD sergeant sneaking with VBC, all rolled-up sleeves at ACU, to which I had to call my $ 2 haji copy, a sniper scene. However, the list would be continued, but you do not have to exchange things badly within 2 minutes, before more things were wrong; and it was about it. <br /> <br /> This video is for people and critics to watch who have no understanding or experience with deployment or army. <br /> <br /> People with a military background or knowledge of the military will be disappointed by inaccuracies.
