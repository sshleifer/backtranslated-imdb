It's such a strange movie, you can call it horrible or if you sit with your friends, it can be a deadly laugh. It's strange to think of me. Shooting amateurishly, it worked even worse, and directions, maybe none. Special effects are fun, but the music accompanying the flying demon will surely be the biggest hit. See if you have time to kill. But no, do not even try to take it seriously. He was to be a tribute to "Holocaust porn." Because I have not seen this, I can assume that he is equally bad. He should have given 1/10, but he gave me a good laugh or two, so he gets 3. Excess gore, the only thing someone has worked on. Stay away if you're sensitive, more burning than laughing. I wonder if the creators had laughter doing it?
