It's the worst movie I've ever seen. I watched this movie with friends and after 40 minutes we had enough. The plot was bad and there was not one nice character. I could get more entertainment by watching statically. I gave this movie only 1 because the scale did not contain negative numbers. Avoid this movie at all costs.
