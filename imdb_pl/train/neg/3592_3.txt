In the show for fans, I have to admit that Hidden Frontier is not so bad. However, the review of this series can not be based on whether it is a series of fans or not. The initiative itself is commendable. Creativity too. I think that these are people with ordinary work and great enthusiasm for Star Trek. But doing all this work. I'm pulling out all these resources. Taking all this time and still all these disadvantages. <br /> <br /> First of all, acting, and the lines are terrible. For majority. Dialogues belong to the military show from the 70s, not in Star Trek. Captain (Mr Squinty) looks like he's going to laugh at any moment. And most of the characters just read their poems. Directors should be aware that "repetition" is not just a word in the dictionary. But I also suppose that the series was created in the style of "Two Takes Frakes", which directed many episodes and films by TNG. I could not help thinking that most of the actors are typical Trekkies. Without going deeper into this assumption. <br /> <br /> My greatest concern related to the entire project is the quality of the publishing houses. When they first decided to spend so much time and resources in this series - why did not they provide it in decent quality? Using a fast time format at a low low resolution is wasting talent. Even "high" episodes are considered poor quality compared to standard series of qualities. Using the Xvid codec, with higher resolution and file size, would greatly improve the experience. If the problem appeared in the team, setting up a torrent tracker would solve this problem. <br /> <br /> Let's hope that the crew will decide to brush the series and maybe release it on a DVD, giving it the quality it deserves.
