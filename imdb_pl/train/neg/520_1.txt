After counting the use of the word f, oh, about 22 times in the first 10 minutes of the movie, we listened really bad actors about the woman and the horse, and we behaved like 12-year-olds being naughty together, well, we turned it off. Relying on unfounded vulgarisms and nocturnal humor is a sure sign of a lost Hollywood movie that is a product of writers with no imagination and no talent. <br /> <br /> We gave him a second chance, thinking for sure that it would be better. There are no bones. Later, my boyfriend jumped the rest of the movie in case he got better, still boneless. <br /> <br /> The main character had a nice bike. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it to anyone except maybe immature teenagers or boys' brothers.
