Before Stan Laurel became the smaller half of all-time greatest comedy group, he worked under a contract with Broncho Billy Anderson in a low-cost series, many of which were parody of Hollywood's main features. After a dispute with Anderson, Laurel continued an informal series of parody in the smaller (and more indigent) production company of Joe Rock. <br /> <br /> Most of Laurel's parody films were just a bit funny and even less fun for the modern audience who did not see the original movie, which Laurel parody. "West of Hot Dog" is quite a vague parody of cowboy shooters. This is a peculiarly specific parody of "West of the Pecos", an oater released two years before without major actors. Because "West of the Pecos" has never been a great success, it is difficult to understand why the movie unit of Stan chose this particular movie as the purpose of their lampoon, and even more so why they waited so long after its release to parody it. Where did they get the title "West of Hot Dog"? Perhaps this is due to the fact that "Hot dog!" Was a sexual preference preferred by American lechers in the 1920s. (Like in the scene opening the stage play "Machinal".) <br /> <br /> "West of Hot Dog" was produced and directed by Joe Rock. Among many other achievements Rock introduced Laurel Lois Neilson, and then he was the best man at their wedding. Full disclosure: In the last years of my life, I had the privilege of making friends with Joe Rock and interviewing him. Almost ninety years ago Rock's memory was impressively clean ... but he did not remember anything about "West of Hot Dog" and I can not blame him. This film is extremely forgotten. <br /> <br /> The protagonist of the main character is Little Mustard: If this is to be a parody of something in "West of the Pecos", I do not understand it. There are several "impossible" gags, including the Laurel method for mounting a horse. For a moment in this movie, Stan Laurel reminded me of the great Buster Keaton when he suddenly started running. "West of Hot Dog" is somewhat similar in theme and sound to Keaton's short comedy "The Frozen North", but the Keaton version is much more fun. The plot of the film is a bit ahead of the Keatonon film "Our Hospitality", but (again) suffers by comparison: here, two hard Varmint brothers expect to inherit the Last Chance Saloon, but the previous owner wrote him in poor condition Stan. However, the brothers will become legal heirs if Stan dies. Hmmm ... <br /> <br /> Seriously: is this legal? As soon as Stan takes possession of the property, certainly any further ownership or inheritance issues will become his decision, not the previous owner's decision. I had plenty of time to consider such legal issues while watching this boring comedy. <br /> <br /> At some point the gag is associated with some primitive animation, directly imposed on the footage. It looks cheap and is not fun. <br /> <br /> This "Hot Dog" is not a mill and no winner: it's just a moan. My rating: one point out of 10. Hold on, Stan: in a few years you'll be half the legend of the comedy.
