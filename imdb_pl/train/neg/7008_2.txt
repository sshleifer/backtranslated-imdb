Annie Potts is the only attraction of this really boring movie. Mark Hamill plays a teenager who is really upset that someone stole Corvette and his colleagues have changed into hotrod (probably the ugliest looking car that appeared in the movie) and goes to Las Vegas with Annie to track down the evil genius he stole his pride and joy. <br /> <br /> I would break my eyes after watching it were it not for playing with watching Anna Potts in a very early role, and it's also bad for Hamill that he did not take some acting lessons from her. Danny Bonaduce also creates a silly scene.
