I will probably always go to see Woody Alleb's film, because you never know when it can simply return to its former size. Only one or two great moments or lines can make it worth it. Unfortunately, this movie just does not get any result. Talking thar really makes me sad and even guilty. I'm sure that my reaction is very similar to many other Woody fans, but what can you say? He should probably concentrate on his clarinet, which in my opinion is quite good. Saying all this, I will probably go to every new movie that Woody can come out with in the future. There is always hope and I will still love and respect WOODY !!
