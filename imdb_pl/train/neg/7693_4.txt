Is there anything that can NOT be predicted in this movie? I think not. Basically, the movie is trivial after banal and really nothing is a surprise. This makes the film extremely predictable and therefore the film is also severely devoid of tension. So for a thriller it's not tight enough and unpredictable, but as a drama it's a failure. This is because its history is unlikely. I mean, it can not happen in real life in any way, just like in the case of this movie. The film has a real problem with faith and credibility. <br /> <br /> But it's really the stereotypes that killed the movie. Sometimes it was a bullet. In this movie, everything is so formal. The predator is depicted as a cold, soulless, almost psychopath, like a frustrated boy and victim as a naive young woman who behaves as if she did not see anything like that. Everything that happened in the film was so obvious and it seemed that everything was happening for a reason. Such as the sequence in which the "predator" repairs the broken car of the "victims". It must be one of the oldest stereotypes from the book. I knew what the film tried to achieve after this point. I tried to look as if the teacher and student really were approaching each other through the eyes of other people around them. It was so unbelievably obvious and cheap that I almost wanted to stop watching the movie after this point. The film is full of such moments. <br /> <br /> The title may suggest that it is a cheap porn movie, but in reality it is a bad television movie. Which means that everything happens slowly and the movie spends half the time for character development and unnecessary threads to make the film even more dramatic. <br /> <br /> I admit that Elizabeth Berkley is quite good. in this movie. It makes some stereotypes and events look almost realistically. Her Hollywood career is as good as after the appearance of "Showgirls" in Paul Verhoeven's movie, so unfortunately she will probably only appear in movies and TV series like this one. It is a waste of her talent and certainly deserves better. All other characters are a disappointment. Corey Sevier plays a banal, nice, "untouchable" rich boy, and the way in which the main character's husband is depicted is even worse. It looks more like a sexually frustrated predator than a real predator of a movie. In principle, he tries to have sex with his wife in every sequence. He wakes up, wants sex. Before he goes to sleep, he wants sex. He returns home, wants sex. It may be realistic, but I do not know, it just was not appropriate for a movie like this one and for history in general. <br /> <br /> A film filled with cliches and I can not think for any reason anyone should ever watch this movie. It is predictable and therefore lacks tension and credibility. It is not a "scary" movie and it is certainly visible at times, but all the weak and film elements of the film also make it far from commendable. <br /> <br /> 4/10
