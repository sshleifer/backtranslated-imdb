A damp story about the American Revolution. <br /> <br /> When the farmer "Tom Dobb" (Al Pacino) and his son come to New York Harbor, they are immediately put on by the lovely Annie Lennox ... Annie Lennox? .. contribute to the war effort. <br /> <br /> After he was cut off by pieces of a chain link fired from British cannons, Tom and his son were immediately punished by the "Daisy" sympathizer of the Continental Army ("Nastassja Kinski") for "do not stand". Following Kodak, a series of digressive chapters takes place, including Tom's participation in the "foxhunt", in which he must wear the model of "poor old Georgie Washington" dressed in the likeness when he escapes from an English captain wielding a lace handkerchief) and organize a barbecue with a group Iroquois Indians who plan the best way to get back into the fight so that Al and his ungrateful kid can dig the shit of the British officer Donald Sutherland. <br /> <br /> Director Hugh Hudson presents a unique style of film making, and the atmosphere is as dense as the proverbial mist of London, but the image of the writers in the form of sinister monsters once again reveals Hollywood's patented hatred of the British. <br /> <br /> Steven Berkoff appears as an American soldier.
