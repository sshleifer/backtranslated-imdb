I was looking at a video store everywhere to find this movie, being a huge Elvis fan I am, and I found it a huge disappointment. Kurt Russel had most of the "Elvis moves", and the imitation of the voice was great, but Elvis's voice-chanted voice just did not work. the voice did not always match the russels mouth and it was difficult to get lost in the story because it bothered me that it was noticeable. Besides, there were so many strange discrepancies in the movie that people who do not know much about Elvis would probably consider them to be facts. songs are sung by him earlier than he recorded them in real life, the time when he got his first guitar is bad, I am sure that his brother jesse garron was buried in an unmarked grave, not a great gravestone reading JESSE GARRON. I know it was just a TV movie, but they missed important events, such as special ones, and dragged a few scenes for too long. if you want to see a good movie that shows Elvis in his main rent, THATS THE WAY IT IS, or another Elvis concert. listening to and watching a real Elvis preform is the only way to really see his talent. (brilliant statement, I know, but still ... go out and rent a good elvis flic.)
