Some funny humor, some fall flat, some decent acting, some quite monstrous. This movie is simply a hit and a lack, guaranteeing the amusement of 12-year-old boys more than any other niche. <br /> <br /> The children of the actors in the film are just fine. When you create a family comedy, this is a problem. Beverly D'Angelo rises above the material to give a funny and dare to say human performance in the midst of this mediocrity.
