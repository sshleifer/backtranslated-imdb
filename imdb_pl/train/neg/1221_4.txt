I remember the times when Kim Basinger was nothing more than a pretty face that decorated the movies with the typical characters of stupid Blondie, romantic interests or a lady in danger. excellent LA Confidential film and I think I was not the only one who was surprised by its solid performance. However, after this moment her career did not follow the perfect path. Of course, the prestige that she gained thanks to this film has made me participate in moderately prestigious films (such as People I Know or The Door in the Floor), but we have never seen it again in a significant way. The film "When she was out" does not do it in this situation; and not only that her character is not very tasty, but also that the film is really bad. The script from this movie can not be more empty and basic. However, Basinger brings some conviction to his character, and that makes him poor. This film is full of clich√©s and general villains. The work of director Susan Montford is really disastrous for many reasons, but mainly because the film never has a good rhythm and tone. The end of this movie is extremely funny. I do not recommend it when it was. This film commits the sin of the sin of being boring.
