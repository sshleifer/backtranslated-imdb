I have no idea what fool from San Francisco this stupid conspiracy was born from, but apparently they have to get out of the drugs they take and put their analyst on dangerous money - NOW. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a reliable story if you think that the sequence of alien abductions in "Brian's Life" is credible. <br /> <br /> This movie is little more than a leftist monster. If the US and the USSR gave up nuclear weapons, the result would be to eliminate the only real obstacle that would prevent them from a war. Wrong, like Korea, Vietnam and other wars of those times, were "substitute wars" that were aimed at stopping superpowers from direct involvement. <br /> <br /> This movie makes me wonder how realistic it was when a group of high school kids would start a hunger strike against the proliferation of nuclear weapons. If someone said, "Mr. President, some children in Drastic High do not eat!" Ronald Reagan would answer, "My God! I'd better improve my defense policy! "Right. <br /> <br /> Do you like this movie? Would not it be better if the Soviet Union collapsed because they could not support their powerful weapons ... wait, it happened!
