RATING STARS: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Twitch prisoner (Kurupt) is transferred to a heavier prison than re-opened Alcatraz. He claims to be closer to his lady, but his real motives are a bit bigger. There he crosses Burke (Bill Goldberg) with a massive prisoner who can take care of himself. Twitch, although he is less muscular, is equally saucy and almost the same. But between the black and Latin prisoners there is a gang war that will explode in a hostile prison takeover when the black gang leader is shot and the finger pointed at Burke. But sh! T really hits the fans when a real killer and Latinos leader, Cortez (Robert Madrid) takes Twitch's girlfriend and hostage to Burke's daughter. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal does not make sequels (apparently very contrary to the idea of ​​Under Siege 2 and agreeing to do it only on condition that the film company with which he was then allowed to direct his own film), so despite this, that this is a sequel to the DVD, the main role this time is Bill Golberg (Steve does not even appear on some of the film material from the first movie, which appears late.) But there is a reason why he did not do much work from Universal Soldier 2, and it's because he's not an actor, and he's not a star of action, he's a character that starts very dark and thoughtful, but he's undoubtedly turned into a standard action hero, awkwardly repulsed boring one-pack. Support smart, veterans from the first movie, Kurupt and Tony Plana, just jumped for a chance to do extra work. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that has tried quite well to copy the style of the original, with poor lighting, dark shadows and rap music. He does it quite well, unfortunately he can not compete with the obscene hero, equally cardboard villain and apathetic history, which the creators seem to think very much. **
