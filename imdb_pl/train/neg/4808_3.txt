Ok, I've seen a lot of movies about witches and occultism, but this one was just weird. This film starts with the fact that the cult of witches led by the really evil Orson Wells playing the main role (if they did not have someone who would look more like a satanist) simply did not belong to the movie. But in any case, the Sabbath takes a new member and stabs a doll that reminds someone and makes him have a miscarriage. The lady who had a miscarriage and her husband set out on a bus to a place called Lillith, and the woman in the meantime sees the image of her sister or anyone she calls on, and warns her to stay away from her and never use her powers there or she will die. A couple after settling in a strange city discovers that all residents are witches, and she becomes nosy and is afraid of all her neighbors and friends. Then strange things begin to happen when a woman discovers a funeral taking place on a hill that suddenly disappears (it was frightening), and also seeing a small boy belonging to Orson Wells on the playground, who later asks a woman for help to live. The lady is soon trying to escape the city, but only to be trapped by its inhabitants and powers, and ignores everything that the ghost is trying to warn her about. This movie is fine, it has moments of uncertainty, but it really could have done a lot better than having Orson there.
