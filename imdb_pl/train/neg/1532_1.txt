Although I was properly warned, I sat down to watch this movie. In part because I usually give each movie an even break, and because I thought one movie could not be so bad. I was corrected. Even George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick and Ben Stein could not save this turkey from drowning like a ton of bricks. Only once in this humor I laughed, abandoning the parody of a parody. Namely, during Simon, the stage is said. Other jokes are either poorly carried out or simply indistinct. And some of them you actually see when they are a mile away. This movie just does not have what it takes to be a good parody, like a plane! (I + II), Naked Gun (I + II + III) or Scary Movie. They all had A. funny gags, B. good dialogue and the most important of all C. unforgettable quotes. Men in white do not have D. none of the above. To call this movie bad would be a gross negligence. AVOID THIS FILM ANYTHING YOU CAN! BELIEVE YOUR WARNING!
