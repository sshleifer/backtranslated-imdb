"Triumph of Love" is proof that not every author of Comédie-Française, who uses disguised courtship, such as Shakespeare, is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Or maybe something got lost in the translation of this adaptation of Marivaux, the commedia inspired by Commedia Dell Arte, about which Brittannica talks: "His nuanced feeling and wise wordplay has become known as marivaudage." <br /> <br /> While Mira Sorvino has a great time hanging out on three rumpled romances, her role in pants has not even matched Cherubino in "Figaro Marriage." <br /> <br /> Herky-jerky edit is annoying and seems to indicate that many shots were needed for each long speech. <br /> <br /> The best of them was Fiona Shaw as a fool, as well as costumes. <br /> <br /> A glance at the audience we see and closing the curtain to narrow our eyes that this is all a trick really does not help. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 5/29/2002)
