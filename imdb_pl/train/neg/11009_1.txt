I rated this movie as AWFUL (1). After watching the trailer, I thought that this movie could be pretty cool. "I guarantee insulting ... everyone!" The trailer said. Well ... it offended me, because this movie really sucks. This is not a comedy because I laughed for two seconds during the whole movie. And what about all the gays in this movie? I'm not gay and I have no problem with those who are, but why add so many gay scenes in the so-called comedy movie, when these scenes are absolutely not fun? I think the director is gay in denial or something like that. <br /> <br /> So my advice to you is: if you want to waste good money, go to rent a good comedy that you saw One million times better than watching this "Mother from all over the world". This is really nonsense.
