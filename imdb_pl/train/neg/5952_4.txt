You realize that you are watching EXACT SAME SHOW for eight years, right? I could understand that the initial curiosity about seeing strangers exists on the Island, but one would think that after seeing the neglected, sad characters run rough through the bush with a spoon on the spoon for half a decade, you would have to engage in something more original (and interesting). <br /> <br /> And I'm not even talking about the importance of exhibitions, which I consider doubtful for the album. It is difficult to suspend disbelief about the "bushy bill" eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and people from cameras is in the air-conditioned make-shift cup, sipping a frosty mochcinno from moxy. <br /> <br /> What's the appeal here? I do not care about people or their meandering life. I just do not understand it. But if it turns out that you are charmed by hairy, unwashed people, I suggest that you turn off the TV and just go to the local bus station, where you can see such people in their real environment. They call them PEOPLE PEOPLE and they can sit down for free and admire their incredible ability to extract a lot of cigarettes from a lot of trash cans, ultimately hitting "pay dirt" and creating a home-made Frankenstein-style club, all the while begging people for a change, when the stench of Aqua Velva on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise. And the best part? Like Survivor, every week one member of the tribe "leaves" the "island" when he is unceremoniously sent to the local institution, when a terrifying, non-diseased state of full schizophrenia begins to work! Now THIS ENTERTAINMENT!
