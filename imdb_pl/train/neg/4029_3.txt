The idea for the story THE LOST MISSILE is not bad at all, but unfortunately the story becomes a bit boring in the middle and overuse of the film material, as well as weak special effects, sink the film below the par. /> <br /> The film begins with a projectile moving towards Earth. In panic, because it is going to hit the Earth, the Soviets manage to bounce back the object. This is not necessarily good, however, because this seemingly unmanned ship has a steam trail that destroys everything in its path AND the ship is now in a low orbit over the planet. In other words, there is a death swath at every pass - one that can potentially kill us all !! So good scientists from the USA (directed by very young and little-recognizable Robert Loggia) should formulate and plan to save us - especially save New York, which is on the direct flight path! Unfortunately, they are not able to save Ottawa (I have never been there, so I can not say if it is a big loss), but thanks to the good old American know-how, they are able to finally destroy this destruction !! <br /> <br /> So, as you can see, the idea for a story is not bad and rather original. But so many old fighter jets and guys operating radar ranges are getting a bit old and it seemed like padding. In general, a decent but uninspired movie that can appeal to extreme fans of the genre - everyone else sees it at their own risk.
