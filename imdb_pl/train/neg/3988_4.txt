In short: <br /> <br /> Spike Lee is clearly on his mind. Thoughts of racist color, media and hegemony, consumerism and capitalism, religion, sexism, "hetero-sexism", drug war policy, etc. ... <br /> <br /> This level of awareness is own is great. I think it's a blessing that more and more people are deciding to critically analyze the basic aspects of our everyday lives; quiet and invisible forces that govern our societies. However, the fact that Lee makes controversial films does not make him a good filmmaker. <br /> <br /> In "Jungle Fever" a superficial understanding of these socio-political forces appears. This is largely the result of two major failures: <br /> <br /> First, Lee just tries too much. It seems he is desperately trying to adapt to any political / social statement he can come up with in 90 minutes. Therefore, the final result seems confusing and reckless, because it does not allow for the development of characters that can fully embody the ideas that it is hoping to present. It exhausts stereotypes and leaves us with hasty testimonies and busy dialogues. The end result is very staged and unrealistic. Secondly, in an attempt to comment on such a wide range of social functions, it seems that it has no specific or original interpretation of the social / political issues presented. What appears is a puddle of returned non-sense. You feel that he bought a basic sociology textbook and spit out all 500 pages. <br /> <br /> These are very problematic functions, because the artistry of the film is dedicated, and the work is transformed into a voice speaker for the voice of the filmmaker. She is unable to distance herself from work and let her speak for herself. <br /> <br /> It functions neither as a work of art nor as a reasonable political argument. <br /> <br /> Although I still appreciate Lee, who raises these important issues, I have to say: <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down.
