Mt sister and I are self-styled lovers of horror movies. We only saw EVERYTHING, especially the zombie cinema. Now we've seen a lot of good zombie movies and a lot of bad ones. This BY FAR is the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life. Not only was the game terrible, but the special effects, graphics and makeup of the "zombies" were the worst I saw. If you can even call it makeup (black shadow around the eyes) This is a complete proof that you should never judge a book by its cover. Because the cover of the movie is the only sweet thing. do yourself a favor and DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so adamant in this movie that I went to put a sticky note on the inside of the movie before I went back to the movie saying "This movie sucks, do not waste time, come back NOW" hahahhaa I do not want anyone wasting a good movie night in this movie POS! I do not even know how it got the ratings he did, it should be negative
