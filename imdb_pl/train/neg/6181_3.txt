If you're a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3K, Attack of the Giant Leeches or Pinata Survival Island, this movie may be for you. <br/> <br /> I live in Nashville and did not even know about the existence of this movie until the day before its release, when the advertising company panicked and shut down Music Row dozens of leaflets and billboards. In fact, it only lasted two weeks in cinemas. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, bad writing and poor production begin to describe this embarrassment of the movie. At the beginning the names are a bit too: Bo Price, Angel and Dixie? Eesh. <br /> <br /> The awkwardly slow delivery of the line by Toby makes you wonder which production assistant got stuck while holding the cue cards off the camera. The angel figure quickly moves from his urban style to a cowgirl, slipping into the southern slang after two days at the ranch. Her wardrobe goes from elegant to feminine version of Toby - in the final scene their outfits are identical, which makes me wonder if the assistant's wardrobe rang sick. <br /> <br /> The sound is inconsistent - perhaps the most noticeable example is the situation in which Toby decides to go swimming, and his voice suddenly sounds like he is screaming in the gym. <br /> <br /> There's never enough explanation or character development to get what's happening on the screen. Horror, irritation, grimaces and moods best describe the interpretation of the actors and the direction of the horrible scenario. <br /> <br /> This film is best enjoyed after eating a few alcoholic beverages and in the company of the wisest friends. But that does not say much.
