The actress making a film in Africa is kidnapped and taken to the jungle where a ransom is held for her. The producer hires someone to take her and bring her back. Complicating everything is cannibals in the jungle, who worship a really ugly "god" who likes to eat naked women. <br /> <br /> This is a bloody, dingy movie. There is plenty of nudity and violence, not to mention violence against naked people. It is an exploitation movie designed to appeal to the deepest darkest parts of our being, and if the movie was not so boring, this movie would be a classic. Let's face it, despite the top, nasty sex and abuse, and the ugly monster this movie is a nap. The stimulation is completely turned off and it throws you out. There are many story lines, all of which seem to divide independently of each other, although in the end it is one story. What's the worst, almost nobody says anything. Most of the minimal dialogue concerns the cruelty or protests of one of the characters who "will do what I want". It's such a quiet and boring movie that if it were not for the frequent screams of the victims, I would recommend it as a helper during sleep. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to avoid unless you need to sleep, or unless you have to see every Euro-Canarian movie. <br /> <br /> (Aside.) VideoAsia just released it as part of a series of stories about terrorism, their print is strangely packed in a letter that looks like the result of their printout from a Japanese source (there is a haze) that has been clipped to delete subtitles, and their printout also has no opening titles)
