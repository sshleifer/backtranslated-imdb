Really very bad. How is the film made so bad? I was waiting for a salutary plot, interesting work with the camera or at least some free nudity, but I did not get anything. I just looked at Cabin Fever and thought it was a train wreck (except for nudity and pancakes), but it looks like a genius compared to that thrill. The best script doctor in the world could not save this rotten heap of stinky poop. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could happen in this "movie" is that it's over. <br /> <br /> It hurts me thinking about this movie and I'm trying to write something. Ugh! I am glad that I paid only 5 dollars for this and will soon be sent to the landfill.
