never consider watching this apologizing excuse for the movie. the way it is shot, lit, played etc. is pointless. everything is so bad that it is difficult to watch them. lots of clips are repeated beyond boredom. it seems that there is no "normal" person in the whole film, and the existence of the "outside world" is, well, it just does not exist. and why is this bald suddenly becoming invincible? this movie is beyond stupidity. zero.
