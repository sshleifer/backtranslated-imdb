At first glance, on the plot, I came to the conclusion that it could be a decent movie. Could you ever be more wrong? The beginning of the movie makes it look like a group of freaks has gathered and decided to make a low-budget movie. For the first 10 minutes you do not notice bad action, horrible sounds and horrible special effects, but then it's worse. After about 20 minutes I asked myself, "What was the plot?" I could only ask this question when I was not thrown out of laughter from the pure lameness of this film. The main actor has one scene for emotions and keeps him throughout the movie, even if he has to go through love and hatred and everything in between. The flashback scene almost threw me up because it made me relive one minute of material from the earlier part of the movie. Now we have stepped into the middle of the movie in which they apparently try to rip Morpheus out of the "Matrix", although he is doing a terrible job. It's almost unbearable to say an actor about Star Wars and phrases with fortune cookies. At the end of the movie, you do not realize it's the end of the movie because you think the plot is finally developing. The character "Morpheus" dies, the ONLY good thing in the film. He speaks a few words and throws credits. What is this? Without plot, bad acting, trashy things, it could not have been worse. Please, if you value human decency, DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM!
