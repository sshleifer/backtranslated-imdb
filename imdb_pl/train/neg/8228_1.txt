The problem with this movie is that it is filmed in the worst possible camera, and the film is blurred and grainy. Maybe it's just that whoever held the camera could not stop because they had an attack or something. In this movie, there are too many poos and vomits. Someone vomits every twenty minutes and makes me think it was done by some bulimic or something like that. It was disgusting. Then there is an irritating, high-pitched cry that lasts and lasts and does not end until the credits are played out. I also did not like it when all of her friends were shot (or maybe I do not know) and she goes into the van and puts on the band's help. It was really really stupid to have it in the movie. How much gas can a person suck to get to the van? It must be a lot, because you will not run out of gas until the end of the movie. It was a horrible movie and I would love to not see it all my life.
