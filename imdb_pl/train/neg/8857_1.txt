This movie is really bad, so bad that even Christopher Lee can not save him. Poor history, and even worse scenario and poor direction make it really a great horror, and the unique part is that it is the only horror I can. Honestly, I will never see again. Garbage makes Plan 9 out of the outer space look like oscar material.
