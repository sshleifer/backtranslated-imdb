Not repeating what was said above about this film, I would like to add that I was looking forward to watching this movie ... cast / location and work of the great director Michael Winterbottom, etc. "Do not look now" on the story from the very beginning. Staying in another environment (again in Italy) to outshine the loss of heart loss ... or maybe this is how I saw it? Therefore, I sat there waiting for history to develop and I will look at what we expect from this family in a foreign European country ... and I sat there and sat there ... and guess what? nothing happens! and I mean nothing !! You do not even have a chance to play the heroes because they are so one-dimensional and useless. Thanks to the pace of the film you believe that something will happen to turn the whole movie into his head ... Flirting the oldest daughters with local vespa boys, had great opportunities to move the movie in a different direction, the youngest daughters visions of her dead mother ended fruitless and aimless exercise, fathers try to be seduced by one of their students feel unreasonably, considering his age. It seemed that the script had a last reminder, in which they decided at the last minute to eliminate all plot lines and went after paralyzing it to a minimum. When the loans began to roll (unexpectedly), you can not help but feel robbed of the time you spent watching this heap of rubbish.
