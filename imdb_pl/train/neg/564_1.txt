The producers made a big mistake by casting Mark Lester, who could not play or sing in the title role. In addition to the very bad "acting", Lester's entire song had to be named by the girl. I do not know why they cast him at all, because there would be so many boys who could play this role infinitely better and sing themselves too. Shani Wallis was much too old to play in Nancy, who was only 16 years old. The current version of the West End is much better than the movie in every respect. Ross McCormack is the best ingenious wrestler of all time and looks much better than Jack Wild. It was clearly political to give this old-fashioned musical so many Oscars after the turbulent events of 1968.
