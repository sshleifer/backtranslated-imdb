Sufficiently decent thanks to some stylish photos, but a small budget makes things difficult. <br /> <br /> I also have the impression that they were trying to shock you with some of the graphic elements on the weirdo perv website. <br /> <br /> if you like anime in particular, such as cyber city and AD police, this may be your street. <br /> <br /> but basically its low-budget cash matrix is ​​not completely devoid of its own style. <br /> <br /> A great soundtrack by unknown bands grunge / punk / post grunge. It is worth checking if only for the soundtrack.
