I am Irish and have lived in Denmark for some time, so I could not wait to return home last week, so I could see Intermission. I will be recording as: <br /> <br /> THIS FILM IS AMAZING. <br /> <br /> It's not as bad as something like "The most prolific man in Ireland", but it definitely is not there with other Irish movies like The Commitments, I Went Down or Michael Collins. <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the movie are actually quite funny, like Cola Meaneys in the American style. But the movie itself is filmed completely wrong. Bouncing around the camera and continually zooming in and out is trying to give the film a sharp look, as if it were a dramatic drama. But it's not like that. This is an Irish sluice, a store and two smoking barrels and should be shot in this way. It should have smooth movement from one shot to the next. The film just looks careless and thrown together. <br /> <br /> The performances are okay considering the horrible scenario. One of my friends told me that they were just following Colin Farrell in Dublin for a week. It gives a decent presentation in Dirtbag in Dublin, but in no way can it match his performances in the Minority Report, Tigerland or the phone booth. The best performance was Dierdre O'Kane, who plays a frustrated middle-aged woman who has just been abandoned by the bank manager's husband for a younger woman. I think she should leave her ugly bra and focus more on acting. <br /> <br /> In total, it does not meet the expectations of the Irish press in any way or deserves to be even considered one of the best Irish films ever. <br /> <br /> I'm expecting a reaction to these comments, because most of the people I talked to said she was great. But before you answer, ask yourself: would he think so much about this movie if it were set in England or America?
