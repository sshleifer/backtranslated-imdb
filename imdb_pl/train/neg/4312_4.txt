This works as a satire during the era of the movement for women's rights. Of course, this does not mean that COACH (film) is a great experience. It works in the same style as FASTBREAK (which was better but still tame) and is basically a standard cup. What I mean to make this movie uninteresting is easy to recognize. Anyone who devotes time beyond normal work, training a group of madmen earning a sudden victory, is wasting. The same feeling you can feel after seeing this. A nice attempt to cast the opposite sex on a man's duty, but I expected better things.
