San Francisco is a big city with great actors. In this case, the filmmakers did not try to use the city. They did not manage even the most basic realistic details. I would not recommend it to anyone based on being a film in San Francisco. You will not think "oh, I was there", will you think "how did a two-story fire trap / stinky armpit turn into a quiet hotel lobby?" Some of them used styles and affects associated with the East Coast. It detracts, but acting has always been competent. <br /> <br /> Stories seemed to be shot in three different styles, at least at the beginning. Chinatown's history was the most effective and interesting. The plot is weak, the stage is played on the stage from classic action films in Hong Kong. The originals had much more tension and emotional resonance, they were better framed and packed. But acting is fun and we can see James Hong and other luminaries. <br /> <br /> The white boy's intro was pointless. I think the filmmakers did not know what to do about it, so they left the structure loose and cut. Father is a strange trial of a liberal in Berkeley - really, people know that this is not a "polite" life in the ghetto - but its segments are the most humorous. They rejected a few good opportunities. Educated and embittered on the West Coast, yuppie jerk is another kind of yuppie moron than in New York. They are equally unbearable, but they can always be distinguished. That would be interesting; it was not. <br /> <br /> Intro Hunter's Point was the most disappointing one. It was the most derivative of the three and stylistically the farthest from San Francisco. You've seen it before and you've seen it better. Even the video game was better! <br /> <br /> In spite of the general, nonlocal and pointless scenario, these characters have potential, the actors have talent, and something interesting begins to circle in a clumsy direction ... about ten minutes before the end. A good concept placed in the wrong hands. <br /> <br /> PS, there's a missing minority here, see if you can guess which one.
