It was a really bad movie. The character "Cole" played by Michael Moriarty was the biggest reason she hit the flop. The actor thought that conjuring up an incredibly uncomfortable southern drawl would make the character more evil, did not do it. After about 20 minutes I wanted the speech therapist to come out, it would add some sincerity. <br /> <br /> - 1) poorly behaved - 2) unsympathetic characters - 3) thin story line <br /> <br /> Fuj! <br /> <br />
