What a stinky it turned out !!! One time, much earlier in her career, Linda Darnell was one of my favorites - no great shake as an actress, but very beautiful and pleasant (especially in movies like "Mark Zorro" and "Blood and Sand"), but when I saw this monstrosity, the memories of her golden days quickly disappeared. This story is unbelievable and farce, secondary acting, an unbearable cast. I can not think of a more immature execution of anyone compared to Tab Hunter, and Donald Gray had to be the most boring top man they could choose. There was also a terrible photograph (and I'm not just talking about color!). Everyone involved with it had to shudder when it was shown.
