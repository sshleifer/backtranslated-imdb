<br /> <br /> Already in his youth the old man wanted to marry his first cousin, but his family forbids it. Many years later, the old man raised three children (two boys and one girl) and allows his son and daughter to get married and have children. Soon sister gets bored with brother # 1 and jumps to bed # 2. <br /> <br /> One would think that three siblings got stuck somewhere on a distant island. But no - they are Europeans from upper classes going to study and busy in the social world. <br /> <br /> We never see a flirtatious moment between any unrelated woman and two brothers. We never see any flirtatious moment between any unrelated man and one sister. All flirtatious moments are shared only between brothers and sister. <br /> <br /> The weakest part of GLADIATOR was the case of incest. The young Emperor Commodus would have hundreds of slaves and a city full of girls about marriage, but no - he just wanted his sister? If film incest is your cup of tea, then SUNSHINE (slowly) will excite you endlessly.
