A muscular monkey in the jungle of Africa is hunted by an opportunistic expeditionary team; the first daughter of the team leader finds him first. A lot of the noisy version of Tarzan's story has a good production, but it's crippled by the worst direction of the movie I've ever seen. John Derek is deprived of inspiration outside of tacky shots in slow motion and fleeting glances from the exposed body of Bo Derek's wife; he has as much talent as Ed Wood. Trying sexuality with a pinch of salt, Derekom lacks finesse, a quick sense of time and taste. They have a sense of parody and daring abandon (they throw caution to the wind), but after the promising opening everything goes to hell. Miles O'Keeffe (who always had balls in his mouth) has the title role, but he plays the third violin with ego John Derek and the self-importance of Bo Derek. * with ****
