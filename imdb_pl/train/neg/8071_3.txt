I wanted to watch this movie because of Eliza Dushku, but she has only a smaller part, and her character is not very nice. However, the main character, played by Melissa Sagemiller, is extremely beautiful and is a great admiration while watching the movie. It's nothing more than a presentation of her appearance and talent. He does a very good job. <br /> <br /> The story itself is quite nonsensical at first glance. After a car accident, some friends probably do not live, but they still live their previous lives, while many mysterious things happen. There are bad guys after them, but we never really know who they are (maybe they were in the second car, but we certainly do not hear anything about why they are after them). The final scenes seem particularly ambitious in film, but I can not get anything consistent from them. Opening scene in which bad guys (who wear strange masks) cut the wrist of a blond girl and collect some of the blood that was never explained or continued. Unless the bad guys are supposed to be a representation of surgeons who try to distract Cassie (Sagemiller) from the dead ... but no, it does not work. The bad are just angry; they will really spoil a story that would otherwise be interesting. In the supernatural story of death, love and sacrifice, who the hell needs bad guys? <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
