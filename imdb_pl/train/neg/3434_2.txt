I am a big fan of horror / splattering, I like even horror movies that some people consider stupid. I also like gore. The more merriment, if he is right. <br /> <br /> After reading the reviews of other people on the site I was sure that this movie will be a little gem. But to my disappointment, it turned out to be one of the most pointless movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Acting was terrible, the dialogues were stupid, the plot was pointless, the special effects were useless and the editing was probably made by someone who has been dead for 2 years. Usually, I think that all these features are a great movie of horror. But not in this case. <br /> <br /> I have released EUR 11 to get this DVD. <br /> <br /> Unless you really like senseless gore (for example, "violent sh * t" movies) avoid at all costs!
