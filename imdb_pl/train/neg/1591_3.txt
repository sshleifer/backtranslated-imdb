After watching many TV shows "Next Action Star", TiVo recorded horrible tripe for me. For some strange reason - and I just have to blame myself - I looked at the whole thing, hoping that there would be something * unique in the whole movie. After so much hype about Joel Silver's "Midas Touch" with action movies, you may want to make sure that he will stick to his alchemy. <br /> <br /> First of all, the only valuable value of the whole movie was Billy Zane, and even he could not pick up the slut written from the fool. Having said that, Zane's performance weakens by two-thirds of the way, because it seems that he does not even know what to do other than to look pleased with himself. <br /> <br /> However, I can not blame him here. Writing, to be honest, sucks. Let's take ideas from the "rat race", "enemy of the state", "terminator", "running at midnight" and every evil gambling movie that you can come up with and just refresh it. And who was the genius idea to have two pursuit sequences in ROW? <br /> <br /> Sean Carrigan, "man of the hour" "The next action star" shows all the strengths and weaknesses of the casting directors recall during the whole cycle. One-voice John, very good at playing stupid, good-looking jockey, but struggling with the weight of the movie. To be honest, we never care if he lives or dies half way, because Carrigan does not give a reason for the public to even like him. His stupid but happy routine is getting old because the hero has nothing to do. <br /> <br /> But Carrigan is a dream compared to the wooden, rigid Corinne Van Ryck de Groot. Did Howard Fine really tell her to pretend the Terminator in the first half of the movie? I do not think so. I expected him to quote Arnie. Her "performance" can be compared only with the dramatic depth of "Freddy Got Fingered", though not as well developed. The camera loves her in dark, dark limousines, but in the harsh light of the day her behavior drains all the energy from the screen. Jeanne Bauer showed more natural life in her five-minute part than Corinne showed at any point in her screen. <br /> <br /> Finally, Sean has a good look to ensure a good lead in the cast, but he should not be left to do this one solo. It was just too big a task for him. A colleague of "Next Action Star", Jared Elliot, may have better luck with more dynamic characteristics, but it's hard to say that Jeff Welch is lame. Somebody should take iMac Welch off him before he hurts himself or anyone else. And finally, Van Ryck de Groot was simply outclassed and out of reach, even for such a complete shock. <br /> <br /> Joel Silver should be ashamed.
