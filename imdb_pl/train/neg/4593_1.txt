As a physics student, I met many professors of idiot and other so-called experts in this field. Continuing my studies, I'm learning more and more about real physical experiments and about people who do it right. <br /> <br /> Then my friends tell me about this "physics film" I want to see. Without realizing it, I am excited, hoping that the information will be well presented. <br /> <br /> I did REAL quantum mechanics; it was not it. <br /> <br /> This film begins with the basic assumption that everything that happens to a subatomic particle can happen to you if you just open your eyes. Let's think about it for a moment. <br /> <br /> Our bodies consist of about 10 ^ 30 such subatomic particles. It's a million billion billions of particles! The more the "mysterious" quantum effects of only two particles, the greater the probability of 50% of total cancellation. When you add more and more particles to the mix, it becomes almost impossible to get a large net quantum result. To tell us that we should believe that this is the correct assumption, without any rationality ... it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> My friend, also in the field of physics, I counted three facts during this film. But they were presented in the most confusing way I EVER SEEN. <br /> <br /> I can not say so much for the neuronal part of the movie, because I did not have any medical training. It seemed like it might have some more truth, remembering my days in biology, but I can not say. <br /> <br /> At least this movie had a redeeming quality: dancing peptides (or whatever they really were) a stage. Not to ruin the priceless conspiracy that drives this movie, but the main character goes to the wedding, where he sees all kinds of personalities "driven" by their peptides *, and then the movie cuts to the dance floor, where we are connected with people dancing, sometimes surrounded CG peptides, and a fully CG scene filled with dancing peptides. At this point the movie tried to tell us how we are "addicted to emotions", so we are dealing with the full song of this hit "Addicted to Love". <br /> <br /> This scene was a redemption because anyone who could go through this scene and still take this film seriously ... well, you have to "open your eyes".
