It was over 80 minutes of half-unexpected boredom. First of all, I was wondering how you can produce something like that. Then, reaching the 70th minute, I found out that it was only a few minutes, and I survived to the very end I'm proud of because I think watching this movie as a great test for human patience and nonsense. Was it worth watching at all? Well, as I wrote above, if you want to check, try and if you're strong enough, you can even survive until the end ... The film lacks coherence, and the characters do not seem to have good sense of everything. All the events in the film, you can be sure that you have seen somewhere before, and appear to be included in this film only to fill the film roll.
