Michael Rooker is a decent actor, but he has no interest in running, except for a low-budget movie. There really is not a lot of charisma. Ryo Ishibashi has a lot more presence on the screen and unfortunately he is not really the main character. Most of the time on the screen falls to the brick Rooker. <br /> <br /> Danielle Harris (from Halloween 4 and 5 movies) plays her daughter and she is cute and funny, but she is written as not being too smart and one of her stupid mistakes kills one of the main characters. Comedians Fred Willard, Bobcat Goldthwait and Stephen Furst are here in interesting roles. Just watching what happens to these characters is invaluable. <br /> <br /> Vincent Schiavelli plays Consigliare at the local godfather of the mafia and it's hard to say whether he's working on the movie as a comedy. Tim Thomerson is also in this movie. It looks like it is in every unusually low budget of the action movie. Thomerson is also in some low-budget comedies. Watching so many comedians and comic actors in this movie made him feel like a trick. Is this a parody of the Yakuza movie? It's hard to say at some points. There is certainly a very small Yakuza action. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast of Thugs and Goons is threatening and well manned. Some of these movies have Thugs who look as if they were working at the local Comic Book Store or as boys at Piggly-Wiggly. In general, the film is very uneven. At some points it seems to be a comedy or a parody. Then at other points it acts like a good action movie. Then it spits to the end. Without input, Danielle Harris and Ryo Ishibashi, this film would have rated Zero in my humble opinion.
