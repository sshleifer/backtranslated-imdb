This movie was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Here are the things that immediately jump out of me: 1. The forests were more like a hill in Los Angeles with a pair of trees and a brush. Not terrible. Instant news, if you're filming in the Southern California area, a big bear is only an hour away. In fact, they have trees there. <br /> <br /> 2. Writing was undoubtedly the worst dialogue I have ever experienced. Every possible line in the film was unoriginal, banal or simply stupid. For example, the name of the camp is "blood of the camp" (lame), the name of the clown is "clown's killer" (lame). What does a clown do in the forest anyway? Is this the only mask they could find? 3. The last, but certainly the smallest, was the actor. Absolutely the worst group of actors and actresses ever assembled. A virtual horn of plenty of shit lines and poor performance. The worst part was that I randomly came back to this fat foreign girl who was looking for a photo naked. It's a really long scene and I suppose it was supposed to be sexy, but it was NOT. Besides, it was one of the few pleasant parts of the movie, it was a tool that should be "athletic". For example, when he gets bored in a movie, he grabs a pair of stones and starts doing curls with them. Later he should run for a clown and it can be seen that his "girl-like" escape is far from athletic. Oh, and to the girl who played Kat, good God, stop singing. This song you sang for subtitles makes me want to kill myself. <br /> <br /> If for some reason you see this movie, at least I'd recommend watching special features. The group of jackass who filmed this movie is talking about it as if it was a really original story. In fact, one of the girls says she allowed some of the friends to read the script, and none of them could have predicted the end. Apparently he meets special children.
