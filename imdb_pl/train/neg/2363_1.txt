This movie was just awful, the first movie was not so great, it's absurdly stupid if they did not have enough of the first 5 movies that had to be added, why not just do it in a continuous series like James Bond I will tell you exactly why, because bond movies are really very good, and these movies just stink, I do not understand whether it was going to be an intersection with genres like horror and comedy for the sake of my 1-year-old niece would not be afraid of such an absurd attempt terror, spit in the face of people who at least want to be afraid at some point in the so-called horror movie. Please, no more of these movies.
