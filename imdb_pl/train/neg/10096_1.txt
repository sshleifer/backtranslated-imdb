This movie must be the worst I've ever seen. The title of the film deceives the audience to think that they can have hope. The plot of the film is ridiculous at best, and the acting is so poor that you just have to fry. The title "Zombie Nation" means the zombie's stock when there are six of them in total. This can not be classified as a horror movie due to the introduction of cheesy 80's music when the zombies "attack". Zombies actually talk and behave like people in the movie, and the only difference is makeup, which looks like a La Roux movie. If you ever have the opportunity to buy this movie, do it and then make a copy.
