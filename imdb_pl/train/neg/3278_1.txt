I must admit that many people have said that some of us have to be in the right time, because the new movie "Dukes" is a modernized version. OH PLEASE. If it's considered modernized, Hollywood can stop it. Many people on the MSN website have also said this (I quote): "These old mists have to deal with it and that's the way it is." Well, let me tell you something, I'm 24 years old, so I'm far away from being and OLD FOGIE, and I will not bother about it, it was FALL FOR ALL, WHICH IS HAZZARD COUNTY. The only thing in the title of the film was "HAZZARD". Was it really vulgarity, smoking and drinking? The staff was terrible. Jessica was on a few morning shows to talk about the movie and I honestly believe that everything came to her mind. In no way is Daisy Duke, maybe by accident, but he is certainly not a prince. I love Sean Williams Scott, but not as Bo. They should have incorporated the original cast at least to the cameos, but even Hollywood knew they would not accept the script. It's about people, even today's actors and actresses express a negative opinion, so why some of you give positive comments.
