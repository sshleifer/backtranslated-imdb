A young professor of genetics dealing with basketball conducts research on the genetic sequence using human fetuses. He hopes to find a cure for all diseases and aging. He insists on completing research because he has not published, so the university has problems justifying funding (I think). <br /> <br /> He makes a test injection to a monkey who dies quickly. Then he tries on himself. He starts a relationship with the lonely mother of an extremely annoying boy; it was she who demanded the results of the research. <br /> <br /> Initially, it does not seem to affect the injection, except for a new strength. Then he realizes that he has had some memory loss and is starting to remember what happened. In addition, it begins to seem very unhealthy. <br /> <br /> Because the movie is called a metamorphosis, it eventually turns into something else. You will not believe your eyes - neither in what he has changed, nor in the absolutely ugly costume that the actor is wearing to show what he has changed. Unbelievably, there is one more change in the store - the end of the movie is really, very absurd. <br /> <br /> What's happening in the movie is that Laura Gemser has a very small part in it. <br /> <br /> Once I saw a video box with a carved plastic mold stuck to the box. Probably it may even have some electronics in it, maybe eyes that light up (the main character's eyes sometimes turn green in the movie). The copy I was watching had a box that showed only traces of tears that kept the glue on the plastic that had been removed. The novel cover, if he still had it, would be the only reason I would stick to the movie; I definitely get rid of him.
