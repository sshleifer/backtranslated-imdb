At the beginning of the film, beautiful photography and scenes with fox were amazing. However, the story was very slow and boring. And then the little girl begins to tame the fox, which leads to tragic events. We live in the forest and often see foxes. One thing that everyone should know is that you leave wild animals to be wild and enjoy them from afar. This movie is a terrifying example for children who will watch it, trying to turn a wild creature into a pet. I do not know what the sense of the story was. Even after the horrible events with the main fox, the girl still wanted to play with the sets. Does she never learn her lesson? There are also other scenes with predatory animals for the fox, which only increases the trauma of children watching this movie. What a disappointment with this movie. And what a terrible story it is. The final story was so stupid that at that time my wife and I were shouting at the TV! I absolutely hated this movie and I will not recommend it to anyone!
