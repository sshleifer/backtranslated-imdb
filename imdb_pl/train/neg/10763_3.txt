First of all, what's good about the movie? Any pretty actress? exotic background? the fact that the actors do not laugh during the game (I would like if I was in their situation)? I do not know. The plot is simple: a Catholic priest who deals with abstract painting, tries to find out who (another abstract painter) killed his younger brother, a prostitute, a man (raped by another priest when he was young). I am afraid that there is nothing here to learn or think about serial killers, art or religion. Dennis Hopper is not very good here. This is the worst episode of the worst "profiler" season (series) with surrogate actors and unbelievable coincidences (my uncle is a policeman who, a girl living in another victim's house, can have a child with a priest, etc., etc.).
