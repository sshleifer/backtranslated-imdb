The first thing I noticed in this movie was unnecessary nudity. It is not boring nakedness or anything, but a lot was not needed. Annik Borel plays a nervous woman, believing that her family is telling stories about ghosts that her ancestor, who remarkably reminds her, was a werewolf and believes their destiny to be the same. Which I actually found quite interesting. The original Wolf Man was supposed to be a completely psychological movie, but Universal threw a real wolf that you never saw for extra money. I believe that this concept of someone who is not really a werewolf is interesting. Unfortunately, this is not the movie I was looking for. <br /> <br /> Instead, we know that he is not a werewolf from the very beginning, so there is no emotion or twist, they also try to make the movie look like it's really a scenario. They also fail to add one or two parts of the film that refer to the fact that it is a reality. At the beginning I was excited to read the description of the film. But I slowly realized that it was a cover, so that they could reveal the heroes' breasts as often as possible. <br /> <br /> Annik Borel is either a decent actor playing a great psychotic role, or a really bad actor playing a psychotic role. Because the character Danniele has no mind and is just a crazy man who runs mad, snarling and snapping like a wolf, the game requires little skill. She has moments when her performance breaks the terrifying moment, but is quickly ruined by the poor camera and light. The idea is great, but hideously made throughout the film. 3/10
