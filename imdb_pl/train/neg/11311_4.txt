I do not remember Ben from my fandom years of the '60s, I did some interviews and bios of unknown actors / actresses, first of all Ben, actress Fay Spain and Jody Fair, who played Angela in 1961 in The Young Savages. Ben was one of the low-level Sci-Fi con people in Chicago, around 1970, when I had a nice chat with him and his "career" and life. All of this has been published in some forgotten fanzine this day. It is a pity that I do not have a copy of these interviews yet, but time goes on, and each of these people certainly does not remember me so many years later. Ben was a really nice man, earning a living (the cons of those days did not even pay his guests unless, of course, they were big names, and even then the pay was a few hundred dollars at most!) It's good to know that Ben is still alive and kicking! For remake Creature, but 50 years older! Ugly, uglier now!
