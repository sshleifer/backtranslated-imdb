Bah. Another tired, inept repair of copyrighted work that was never intended to be filmed. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Toni Collette is great as always (she is a real actress, you see), and there are some nicely handled cuts of messages between scenes. There are even a few truly fun lines, and the work on the film, the score and the editing is competent, except for the bizarre interruption of reading and speaking to the camera towards the end. <br /> <br /> But, ah, but. Most casts seem to be on autopilot and almost everyone is clearly too old (and in one case too young) by the declared age. To make matters worse, everyone says "Austin," this peculiar falsetto song that sings itself, which could not be more than what people were saying on Austen day (think, Yosemite Sam, I'm not joking). This is particularly sad considering that it seems that in the end we see the fall of the equally far-reaching "Fakespearana", which Olivier and his friends liked to roar at their throats. <br /> <br /> And the worst of all is Gwyneth Paltrow. She played only one character in her films, and she remains true, creating here, running through her entire range (smiling to sulk) in the first ten minutes and then repeating herself for the rest of the movie. There is absolutely no chemistry between her and none of her devotees, or any apparent reason why they would be interested in her alone. <br /> <br /> In short, there is no reason to watch Emma. This is a friendly enough adaptation, but if you're going to pack a movie full of anacronisms (eg frightfully thin lead that can not shoot from a bow or handle an epoch), you might as well do it properly, as in the case of the much better "Clueless".
