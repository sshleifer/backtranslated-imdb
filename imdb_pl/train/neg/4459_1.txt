I'm not saying this because the production values ​​were so low, but because they were filmed terribly. Is this a picture of a girl washing her hair in a stream? Did we really have to sit there for a long shot and watch it for 5 minutes in the same place? It was terrible, the lighting was just bad. You almost did not see anything, and when the heroes talked, you barely heard what they were saying. Did I watch the whole movie? Of course, I did not jump over most of it and I do not want to hear someone say that first I have to watch the whole thing to assess it. This film was so badly made and made that even with independent and low budget standards is simply horrible. A horrible movie ... do not waste time, unless you want to laugh, but even then it's not because of the "funny" lines of the actors, but because of how the production looks boring.
