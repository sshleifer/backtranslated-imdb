The poster that he called this "Unlimited and pointless" literally took words that I would use in my topic. The only thing I will add is "without passion". In the case of a film made by a real marriage and containing many scenes of graphic sex, the film manages to create something that should be a stifling situation in one except the icily cold. Dafoe and Colagrande look bored during sex scenes, and the viewer might as well take Valium and do it with him. In addition, women in the audience saw WAY too many used tampons in their time, and every guy who is turned on seeing Willem Dafoe extracting a bloody tampon from his wife's vagina really needs therapy. <br /> <br /> I think the key to the movie (if there is one) is the restaurant scene, in which the waiter explains constantly sleepy Dafoe, what is "deconstructed jambalaya". (All the ingredients in the dish are still separating than cooking together.) This movie is a "deconstructed thriller". All elements are there: scary, isolated house, dead spouse, terrifying violin on the score, a bizarre guardian who comes and goes as he pleases, deadly car accidents and deaths, characters with a secret past. Essentially every thriller phrase you can think about, but nothing connects anything. Everything just sits and never merges into a coherent storyline, or even an artistic art of mood. In the Dafoe restaurant, he donates a "deconstructed jambalaya". Potential tenants of this mess would do well if they left this deconstructed thriller on the store shelf.
