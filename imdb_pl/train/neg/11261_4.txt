At the beginning I have to pay attention to the fact that you will feel completely lost for over half an hour. Yes, some things happen, but you do not know why and why. When you finally discover what is happening, you just realize that it is nothing but a twisted opera, dealing with mature prostitutes, dead mothers, illegitimate sons ... Heroes are rather poor, and actors (especially young) do not help much, make them look reliable. Only Marisa Paredes stands out, but she is a great actress, regardless of whether the film is pure nonsense. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing to say about the "Fr√≠o Sol De Invierno" is that the debutant Pablo Malo seems to have good intentions and shot some scenes that are quite intense ... Well, maybe next time ... <br /> <br /> * My rating: 4/10
