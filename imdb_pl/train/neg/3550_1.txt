I lead a group to stop the comedic exploitation and have spent the last two months listening to horror stories from comedians who have tried to interview "Last Comic Standing". If they do not have GOOD agents, they do not even have a chance to be heard, so more than 80% of comics who appear will be turned down before they show someone they have talent! If they go to the interrogation, I'm told it's "pre-determined" if it gets a second chance. What TV viewers see is NOT the best comic book in the United States. <br /> <br /> If the comics reach the series, most of them will not get IMDb credits. I know this because I made credits for all 6 seasons of "Last Comic Standing" and I do not receive any remuneration for performing the work of the Producers. It's really a disgrace. A month ago I asked "Last Comic Standing 7" on Facebook, why the producers do not grant IMDb credits and I was banned from their Facebook page !!! I'm not a comedian, so I do not have any personal involvement in it. I just want people to know the truth. I do not like when EVERYONE gets used and that's why I help comics. Comedians are used in HBO, BET, TvOne and other cable networks, but NBC is a GREAT THREE network, so the responsible people should be ashamed that they let it be used. <br /> <br /> Watch this video of a comedian who fell victim: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMb4-hyet_Y
