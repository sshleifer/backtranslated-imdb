The disappearance concerns a couple who takes their family on holiday to New Mexico and is in serious trouble after descending from the main highway to visit the city, which apparently was abandoned in 1948 for unknown reasons. At first sight, the city of Weaver seems harmless and attracts tourists until the family is trapped there overnight and begin to have reasons to suspect that others have experienced the same trouble with disastrous consequences. Henleys are watching the Blair-Witch-Project-esquire movie diary left by the last victim of the city, who ironically shows the best performance of everyone in this film. Although Hamlin and Dey's performances are much better than supporting casts, their emotional impact seems to me "flat" throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Disappearance is an appeal to most films, because there is a lot of uncertainty and a good direction. However, the plot takes on unexpected and improbable phrases that seemingly do not make sense. What's worse, we do not really understand what exactly happens in the movie, which makes this weird end less bearable. It seemed to me that the creators of the film focused so much on creating tight scenes that they rejected all elements of a good story: the development of the story, the gradual explanation of topics and symbols that lead to a coherent solution / result. <br /> <br /> The most difficult aspect of the film was that the first three-quarters of the film was devoted to building tension and curiosity in relation to some aspects of the plot that were suddenly removed, as if we had not done it, "I deserve clarification : <br /> <br /> What was the meaning of Indian symbols on the walls? What happened to Weaver's original people? What was the relationship with people at dinner? What did the sheriff know? What did the missing boy discover? <br /> <br /> I think it was a bad move because it caused a grudge. I invested a lot of mental effort in hypothesizing some plausible explanations for some of these twists and turns, just to make the filmmakers just end up without answering any of these things. These are cool fans at the end of the miniseries, which is due to begin next week, but it is completely frustrating and inappropriate to end the independent film.
