This movie has let me down. It seemed very similar to the movie Jawek, when Skoczek told the mayor to close the parks, as when Roy Shider ordered the mayor to close the beaches. They both said that there is no question of summer! But the field says that Hopper must get into the killer's mind and think like one. But it really does not do anything too interesting or exciting. I am not even convinced that he and his partner have some experience in police work when they are in the office and are wondering how they will solve this matter. They only say that let the police work and we will solve it. And what about all the old ladies with pool sticks. I did not even believe it was the mafia bosses. And then the guy who doubted the guy the crowd took away to deal with finding the killer. With his haircut haircut and the fact that his Di @ k has the size of a school bus. Come on, what cruddy lines. I thought he would hit him with a baseball bat like in other movies. I used this movie and I would not buy it new. I suggest you skip this movie. Oh, it was fun to see the microphone over the stage where the jumper goes out for coffee.
