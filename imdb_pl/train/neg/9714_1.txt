I hate this program: not only is this a preposterous concept, but it tries to be feasible (something that has been omitted in similar programs ending with "I admit", such as Muder: She Wrote). > Sigh. Why can not writers be smart enough in this program to come up with evidence that would hold and win the decision in court? <br /> <br /> Come on: after X years, unresolved issues, why EVERY SNEAK, EVERY SIZE * CONFESS * * damn it! , shucks, officer, you're smart - unless you've discovered enough to convince yourself that I did it, I might as well admit it and help you in court. honest cop. <br /> <br /> An absolute dog ** and offense to those of us who have enough brains to even hear about IQ
