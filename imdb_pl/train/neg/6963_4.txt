The Japanese have always had amazing ambitions in their fantasy films. They were always ready to destroy cities with huge plastic monsters from space and other places. The problem is that they never had the money to achieve convincing special effects. This film, published in France under the title Les envahisseurs de l'espace, is no exception. His ambition is to show three creatures from a giant octopus to a giant lobster that is trying to have an advantage over humans. It is extremely awkward and funny, but also quite pleasant. We like these creatures and these movies, right?
