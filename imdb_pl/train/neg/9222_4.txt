I love sexy action movies and science fiction from the sixties, and it's because of the actresses that appeared in them. They found that the sexiest women are in these movies and it did not matter if they could work (Remember "Candy"?). I was disappointed with this film because it was not nostalgic enough. In this story, a European science-fiction movie "Dragonfly" is created and the director is released. So the producers decide to let the young ambitious filmmaker (Jeremy Davies) complete the picture. She's a real beautiful woman in a movie that plays Dragonfly, but she's barely in it. The film is written and directed by Roman Coppola, who uses some of his feats from the early years and puts him in the script. I would like the film to be a tribute to these early films. They could have many scenes by the actors who appeared in them. The film has one actor who has been popular since the sixties and his John Phillip Law (Barbarella). There are also Gerard Depardieu, Giancarlo Giannini and Dean Stockwell. I think I will have to wait for the director to pay tribute to the films from the sixties. If you read this, "Make it as sexy as you can"! I'll wait!
