Look, I read and read these comments and there are many things that I want to say, but I will try to make them short, but clean ... First of all, let's forget everything about how bad the movie was ... If he did not show anything from Notorious, and I agree with most people here saying it was "Hollywood," that is, what did you expect from a real story? When people wake up and see that you'll never find the real truth about 2pac and Biggie ... It's all hidden and buried deeply. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I'm not against either 2pac or Biggie. I love them both, but 2pac and Lil Kim DID are certainly embarrassed in this movie for sure ... <br /> <br /> Then, for all who say that the movie is amazing and I do not see the truth you are too blind to see it because you think you know something about BIG or you do not know anything about it and you love these Hollywood movies for teenagers. Use your mind and see the clouds ... There are many things that you can say when it comes to this topic, I did not say 60% of what I have to say because it is a very broad topic, but for the movie I can only say that it could have been a bit, I mean much better. But in any case, I'm just a person who gives her opinion ... Without heavy feelings ... <br /> <br /> Listen, I love hip hop and I live for it, but after watching this movie every person with a bit of intelligence she saw that someone was supposed to live like this. With all due respect to 2pac and BIG, like all other artists who live in this way, they should change the other side, because you ruin your youth .... Bring in the wrong message to children, namely: not going to school but living out of the streets , hustling and grabbing the paper .... <br /> <br /> Real hip hop is about love and intelligence, be smart and everything. <br /> <br /> OK I know many of you think I'm crazy, but that's just my point. Look, I may be wrong and I'm not saying that it's a completely bad movie, because even if I'm in hip-hop for 17 or 18 years, I still do not know anything about 2pac or Biggie, no matter how many articles I've read or how much I support and listen to their music ... Like most of you. Only people who were really close to them and killers know the truth behind all this. <br /> <br /> And in the end I just want to say that all fans of Biggie and Tupac and family, two men were and will be the greatest in history, no matter how they lived their lives, but PLEASE BE IN BETTER, THE FUTURE, LEARN AND LOVE EVERYONE, THINK EVEN FOR ONE, WHO DO NOT LIKE, BECAUSE THE END. . IT'S NOT HOW MUCH MONEY OR TEACH YOU CAN GET IT AND HOW FAST YOU CAN GET UP, ABOUT YOUR CUSTOMIZATION TO FULL AND FEEDING YOUR SOUL, YOUR BODY AND MIND ... BECAUSE YOU MANAGE TO MAKE YOU WILL LIVE THE LIFE EVEN AFTER DEATH !!!! PEACE AND LOVE TO YA ALL !!!! RIP BIGGIE, 2PAC, AALIYAH, LEFT EYE, JAM MASTER JAY AND OTHERS WHO CHANGE THIS WORLD !!!!
