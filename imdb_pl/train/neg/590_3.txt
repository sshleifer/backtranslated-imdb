Unfortunately, I was disappointed with this movie because of the fact that he felt fake, and the characters were not strong enough to move the movies quite poorly to horror. The basic idea for the film was interesting, but unfortunately it was not able to arouse, really scare or shock me - there was one part in the whole movie, which I thought was gruesome, but even it did not buy it. At the end of the movie I liked the character of Kate, because it seemed that at the end she softened and became a little more realistic, the character played by Jeremy Sheffield was not really needed for this movie and I think that the director / writer was able to kidnap countless figures used without a purpose, if he left them in the main characters, making them a more solo effort on the part of Kate, it could work - Jeremy's acting was at least wooden and I felt uncomfortable watching the bad chemistry of the screen - or its lack. Such a shame. Disappointing.
