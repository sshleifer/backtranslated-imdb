"I am a cartoon!" "You are an illustration!" What is this supposed to mean ?! This story could not be worse because a boy who is afraid of everything becomes very brave at the very end of the movie because he went to the library. The only purpose of this celluloid waste was to encourage American children to read, when a cheaper and more effective way to do it could be a series of ads! Even the talents of Macaulay Culkin (as a kid), Christopher Lloyd (as so predictably "that he is the librarian of the party"), can save this senseless movie from a boring plot. Even the voices of Whoopi Goldberg, Patrick Stewart, (even) Leonard Nimoy, or the Hollywood God of voices, Frank Welker, like cartoon characters, never write it down. I can only describe it as the equivalent of the 1990s, and even the horrible adaptation of "Water Children" from 1978, because insipid animation makes the film worse, instead of improving the matte story!
