I am the type of person who always goes to the horror section when I choose a movie, so I chose five in my eyes, I was disgusted with this movie and I thought that there is no story and it makes no sense for you to enjoy it, it made my skin start to crawl, thinking that people like to watch movies that just encourage violence, hell, it was low budget and very rubbish! I think I could do better myself. I think it was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, and you should not worry about watching the actors rubbish, the camera was horrible, the picture was bad, and the sound was not scratched, I think it was a little bit like a shod break the baler, which project did not work at all, it was a foul.
