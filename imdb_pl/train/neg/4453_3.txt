I am sure that people watching this movement outside of England will be an entertainment film, but for someone from the United Kingdom it is painful in his mistakes. <br /> <br /> At the very beginning of the film, Elijah Wood gets a bank from the tube at the station, which was destroyed. He speaks to his sister, whom he meets: "What happened here" and she replies: "Oh, Tottenham was in town yesterday" !!! Tottenham is already in town ... they are part of the city, they do not have to go there! And if Tottenham fans wanted to fight other fans, then the last place on earth would be done at Bank station, where there are probably more security cameras than anywhere else in the world. <br /> <br /> There are a few other similar mistakes, but the biggest failure for me is the actor who plays the main hooligan. He definitely decided that it was not worth trying to speak with an East End accent, and instead decided on the stylish Dick Van Dyke dick that made my ears bleed. This was highlighted by the fact that the rest of his gang spoke the way that West Ham fans could be expected. This error made him unbelievable in this role and really ruined the movie.
