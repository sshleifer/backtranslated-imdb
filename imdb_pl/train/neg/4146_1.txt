After watching this thing, then reading the summary on the back of the DVD and then returning to the actual movie .... I became a bit dazed. I thought I might have fallen asleep and dreamed that I was a rolled fall syndrome in an endless forest, where people drive 11 miles an hour and stop aimlessly, and then sometimes tasteless lesbians. Where (zombies?) They appear out of nowhere and (vampires?), Who (seduce?) Pure citizens' hearts on their way to save the world. Neither zombies nor vampires meet each other. The only fight I remember was taking off the panties from Bonny Giroux. Coo Coo ca FAT! Everybody! Perhaps because we were watching a widened panoramic screen and we were too lazy to change it to native resolution, but it actually made it more entertaining ... To conclude, my thesis of continuous thought had more continuity, plot, character development, antagonism, subject matter and action is the whole of this film. It made Bloodrayne look like Citizen F *** ING KANE
