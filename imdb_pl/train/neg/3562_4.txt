"Indian burial site": if these three words appear anywhere on the property list, look for another neighborhood. A young couple with a young daughter and a son of infancy move to the Maine house adjacent to the pet cemetery - and after the l-o-o-o-n-ng journey, the ancient Indian burial ground. It looks like the Indian land can restore Fido or the Fluffy from the dead - if you do not mind that you have a beast from a hell for a pet. It can do the same for dead people - if you do not mind having a deadly zombie around the house. <br /> <br /> Put in a busy two-lane blacktop, rushing big platforms, good intentions (if somewhat dark), an old neighbor and one kid who really does not have enough supervision, and I think you can find out what's going on - a chaotic, illogical mess that offers several horrors in all honesty. <br /> <br /> Well, there are worse adaptations of Stephen King (such as "Maximum Overdrive", which King also directed). But there are also much better (such as "Flight Salem", "The Dead Zone" and both versions of "The Shining").
