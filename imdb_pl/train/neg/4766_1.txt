you can say that they spent $ 5 on doing it. it's a waste of your time ... ugh ... there's nothing good about this movie ... .. I do not know why I kept watching it ... the chick is not hot. terrible operation ... you could do anything and make better use of your time ... like watching TV in shit video games ... I feel robbed. I just robbed .. my time. I've never done a movie review, as I probably say, but this movie where I felt I had to save the poor souls who will watch it and look at IMDb to see if it's decent and looking at comments. - there was no action - no hot chicks - no budget-spurting-screaming bad movie. **** ALL THE FILM IS IN THE ROOM. ***
