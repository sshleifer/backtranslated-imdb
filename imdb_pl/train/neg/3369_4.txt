Well, my God, I'm disappointed. When I heard the news about the remake of Robert Wise's 1963 film The Haunting for the first time, I was afraid that he would be ruined by a lot of visual effects in summer films. But deep down I had faith. For sure with such a talented cast ... De Bont and the company will not ruin the movie, whose original was a fantastic and frightening movie that understood the subtle art of subtlety. Well, subtlety, where are you now !! ?? My fears were revealed ... the promising movie went wrong. Yes, the production project of Eugenio Zannetti is stunning; the film is wonderfully photographed; and composer Jerry Goldsmith can never do anything wrong. But the script says that they are great actors on the rehearsal. They convince them to provide a kind of rigid dialogue that is only spoken in movies. In the end, always great, Lili Taylor is the only artist who escapes with dignity ... and barely. But the crime of all crimes is that the horror is shown to us. We can no longer use our imagination, feel terrible fear of the unknown. No, we get visual effects that SHOW US, what should we be afraid of ... and you know what? So wonderfully realized, how are ... visual effects are kind of stupid. The climax is a phantasmatic mess ... but for a long time everything went terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> Everything at The Haunting is exaggerated and exaggerated. I'm afraid that there is no real thrill and creak in this old haunted monstrosity of the house ... just groaning. Check the original instead. <br /> <br />
