I am probably one of the few viewers who would not recommend this movie. A visually stunning thought, like all Ang Lee's (every still frame seems printable), I was really disappointed with the chaotic pace of the movie. It really was too long. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in the Missouri Civil War and concerns a young man (Roedel), who joins the Bushwackers' savage forces, a kind of renegades of confederate supporters who run geurillas, fight against the Jayhawks, their counterparts in the Union . He and his close friend, Jack Bull Chiles, played by Skeet Ulrich, join the group after Chile's father is shot dead and his home is burnt, probably by Jayhawkers. The story is about the raids of Roedel and Chiles and their interactions with other victims of war, including a former slave who fights for Bushwhackers (Daniel Holt played by Jeffery Wright) and a war widow played by Jewel. /> It seemed that each time a film unfolded this story to an interesting point, it would change into a different sub-story and leave undeveloped things. For example, the agitation among the Roedel group caused by former Holt slave attending a confederal case is shown briefly as a result of a decency conflict and protocol, and then dropped until a later film. Young villian / bully Bushwhacker hates Roedel and directs a lot of anger and violence against him, but we never know why. Some characters never appear; I think that this is because the film covers too many of them, and also takes a large amount of history. <br /> <br /> The historical detail was perfect. I loved looking at flat, furniture, clothes, etc. And I thought that the main actors did a great job humanizing the heroes, although they stumbled a bit in dialogue. Unless you really like history or are a big fan of Ang Lee, take it on yourself.
