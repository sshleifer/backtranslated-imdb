Stupid, often ridiculous, absurdies involving the landing of a spacecraft and the resulting devastation that this causes Tim (Jeff Daniels) and people in its orbit. <br /> <br /> I'm always amazed by Daniels. He showed such depth and promise in the "Recognition Conditions" of 1983. As the filigree son-in-law of Shirley MacLaine. Over the years, Daniels was unable to get a good, meaty role. Instead, he's in mindless comedies like "Stupid and stupid". <br /> <br /> When it comes to this picture, it fails because of the topic. At least the TV program brought different situations. The film has a continuous slapstick, and people turn into monsters when the government manages to capture Martian-Martin. <br /> <br /> Part of Mrs. Brown is a great example of a non-success movie. On television, Pamela Britton played the role of Ditsy entangled in situations where the Martian embarrassed leaves her. In the film version, a blonde bomber shell, like Brown, tries a romantic entanglement. <br /> <br /> TV star Ray Walston has a small role as a government agent, is it really? <br /> <br /> Very big disappointment for those who liked TV program so much.
