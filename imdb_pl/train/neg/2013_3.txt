This movie is more or less like the futuristic version of Cinderella's legend, but with songs and (quite tame) sex scenes! The movie is not sure what it wants to be and almost ends in a mess. It is more expensive than most films by director Al Adamson, but it is not at the same level of budget as science fiction viewers expect. The actors are very bad and unlike most of Adamson's films, there are no great names or B actors. Part of the music is fine, but it's easy to see why Cinderella 2000 has been forgotten for many years.
