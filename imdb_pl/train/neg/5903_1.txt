I live in Salt Lake City and I'm not a Mormon, so why did I rent this movie? Well, because I live in Utah and I thought it would be nice to see the places I know in the movie. I really knew that by going into it, I did not intend to have internal jokes, so I was not surprised when I sat down with a deer in the spotlight. What surprised me was the actions of Mormons against the Mormons that were included in this film. <br /> <br /> I know it's a Mormon movie, directed to members of the LDS Church, but I found it offensive because of the typical stereotype of people who are not out of their faith. Everyone, not Mormon, who was not many, drank, smoked and had an amazing attitude of selfishness, why? <br /> <br /> It really struck me in this movie, made the Mormons so clean, but the rest of Utah, I think, is filled with punk psychologists just because they do not follow the writings of the LDS Church. <br /> <br /> I understand that the plot revolves around all LDS members, but you would think Salt Lake City was 100% Mormon, which is not even true. And as I said, the non-Mormons in the movie were portrayed as drunk jets, please! <br /> <br /> I guess I just do not understand, because I do not belong to their faith and probably never will.
