Cinderella's story for adults who live in the land of dreams. Romance is very unrealistic, fluttering, lovable dovey, perfect etc. The story of Cinderella to the very end and Shahid Kapoor is the only reason for my stars. If you are looking for a dream romance with a surprise, then you are definitely a movie, but for the rest of us, real people of the world, I highly recommend saving your three hour watch time. Wake up people! <br /> <br /> Four of the five people who saw the film with me would not recommend the movie. We had a great time fighting with the majority of unrealistic scenes. Maybe something is missing ... I just can not believe that such a movie can beat the classic like HDDCS !!
