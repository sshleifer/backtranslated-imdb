Watching this movie, just like the first time in Turner Classic (which lists it as "Dangerous Female"), can multiply your appreciation for the Bogart-Astor version from 1941. Ricardo Cortez must have earned a smirk. I hope he remembers his dentist and the seller Brylcer; they made him the actor he was. All women are good, but not better than this. Well, Una Merkel is a little better. More interesting are the "original" Joel Kair and Mr. Gutman, who competently provide a lot of individual tics, but almost none of the changing scenery of their successors in the roles of Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor somehow surpassed the essential nuclei of their characters in the remake; here Sam Spade and Ruth Wonderley (!) can not. <br /> <br /> This movie does not stink; it lies there like a big piece of ham. Its main value is the reminder that great films such as "41" "Falcon" simply do not happen. On a scale of 1 to 10, I rate it on 4, mainly for working with cameras and supporting players.
