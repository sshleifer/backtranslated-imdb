I loved this movie, I will confess. It must be the best (straight to?) Video movie I've seen. Well ... me and my friend decided to just shit and giggle that we will borrow this movie. We knew what to expect and received exactly what we expected, plus more. When this red neck is hit by a tree by Sasquatch, we literally watched this part about three to four times, it was amazing (hysterical, of course). And why? Oh, why the main character has to shed so much? Honestly, we know that you are in danger, going down so much will not help too much. But really, if this movie is in your local RENT IT video store. It is worth the money and it is not even as bad as it is bad but not very bad. Overall, a complete amazing one will be for you if you rent this movie.
