What was it supposed to be? Remake of Fisher King? Why do we care about the character of Sandler? What a slow, grim, boring, who-gives-damn-o-the-people movie !!! It's just painful to sit, turn it off before it's over. It's obvious that Cheadle needs help the same as Sandler; as I said: can you say "Fisher King"? And how does this psychotic character function in his daily life? I do not think we should think deeply. Why is Cheadle still giving Sandler the chance of violence? If they were such good friends, how did they divorce? If Cheadle has such control, why is he looking for a board of trustees on the street? One never speaks. That's why Fisher King was a better movie on so many levels and why it just sucks. Almost 8 out of 10 average results? I do not agree. At all. Even the best films are lucky to get such a high average rating, and this shit does not deserve to be with them in the same universe.
