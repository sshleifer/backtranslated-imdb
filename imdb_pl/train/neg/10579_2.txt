According to IMDb, Master of Horror-Segment Takashi Miike, Imprint, was banned in the US. So I thought I would translate the Swedish review that I just wrote ... <br /> <br /> It was difficult to NOT have any expectations from the episode of Ichi The Killer-director in "Masters of Horror" series. The DVD cover of the Imprint publishing house was very promising. <br /> <br /> The story takes place mainly in a distant Japanese town, some time in the nineteenth century, and tells the story of a journalist looking for Komomo, a woman he left behind and for which he promised to return. Tired and depressed, he arrives at the brothel, hoping that this will be the end of his long journey. It turns out that one of the prostitutes, a deformed and calm girl, knows about Komomo, and a desperate man tells him to tell him where he is and what has happened to her since he left. The story told him is equally deplorable, how difficult it is to swallow ... <br /> <br /> The first thing that struck me in this episode was how unnatural it seemed that Japanese cast mostly speaks American fluently -English. But I leave it on this, it is not such a big deal. What a big deal is, how unhappy she was. Miike's story moves so slowly that I could not help looking at my watch several times in 63 minutes. The widened stage of the torch, which takes place somewhere in the middle of the movie, was so unmotivated and pornographic obtrusively that even this scene did not become interesting. I felt that it was violent only because of the violence itself - without a sense of style and purpose. The only scenes that evoked any emotion in me are the images of bloody fetuses running on the bottom of rapidly flowing water ... and to be honest, the only emotions they caused were the disgust. <br /> <br /> A journalist looking for the love he left, Billy Drago, for me the most memorable one like Frank Nitti - Al Capones, the killer in Brian De Palmas The Untouchables (1987). I've always considered Dragos to be a portrait of Nitti very cold (and I mean it in a good way) and probably that's why I was almost annoyed when I found out he was so awful (NOT in a good way) in this one. His actions seem to flow between lack of feelings or empathy in general, and manifestations of really bad actions. When his character is to react to the horrible things that Komomo underwent, I sat on the sofa, turning and turning, trying to escape the terrible actor running through Drago. I am grateful that most of the story was told by Yuoki Kudoh (Memoirs of a Geisha, 2005) who is playing a deformed prostitute. <br /> <br /> Probably the finale is choking, maybe even rebellion and terrifying, but I just found out that it's sort of ... you know ... "blah" (and I looked at the watch again, once again seventh, I just regret that this shitty episode will not end). Perhaps the finale made me smile a bit, but that's only because I could not stop thinking about the episode of Red Dwarf, and the reversed chins of Craig Charles and Danny John-Jules with their eyes glued to look like aliens ... Fortunately, if you've seen this episode and now decide to see Imprint, I will forever ruin the visualization of the ending for you. <br /> <br /> My first thought, when the Imprint finally came to an end, if the only thing that made the pain of watching worth it, was listening to the main title theme of Edward Shearmur (the same music I think that it is used in every episode of this series), and that - if at all - is a big warning about friggin, do not you think? <br /> <br /> One could point to the costume design by Michiko Kitamura and say that at least there is something that is not lacking in style and sophistication. but there are so many other movies and TV shows that are much better at showing Japanese "geisha fashion". It's worse and I'm disappointed. The Takashi Miike's Masters of Horror section is boring, uninspiring and pointless. In other words; It's really, really BAD!
