My thoughts on the film, 9 <br /> <br /> It was not good, not good at all. Visually it was great. I was happy with stimulation, camera angles, etc. However, characters? eh, a bit bland. Thread? It sucked. <br /> <br /> This movie seemed more mushy than anything else. Organized religion is depicted as cowardly and timid. Science is not better described. Creates a monster weapon that kills everything ... but "souls" have the power to destroy monsters and restore life? Really? <br /> <br /> It's also something that bites me a bit. Here is the CGI movie ... created with science ... and use it to tell us that science will destroy the world while promoting the idea that spirituality will save us? At least they had the decency to ask one of the characters, <br /> <br /> "Okay, so now what?" (Or something similar). I did not hear it very well because the crowd immediately rose and took a break to leave. It was "fine ... it was just not very funny to sit here all through the movie, but now let's get out of here as soon as possible!" Type of exit. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies where you can not think if you want to enjoy it. Just look at the visuals and nod your head nicely. Every thought about "what is this for?" Sucks you out of disbelief and makes you look at the sign of departure with longing. <br /> <br /> Okay ... SPOILERS follow. <br /> <br /> So, in principle, the scientist creates a "machine" that is capable of creating another, intelligent, robotic life. Bad people use it as a weapon. However, the scientist realizes that he is also guilty. He gave the Machine his intellect, but he did not give him the heart. <br /> <br /> The machine goes to Skynet on the knees of humanity and erases all life on earth, and eventually turns itself off. However, the scientist manages to survive and create walking marionettes. Each containing a piece of soul of a scientist. <br /> <br /> Last, # 9 wakes up without knowing anything about the world. Nearby, he sees a strange device and picks it up. Meets the other like him, # 2. <br /> <br /> Well, # 2 is captured by the last live robot of the Machine. # 9 is more like him and sets off to the rescue # 2. <br /> <br /> He succeeds. <br /> <br /> # 9 notes that it fits perfectly into the device. He puts it in, and the Machine comes back to life ... pulling the soul # 2 in the process. <br /> <br /> Then the movie continues the action scenes with the number 9 trying to save their ragged souls compatriots. <br /> <br /> They finally succeed and destroy the machine. They free the souls of fallen friends who go into the clouds. Then it rains and we see that life returns to the planet. <br /> <br /> Hunh?!? <br /> <br /> It does not make sense. At all. Why the hell did the scientist want to divide his soul into 9 homunculi? What did it achieve? Were they created to stop the machine? Everything is dead! The machine was dead! Why bother yourself?!? <br /> <br /> Why did he expect that nine small creatures would succeed if nothing else had? Why not create a second intellectual machine, but with a "soul" to fight the first ... at least it would seem that it would have a reasonable chance of success. <br /> <br /> Why did they need their souls sucked into the machine by the Machine, then they would destroy the Machine, and then they would free souls to bring life back to earth? Why not wait until the machine turns off and restores life without the rest of the crazy steps?
