As an Altman fan I have been looking for this movie for years, thinking that with such a great cast it would have to be at least slightly brilliant. <br /> <br /> A big mistake. <br /> <br /> This is one of Altman's bigmans, thrown together accidentally and improvisively (or at least it seems) with the hope that everything will go down together in the editorial office. This is not. <br /> <br /> As underlined by Maltin, this turkey is distinguished only by the debut of Alfre Woodard, who outshines the vets surrounding her. But avoid it at all costs. (Which is quite easy to do - it has never been released on video - to my knowledge - and its performances on the cable have the frequency of Halley's Comet).
