It must have been one of the worst films ever. When appears, Kate and Jed are with a group of boys and everyone is starting to clap ... so Hollywood. Another bad scene was that Kate was shifting her hand along the sidewalk. It looked like he was examining the pavement's texture. Andie's acting is so bad in this movie - I could not connect with them or feel that they love each other. The other two women, however, were very good and were in the shadow of Andie. In any case, it was such a movie campaign. I usually like these types of movies, but I could not enter the movie. Too many unlikely situations and Andie's acting again did not help the movie. She also has gums. Lancome must make up the makeup with a spatula, because it looks great in stores.
