We should have suspiciously discovered that we were the only ones only two minutes before the light. Only five other people joined before the start of the movie. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to buy this movie. Acting is awful (especially Mrs. Hurley). The script is trivial. The effects we've seen a million times. The direction of the worst movie we've seen. Meandering and chaotic. Nobody laughed, including children. <br /> <br /> We left after 25 minutes. It would be sooner if my wife did not go for a hot dog !!! <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money on this movie. If there is nothing else to watch in your cinema, buy drinks, popcorn and hot dogs, and some watch. You will have a much nicer time !!! <br /> <br />
