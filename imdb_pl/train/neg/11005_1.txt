This film shows a number of sketches that partially overlap. I realized that the passing away was over in the movie, at first it only irritated me. <br /> <br /> Many episodes in this movie come without any recognizable punch and just try to embrace this fact using absurdity and obscenity. Trying to remain comedy without any funny bits fails. <br /> <br /> My staff and maybe a subjective result after watching this movie (My God, it hurts in my head every time I call it a "movie"): A bold attempt to turn anything into something big. But it did not work. At least the director did something out of nothing. But this is not something good. <br /> <br /> Many movies have not turned out to be as fun as they were planned, but this one is the best. It is a true manifestation of the worst filmmaking scenario. No. To improve, it's even worse. Film with gags so bad that they are not funny at all. It is not even fun to watch the main actor, the screenwriter and director (all three of the same guy by the way) are dying, drowning in a sea of ​​bad movies. The movie is bad for it.
