This production has no story. The action is embarrassing. The promising Dutch television Sophie Hilbrand should not add this video to her CV. Her acting is far from faultless and I personally think she has crossed the line of professional decency; regarding the way it appears in this video. This movie contains too many unnecessary nudity, vulgar sex scenes and naughty language. It also shows a bad picture of the Netherlands (like most movies). Do not worry about watching this movie: a waste of time, a waste of money and an embarrassing record for Hilbrand, who turned out to be better on the screen with her.
