A bad attempt to break up in the "Seven", along with sub-second-class acting, terrible camera work, half-baked history and a strong aftertaste of lame propaganda. Yes, it's sex offenders, they live next door and you really will be raped, really. <br /> <br /> Without surprises from a woman-vice-terminatrix, she behaves as always - as convincingly as a piece of wood. Richard Gere is moving lower and lower - and he is as low here as the late Steven Seagal. <br /> <br /> The singer with crazy eyes is the best when she is dead in bed; and even the wolf was a sub-par (though she was the best performer in the movie) - maybe they fed her before the shots or something. <br /> <br /> Unlike the "Seven", which had (made up, but interesting) a story that you can refer to more or less independently of the country, this movie seems to focus on the US only. If you do not care for "sex offenders" - and statistics say that lack of exercise and a bad diet cause more pain, suffering and death - there is no reason to see or be afraid of it. > <br /> There are some body parts fetishes and some snuff, but the blood is less than average and fails as both an artistic device (because it is pointless) and upside because it is not bloody enough. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time on this one.
