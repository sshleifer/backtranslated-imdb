From the very beginning this movie had several disadvantages. The main character played by Hayden Christensen is a wealthy young tycoon who inherited a lot of wealth and father's power, and he tries both to fill his father's shoes and cut the cords of his apron. He also has a problem with heart disease and waiting in the abyss, which is the registry of organ donors. There are also small stories that ignore your first instinct, which become important later, such as his friendship with the surgeon (Terrence Howard) and his affair with the middle-class girl (Jessica Alba). Unique feature lines, but not bad enough to spoil the movie. The only real "oy vey!" Moment was the name of the character Lena Olin. A naive woman named Lilith ... subtle! <br /> <br /> Surgical scenes are not censored at all. I appreciate that people who find scary surgical scenes may not. At first, the horror of awakening during anesthesia was good. You look in emotional agony when Christensen yells inward through a chest incision and a rib spreader. The irony moment of trailers comes when he is one of the unlucky ones who do not sleep during anesthesia, he is also lucky because he helps him find out that his surgical team is planning to kill him. <br /> <br /> The great twist, however, is very predictable and sends the film to a conspiracy and its memories of the small characters that were there, but he, like us, initially missed. <br /> <br /> At the end there are two more twists and turns related to his relationship with his mother. One is the impressive gesture of Olina, who is equally impressive because of poor writing. The second is a secret about the past of the family, which seemed very attached and pointless. <br /> <br /> Initially, a well-made drama of anaesthesiological awareness is lost in a badly written conspiracy drama. There is the last attempt to restore him, which falls flat, taking the entire movie.
