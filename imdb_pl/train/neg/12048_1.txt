Throughout my life, I left about six films. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I do not know how I sat for an hour. That night I had to be in a coma. I saw it in the theater when it appeared 8 years ago. I did not even remember the name, but I knew that Penelope Ann Miller played in it. It must have really affected me wasting my time commenting on it today. Yech! Vomit! Barf!
