It seemed like a good movie, I thought it would be a good movie, and throughout the movie I hoped it would make sense to use my time, and yes, I must admit that the acting talent Dimple Kapadia and Deepti Naval, where really praiseworthy but despite the best effort, this movie is not able to effectively convey a meaningful message, which seems to have seemed like what Somnath Sen is trying to do. The last point is short, and the end seemed unsatisfactory after all; a bit like real life in this respect, but the films, unlike real life, end about 2 hours, and the ending should leave the audience satisfied if it really was the intention of the director. It does not fit in this respect and it disappoints me the most. <br /> <br /> Another aspect that bothers me was the national stereotyping of American characters - they all seem to be engraved in the same block. I think most American characters in Indian English movies are based on how often Indians see Americans themselves, and it is clear that no effort has been made to allow any American in the film to feel depth or complexity. /> <br /> These two aspects make for a disappointing story.
