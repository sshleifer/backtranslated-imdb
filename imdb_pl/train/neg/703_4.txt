College students who clean up the condemned dormitory follow an elusive killer. <br /> <br /> Dorm That Dripped Blood (aka Pranks) is a mixed bag for slasher fans. The production values ​​of films are quite low, and the plot is mostly routine, and on the red herring even the terrifying butt is spinning. In fact, much of the story is quite forgotten, except for one or two brutal murders. But the film is really improved by a surprisingly intense climax (in an atmospheric climate) and one fairly bold, unconventional conclusion. <br /> <br /> The cast is mostly colorless. Stephen Sachs is the best of many because he has a pretty good character. Look for the young Daphne Zunigi as an unfortunate student. <br /> <br /> In all, it's quite a standard B effort, but the finale is worth relishing, and the viewer has not recorded the movie as total noise. <br /> <br /> ** with ****
