I'll be honest, it's one of the worst films ever. If not, it is VERY close. Have you ever seen a bad teenage soap opera? This is one of those. Except worse. For example: (POSSIBLY SPOILER) girl: I want to go somewhere else. <br /> <br /> guy: everything we need is here. <br /> <br /> girl: but I want to get somewhere else br /> <br /> guy: I'll take you somewhere else. <br /> <br /> ... Continuing this line they have sex. Music is bad pop and bad punk rock. If you've ever read a book, avoid this movie like plague. They completely change the characters' personalities and events. In addition, they get rid of things. The film also ends before the end of the book. It's a terrible movie. So if you have not read the book, do not watch it. If you have read the book, burn it (film). If you like stupid soap operas for teens that are of lower quality than the average soap opera for teenagers with low quality, go for it. Should we expect something other than MTV?
