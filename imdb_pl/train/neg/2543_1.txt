I'm talking about wasting money ... I'm just wondering why Michael would play such a turkey in a movie ... Michael is a great actor, especially in the movie where he plays a man dying of cancer ... that was great. how he records for his son to see him when he grows up ... Michael is such a talented actor ... so what made him do it ??? I watched him and thought it was really stupid .. probably someday in his career have bad movies .. especially "The Squeeze", I did not understand it at all, and feel that his best performance was in "Pacific Heights" his character really me she was scared ... and I really liked the "Multitude". it was so much fun !!! and he was just perfect for the role of "Batman" .. and I liked "Night Shift" and I also love "Johnny Dangerously" ... it's a pity that some of them make bad movies .. just like this one was ...
