I'm ashamed to have this movie in my collection. The most beneficial factor for having a DVD is a short movie in the bonus functions. My voice for this movie is big ZERO. Do not get me wrong, I'm a horror girl. but I want some meat for the story, not to mention that I prefer evil to meet people, not to be fooled by what seemed like forever, clips of animal snuff. Acts of brutality interrupt painfully long silence and weak acting. If I was forced to compare with another film, the only one that comes to mind is Cannibal Holocaust. A bad, boring, senseless and totally uncomfortable watch.
