I am the owner of almost every Seagal movie (yes, even the one that has a low budget) and I must say that it can be the worst, not just his films, but all the films that have ever been made. The only climax of this movie and the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that A. is Seagal, and B. Seagal has a few sweet action sequences, especially in the store, and also when he takes another to throw away an entire army knife. Next time, give me 90 minutes of Seagal killing people and do not even worry about the plot, because the plot not only stinks, but also acting, the fact that F-18 and F-14 have somehow changed in the F-16s, and the fact that that Stealth was as fast as F-16. Stealth also never had to fill up? And since Afghanistan is considered a hostile territory from the point of view of the air force. recently I checked that Afghanistan has no air force, we (USA) control the sky. In addition, this top secret mission was played through the speakers to the entire crew in the room, but the Admiral still whispers to the other guy that he is secret. Also, how did Seagal go from the bottom of the truck to the top? Please tell us why they imprisoned him. Since when is the Air Force piloting large commandos (unless they are Owen Wilson?) And since their drunkards in Arab countries believe that Muslims do not drink alcohol? Besides, since when do Arabs listen to the orders of women like the rulers? The climax of the film was definitely Seagal killing people in the store, and the remaining 50 people killed with a knife, as well as a very short and completely random lesbian scene, which came out of nowhere.
