really horrible ... the main actor did OK ... the movie, the plot, etc. was completely nonsense and inaccurate, it might as well have been a continuation ... whatever little or no relevance to Carlitos Way ... and should avoid him like a plague on Carlito fans' way ... no mention of Gail actually ends with another bird, no mention of the Klienfelt, no mention of how he was caught, no mention of how he was sent to prison. .. tried to do it as the original with backsami at the beginning ... but to be honest, I was looking for a zero mark ... unfortunately I had to rate it higher ... <br /> <br /> It's a terrible attempt to earn one of the best films 90s ... in general it was about 6 and 2 hours of my life wasted ... on all "activities" in this, it was really boring, slow and predictable ... again for every fan Carltio's Way avoid this fiasco. ..
