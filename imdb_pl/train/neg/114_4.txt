This is not a cast. A better group of actors that can not be found. This is not a setting. The director is in love with New York and we are all at the end of the movie! Woody Allen could not improve what Bogdonovich did here. If you're going to fall in love or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. Actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. From the Hollywood director's own experience, it happens when they go to work on a set. It is a reality for him and his peers, but it is a fantasy for most of us in the real world. In the end, the movie is empty and shallow, and without a message.
