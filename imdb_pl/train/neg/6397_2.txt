I have a problem with movies that appear on television when there is nothing else to watch. Somehow I'm getting into really bad movies. <br /> <br /> But this one was quite possible to look at. The concept of being the only ones left on Earth after the comet, and then discovering the zombies nearby makes me laugh. And that's why I gave this film 2 instead of 1. The story was stupid ... but in the way that you are laughing (too stupid> funny). <br /> <br /> I think I just watched her because the guy from Star Trek was the leader. I was surprised to see him as a younger guy ... and he was the only funny character.
