Is this a remake og Thing (1982/1951), I think so, there are so many factors from previous det movies that deny. <br /> <br /> So the acting is wrong, James Spader makes superlow to recreate himself with his cup of coffee and his strange thinking / movements, but that's it, other actors I did not even notice. You do not have the feeling of getting to know anyone from the main characters. And the evolution of the plot is slow, boring and I know what will happen in 30 minutes. The result / music is amazing, there are not many unshakeable people who would earn points for Coke and credit, but this is nonsense. Some special effects are nice if they were created in the early 90's. If you like Slimes Aliens, shivers and emotions, do not do this movie. his boring combination of Thing, Alien 3, Outbreak and some of Jerry Bruckheimer / Michael Bay's production went really bad. Now this combination would be nice if someone knew what they were doing and the only ones in the production who knew it, no one. <br /> <br /> Although I've seen a lot worse, I do not recommend this movie to anyone, but if you're on a cold night and want to get something wet, the time is slowly passing by.
