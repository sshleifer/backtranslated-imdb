I rented it on DVD and I feel bad because Dawson and Lugacy are so serious in the DVD comments. This is not a bad movie, but it is one of those movies that desperately want to be a deep commentary on human nature, not realizing that its history is practically a genre. In addition, it is a bit simplified in a number of ways, and the behavior of the characters often distorts faith. I would say that this is a movie that you can get something out of if you do not have a lot of movie / TV / literature / life behind you (to be honest, I even saw the same story in the horror comics). Otherwise his point was earlier and more ingeniously. This applies to a large problem that is not of great interest to the cinema beyond that. As a result, a rather vague movie is created that invests everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and convincing, and it really does not pay off.
