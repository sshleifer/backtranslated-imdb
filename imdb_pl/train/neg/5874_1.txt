one of the worst movies I've seen so far. A pitiful scene of action and really bad acting does not help either. The only good point is the parts of Gary Busey, but this does not raise the film too much. lives in accordance with its rating of films B and passes the test in the colors of the flying. The loss of my money, although I think it's funny that it starts to get upset after a few watches. I do not recommend this movie unless you watch it for free or as a gift. (you can ask for a gift and send it back for a full refund). <br /> <br /> Really BAd. <br /> <br /> 1/10.
