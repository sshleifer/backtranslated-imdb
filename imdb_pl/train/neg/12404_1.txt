I must say that this movie is Mork and Mindy knock when I watch it, I have shivers, I will even get a little wet. When this Korean guy with spiders on his neck started kicking people, I was like my Asian lady, they smell and suck because they're eating dogs all the time. Returning to the track, Chuck had a slightly awful performance and lacked the intelligence of an ordinary, non-robotic man. Some compared it to its earlier days when it was an analyzer of a car wash and believed in the holy spirit and spirit of the Christmas past. This movie is so bad that I put my newborn baby in a box and left it in Mr. Norris' mailbox. He can raise my child. I do not let him into a world where he thinks Chuck Norris is a karate expert.
