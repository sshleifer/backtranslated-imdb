My mother worked with Dennis L. Raider for eleven years, not to mention sharing the office with him. When it was announced that it was BTK, it was shocked. The whole day was just her story of how she would never see him as Wichita Killer. I heard how many times she told them. I asked her many things and went to all interviews she was asked to do. I read the whole book written about Raider, Wichita is my hometown and I was surprised that something like this could happen in Kansas. <br /> <br /> Not so long ago, another BTK movie appeared on TV, and I thought it would be better at showing Dennis's killings, maybe even had some smart touches on his motives. <br /> <br /> I will be very dumb because of the disadvantages of this movie. This is based on the presentation of it by my mother, on all his readings and on the video tapes I saw him talking about. <br /> <br /> First, the camera angles were awful. It looked like it was shot on a home video camera. Acting was terrible and I could not even stand to watch it. <br /> <br /> Dennis Raider never had long hair. Dennis Raider was a "very anal guy" and he was the type of a "guilty" guy. He was not as nice as the movie made him look, he was very kind and violent, he was interested. The same applies to killings, as far as we all know. If you saw his confession in court, you can already guess. <br /> <br /> And what about the obsession with the slaughterhouse? No. I have never read whether Dennis Raider has confessed to the problem of cruelty to animals or the malice of people. In fact, he practiced on cats and dogs in order to choke the methods. However, throughout the film he placed animals on the faces of his victim and acted as if he cared for their well-being. <br /> <br /> Dennis Raider never killed the people he knew, he confessed it, but in the movie in his first murder tells a lady who also knows her. <br /> <br /> I really do not even want to enter this movie, and I'm already ranting. This is NOT what you want to watch if you are interested in the real events of BTK. This is NOT what you want to watch if you want a good horror movie. If you want badly recorded half-porn with a few slaughter scenes, this is your movie.
