It's really a terrible movie, "B". It is meaningless and often embarrassing. The plot, the basic routine of "doing the show business", hardly exists. In fact, the film is just a pretext to push through the war and highlight some of the popular 1942 music groups, including Mills Brothers, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Bob Crosby and Freddy Slack. Each group has three standard minutes, the exception is the Mills Brothers, who for some reason guaranteed two numbers. Ann Miller does not dance until the last few minutes of the film, and she has little to do, but she does her things in the dam of patriotic propaganda. <br /> <br /> The most interesting moment in the film in my opinion took place in the Duke Ellington segment. The band seems to be playing on the train, standing in uncomfortable positions. (In those days in the far South, the team was segregated in railway cars while traveling.) Johnny Hodges is seen next to Duke, and Harry Carney can also be identified. In the last moments of the movie, the trumpeter / violinist Ray Nance moves to the altar to the camera and does "Uncle Tom", overhearing his eyes and moving his head in the way that Willy Best did in many movies. For modern viewers, especially jazz fans, this tribute to segregation is really sad. Some movies are best invisible.
