It's a bad movie, but I have to pass it to the main actress in this movie .... Francine Forbes. It seemed that she was the least, and I personally thought she was adorable. It is a pity that it appears only in one other film in the database. In addition, the movie is full of funny scenes from up and false death. People are stabbed with a knife and GUSH like 2 gallons of blood! But if you like watching bad horror movies, I recommend it very much.
