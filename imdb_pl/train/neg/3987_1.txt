Before the end I came out of very few movies, but I could not finish this piece of rubbish. It was the biggest load of racism that had been tried as a legal movie since the birth of the nation. Characters were little more than cardboard cutouts. I do not understand how any actor would like his name to be related to this movie. Lee needs to have better things to do to put out that junk. I know that everyone with the brain has better things to do ... like watching dry paint. I would like someone to make a movie about inter-racial relations that realistically raises the topic. There is much more depth to the subject, which is the shallow setting of a bitter director like Lee.
