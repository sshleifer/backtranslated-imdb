The character Demi Moore in the film was chosen for SEAL because of her appearance. It was a bad start and the movie fell from there. The plot was completely unbelievable. It is not enough to get him in a tough military unit. This movie did not convince me of the physical ability of a woman to perform the required tasks. <br /> <br /> Trying to pretend that women and men are basically the same, insulting everyone's intelligence. Differences between the sexes make life interesting.
