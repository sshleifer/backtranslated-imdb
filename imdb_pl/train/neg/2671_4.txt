** MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The title topless heroine rescues another beautiful girl and her father (an eccentric professor whose spare helmet is broken with one shot and the whole in the next) from the moth eaten, the mummy from the store with a penny and nasty Nazis to - what else? - build the Fourth Reich. Misty's outfit, like other wimmen, becomes smaller as the film goes on. The last part of the film is devoted to the prolonging lesbian action; this material is really boring, very fast, which tells more about creatures behind the camera than about the rounded creatures in front of it. MISTY gets her nominal story from the beginning and quickly, and then gives undivided attention to nakedness and the soft core. This makes MUMMY RAIDER a return to movies from the 1960s, such as Stan Borden, David F. Friedman and Harry Novak. Just think: if this wonderful work was shot four decades ago, it would play for 42nd Street over the years with WHAM BAM THANK YOU SPACEMAN and KISS ME QUICK. In fact, MISTY MUNDAE MUMMY RAIDER went straight to home video. Catch yours quickly before it goes out of print.
