This movie is so bad - dialogues, history, actors and actresses - everything! - it is hard to imagine that this year or in the following years we will see worse. "Brother of love" (imprisoned in Australia among Italian immigrants) has only shallow phrases about Italian culture to offer, and it is quite clear that even Italians from Italy and Italy speak English. The message of the movie - ugly people must get married to ugly people, beautiful people have to marry beautiful people - it's really uncomfortable. Giovanni Ribisi is quite good in films such as "Suburbia" and "Lost in Translation", but here his pseudo-Italian accent is hard to bear. See this video at your own risk. Garbage like a trash can!
