This is one of the few episodes (if not the only) with an undeniable mistake in telling the story. While dealing with Ralphie's situation, Christopher states that he heard about the death of Pie-O-My in a fire accident. This is an important detail, because in this context it is quite obvious that Christopher knows from the beginning that Tony is the one who had to kill Ralphie. There is no way Chris can hear about the accident. Who should tell him and when? Before Tony was pulled out of the delirium, no one was informed. Tony knows - what makes him worse! Hearing Christopher talking about the death of Pie-O-My, he could lead Tony to believe that Chris himself had lit a fire. Considering the impressively complicated writing process, which the authors themselves write about on DVD, I really wonder that none of them were aware of this problem. History simply does not work that way. Needless to say, I am a huge fan of Soprano. Otherwise, I certainly would not care.
