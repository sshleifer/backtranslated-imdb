I just watched the movie last night and being someone who had very low expectations, I was still disappointed. The most blatant mistake in this film's abomination is that the main plot (the guy awakened during the operation) had nothing to do with the result. Regardless, it would end the same way. So what was it about? Who knows. Also, this surgeon had 4 suits against him and thought that people would not ask questions if the patient died on his table? Give me a break. Jessica Alba is completely without talent, and Christiansen is almost as bad. The whole thing was just ridiculous from beginning to end. I'm pretty sure that if you felt someone cutting your chest with a scalpel, you'd be more affected than that.
