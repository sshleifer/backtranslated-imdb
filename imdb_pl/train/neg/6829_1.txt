I've written at least half a dozen scathing reviews of this grim film and none have been published, so I have to say that someone from imdb.com really likes this awful movie. The idea that a group of oil workers can resurrect a military tank that has been deposited in the desert for over ten years and make it a fighting machine is ridiculous. Like action and direction. Give it to me.
