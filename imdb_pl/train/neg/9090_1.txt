A propaganda film for the Palestinian "cause". If you were expecting an unbiased document on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, you would have to look elsewhere. If you are an anti-Semite (or simply anti-Zionist - nothing wrong in supporting the destruction of the country, right?) Or uncritically in support of Palestinian goals (eg Mass murder, destruction of Israel), this is a document for you. You should spend the evening on college campuses in the UK and the United States. However, any informed and intellectually honest person would be outraged by the sheer number of lies presented in this film. I just hope that those who are not really aware of this situation are not corrupted by this anti-Semitic dirt.
