This thoughtless movie is a piece of nonsense and boring like replays from the whole house. For all people who want to see a great, exciting and cool horror, they should not even think about watching this mindless work. in my opinion, F-. I have one question, what were they thinking? Let's make a list: 1) bad script 2) bad script 3) bad script 4) bad actor 5) bad director and last but not least bad script. I mean, I do not like staring at every movie, but I was disappointed when I watched it. This movie should be locked in a box, locked and sunk in the sea. So please, do not do something like that, please, please, please !!!!
