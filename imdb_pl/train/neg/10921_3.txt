I often try to watch bad movies, and original movies in the science-fiction channel seem to be one of the best sources of these films. As such, I am sure that you can imagine my disappointment when I saw the Sands of oblivion. Acting was an unusually sub-par, unlike the pitifully disgraceful science fiction show that usually awaits us. There are several scenes created by people you most probably will meet, although you may not know their names by heart. CGI's special effects are minimal, so one of the biggest sources of comedy in a science-fiction movie is missing. Sure, there are some funny moments when a guy is beheaded by a bulldozer or when a main character leaves his friend to die to save a girl he has known for a few days, but overall, you end up laughing on the floor and I consider this a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> If I rated it on a 10-star scale created especially for the evaluation of TV movies, I would probably give it 4, maybe even 5. It's a real pity that I have to wait for the next original science-fiction movie to Have a good laugh, and I really hope this movie is not part of the overall quality increase in sci -fi original movies.
