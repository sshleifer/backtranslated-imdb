As you all know, JIGSAW did not reach Blackbuster because of Full Moon staff member Devin Hamilton. Devin is the one who sells all video networks. He recently released the BLEED movie that he sold to Blackbuster at the same time as JIGSAW. He convinced the Blackbuster buyer not to accept any JIGSAW and double the BLEED number. As a result, JIGSAW looks like a flop, and BLEED looks like a hit. The main problem with this is that BLEED is one of the worst films ever, and as we all know, JIGSAW is, well, gold. I am calling you all to go to the BLEED website on the internet and vote for a film that has harmed JIGSAW and all your talents. Similarly, you should go to the JIGSAW website and give high votes for it (if you do not already have one). We need to get JIGSAW to at least 8 or 8.5, and BLEED to about 2 (by placing it on the 100 worst lists of movies on the Internet). Also try to convince your friends and family to do the same. <br /> <br /> I hope you're all doing well, - Matt
