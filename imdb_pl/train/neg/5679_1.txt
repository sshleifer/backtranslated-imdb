I was so moved by the real movie material at the beginning of the movie that I felt sick in my stomach and ended up turning the film off. As everyone can give this movie more than 1 value, it surprises me. I know that the intention of the film is to shock, but to show the actual film material of a dog that has been skinned alive (holding vomit while writing) - PLEASE! I turned it off after the scene with the decaying child. Until then, my eyes were covered by most of the time. Not surprisingly, this film was found in a chance container at HMV. I really do not want to watch any other film of this person from Uwe. Anyone who likes it needs therapy. Dot.
