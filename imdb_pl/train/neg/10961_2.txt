Although the film could be "real" compared to Lewis's book (in the sense that the script was essentially literal, literally), he failed to capture any size that would otherwise be associated with such an epic story. Mythical creatures (unicorns, centaurs, griffins, ghosts, ghosts) are * drawn * and, as in the previous review, the sequence of flying on the green screen was very difficult to swallow. I almost laughed to death when I saw humanoid beavers with their huge stiff suits and teeth; I almost cried when I heard "howling ..." a wolf, a man in a gray fuzzy suit, basically screaming as loud and girly as he could. <br /> <br /> All the acting is incredibly forced, especially as little Lucy Penvens ... I could only take so much indignation, desperation and teeth in fourteen hours of watching the movie. The actress who plays the White Witch seems to be more at home on the stage, where a roaring voice, wide arms and brave effort for Shakespeare will be appreciated. <br /> <br /> The sets are claustrophobic, regardless of whether the scenes are taking place inside or outside. Inside, as if the BBC could afford to spend $ 100 to build the set, so it's very small, and all the characters are constantly focused together. The Castle of the White Witch is a neglected, rotting English castle full of Styrofoam statues and poor lighting. When Penvensie children are wandering in the forest - actually * every * scene in the forest - it seems that they just circle around. <br /> <br /> The only thing that looks decent in the movie is Aslan, but you can bet that the BBC probably blew off the entire movie budget to build a mechanical feline. It looks great when it stands motionless and before it starts talking, but when it starts moving, you can not mourn a poor man who must be back in a lion costume. <br /> <br /> Yes, if you're a Narnia fan, you might want to see this version simply because it keeps every word that Lewis ever wrote - but Lewis was definitely not a screenwriter, and a lot of dialogue on the screen is massive and uncomfortable. In the scene in which children are at the Beaver's and prepare to escape the wolves, Mrs. Beaver constantly, "oh, only ONE thing, dear, and then we will be ready to work", interrupted by children at the same time screams, sighs and groans "NO, Mrs. Beaver, PLEASE! "- a scene of comic relief, so absurd (it is supposed that they STRESS from the inevitable danger, without thinking whether to pack a sewing machine or not), negatively affects the drama that a scene could have. In fact, the whole movie is full of faux pas, such as these. <br /> <br /> I recommend to see the new Narnia (Disney 2005). A new movie, with updated effects, spectacular computer animation, great timing around and a magnificent and stealing scene, The White Witch (which plays its role with all the subtle evil of an experienced politician, unlike the screaming banshee) catches all the magnificence and magnificence of the Narnia world without compromising the smallest part of Lewis's original vision (I think so). Lucy is much prettier (NO TEETH, YAY!), Like beavers (and realistically great), and Brothers BBC Edmund has nothing divine, Desperate-Hungry-Acceptance-Uncertain-and-Anger- - Edmunds inferiority complex, which stands before the new version of Disney. <br /> <br /> Unless you are the type who likes to waste time, laughing at the movies on the campsite, I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
