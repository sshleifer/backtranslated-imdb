This should be my kind of movie. Even if it sucked, it should still be right on my avenue; hell, I like "Congo" and "Allan Quatermaine". I have a weakness in my heart for stupid foreign movies / demons / adventure. Let's think about why I decided to watch it first. <br /> <br /> 1. Horror / Sci-fi almost always intrigues me. 2. I am a huge fan of archeology, and this film contains a rare treasure. 3. Super natural enemies with high quality FX. 4. Christian Slater and Dorf I are generally happy. 5. Tara Reid is hot. <br /> <br /> So this movie had potential, at least in the horror section of the video store, but the boy sucked it. The only aspects of redemption are Slater and Dorf, and not everyone thinks them as funny as I am ... I mean, let's face it, both are melodramatic. But now for many mistakes. <br /> <br /> Tara Reid. Although the film as a whole is inferior, Reid's performance is really terrible. We are not saying badly, I am talking about nominating Tara Reid for the worst results in the year. I do not know if she is capable of acting, but playing in a museum is simply outside of her league ... completely. Watching him try to transport an educated scientist did not differ much from what you see in bad porn. I mean, it's not bad, it's ridiculously bad. Oh, and for those of you who are curious, it does not get naked, just a bra in a stupid, totally unnecessary love scene. <br /> <br /> Even in the case of Reid's performance, maybe the movie could work, but the plot is what dominates, and the plot seems to be written by a 10-year-old. I did not realize that it was an adaptation of video games, after watching a DVD, otherwise I would appreciate stupidity in real time. <br /> <br /> The story jumps back and forth from Slater's childhood in an orphanage, where he gets a flashback of something terrible, what happened, of course he has amnesia. In adulthood, Slater was recruited by unit 713, a paranormal military force that apparently hunts for evil or something like that. Slater had to leave because he was too rebellious, you probably never really know unless he was in one of those voice recordings that I played in the middle. The film begins with Slater's hunting artefacts, obtaining his latest work after several contacts with the "Chilean mercenary force specializing in the sale of rare antiques". I could have an incorrect quote, but you have an idea. <br /> <br /> There is a bad doctor who wants to release some hellions on the ground (without giving a reason), experiments on children, super demon / alien - human hybrids, "photonic" bullets (demonic things can not stand sunlight) and, of course, Slater and Dorf, try to save everyone. <br /> <br /> Jesus, I can not even get through stereotypical elements. The script needed a remake to narrow the range and provide some SOME depth. I mean, why is this bad scientist so damned angry? Oh, people are doomed to death, and he's just trying to save humanity. I think he's infected? How did this happen? Oh, he has one of the evil demons in the cage and draws blood to shoot at himself. How the hell did it happen? Why and where did the super snails come from (yeah, they use old sci-fi by parasitic aliens / demons that "connect" to the backbone of their host) Of course, Slater is like Blade, half super-powered snail, but his snail "no he ended up being killed by an electric shock, "thank God. Oh, and people with these "connected" spines have no idea that they are half-stranger / demon and act like good members of the community until a secret signal comes from where they turn deadly zombies. Yes, we have a zombie. <br /> <br /> So much shit that can be fun, but it's not. <br /> <br /> Also the ending is completely stupid, because everything turns out not to be such a big layout to fix in the first place ... at least nothing that little dynamite can handle. <br /> <br /> Not the worst thing you will see, but a really bad movie.
