The massacre is a film directed by Andrea Bianchi (Burial Ground) and produced by the legendary Italian horror director Lucio Fulci. Now with this mix of great talent, you would think that this movie would be a real gore festival. It could not be further. The massacre falls on her face as one of the most boring movies I've seen in Italian cinema. In fact, I tried to stay awake during the movie and never had a problem with Italian horror movies. <br /> <br /> The massacre begins with the murder of a whore on the side of the road with an ax. This scene was used in the Fulci Nightmare concert. This is not a bad scene and raises your expectations towards the movie as a slaughter with an ax. Unfortunately, the next hour of the movie is so boring. The film goes into a horror movie set that is filmed, and during these scenes there is a lot of character development, but the characters in the movie are so boring and badly behaved that the interest begins to leak out. The last 30 minutes of the movie is not so bad, but it could still be much better. The blood in the film was pathetic, and since Fulci used most of the scenes upstairs at the Nightmare Concert, there was nothing new. The end of the film left a good turn, but there were still many unanswered ones, and continuity falls on the floor. <br /> <br /> It was not a very good movie, but a real Italian horror movie man (like me) is a must because this film is very rare. 4/10 stars
