I watched this movie. To end. And it really was not easy. It is so boring, badly played and almost in every detail stolen from the "BLAIR WITCH PROJECT" that you can not believe that the creators take it seriously. It's even harder to believe how this "product" came across VHS and DVD. <br /> <br /> So if you want to see a horror movie, just watch "Scream", but if you want to laugh and have fun, watching some children running around the woods shouting at each other and showing their inability, watch the dark areas.
