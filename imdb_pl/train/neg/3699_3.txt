<br /> <br /> One would expect that a movie with the famous comedian in the main role will be a funny movie. This is not the case here. I laughed loud once in the whole movie, and it was not even on the last comedy scene (which one would expect the most fun). This is the one you can watch when it comes to television, do not spend any other rental money.
