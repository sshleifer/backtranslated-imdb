A rather funny song that tries to show how intelligent the Orcs are, but in the meantime (completely unaware of them) makes the audience feel stupid, creating the most absurd movie. Richard Harris plays Quinta. I'm sorry, it's not like that, the game of Captain Nolan, a fisherman who catches sharks for life, but is lured by a big hook and tries to catch an orc. When the female whale is missing (do not ask), his partner (do not ask) goes crazy (do not ask) and STALKING Captain Nolan begins (Do not ask). Soon Captain Nolan realizes that he has something in common (do not ask). Quite amazing filming here. But I must tell you that the beginning (with whale sounds and nothing else) is quite haunting, and the final credits (with the most horrible song) are quite funny.
