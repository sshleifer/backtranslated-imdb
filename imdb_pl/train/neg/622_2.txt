This movie is so aggressive. The main character looks 35 years old and I've seen lean beans with more balls than this guy. The plot returns are so predictable that it is not even worth watching because of humor. <br /> <br /> Also some of the worst dialogues I have heard for 3 years, let us find a small animal for torture. br /> <br /> Ugh ..... I can not even continue, do not watch this pile of rubbish, it was done in 8 days. <br /> <br /> The only highlight is a drunk guy calls the main character a pedal to draw pictures. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10, not for viewing
