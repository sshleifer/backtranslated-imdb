The thing that stands out in this film (unfortunately) is the introduction, in which John Berlin (Andy Garcia) goes to the city. You see how his Mercedes passes a winding road through a forest that looks like a redwood tree loaded with snow. She is quite beautiful. <br /> <br /> As for Andy Garcia playing a character with the name Berlin, well ... Andy is just too Latin / Latin to be satisfactory. Perhaps the Caucasian father married his Spanish mother for this story? Who knows. But I can tell you that when you put him in the town of farmers and hicks, he stands out like a painful thumb, especially with his accent that flashes when he gets nervous. Yes, I know, a good thing? He is still a good actor. <br /> <br /> The title concerns a serial killer who calls his victims Jennifer. All victims are blind and he neglects them. The killer took a break, but suddenly appears again when there is a blind witness (do not ask), Helena Robertson (Uma Thurman). Thurman does a good job playing the blind, to my surprise. When I saw Lance Henriksen playing Sgt. Freddy Ross I was worried. Henriksen played in rather strange films, especially late. I still can not forget about him in the movie about the blood bath, Pumpkin. <br /> <br /> Berlin movies in a small town with L.A. as a detective. He starts investigating Jennifer's murders after finding a part of the body at a local repository. His brilliance in discovering that one of the victims was blind seemed impressed. Just like the irony of Freddy's * SPOILER *, with the recording and similarity of names. I was very confused about the logic of how eight "Jennifer" came into being. And the killer's motive as just madness was not too strong. Looking back, this film is probably more faithful to life, showing anything unsuspecting man as capable of murder just because it became a little wacko with time, or maybe a crazy toons was born. <br /> <br /> John Malkovich is doing an amazing job in auditioning Garcia! Although no cop could legally push someone who eats so much and an egg, he would not be knocked out. As for the ending, this is a bit surprising, but it is highly debatable, as is Sgt. Ross's murder. The killer chooses to walk on his victim, instead chooses frolick I'm guessing. <br /> <br /> And there are so many possibilities that it kills her that it's funny. I will not spoil the very end, because despite its instability, it's a good surprise. Later, however, you will probably say, like me, "the boy was lucky!" 4/10
