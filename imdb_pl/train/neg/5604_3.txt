I've heard about this film for many years and finally I have the chance to see it. The enormous murder of the cheerleaders in 1963 and 1969 led to the closure of the cheerleading camp. Scroll to 1982, and Bambi, a former student, opens him with new recruits, including Candy (Carol Kane), Glenn (judge Reinhold) and Sandy (Debralee Scott). One by one they are murdered by a killer, as long as only one remains. That's when we find out who did it and why. <br /> <br /> Also in the film Tom Smothers makes a terrible accent as a Canadian Mountie, and Paul Reubens does his Pee-Wee Herman schtick. The story is generally not very well developed and quite bad, but there are funny scenes, namely House of Bad Pies and a strip scene. The ending seems to be connected, which is a shame. <br /> <br /> In general, good for about ten or fifteen minutes, the rest that you can simply scroll forward. He can catch him on TV, but it's not worth buying.
