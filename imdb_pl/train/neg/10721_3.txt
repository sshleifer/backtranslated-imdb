Expedition led by hunky Captain Storm (Mark Dana) travels to the Valley of the Kings in Cairo to find out what happened to the previous expedition. They meet a beautiful mysterious Simira (Ziva Rodann) who joins them. Soon they're dealing with a mummy who drinks blood ... and only Simira seems to know what's going on. <br /> <br /> A real nap. I caught it on TV late at night when I was about 10 years old. Seeing this again all these years, I can see why. It is slow, the mummy does not even appear for 40 minutes (and it's only 66 minutes!), Acting ranges from evil (Dana) to REAL evil (George N. Neise) and there is no violence or blood to find. This film focuses more on secondary drama (involving a stupid love triangle) than on horror. <br /> <br /> This is rated three stars because it actually looks pretty good, everyone is playing straight, there's some good game from Diane Brewster, it's short, and the mummy attack scenes (all three) are not bad. They are not scary, only slightly frightening. Even so, this movie is very bad. Some remedy for insomnia.
