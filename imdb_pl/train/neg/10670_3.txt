Flat characters that you do not care about and never care about. Discussion dialogue in places. No twists (think they have, but if you have not understood it after about 40 minutes, you are not very clear). Many well-known actors in roles and performances, which fortunately for everyone involved, will be forgotten as soon as the ending is over. <br /> <br /> I do not mind "slow" movies, but they have to go somewhere. This is not. <br /> <br /> The plot was not what made it a movie directly on DVD, it was just a convenient excuse to try to conquer false controversy. <br /> <br /> Writing 37 (!) ten (10) ratings must come from people involved in production.
