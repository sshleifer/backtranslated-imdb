I think the time has come for Seagal to enter the night quietly. What I just saw makes all of its direct video releases in the last few years look compared to its early hits from the 90s. <br /> <br /> The secret biological laboratory produces a new type of drug, the adrenaline system of man to the point of becoming psychopathic killers or something like that. Somehow, Seagal is going to stop the infection or its end ... or something. Seagal also went through the strike like jellybeans, every time I looked up, he commanded a new face, so it was difficult to follow the development of the character, I also know that Steven's athlete does not allow him to scream at his throat, but even why people constantly dub him who do not sound like him? Usually the plot of the movie and action sequences can save him from the total loss of time, but he was not even close. As I said, it was a horror with a lot of blood and stilted shins rather than a simple fight. The problem was that it was not really scary, and Seagal looked completely out of place because the infected people were supposed to have the speed of light, and 40-year-old Seagal killed them all individually? I think the only climax of the movie was the first 20 minutes in which new recruits ask Seagal to come to the strip club. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
