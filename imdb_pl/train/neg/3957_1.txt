The original Boogeyman was a stupid but funny, supernatural wave of his hand. It was not a great movie, but fun in the right mood. The third part of this series, Return of the Boogeyman, on the other hand, is simply awful. It consists of two things. First, cheap and dead new footage. Second, LOADS recycled bits from the first movie. The new material is incredibly amateur, but not in a fun, inept way, just incredibly tedious. This footage was clearly discarded quickly and effortlessly. It serves as a device for framing endless clips from the first (and probably second) movies. And boy, do these clips from previous movies; Sometimes I use sequences again. The only new addition to these parts is the voice, which pointlessly describes exactly what we can see with our own eyes. The whole experience of watching this is really intoxicating. <br /> <br /> Boogeyman's return is an example of the worst type of liberation; a kind that uses the audience in a highly cynical manner. I want this review to be short and to the point, because this movie does not deserve more. There is nothing valuable here. It is worthless.
