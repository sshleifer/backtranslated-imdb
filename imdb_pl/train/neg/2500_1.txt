Van Dien must be ashamed to remember this absurdly poor film, just like any individual involved. Honestly, I'm ashamed to admit that I watched him from beginning to end. The production values ​​are somewhere between the original series "Crossroads" and "Block cell H cells". Most five-year-olds would be able to come up with a more realistic dialogue and a more credible plot. When it comes to acting performances, if you can imagine the most junk porn you've ever seen - one of those where the action is filled with an endless "story" to explain how the sulky-looking old cauldron with the peroxide blonde begins to spit - baked by a few guys with a mustache - you'll have an idea about the standard of the game in "Maiden Voyage". What's worse, you can not even scroll sex scenes because they are not there. A terrifyingly horrible movie.
