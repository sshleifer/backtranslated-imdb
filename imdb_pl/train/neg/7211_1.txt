I grew up watching the Inspector gadget. She was and is one of my favorite cartoons, if not my absolute favorite. I have learned many geography and stories from the Gadget Inspector's "Trip Trip". I wanted to slip into a banana peel and become the greatest detective in history. <br /> <br /> But the movie has ruined the reputation of a great cartoon. <br /> <br /> Matthew Broderick, an actor with potential, was definitely not the role of the Inspector Gadget. First of all, the Inspector Gadget movie is intelligent. Not so in the cartoon. In the film, Gadget solves the puzzle mainly independently. In the cartoon she was almost always Penny, Brain and an amazing book (I still want her book!). If the gadget solved the puzzle, then by accident. The gadget in the film seems to be a competent detective, but in the cartoon he was quite stupid, where humor comes from. <br /> <br /> Another thing is that it is too much "Good Guy v. Bad Guy" in the movie. This is not just a silly Saturday cartoon. In addition, the gadget should never have a love story, but Disney Corporation is full of idiots. <br /> <br /> I miss the real gadgets that the gadget had, and especially for the car with gadgets. In the film it was an elegant convertible. In the cartoon, it was a police sedan and it could turn into a van. He also did not have any gadgets and was there mainly to take him from place to place. <br /> <br /> But if at all, the only thing that was awful in the movie was a feature film. Inspector's Gadget was a stupid cartoon on a Saturday morning. The film was too serious, too exaggerated, it had too much plot and it was not even so much fun. <br /> <br /> A tip for those who have not seen it: NEVER see it. ALWAYS. Watch the cartoon, it's a real classic.
