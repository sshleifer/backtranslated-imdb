I can not believe the positive reviews of this movie - I thought it was one of the worst, worst performed and badly made films I've ever seen. And the plot was completely ridiculous (sp?). He starts to talk to him when he is tied to a chair? puh-lease. The worst part was that it was not even bad in a good, fun way. Just horrible - I could not understand why they even bother to show it on HBO. I thought Belushi was ridiculously stupid - very unbelievable like an "eccentric" hitman. idk, I could continue - I am shocked again by positive reviews. The only thing that watched me is that it's fascinating to see how a movie can go wrong and what makes it bad. And the ending also did not disappoint your stupidity! "Live with the sword, die from the sword ..." Funny.
