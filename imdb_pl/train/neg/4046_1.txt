What an insult to the film industry SA! I've seen better SA films. The comments I've read about Hijack Stories, saying it's worth ten to ten, are pretty scary. The film's assessment should not depend on ... "OH, THE FILM FROM THE DEVELOPMENT COUNTRY, ALLOWS ITS INDUSTRY, SPEAKING NICE THINGS ABOUT ITS WORK, EVEN THOUGHT We have experience in creating good films. Do not judge the film industry based on what people they say how great they think Hijack Stories is. We can tell great stories like Cry's beloved country and Shaka Zulu. Cry the beloved country of Dam 9 out of 10. Great director, Darryl, working great with two great elderly actors, no matter what where they are ... Hijack Stories .. I will give 1 out of 10. This can only be people involved in the project who will give it high results. I would do the same if it was my film.
