You have to watch this program once to see them all, the formula is exactly the same in each episode. Jim does something his own, it means good, but he annoys his wife, finally he learns that what he did was really for her, he caresses his cheek and gives a rubbery smile when he looks at him shyly. In fact, the storylines are so bad and formulated that I will press them now. <br /> <br /> Episode "Valentines Pay" <br /> <br /> Jims's wife notices that all Jims pay off each week and then explain to her that he lost him in the casino. He screams and leaves the house, lamenting how horrible he is. Then, on Valentines Day, he appears in a limousine with Bal tickets (hence explains the missing earnings). She is aware of her "mistake" and the usual "Oh Jim, you are so beautiful." .. Koniec <br /> <br /> Another very obvious thing is the fact that the character Jims is based on Homer Simpson, who as a cartoon character can escape from being warlike and unconscious, when it is attempted with people, it does not it works, and Jim just appears as an arrogant, selfish moron. <br /> <br /> IMO The only reason we succeed is that we are so numerous in terms of people with televisions that nowadays you can make a show about a man who insulates walls and you get the audience . <br /> <br /> "Two and a half men" is fantastic and fun.
