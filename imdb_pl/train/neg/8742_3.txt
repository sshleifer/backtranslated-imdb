After watching the trailer of this film in the cinema, I thought it was the original concept of the thriller, setting it in the competitive world of computer companies. The entire cast star was another message that this movie will probably be good. But when I did not watch it in the first week of the premiere, it disappeared in the second week and I was afraid that something was missing. I was waiting patiently for his DVD release, and then I bought him by rushing home for a pleasant evening. Waiting on the way home was much better than in the movie. At the beginning, the direction is terrifying. There is no thought in it, and the director just makes himself a part, so he can appear in the movie. I would not be hurrying to hire him in the future. Secondly, the main role is completely wrong, because Ryan Phillipe. Phillipe is usually a nice character, like in Cruel Intentions and Way of the Gun, but in this he has to be a clumsy hero who tries to present, slipping when he runs and has cool friends, but it just does not look good. The female stars Rachel Leigh Cook and Clare Forlani do not have enough features, but when they do not play, none of the performances are close to their best. The only climax of the movie is Tim Robbins in the role that you could do for him, and his fiery temperament and mysterious ways drag the film. The last point is that this movie is another movie that fills the trailer with scenes that are not seen in the movie, and instead appears only in the section of deleted DVD scenes. Making even greater disappointment, although some of these scenes are primitive, fill important gaps in history.
