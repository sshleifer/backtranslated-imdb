I should precede it by saying that I am a fan of Dolph Lundgren. The man turns out to be one of the funniest cliches of action imaginable, and Detention is probably my favorite. * Spoiler *, although there is no such thing as Dolph spoiler, because the scripts are so absurd at the beginning: a chase scene with a disabled child carrying a pistol compared to a Harley guy with a submachine gun, through a high school corridor and the child wins? Good game, Oscar goes into custody. Dolph, if you read this, thank you for laughing, old friend. <br /> <br /> In summary: A great movie that is guaranteed to laugh. I recommend that you invite a few friends and make them sit down. Cheerful.
