The plot is not so original. If someone saw "L'ultimo Bacio", there is nothing new. The rich family in Rome, which lives every day, is boring and false, and everyone asks others what they think about them. Really boring after half an hour, because it's easy to understand where the story will end. That's because it's easy to see the moralistic view of Muccino in this movie, so even the hardest parts seem normal. In summary, in the first 2 minutes of the movie, it would be enough, and the purpose of the film has already been said. The family has seen for 30 years, I do not like watching a movie that wants to show reality, but consistent with his thoughts must push more than normal situations. It's really good that Muccino put the camera in the right place, moving with carathers, and that's the only reason why I can not sleep in the cinema, although always at the beginning of the movie. Perhaps it would be good to see the family as they are in reality and not blame something of it. Morante was intense and great as usual, but unfortunately in a bad movie!
