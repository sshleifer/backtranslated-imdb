START SPOILER: Amazingly funny and unforgettable for the literary scene of Mr. Chung's tobacco smoking: Chong coolly rinses the stray kitchen cockroach into the bowl of his pipe, brightens up, coughs and fights violently for an apparent eternity, then with perfect control and without passing rhythm, properly loads the bowl , turns on the light again, changes the chips. FINAL SPOILER. Unfortunately, I began to lose faith less than halfway through the proceedings. It occurred to me that the messy duo is ugly and incomparable. I appreciate the relative sophistication of modern masons, Harold and Kumar. I just prefer a brighter company. However, the film is probably ideally suited to brothers who are brothers or brothers, who are so weak mentally that they pass through the stoner when ... the former are sober. Excellent performance by Paul Reubens, causing profanity in a pre-pee-wee form.
