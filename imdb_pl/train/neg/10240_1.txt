I love all kinds of movies, especially horror movies. With this in mind, Survival does not meet ANY noise around it. <br /> <br /> I can not give any points for originality. There is nothing wrong with discovering the same topics or altering what others have done. He just became a policeman in independent films to take us on a more modest journey through the forest, a crazed killer, and recently to throw in some crazy family. On these lines I have to compare it with such as Texas Chainsaw, Wrong Turn (though this phrase is obvious) and others. Survival becomes short compared to comparable films. The plot was not original in any way. In some movies you can hear a weak storyline with great acting, a special fx or a lot of other factors. Survivial has no influence on this. If so, pay attention to the following: Acting in the film never took off. I do not knock or blame the actors or the director for it. The dialogue was mediocre at best, and the actors involved never showed (without saying he had) the talent to distract him. I mention two exceptions. The main character of this movie certainly has a look, but seriously I think that he must consider more training before he is ready to wear the movie. The actor who played Greg also had potential, but we've never seen one of them (watch the movie to see why, you will not believe ...). <br /> <br /> The appearance of a grainy movie. Ah yes, this bit of film-making magic took us back to the glory days of the Grindhouse movies. In today's making movies, it has become a trick. Either it works or it does not. In this case it just does not work. Too many other errors are happening, so it distracts from the movie without adding it. Having said that, I think they did a good job adding this seed. This is a good grain of good quality. I think that with another scenario, a better direction and probably actors, they should try another "Grindhouse" attempt. They'll probably pull it away. <br /> <br /> Regarding the technical aspects, in my opinion, they have never been too much gelled for me. Better care could be obtained with the help of sound (it sounded as if it was fed directly to the camera, but there is nothing wrong with it), and the recording on the DV was too soft for my taste. <br /> <br /> That's all I have to say about this .....
