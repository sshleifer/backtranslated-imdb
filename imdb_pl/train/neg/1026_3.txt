Wow. I do not think I've ever seen a movie with so many great actors who had such a key role, so wrong. Justin Timberlake is probably the worst actor who played a big role in the movie with stellar power and money for what Edison had. <br /> <br /> His acting was WRONG to watch. The story was fine and all other characters were played by professional actors, for hell, even LL Cool J was okay, because he had many small parts to cut his teeth. As the director and film company came to the conclusion that Timberlake was ready for this role, it is impossible to understand. <br /> <br /> His character destroys the whole experience, because every time he is on the screen, you actually cheer the corrupt cops to satisfy his pitiful ass, and he's supposed to be a hero ... I would not waste my money on theater or on video. CAN BE, if you have HBO and you have nothing else to do at 2 a.m. on a Saturday night and you are drunk and stoned, it can be OK. <br /> <br /> Watching Timberlake in this role was like watching a man, Frog 'works in Hollywood Blockbuster, it just does not work at all.
