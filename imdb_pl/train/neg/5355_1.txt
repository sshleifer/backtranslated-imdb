Now I do not hate cheap movies. I just do not see the reason why you should waste money on a movie that you can shoot with your dad's camera. If I rent a movie, I want it to be a FILM, not a group of people thinking that it would be a good idea to waste some of the MiniDV tapes. <br /> <br /> Maybe I hate it so much because the guy in the video store said it was great and it was not. Maybe I hate it because it is cheap, it has the stupidest story EVER, the most unrealistic characters EVER and really, really, THE MOST LATEST EXHIBITIONS in the history of films. Even Tom Savini can not save it. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this is a complete waste of time.
