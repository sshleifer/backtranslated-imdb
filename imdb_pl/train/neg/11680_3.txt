This movie had such a big potential - a strong cast, quite a strong idea and a clearly decent budget. I do not know where everything went wrong, but each of these elements was wasted. History did not go anywhere, the characters were at least empty, and the result was very boring, senseless, the movie was wasted. I hated it. Judging by other voices, I'm here in a minority and I have to be a weirdo. But I thought that this movie is terrible. I had high hopes, but I was very disappointed. A particular disappointment was the character Jody Foster. Extremely confident "fixer" is a cool idea. Jody was confident and sexy, but the character did nothing and did not go anywhere. Denzel Washington played the same character that he always plays - nice, but nothing new.
