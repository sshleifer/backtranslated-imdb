You know, I went to see "The Hills have eyes 2" who want to like it. I loved the original, and the remake was quite funny. Apparently, they had more money to drop than Wes Craven on special effects the second time. Although I still prefer the original movie, the remake was made well and it was a kind of guilt for me. Bloody, intense and great special effects. In short, a great popcorn movie for any fan of horror movies. <br /> <br /> Which leads us to "The Hills have eyes 2". Man, where should I start? The story, or its lack, is paper thin. We do not have a whole new ground here. The military decided to monitor this area, and all these people were missing. What we gonna do now? Let's send the National Guard to investigate. In a real Hollywood style, we have to make them the stupidest and worst soldiers they've ever seen. Oh dear, I've never seen this assumption before. In short, mutants kill moron soldiers individually in a graphic manner. Once again, Nicotero's special effects are great, but killing no matter how boring and predictable the graphics become. Honestly, it seemed to me that this move was made just to get a fast zloty. It was bloody and graphic, but I thought it was predictable, boring and not terrifying at all. It would be nice for me if this movie had one original thought.
