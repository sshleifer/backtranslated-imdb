If you want to watch a good movie about how women can fight sexual assault, this movie is not the movie you want to watch. It was a social comment about a woman who was persecuted and fights against her. Spoiler: Rosario Dawson changes tables to his attacker. Instead of using the criminal justice system, the victim uses vigilance. In essence, it invalidates the judicial system. The "Accused" film was a much better film because the victim uses the court system and wins. What does "Descent" do, telling the victims of assault that they should resort to violence? Is the victim better than the prosecutor? No!!!
