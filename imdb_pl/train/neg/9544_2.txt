I did not like this movie. I thought acting was not very good and the story was boring. A 20-year-old computer that saves you days? I thought it was just a bit stretched, even for the movie. I could not understand why they could not just turn it off, why not take the hammer. <br /> <br /> It's a pity, but after the original movie from the 80s, you expected something more than what was actually delivered. This movie could be a version of an old movie of the 21st century, it was not. If you want to watch it, do not watch this movie! <br /> <br /> Even if the old computer did not show up to save the day, it would still be very bad traffic in my opinion.
