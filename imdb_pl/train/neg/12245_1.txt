Why, why! ... I chose it? Well ... I needed flawless thinking in the summer heat, and the cover looked great. <br /> <br /> Of course I should have known better. It's a really bad movie. And it gets embarrassing when the creators know it is wrong, and try to hide it, adding to it sexy / beautiful women and a few sex scenes. Well, people ... it's not over, right! <br /> <br /> If you wanted a nice movie about a big reptile, which is really very, very good, well played and funny: go and hire Lake Placid! (this is an order)
