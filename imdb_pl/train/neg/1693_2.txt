My husband and I went to see this movie, being lovers of the horrors we are. Two hours later, I discovered that I want both my money and time. I was very disappointed. Teasers for this movie basically included the best points of the movie. There was nothing terrible in the film except good times at unexpected entrances, etc. Most of the "terrifying" parts I thought were more comical than anything else. After watching other films based on the works of Japanese writers, I must say that what is considered terrifying in Japan is not terrifying in the US. My advice: if you're a fan of real horror movies, save yourself the pain of sitting. I can not really say I would recommend it, unless you have a free rental.
