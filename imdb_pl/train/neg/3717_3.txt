Chris Rock, apparently desperate to create a cozy vehicle-star that would appeal to his black and mainstream black audience, updates the hit comedy of 1978, "Heaven can wait" with the urban agenda. A game struggling with a comedian who was involved in a car accident, and his soul was removed too early from his body - therefore his angels have to find a different body to put it in, and they can only come up with a white businessman. Rewriting the film as nondescript and sentimental as "Heaven Can Wait" only shows that Rock's eye was at the box office (it was a strictly corporate move organized by the most hilarious Hollywood player). Why not pursue something higher or more memorable than a stupid reincarnation comedy that culminates in the Apollo Evening? The magnificent cast (including the usually reliable Regina King, the wonderful Mark Addy, Wanda Sykes, Eugene Levy and the wonderful Frankie Faison) do what they can, but Rock seems awkward and uncertain. * 1/2 of ****
