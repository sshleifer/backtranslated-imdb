This movie was made with a view to television, so with that in mind, I do not intend to grab it as much as a feature film. The script is sub-par, but it is successfully mild in places, whether it means to be or not. Acting is usually the best, but it applies to many films with a lower budget. <br /> <br /> The aspect of this movie that I really hated was that 90-95% of it is filmed, but in random places it will be 5-10 seconds in which video footage is recorded. It can be concluded that the contrast is smaller, the colors are less vivid and the film material has clearly 30 frames per second instead of 24 frames per second. I'm not sure if these scenes had to be made later and then they did not have the money to make the film (I assume it is), but it's confusing and really makes the movie look cheesy than it must have looked. <br /> <br /> In any case, I definitely saw worse movies, but I would definitely not say that I liked this movie and I can not recommend that anyone see it.
