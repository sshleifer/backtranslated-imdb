As a young black / latina I am always looking for films representing the experiences and lives of people like me. Of course, when I saw this video in the video store, I thought I would like it; Unfortunately not. Although the topics presented in the film are interesting and relevant, the story simply has not been properly elaborated. The film continues to drag on, and many characters appearing on the screen simply come and go without much contribution to the whole movie. If the director did a better job combining the scenes, maybe I would enjoy it all the more. Honestly, I would recommend a movie such as "Raising Victor" on this movie every day. I just was not impressed.
