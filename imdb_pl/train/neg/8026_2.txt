You wonder how this program is still in the air. There was one couple who stayed together, got married and have children, but everyone broke up. What is the point of continuing this? The show can be fun at the beginning. You see all the girls swooning over one man who almost everyone likes immediately. It's like in real life! The girls start to worry, they break away and show their true self (or so we think). But this one man has to decide whom to choose, that he thinks he can get married and live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> What is true love? How can you fall in love when you are forced to choose them? This performance is unbelievable. You thought that online dating is bad, but people have to go to television to find love? This is not realistic. How could a girl be with a man when he went out with a few others, doing with them? None of these questions are given, and finally, when the show ends, you know that in the future there will be no happy ending. We know everything is scripted.
