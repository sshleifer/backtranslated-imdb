There is no reason why I could understand why this movie was ever made. <br /> <br /> Why should Hollywood still spend one awful update of the classics after another? (Examples: Mister Magoo, The Avengers - horrible!) <br /> <br /> Christopher Lloyd, whom I normally like, was so unsuccessful in this role. His manic representation of our beloved "Uncle Martin" is so unimaginably unpleasant that it is almost criminal. His ranting, moaning, grimace and histrionics give us no reason to care for his character, except for the one-dimensional cartoon character. <br /> <br /> The director had to think that quick moves, screaming dialogue and "one-off" Slapstick had some resemblance to comedy. Apparently, he told EVERYTHING to act as if they had red ants in their trousers. <br /> <br /> The defect must lie in an irresponsible typeface. I think the writer used "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" as an example of a good comedy scenario. As manic as the classic from 1963, it is much better than this classic slap - in fact - it looks quite good in comparison. <br /> <br /> The most sad thing is this movie, which apparently has been written to appeal to young children. I'm just not sure who the children were made of. I certainly do not know the self-respecting, child-bearing card! <br /> <br /> If they were to make "My Favorite Martian", why did not they add some timeless charm to the original classic? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, IMDB.com can not consider "zero" as a rating for its readers, it is the only assessment that comes to mind when describing this travesty. <br /> <br /> One good thing came from this movie, the actors and the crew were paid - I think.
