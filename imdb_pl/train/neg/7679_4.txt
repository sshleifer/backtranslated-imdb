Snow White, who just arrived in Locarno, where I had the opportunity to see her, of course refers to the world-famous fairy tale. This also applies to coke. In the end, the real snow of the Swiss Alps also plays its part. <br /> <br /> In this video, all three aspects of the title are touched. There is a lot of drugs on the stage, and a pale, dark-haired girl - with a prince who has to go through all sorts of trouble to come to her rescue. <br /> <br /> But: this is not a fairy tale. This is to be a realistic drama from Zurich (according to Tagline). <br /> <br /> Technically the film is close to perfect. Unfortunately, the weak plot, predictable dialogues, mostly unreal scenery and mixed acting do not add up to create authenticity. So as a viewer I remained intact. <br /> <br /> And then there were the stereotypes that made me mad one by one: Snow White is a rich and spoiled daughter from a higher class - of course her parents are divorced and she never got enough love from them because they were busy all the time. On the other hand, her best girlfriend has loving and caring parents. They (a steelworker and housewife) live in a small apartment, poor and happy - and unaware of the desperate situation their daughter is in. A good guy (= prince) is a musician (!) From the French-speaking part of Switzerland (which is considered to be less economically effective, but a more emotional part of the country). He has problems with his parents. They are migrants from Spain who do not accept his wild way of life - until the father becomes seriously ill and does not confess his great admiration for his son from the hospital bed. <br /> <br /> And this is how it goes: Naturally, the dealer is brutal, the bankers are heartless, the club owner is a playboy, and the photographer, although a woman (!), means only a career when he puts Snow White in artistic pornographic photos on the exhibition. <br /> <br /> This review does not require a spoiler to allow these elements to be added to the obvious storyline. Like other Samir films, such as "Forget Baghdad", I was very disappointed. Let's hope for the next one.
