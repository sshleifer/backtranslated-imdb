Visually speaking, this movie is stunning. He has some charming comedic moments. But in general, the plot is very stereotypical, as is its apparent message. If you're a fan of excessive violence in mainstream movies, such as a hostel or saw, you'll love it. If you're looking for something at the forefront, turn around. I saw it as part of the Edinburgh Film Festival 06 and I chose it just because I was looking for something disturbing. Ultimately, it does not bother you. Just grinding and unpleasant sitting. If you really want to be challenged, go see something like The Lost. If you want to be exhausted or tell your friends about a really tangled movie, this is for you.
