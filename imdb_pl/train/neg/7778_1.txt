It must be the harshest, stupidest and most delayed monster movie of all time. It's a complete joke that even appeared in theaters. It's a bit like watching the Loch Ness monster in rural America. This film deserves to be thrown into the toilet and completely forgotten. John Carradine, a shame for you. People involved in this moronic pile of garbage must be lobotomized. Wait! Maybe I give them too much credit. I am sure that they were subjected to lobotomization before filming. How else can you explain the total and pure stupidity that this bucket of nonsense contains. Do not waste time watching this. Do not waste even time sending reviews.
