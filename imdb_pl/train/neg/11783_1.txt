What a crappy movie! The worst of the worst! This movie is as funny as a dead snail. Actors without talent, whoever they are, stupid plot. Who wrote this script?! Was there ever a script for this foolish movie, did the director accidentally press the record button on his camera, and then decided to make a movie while they were moving on? Is this to be a movie for children, a comedy or something? My friends, my younger brother is in 6th grade, and he and his colleagues just made an amateur movie for a school project that surpassed this scientific film. There is no justification for this movement!
