I bought this DVD for $ 1 at Walmart. After watching it, I can just go back to the store and try to get my money back! The only reason I gave movie 2, not 1, is that the story has a few innovative features, although it never really gets to the level of interest. This film has all the advantages of being created for the cinema market - very low budget, amateur acting and a liberal dose of sex (for a movie from the early 1960s). In fact, I wonder if the only reason the film was made was to make a quick buck AND because someone knew some stripteids they could use as extras. The film tells the story of a physician who wants to transplant the severed head of his girlfriend into the body of an unsuspecting donor. Most of the potential donors are skeptics of a stripper or model - whose only real goal in the movie is excitement when they remove most of their clothes. However, they are trying too hard to make the movie even worth watching for naughty songs, and the movie is not terrible enough to deserve to be watched by bad movie fans.
