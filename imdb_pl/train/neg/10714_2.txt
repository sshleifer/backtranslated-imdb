For the two funniest comedians, the movie was terrible. Fast forward and never better! Waste of time and waste of money! Tina Fey is such a great writer, I thought she would be great in comedy. The previews were great, but they showed only the best parts of the movie. My husband even thought that the chick was sucking. What's happening with it? The film was very slow and boring. At the moment I do not recommend it to anyone. I would like to get back the money for this! BOO from us here in Arizona. Thanks but no. Who does such stupid things that people think you are pregnant. I thought it would be so funny, I had my own children and I helped others to have children. It could have been more in line with reality.
