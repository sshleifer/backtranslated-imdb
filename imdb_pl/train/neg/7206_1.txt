Well. Where to start. Let's just say it; avoid this movie at all costs <br /> <br />. It is based on a cartoon series. The movie makes the cartoon look like <br /> <br /> like Hamlet. Filled with distorted actors who seem embarrassed to be <br /> <br /> here, poor camera work, horrible music and enough space for a product <br /> <br /> make you never want to visit Yahoo! again, this movie is really the bottom of the barrel. Quoting New Yorker, Matthew Brodericka and <br /> <br /> Rupert Everett are breaking through this photo with gay abandonment <br /> <br /> men who have noticed a rare payment in the distance. "<br /> <br /> They should pay us a few million earned for viewing. <br /> <br /> Awful.
