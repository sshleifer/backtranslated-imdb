This movie was different because it did not show the typical gay stereotypes I was used to. But that does not change the fact that he completely lacks the plot. I'm sure there are a lot of homosexuals who just enjoy seeing themselves on the screen because black gay characters are rare, and when they're heroes, they're usually not fully developed. But how difficult it would be for the writer to write a story with the beginning, the middle and the end. Or maybe a story that was focused. In this film, it really does not make sense, and although it is a low-budget movie, there is still no justification for the lack of a story or story.
