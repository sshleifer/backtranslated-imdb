First of all, animals have emotions. If you do not know it yet, I believe you are a moron. But let us assume that none of us is a moron. We all know that animals have emotions, and now we want to see how these emotions manifest in nature, correct? <br /> <br /> Instead, we get a boring and absurdly simplified document that tries to show how "human" animals are. The creators of the film are looking for high and low amount of photos of animals that behave like humans, and when this happens, they say: "This monkey is almost human!". (it's actually a direct quote). <br /> <br /> Everything is in human terms. They are wasting time on theorizing what makes dogs smile, but they never mention what a waving tail means. The arrogance of these researchers is disgusting. They even go to show chimpanzees dressed in human clothing and wearing a cowboy hat. <br /> <br /> I was expecting an insightful documentary about animals on my own terms. I wanted to learn how animals emulate in their OWN languages. Instead, scientists are still returning to observations and pedantic, anthropomorphic assumptions. Add a cheezy soundtrack and images of chimpanzees "celebrating Christmas," and that was enough to turn my stomach away. <br /> <br /> But it does not end. Half of this film is documented not at large, but in laboratories and experimental facilities. All chimpanzee shots are made by steel rods and we see how these monkeys are crowded in sterile concrete cages. One particularly sobering moment happens near the beginning (though you must notice it quickly) when he says a trapped monkey in sign language, "You want to get away. Hurry up. "<br /> <br /> The unclear references relate to" stress tests "and psychological experiments that I shudder at the thought. Babies are separated from their mothers at birth and receive skeletal dolls to prove that the little monkeys want to "figure their mother". And after 40 years of experiments, satisfied researchers pat their backs, reaching their brilliant conclusion: monkeys have emotions. <br /> <br /> One chimpanzee named "Washoe" is for this purpose in a concrete cage since 1966 and remains so today. We get a short look (again through the bars), leaning against a concrete wall with a rather colorless expression on the face. Personally, I do not have to see any further experimental data. Washoe, sorry for all our species.
