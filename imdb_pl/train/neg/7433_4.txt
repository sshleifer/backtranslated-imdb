I have to be completely honest, saying that I have fallen asleep somewhere in the middle, so I can not express a full opinion of the film until I see it in its entirety. Essentially, a group of thieves, including Sid Carter (Sid James) and Ernie Bragg (Bernard Bresslaw), are planning to make a fortune by stealing a contraceptive pill delivery from the Finisham maternity hospital. It is here that the title Matron (Hattie Jacques) works with staff members Sir Bernard Cut (Kenneth Williams), Dr. Francis Goode (Charles Hawtrey), Dr. Patients and their guests are also nearby, including pregnant Mrs. Tidey (Joan Sims) and her nervous father, who is husband of Mr. Tidey (Kenneth Connor). They also performed Bill Maynard as Freddy and EastEnders' Wendy Richard as Miss Willing. By the way, this plan does not work because all employees interfere. Almost everyone can say about the movie until I see it again in full. Fine!
