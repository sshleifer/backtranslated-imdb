Make your own mind. Personally, I think that playing with the backbone of Stevie Wonder is equally enjoyable. No offense to Mr. Wonder. Maybe it's a comedy, but it was stupid. Not exactly the first two options of looking after children; Wheeler (Seann William Scott) and Danny (Paul Rudd), two sellers of energy drinks, in order to avoid imprisonment, are required to order two children to take care of children from the development center run by Gayle Sweeny (Jane Lynch). One of the misfit is Ronnie (Bobb'e J. Thompson), a disgusting fifth grader, and the other is Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), an embarrassing young man who plays in the medieval fantasy world. Wheeler and Danny are desperately trying to give their wards an invaluable view of life, love and heavy metal. Lynch is hilarious with his dry jokes. The support is: Elizabeth Banks, Ken Jeongg, Kerri Kenney-Silver, Amanda Righetti and David Wain.
