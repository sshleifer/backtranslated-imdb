I read here posts about the Wonder Woman costume for this TV movie. It should be emphasized that during the creation of the film, she did not wear traditional attire. Manufacturers properly adhered to the WW concept from the comic in the early seventies. <br /> <br /> As for the movie itself, I have to agree with many other posters here. Nap! I was a kid when he appeared at ABC in 1974, so I was of the right age to appreciate the movie about the hero of the comic. And yet I was so absorbed in the plot that I stopped watching her in three-quarters of the movie. <br /> <br /> Of course I was not the right age to appreciate Cathy Lee! :-)
