I mean, really ... or I suddenly lost my sense of humor, or it's a really bad movie. It's stupid, funny and just not fun. <br /> <br /> Since I saw the preview, I knew it would not be a great movie, I just did not think it would be so bad. .. <br /> <br /> What happened to the good old days, when you could find clever funny lines in every movie? When did the actors not have to play funny roles, trying to be funny? Now we are in such films as Borat, Little Men, Scary Movie 4, where I could not find funny parts !! <br /> <br /> Just skip this piece of garbage <br /> <br /> PS (sorry for my English)
