Stiled, stagy, strange and opaque, if visually striking ... fantasy-would-be-erotic. Really boring, too much male nudity (including the incest of father and son) and just a kind of shameless senselessness. I admit, however, that some fragments of the dialogue, undertaken on their own terms, have a calming, haunting quality.
