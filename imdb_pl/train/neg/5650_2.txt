William Shatner is tolerated in small doses. Unfortunately, instead of leaving his character as a slight irritation, and in this moderately funny, it was considered appropriate to expand his role and overdo it. Just like the original Star Trek series. I do not think I will ever understand American humor, which often "overreacts" to convey a message. I vote with my legs. I do not watch the show anymore, which is a shame because the rest of the cast was good. It is a pity, however, that Shatner's exaggerated role also influences the performance of James Spader. But the majority demonstrate how the society works. I do not travel the same routes. Honest
