SOME SPEASE SPOILERS WILL RECRUIT <br /> <br /> Why do people, when confused, sick or scared in the club, cross the center of the crowded dance floor on the way to the bathroom? <br /> <br /> Who would be right, hiding under the bed when someone breaks into their room? <br /> <br /> How often do you knock on the door of a stranger, and when IMMEDIATELY do not respond, open the door, go in, shout a few hi, and then start to look at their stuff? <br /> <br /> If you were chased by someone you just discovered, he was a murderer, what would you do? Quiet sneak out and hide under a wooden platform or among metal tools? Run, of course, quietly to an old barn or other rotten structure? <br /> <br /> I could talk about almost every thriller that appeared in the last few years, but because it's the page "The Return", of course I'm talking about "The Return". I saw it for free, because I work in the cinema and try to display all the "scary" movies. I thought that it was bearable ... except for worn-out clichÃ©s. Sarah Michelle Gellar is really gray and looks like "Huh?" For most of the movie. The details of the story slowly diverge as the film progresses and it is almost enough to make it interesting, except that there were not enough explanations when it moved, so I was almost lost until the last 2/3 of it. > <br /> If you're a die-hard fan of thrillers, it's worth checking at least once. If there's nothing better in the theater and you really want to watch a movie, um, it's probably worth buying a ticket. If you thought that the trailer made it look like an interesting movie and you can not wait ... wait.
