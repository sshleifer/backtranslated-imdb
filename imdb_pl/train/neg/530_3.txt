I saw it alternately two days before the official opening and I have to say that I was very disappointed. And I have to put most of these problems on the decision to cast Claire Danes in the lead role. Depending on what you think of the Danes, she was either terribly ill or so far behind that she should be Razzie's first favorite for the worst actress in 2007. I think we were to sympathize with her. Instead, it's completely unlike yourself. Other "great" actresses do a good job, but they certainly do not brighten up the screen. Of all the "great" actresses in this film, I would say that the best job was Natasha Richardson. Streep is barely visible in the picture and appears only at the very end. <br /> <br /> A horrible scenario. It comes out more as a reading line than truly "in character".
