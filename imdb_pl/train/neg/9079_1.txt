What are people talking about? I had to see a different movie than you. I was so bored that I left the theater. What is with these things? I only laughed once and not even hard. He who is green, this film should be taken to the street and beaten. Usually I always find something that I like about the movie, but it's crazy. "Slackers" makes "Not Another Teen Movie" look like a classic. He's in such positions as "Body Shots", "Con Air" and "Conspiracy Theory" as one of the worst of all time. AVOID ALL COSTS! I thought the studio would give away money to people who left the theater to apologize, but to my horror that it did not happen. It looks like I will never see this money or two hours again.
