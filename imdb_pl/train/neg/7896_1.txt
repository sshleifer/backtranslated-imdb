I'm not sure why this movie seems to have such enthusiastic reviews. <br /> <br /> Watching "Bang" one night on TV, I found myself bored with a senseless, random plot that took place on the screen. The whole film seems to be nothing more than an exercise in senseless, artistically-hearted indulgence on the part of the director. The fact that the director / writer goes under an unambiguous name only strengthens this sense of pretentiousness. <br /> <br /> Those interested in independent films will be better off looking for something better written and I dare say more fun than this total waste of time.
