The last reviewer was very generous. Quiet like the first movie, but I can not say that I like it very much. The beginning is passable, but falls quickly. I just do not see Jon Bon Jovi as the "vampire's evil ass", and the vampire princess is neither sexy nor scary. Many scenes simply do not make sense. I mean, every normal person suspects something is happening when a strange woman suddenly appears out of the blue to seduce you, let alone an experienced hunter. Why is Una able to communicate with Jovi? In this movie, nothing has ever been explained, you would not mind if it was fun, but it was too much to ask. It must be one of the worst vampire movies I've ever seen.
