It was not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's as much as you can say about it. It starts with a good atmosphere; the hospital is adequately sterile and alienating, the mood is "amazing". And then ... nothing. Well, something. It's just something that clearly does not match ... and no effort is made to explain the relationship between the bizarre, but not particularly intimidating beings, and the hospital they've taken over. I mean, give it a rest, dude motorcyclists? A team was watching a little too much. <br /> <br /> My favorite was the main demon, who looks more like a middle-aged truck driver, desperately trying to threaten, and at the same time looking as if he really wanted to. Drop on an Afghan sofa lying on the couch, unbutton your belt, throw a can of cheap beer (probably Schlitz) and watch the game. Honestly, I've seen far more frightening truck drivers. At stops. Drinking coffe. WWWwoooooohHHHHHoooooooo !!!! Horrible !! <br /> <br /> The other monsters are even more cartoonish and even less frightening. At least the DVDs show an explanation of their presence in the hospital ... apparently they just pop in randomly in different places, play bippy "metal" and cause people to be a bit worried. Apart from a few good special effects and acting, which is not completely frightening, considering the lack of decent writing, nothing is here. It's just a movie with background noise.
