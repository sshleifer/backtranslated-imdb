Why every horror director wants to imitate the "Exorcist" is a complete mystery to me, because William Friedkin's "classic" is a very overrated movie and in my opinion not so much tense or shocking. And here is another clean rip-off, this time Spanish, which shamelessly repeats the story of a young girl who is possessed by pure evil and turns against her own family. Paul Naschy (who I must admit he looks quite hot here) is the game of an honorary priest, to whom John Gibson addresses, because the behavior of his sister Leila has changed drastically since she met her new boyfriend. Initially, the priest does not believe it, but when John's body is discovered with a crooked neck, Leila's demonic behavior becomes more noticeable ... "Exorcism" is not only very unoriginal, but also unbearably boring! Here, Naschy and director Juan Bosch had an open opportunity to make a religious motive for the release of full upheavals and gore, but the result is a tamed and general bloodless drama that will almost bring you to sleep! The last twenty minutes contain a few romantic moments, although very stupid, and there are a lot of stylishly recorded feminine nudity and glamor. The absolute lack of budget is not a real excuse, since Paul Naschy has already proved that he has enough imagination to make up for the shortage of money. It's just a horrible movie, the end of history. Other European excerpts from "The Excorcist" are "The Antychrist" and "Beyond the Door".
