Is this a stupid movie? You bet !! I could not find any moment in this movie that would be frightening or frightening. Stupid moments? Much. Silly characters? You bet. Bad effects? Everywhere! Rick Baker could go and do bigger and better things, this is not one of them. Well, people have to start somewhere. Dr. Ted Nelson is in cheese. He's the most tearful doctor I've ever seen. He has a drowning man running somewhere in Ventura County, he is not too happy that his wife is pregnant (probably because he is 55 years old and weighs 90 pounds), and nowhere you can find crackers. In addition, he has a not very helpful general who wants to find Steve's astronaut. And the local sheriff wants to know what's going on, even though Mr. Nelson can not tell him anything. There are also some random characters thrown in for good that face a melting man. Eventually the movie ends and the monster enters the trash can to become a compost. In the end, this is just what you need for a great episode of MST.
