This movie is pure guano. Mum always said that if you can not say anything nice ... but even mom would say that I have to do my best to warn others about this film. <br /> <br /> I can guarantee that it's a movie that Geoffrey Rush will just leave. I hope Greg Kinnear fired his agent ... from the cannon for giving him the script. After all, Ben Stiller is probably praying for someone to throw "There is something else about Maria." I've always been a fan of Wes Studi, thank you for all you swear that he wore a mask through the movie, so maybe people will not identify the film with him. <br /> <br /> It starts promisingly from the style of a Batman movie cinematography, and then just loses something ... like a coherent plot and half decent effects. <br /> <br /> The jokes are sent by telegram an hour before the arrival of the punchline, and even then they fall. If you want to see an effective parody of the comic, see "Chasing Amy". <br /> <br /> RUN! YOU DO NOT WANT TO WON THE "MYSTERY MEN"!
