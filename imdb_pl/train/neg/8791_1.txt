Be warned! <br /> <br /> It is nonsense that other nonsense do not even bother to be in the company because it's under them! Okay, make it out of the way, let me say something more substantive. <br /> <br /> I saw Ashes of Time a long time ago thinking it was a fresh look at the material based on the highly revered volume of wuxia novels due to the emerging director's reputation, Wong Kar Wai. Well, despite all this, WKW has failed to adapt the novel on the screen according to many wuxia fans; these are usually just pictures of dripping water, beads of sweat, legs of running horses, etc. I could not sit for most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Fast forward many years later, when I wanted to give you. Wong's films are another shot after hearing a lot of praise, especially from Cannes. I was intrigued by his newest, 2046. A friend told me to start at Chungking Express, because it is his most-available film. Very bad! I was just p.o. that I had fooled myself, wasting time and money on this piece of pretentious nothingness. Some professional reviewers have mentioned this as a meditation on alienation and loneliness in the modern big city, blah, blah, blah. It's all right if the director has a point of view with something that says why these things happen and they say. But no, he only shows what is. Acting Faye Wong is very typical of the Hong Kong style: distorted diction, deer in wide light, try to be a sweet and girlish actor; the rest of the cast is just as little inspired. <br /> <br /> I think the word Auteur is a euphemism for a director who is trying something new and different, which should be applauded, but not the one who has not mastered the art of storytelling, what Mr. Wong has been for 17 years !
