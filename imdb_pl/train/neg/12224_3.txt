Barbara Streisand directs and plays in this very Jewish history. <br /> <br /> To have a chance to get an education, Babs enthusiastically dresses up as a boy, which is not the most difficult thing because the boy looks anyway. In his new school he meets many classmates who have no problems with believing that he is a guy. <br /> <br /> Do not miss the best of many moments of unintentional humor, when a friend of a friend of Babsa thinks he is a man, but he sticks him to the ground, sits down on him and looks affectionately at "his" eyes ... * snicker * . <br /> <br /> Medium film; splattering story of nothing particularly interesting.
