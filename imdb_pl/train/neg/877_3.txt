I was excited to see how this movie expects to be a continuation of the cult "Private Lessons" that depict the dreams of every teenager. <br /> <br /> "Private lessons II" has nothing to do with the title I mentioned. It's just an ordinary movie Cinemax with a soft core that will not change your life. There's only one hot sex scene on the roof, but that's all. I watched it a long time ago, but believe me, it's just a boring movie with a soft core. <br /> <br /> Women are hot, but this is not enough to rent or buy a movie. My advice is to watch it only when it is broadcast on the cable.
