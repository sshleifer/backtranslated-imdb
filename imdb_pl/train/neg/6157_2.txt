It was definitely one of those sleepless nights when I was surfing the sewers and I came across this stinking movie. For some of the names in the cast, I expect a much better movie. I am almost embarrassed to see that Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham has been reduced to such a terrible part. I hope the money was worth it. And the students talked about fencing as if they were talking about surviving in a war or a terrible catastrophe. I mean, I was fencing, it's a fun sport, but I've never been so intense. The only reason I watched the whole movie was because the pilot came under the sofa and I was too lazy to get him back.
