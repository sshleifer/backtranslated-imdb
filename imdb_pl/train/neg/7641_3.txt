This is one of those films that tries to be moody and tense, and instead stumbles itself. Seeing this at the queer film festival, I was intrigued to write "a young college that went wrong," but eventually it ended up being quite disappointed. <br /> <br /> It's difficult to criticize "real story" because you can not do much with the story - but I found it chaotic, melodramatic and totally depressing. It is dark and almost sinister, it paints a damn frightening flash of the seventies with impressive music and sharp close-ups. It just does not work - some scenes in which it's so tacky that instead of silencing respect, my audience suppressed the snickers and rolled their eyes. <br /> <br /> The story has an interesting assumption, but it rotates down into darkness, a miserable spiral.
