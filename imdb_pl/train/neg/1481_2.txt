Did they use their entire budget by paying porn stars or what?!? <br /> <br /> The sound effects, background music and editing were so bad that one could think that a 12 year old dream movie. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors were good, considering the scenario ... the "innocent virgin" played its role really well. <br /> <br /> Mutants look really cool and it could actually be a really cool movie with the right brain behind the wheel ... but, unfortunately, for everyone involved, it's not like that. <br /> <br /> Turn left was better than this movie, and these guys do not even have money !!! It's good that I did not rent the movie myself!
