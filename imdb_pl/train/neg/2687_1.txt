Eleven "great" filmmakers, eleven pieces of rubbish. Eleven minutes of every boredom, sophistry, condescension, indulgence. Delicacies for people from all nations. Yussef Chahine from Egypt, giving "hip hip hop!" For terrorism in his amateur segment. On the other side of the green line we have Amos Gitai from Israel, using his eleven minutes to show the terrorist act and focus on the shuffling presenter. Alejandro González Iñárritu from Mexico focused on the Twin Towers, but it seemed that he forgot to turn the camera on. Sean Penn did not know that there were no buildings in the shadow of the Shopping Center on 9-11. Shohei Imamura from Japan ignores the whole matter. Claude Lelouch focuses on a trivial and diligent affair. Ken Loach from the United Kingdom focuses on Chile. Etc. etc.
