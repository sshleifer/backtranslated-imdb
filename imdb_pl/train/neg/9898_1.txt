This version of "Moby Dick" offends the audience, claiming that it is based on Melville's novel, and even shows the false sentence of the first chapter, not the famous "Call me Ishmael". In addition to the horrible action, even from John Barrymore, this is probably the biggest example of how far Hollywood (especially early Hollywood) will go on revision and change the famous novel just to increase its chances at the box office. the beautiful, poetic language of the novel has been completely eradicated, and Ahab has been changed from a thoughtful, blasphemous, obsessive madman into a bold, misunderstood hero who wants to kill Moby Dick after his fiancé (!) turns away from him after seeing his wooden leg. Added to this is a standard evil brother who wants a fiancé and other ending for himself!
