Space Camp, which had the unfortunate luck planned during the Challenger accident, deserves such happiness. The "stars" are mocking acting, Lea Thomson actually turns sideways when asked for more than her usual innocent smile with wide eyes, probably to mask her risky attempts. Film is sometimes funny when you start to ask too much. A small boy is holding a multimillion robot in the closet, which breaks when hordes of related roommates receive too many commands. This hacked and unbearable machine, "Jinx", is the main player in the absurd premise of the film, which appears to be part of the Short Circuit, part of 2001 by the Airplane team. I will not bore you, just say that you can only laugh when you face it. Having said all this, it's nice to observe the way Bell wrote in SeaQuest. Romance and technology, beware, they are as unbelievable as each other. In addition, if you are a freak from the eighties, you can not ignore it in the playful performances of Kate Capshaw (Willie of the Temple of Doom) and of course Lei Thompson. Joaquin Phoenix also bets on the suspicious verse as a kind of would-be Goonie who befriends Jinx. Do not come close to this movie if you're not a trash fan.
