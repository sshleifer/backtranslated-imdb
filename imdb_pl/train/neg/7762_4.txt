Considering that John Doe apparently inspired the creator of Kyle XY, I expected his pilot to be quite interesting. However, I probably had too high expectations because I was quite disappointed by it. First, they turned the hero into a freak, who had a crazy idea to show his amazing knowledge to the public in public space. So after this scene I started to worry that it's just entertainment. The problem, however, is that it has worsened because none of the other characters have been correctly introduced. They focused too much on John Doe, which made the story less intriguing. I was also slightly disappointed with the performance of Dominic Purcell, because I discovered that he was not a credible John Kowalski. Another problem was the history of the police. It was really déjà vu and it was not a pleasant feeling. This leads us to the worst problem, which is the episodic format. I've already seen the fillers appear one by one. <br /> <br /> So overall I was very disappointed and would not recommend it to anyone. Considering how bad it was, I now better understand why the show was canceled. In a sense, I have the impression that he missed the goal, developing characters to help the hero find his own identity. It's sad because there was potential, like the people he met at the club. The production quality was also quite good and the casting was correct. But I will never know if this has improved, probably not because I do not plan to watch the next episode.
