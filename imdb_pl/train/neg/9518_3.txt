Poor performances by Sinatra, Martin and Hyer. Grossly underdeveloped supporting characters. Annoying talk without a real story. The ending leaves flatter than the pancake, with more loose ends than could be combined in the four sequels (that is, if you even cared for these wooden figures). MacLaine is the only real asset. This penultimate sequence, in which the "Chicago hood" is looking for the character of Sinatra, is ridiculous. Music in this sequence is also weak. And in the last scene, when Martin's character removes his hat for the woman he called "the pig," he almost forced me to go outside and find a stone that I could throw through the TV screen.
