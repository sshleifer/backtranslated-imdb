LESS SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> Well, I just sat up late and watched the movie, mainly because I liked and rated some of Singleton's earlier works, such as "Boyz n the hood". I must say, however, that it was a great disappointment and everything I hate in the fanciful, stereotypical, so-called "news" films. <br /> <br /> Acting is mostly weak (pop stars and models do NOT necessarily have to make good actors ... notice), situations difficult to swallow (the rape victim becomes a nocturnal lesbian? ... please!), but the worst thing is that it strengthens every corrupt stereotype you can think about. In the second half of the movie it has become similar to its characteristics, which means that you lose some of the empathy that you could have for her one-dimensional players. <br /> <br /> There is no important point about the inherent causes of racism and cultural, sexual and political ignorance. As a result, it ends with a sensation of the results of these problems. This message is contradictory, which causes a sense of confusion and a general lack of consistency of the story. When it comes to films, I found that it is predictable, embarrassing, exploitative and gently offensive. For a movie called "Higher Learning," I must say that everything I've learned is to avoid it, never to see it again. <br /> <br /> If you want a real commentary on some of the topics that this film completely does not cover then hire "American History X" ... unless you just watched it for Tyra Banks, and then go to rent a life.
