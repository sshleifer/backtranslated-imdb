Where to start? How best to describe how awful is this movie ??? <br /> <br /> Let's start with the camp humor. It's not funny. Add a group of musicians masquerading as actors - Meat Loaf is horrible, and Deborah Harry is even worse. Pity poor Art Carney, who should have known better than to make this movie. <br /> <br /> And then there is a conspiracy. Roadie, whose life goal is to work at the Alice Cooper exhibition, meets a girl whose life goal is to be a groupie for Alice Cooper. At least they get what they want ... <br /> <br /> And then, when the movie should end, they can not come up with a more credible final scene than ... well, I will not ruin it for you if you really want to see a movie . <br /> <br /> There are some actors who will let you know that it will be a "B" movie or maybe worse. Gailard Sartain is one of them for me - and he has a more significant role. This is a sure sign that the film will probably not be very good. If nothing else, the film meets low expectations - it even exceeds them, being worse than poor. <br /> <br /> Let's say it. This is a movie with which all bad movies are compared. And none is worse than Roadie.
