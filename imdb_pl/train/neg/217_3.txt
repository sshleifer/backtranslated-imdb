It is a film that is based only on a somewhat controversial image of incest and lesbianism to be noticed. This is it. Dialogues are pathetic, and the sensuality of "sexual scenes" is absolutely absent. Acting and dialogue are more suitable for high school students, but the topic is intended for adult audiences. This is a film without a gutter and a shallow one. It could be better if he had history and drama. And one more thing: why are internal monologues so overly used? It makes it seem so cheap. All in all an embarrassing movie for Romanian cinema, as well as for a mature audience trying to watch it. I know that the funds are rare, but it is not always an excuse to flop the movie, as it does. start using good actors in your movies and stop them being processed by musicians (Tudor Chirila) - they can not work!
