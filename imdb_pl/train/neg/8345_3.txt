This movie could have been much better, especially considering talent. The portrait of Frankie Lymon Larenz Tate was not good, especially in the case of musical performances. He is not well in sync with his lips, and his stage manners are Larenz Tate, when Frankie Lymon should have been. The presentation of women as a group of gold seekers is Hollywood. The forces that apparently pushed them, but only made the heroes more unrealistic. The positive side of the film is the portrait of little Richard Miguel Nunez and the same cameraman Little Richard. Lela Rochon, as usual, is sweet to the eyes, even as a conservative one. It is a pity that the talents of Halle Berry and Vivika A. Fox have been wasted. The whole saga Frankie Lymon was fascinating in real life. It is a pity that this movie was a wasted opportunity.
