I have a copy from the author of this movie on soulseek. I must say it's pathetic and just painful when we watch the performances of two cops, but I watched the movie as a joke, and because it is a tribute to the underworld of August, which I just saw in my book as an amazing movie. Its quality and everything in it is very bad, but its entertainment and something to say among friends. It reminds me of the troma, but good things. I recommend that you see it under two conditions, if you are bored and you need good laughter, or high, otherwise just let it be. Recommended download for sure. and murders are quite funny. as when the zombie tears Satan's worshipers, they move away and stab someone on the head.
