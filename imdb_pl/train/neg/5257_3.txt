For the film "horror" created for television, the film began to be very interesting. I was intrigued by the story and the mystery of the film. But the ending was a total disappointment. The film developed at a rapid pace and developed, it seemed, to a very climatic end. But guess what is endless. The film ends and after almost an hour and a half, the audience simply wonders what happened. Why all unanswered questions in the film have remained unanswered. There was no explanation about any of the key points in the story. This movie is like watching the murder mystery, and then he'll never know who did it. Very disappointed. This movie looks like the producers ran out of money and never finished the movie. A real BOMB!
