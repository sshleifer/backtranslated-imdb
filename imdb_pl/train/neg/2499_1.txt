The cast of this movie contains some of the better New Zealander actors, many of whom I've seen in fantastic roles, but this movie fills me with a deep shame that I'm from the same country as they are. False American accents are the first indication that things are going to happen spectacularly wrong. In another review it was quite aptly noticed that a luxury cruise ship is actually an old car ferry, decorated with several colorful flags stolen from a used car. Most of the cast seems to come from the (long) long New Zealand soap Shortland Street. It is as if this movie was dreamed at a Christmas party on Shortland Street, which is the result of too many gins and probably a little salmonella. Imagine that "Under Siege" meets with "The Love Boat", issued by a local primary school and managed by an autistic and you have an idea. <br /> <br /> If you're an actor, I recommend you this movie as a study on how to destroy your guardian.
