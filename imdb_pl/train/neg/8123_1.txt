(spoilers) Wow, this is bad. I made a double attempt to watch the old episode of Star Trek one day - it was the one where everyone gets infected with this cosmic disease, then they get a little nervous - and he was Stewart Moss, known as the 'hero' of It Lives at night! He played the first infected crew member who dies from depression. I could only think that he watched his own film too many times, which caused depression. This movie is full of really unbelievable people. There is no redeeming form in the film, not one. It's very difficult to feel bad because Dr. Beck turns into a bat (or whatever he's actually changed) because you just do not like him. And you do not like his penetrating, bony wife or nasty, obnoxious sergeant. Ward or Dr. Mustache Love ... So why would you invest some time or energy in this movie? Where there is no empathy with the heroes, there is no reason to care about it. Not to mention the terrible pictures that made it look like they filmed the film through the urine, and five cents of special effects of the bat, many of which seemed to be pieces of paper thrown into the fan to simulate hordes of flying bats. This is not the worst movie I've ever seen on MST3K, but definitely downstairs.
