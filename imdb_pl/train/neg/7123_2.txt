Welcome to the evil story of ghosts and someone else's nightmare. This horror story features a newly married husband (John Hudson) and a wife (Peggy Weber) visited by the memory of his previous wife and screaming skulls found in their empty pond and lily pond. Is the husband really trying to force his already anxious bride crazy? Is this a challenging gardener Mickey (Alex Nicol) who looked after the residence area since the death of the original housewife? This low-budget horror has a story that allows you to get involved in the finale. Special effects are very bad even in the standards of 1958. I swear that the screaming skull sounds like it should be in the movie Godzilla. Also in the cast as Reverend Snow is the actor of Russ Conway. By the way ... lurking gardener (Nicol) is the director of the film. You can catch it as part of the AMC Monsterfest.
