Remake of H.B. Halicki's classic film from the seventies is simply awful. Together with Vanishing Point, Gone in 60 Seconds represent the quintessence of pursuit movies. The remake takes the original and stands on the head. While Halicki gave us 75% of the car chase and 25% of the supporting drama, in GISS 2000 we received 25% chase for the car and 75% of the supporting drama. Cage as a great man, saves his brother, kisses a girl. MTV editions, tits and ass. Save money, rent the original. At least, Halicki did not live to see his child (he wrote, produced, directed and played in the film "74"), thus degraded.
