Although this is usually a tacky jungle-style adventure film, it has some great elements - the settings are quite beautiful and the pace of the adventure is good. You will not be bored watching him. <br /> <br /> Keith is as breezy as possible playing the title leader, the shamelessly drunken jungle guide escorting rich boy Van Hoffman and his wonderful wife. expedition in the cannibal country. He never takes things seriously. The shower is there as a decoration, and Keith uses it widely - it does not really have to work too much. She is not the only woman who shows off her body, and the delicate aspects of the film cause that halfway to the T / A picture. <br /> <br /> In this movie there is nothing that would pay particular attention to it, or away from it. Produced for shlock, it works without too much confusion. Good 2 AM cable programmer.
