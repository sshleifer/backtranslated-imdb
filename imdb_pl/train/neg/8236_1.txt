I can not believe it is on DVD. Even less was available at my local video store. <br /> <br /> Some say it's a good movie if you take into account that it only had a budget of $ 4,000. I think it's funny. I would find it very bad, regardless of the budget. <br /> <br /> Even more fun, read the next review: "Dramatics aside, if you love horror and you love something like Duel (1971) updated with a little more stories and some pretty girls thrown in, you'll love this movie. "<br /> <br /> What?!? It's a pity to compare these two films. <br /> <br /> I give "1" because I can not give "0". I just can not see this movie funny.
