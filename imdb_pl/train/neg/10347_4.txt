I just saw that Adam Had Four Sons for the first time and I was struck by the fact that I thought the model used was Theodore Roosevelt and his four sons. They were more or less the same age as the four boys in this movie. Warner Baxter in his performance of Adam Stoddard spoke about the same values ​​and family traditions that you would hear from our 26th president without some of the more noisy aspects of the character of TR. <br /> <br /> Like TR, all the sons of Stoddard serve in the First World War, in this case, the youngest lose their eye and do not die. <br /> <br /> But what if the female falls into this whole male farm and disturbs everything? This is Susan Hayward's job here. In one of his greatest roles, Hayward is a flirtatious, amoral girl who marries one son, has an affair with another and starts playing for the third. This is the early precursor of this part, which later brought her Oscar in I Want to Live. <br /> <br /> I suppose that with such a powerful decorum pattern as Theodore Roosevelt and Warner Baxter portraits, everyone is afraid to tell his father what is going on. Sons, as well as their governess, Ingrid Bergman. Here the story becomes a bit stupid. Bergman is introduced to us as a governess employed by Baxter and wife Fay Wray for her children. Wray dies, and Baxter suffers from some financial problems. Bergman must be released. He returns to France, and years later returns to his family when children grow up. <br /> <br /> I am sorry, but I can not believe that children now need a governess. Hayward is right when he confronts her that it was not the children who brought her back. In the normal course of things, Bergman would deal with his life. <br /> <br /> One of the previous reviewers said that one quarter of the movie I had was edited. Perhaps this may be the reason for many of the story holes we have. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that Ingrid and Susan could not make another film together in the 1950s, when Hayward was at her top, and Bergman was just back. <br /> <br /> Susan Hayward is the main reason why Adam Had Four Sons. And I am ready to believe that a lot of Ingrid remained on the floor of the cutting room.
