Many horror fans love Scarecrows, so I will not be too popular saying that I find it rather boring. The idea behind this was interesting, but it seems to go on so much. I think the main problem is that everything is in the dark. Sometimes horror movies set in the dark can work (eg Humongous), but Scarecrow is in the dark for the whole movie. Most of the time it is difficult to understand what is actually happening, and although some shots of scarecrows were frightening, most were hard to see. If you used a little more light, maybe it would be better. <br /> <br /> To my knowledge, there are not many movies with deadly scarecrows, except Dark Night Of The Scarecrow, which is much better. I would recommend it over Scarecrows every day.
