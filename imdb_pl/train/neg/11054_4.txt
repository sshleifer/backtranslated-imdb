It is enormous and inspiring for me that a band writing for hopelessly the main Hollywood movies like INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, American Graffiti and HOWARD THE DUCK will start their career with such a low-budget exploitation horror. Perhaps as a testimony of talent that would win Willard Hyuck and Gloria Katz a subsequent Oscar nomination in their career, the Messiah of Evil has potential, but unfortunately becomes frustrating because he can not mobilize to create a movie. . <br /> <br /> The idea is a young girl who travels to a small seaside town in search of her painter, who went missing some time ago. You do not have to wait long for the fragmentary narrative to give up all hope and immerse yourself in the chaotic absurdity - and work for a while until you begin to think that perhaps the Messiah of Evil must be recovered from the ghetto Utilization of the '70s as an example of an ingenious mysterious horror. <br /> <br /> Surreal non-sequelings are still cumulative when the daughter encounters a young couple in a seedy hotel room that is in the city to conduct research on the local legend about the "bloody moon", sloppy and semi-crazy alcoholic (played by the great Elisha Cook Jr. in perhaps the best scene of the movie), who warns her against the father only to be supposedly found dead in the alley "eaten by dogs a little later, a blind old woman who owns a local art gallery and which inexplicably removed from the store all the images of her father and the last, but no less important, delayed, murderous, eating the albino squirrels. <br /> <br /> Part of the charm of the film is just the branc of artistic surrealism in the cellar basement, which at every turn contrasts with logic and species conventions. While with Lynch it is obviously a sign of a talented artist, with the Messiah's evil boundaries between "intentional", "unintentional" and "he did not expect it to come out this way, but it is good enough - WRAP SCENE" is blurred hopelessly. <br /> <br /> Take, for example, the double narrative that flows and comes out of the picture into a narcotic, hectic, stream of consciousness, one coming from a daughter who wanders from place to place in search of her father and the other told by her father's voice when he reads his diary. <br /> <br /> While we are still talking about the image of a "living corpse", Messiah of Evil is different and only loosely - at least with the current ideas about what a zombie movie should be. The source of the living dead is a hundred-year-old curse, given to the city by the mysterious "Dark Stranger" who one day came from the forest. Meanwhile, Hyuck finds time for fragments of criticism of mass consumption in a supermarket with meat food, which overtakes DEATH Dead for a good number of years (you can already hear the line MST3K: "man is dead, only his capitalistic food cans remain") and nicely thought out, but badly made similar cinema scene. <br /> <br /> Generally, I think that surrealism works in prudent, well-measured doses - how does absurd work if it is not hidden in a completely normal one? Hyuck seems to just smudge it all over the picture and doing so dangerously overcomes his hand. When, for example, an albino lifts a girl who goes to the city and eats a squirrel, it is almost conceivable that the director winks significantly to the audience, amused and satisfied with his own hijinks. <br /> <br /> The overall level of film making is also quite low - after the halfway point the pace becomes muddy, and the story is tiring and apparently is not fast anywhere. Add to this an intermittent edition, average performance and Hyuck's general inability to capture the real atmosphere - the empty streets of the seaside city are criminally abused - and I put the Messiah under a "missed opportunity", but still the grindhouse afficionados will find enough to appreciate - even though it is not it's especially bloody, kitschy or dingy.
