This is certainly one of the most bizarre films in history - even for Fellini. His only SATYRICON is bizarre. It's two and a half hours in a strange nightmare world of decadence, wealth and sexual challenge. Sutherland makes an oddly unattractive Casanova, and strange events in a series of unrelated vignettes taken from the autobiography of a great lover do not engage the viewer. The direction of art and costumes are, however, UNIQUE. The Academy did not even want to nominate the first one, but it did justice to it, rewarding OSCAR for the latter. Nominated (oddly enough) was also an ambiguous, pointless and almost unattainable scenario. Conjecture!! Video on video is only 150 minutes, 16 minutes before the original work time. This viewer was grateful.
