While William Shater can always make me smile in whatever he appears in (and especially love him as Denny Crane in Boston Legal), well, this series is mainly tinsel and dancing girls who scream and jump in up and down. > <br /> There is nothing of Milioner's intelligence, none of the Deal or No Deal talent. <br /> <br /> This series is all about dancing and stupid things to fill the time. <br /> <br /> Of course I watched it to check it out. I watched it for over 45 minutes, then I had to turn it off. <br /> <br /> The best part was that William Shatner was dancing on stage. He is hoot! unfortunately this concert DOES NOT DO. <br /> <br /> This is given
