SPOILERS THROUGHOUT THE ENTITY: <br /> <br /> Gettaway is mainly an action movie. And what an action !! Shootings, chases, dustbins and much more. It features Kim Bassenger and Alec Baldwin as Mc Coy's. <br /> <br /> This is a remake and I did not see the original, but I really did not care, even though Bassenger and Baldwin have a nice chemistry screen. But the film itself did not do it for me. <br /> <br /> Gettaway has become really tiring really fast. The conspiracy is overshadowed by one fight / chase behind him, and when violence continues to rise, Bassenger and Baldwin retain their magnificent appearance regardless of the dangers that may arise. In fact, at the end of the movie they look almost better than the beginning. I do not think that the makeup of Baserson's eyes will move once in the whole picture. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, certainly not, but it's not very good and I think it's not a purist from an action movie, I do not see that I really liked this movie because it's here little. Gettaway is also not terribly original and goes from unnecessarily brutal to rather boring. It could really be better, I think. <br /> <br /> Bassenger and Baldwin give good results, but they do not have much to do except for the race and escape for their lives. Sometimes less is more, after I saw the same over and over, it becomes out of date. I did not like it too much.
