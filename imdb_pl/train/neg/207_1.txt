This film is a 90 minute Ramones concert with short periods of stupidity and absolute boredom. What kind of high school? <br /> <br /> Unless you're a big fan of Ramones, NO and I repeat, DO NOT waste time like me. It is completely impossible to observe from the beginning to the end. This movie should be called Ramone Fever. Everyone seems to like them in this movie. There is no conspiracy in this film. When it comes to comedies for teenagers, scrape the bottom of the barrel with it.
