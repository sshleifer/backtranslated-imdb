To be honest, I did not watch the whole original "howl", but the scenes I saw made it obvious that the first howl was a great movie. so great that you had to make seven dire consequences. They started with "Howling II: Your Sister Is A Werewolf". I got this video on VHS from my uncle some time ago, when he was giving away some old movies he bought when Atari was completely new. I just watched it last night and it was not really BAD, it was just weird. I mean, the whole thing with Sybil Danning with three servants of the werewolf was just out of place and quite disturbing (but a bit hot), Christopher lee is going to stab a dead karen, like she was a vampire etc., this movie was in fact like mrac-mash of Dracula and The Lost Boys ... except werewolves, because everything Christopher Lee (who played Dracula himself) talked about werewolves quite detached from every other movie about vampires (stake in the heart garlic, the creation of the night must die IN NIGHTS and the ruler of the werewolves lives in TRANSYLWANIA). not much for acting, but the worst was from Annie McEnroe. I swear, at some point in the movie, I found out that the werewolves are ripping her throat because that damned throat always had to say SOMETHING. In any case, the plot is quite stupid and stereotyped, so there is no point in telling you, you can just read about it on Wikipedia. Incidentally, what really makes me scared about this movie is that it's the ONLY video of all seven sequels related in some way to the original (not counting Howling IV (1988), which was a remake 'iem the original or in other words a continuation based on the same novel). so do not watch this movie. there is no real horror, almost no werewolves and just a terrible special fx. 3/10
