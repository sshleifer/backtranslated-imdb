I went to see this movie with the most positive expectations. I saw Jacquet's previous movie (march of penguins) and I heard a very positive review of this movie on the radio. However, I was very disappointed. First of all, this movie is terribly boring. Literally nothing happens. I tried to describe the content of the film to a friend and we both laughed because I could only stutter in "well, then winter comes, then spring, and then there is an eagle, the river and once it is dark, and the girl goes to the cave, and another time the fox has children "and so on. After about half an hour I began to sigh, yawn, roll my eyes, curse the reviewer at the radio station and hope that it will end soon. But the film lasted and lasted. When I was finally done, I sank so deep into my chair that I had to look a bit like Stephen Hawking. The most annoying part of the movie is (a) A girl who, of course, is going to give the children someone to identify with. He wears the same clothes throughout the film (one year) and shows exactly two facial expressions: Joy and Severeness. It is sweet, there is no doubt about it. However, a film about the beauty of such a nature would do better without its too human presence. All the time I was hoping that she could be eaten by a bear, drown in a river or something terrible. (b) A commentary on the adult voice of a girl who only tells us things that are negligible, obvious, boring, unnecessary. (c) Music that desperately lacks subtlety. When the girl jumps happily, the music jumps too. When the fox threatens the eagle, the music also becomes dangerous. It reminded me of the very early times of filmmaking and it was too predictable to enjoy them. I must admit that many children who saw the film with me apparently liked it, at least somehow they got involved in it. That's why my warning applies only to adults: if you're more than ten years old, avoid this movie. You can get a better (and cheaper) sleep in most other places.
