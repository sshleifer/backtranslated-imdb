It is interesting that everyone who (so far) seemed to like this movie had no expectations - it's probably a trick. In contrast, I had optimistic expectations and it was a mistake. As soon as I saw how close to the camera there were always faces, I knew that we are in the hands of an extremely amateur director - it is always their clear sign, they believe that holding the camera is the art, effectiveness or intensity of about two inches from the actors. However, the actors in this movie had only one expression on their faces. <br /> <br /> If the camera was not enough, there was not enough light in the film. The film seemed to be completely filmed in the dark. We now know that the cinematographer was also an amateur of rank. "Oh, oh, we'll light the set with a flashlight! All this will make everything intimate! "No, it made everything invisible. <br /> <br /> In addition to serious technical defects, there was absolutely no story going beyond the most delicate hint of an idea that was never developed, and nothing new in this kind of relationship was illuminated. (Perhaps this is a new kind of film for Germany, but in Los Angeles, forget about it.) <br /> <br /> The fact that this film won several awards at film festivals does not testify to the quality of the film, but praises the quality these festivals. I can assure you that this movie will not win anything at the festival where I saw it. In fact, twice during the film it seemed that it was finally over and people started to get up to leave (this was one of the side effects of the operator's "total darkness" technique). But when the movie shivered, the audience started to moan instead. And when the film finally ends, it became clear that it did not matter if it actually ended in one of the two previous points. Earlier ending would save the audience from even more monotonous home scenes (folding sheets, cutting vegetables, spreading honey on bread). Yes, we understand, the life of a lonely old man was boring - but we discovered it at the very beginning. <br /> <br /> I recommend that the audience long for this, there is absolutely nothing to offer sophisticated movie viewers.
