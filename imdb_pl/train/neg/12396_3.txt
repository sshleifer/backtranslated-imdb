There are not many things to say about Underneath, Soderbergh's untrue pursuit of neo-noir. Soderbergh faithfully repairs Robert Siodmak's decent Criss-Cross noir, without changing the plot at all, but the adaptation sucks it from every ounce of the most modern atmosphere of the noir movie, giving it the same story embedded in the least attractive places, lifestyles and anachronisms. Soderbergh, who later created great crime movies such as Out of Sight and the Ocean series with great style and atmosphere, takes a dangerously obvious path to modernization, reviving the ugliest, the most stupid and flattering fashion from the early 90s. Nightclubs have horrible, disgusted garage teams, an uninteresting version of the anti-hero Burt Lancaster by Peter Gallagher is left by his girlfriend femme fatale for compulsive buying cinematic, lifeless modern devices such as stereo, televisions and other modern devices that react outside the film . <br /> <br /> It could be more fun and less boring if he had a few favors of saving, such as a good result, more bodies for his characters than just William Fichtner giving performances that are not t wooden, sharper pace. Unfortunately, Underneath does not have any of these things. Soderbergh, a great director, this time does not use his dry distance for his film. This disposition works wonderfully when he controls a crime film with more tongue in the cheek, like the aforementioned photos of George Clooney, or a social drama such as Movement or sex, lies and a video tape. In a movie like Underneath, it intensifies the boredom that the viewer experiences.
