I do not see what everyone liked about this film. The configuration was too long and talkative, and when it happened, the main character remained as flat and opaque as in the first scene. After the film finally got Cusack to the hotel's title room, I had to think about what would happen here for the next hour to get me involved. Answer: not much, just John Cusack having a long, exhausting, mental breakdown. <br /> <br /> Maybe if the Cusack character has more depth. . maybe if his eccentricity was a more accurate remake of his everyday life. . . maybe if the film would have developed the half-baked topics of loss and faith better or not attached them at all. . . maybe if the movie would choose a psychological horror or horror movie, and fully embraced one of these styles. . . I do not know. I only know that I saw this movie with two other horror fans and none of us liked it. <br /> <br /> With the exception of a disturbing episode on the hotel shelf, a disturbing mad lady with a hammer and such a stupid-was-fun guardian of the crypts in the air channel, all three of which no more than five minutes on screen, this movie was boring. <br /> <br /> By the way, this story seems to steal ideas from Shining and use them here for a much smaller effect. Is Stephen King now restricted to stealing ideas?
