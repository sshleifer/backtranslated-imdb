This is a great story and was just the beginning of equality in the United States. (We're still working on it too.) But despite the fact that it's true, it's still a movie and it's a movie site. I realize that independent films have difficulty getting good actors, but wow. The only average is the excellent Ossie Davis. But even he was unable to make up for all the actors (including the one who played him as a young man) absolutely horrible action. The scenario awarded was terribly banal, but even then you must get decent actors! I would not recommend it to anyone because it is so badly made in every category. Read a few books about Mason's true story from the USA, because they give these people the respect they deserve.
