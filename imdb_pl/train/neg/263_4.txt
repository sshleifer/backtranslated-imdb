After a day at work, I sat down to relax and turn on movie channels. The film appeared in the guide and sounded interesting, so I tuned in just before it began. The first 30 minutes were enough to interest me, but the lack of acting skills in Jamie Foxx and slow motion made me want to get up and find food during the movie. If there is any loan that could be granted for acting in this film, it should be passed to David Morse, who at least tries to make the film interesting. To sum up, do not plan to impress your friends by choosing this tenant for a movie night.
