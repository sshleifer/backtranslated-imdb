It is a confusing and incoherent mess of endless scenes of boring dialogues and monologues. It's not an exaggeration: you have to make a huge effort to even try to get involved. <br /> <br /> I honestly thought that Fassbinder would do something interesting to say why Erwin / Elvira committed suicide at the end, but instead, in each scene someone tries to explain: "when he was young, it happened ... "And" he came back from Casablanca and ordered everything there to be cut out ... "itd. <Br /> <br /> Soon in the movie Erwin / Elvira he is in the slaughterhouse talking to a prostitute friend (certainly the slaughterhouse is the best place for a pleasant little chat ) and telling her the story of Elvira's life, Fassbinder shows killing one cow after another. It is difficult to choose between paying attention to disturbing images or what the transvestite says. Of course, we come to a very forced and rough symbolism "I have suffered many things in my life and I will die soon." <br /> <br /> In one of the rare moments in which something is happening, Erwin / Elvira meets a former lover, that only after performing an extremely homosexual choreography with two other boys (as if he required an appropriate level of homosexuality) he recognizes Elvira . <br /> <br /> There are some interesting shots and ideas, I have to admit (eg When a nun tells the story of a young Erwin), but everything on the film is wasted due to the indulgence of Fassbinder.
