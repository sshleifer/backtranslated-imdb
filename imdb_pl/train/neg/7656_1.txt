Alone in The Dark is one of my favorite role-playing games of all time. I remember that I spent whole nights on the computer screen, trying to escape from this mansion and actually being surprised sometimes when the monsters appeared surprisingly, charging to her. I do not remember a single success story in this new Hollywood genre, though some are fun enough to be watched. And yet I am such a huge fan of the game that I could not resist. My justification was that if the movie had a story that resembled a game, it would be OK. <br /> <br /> Man, it was 90 minutes (what seemed like 300) of my life that I will never come back. If I had the chance, I would like to devote it to me, instead, change the sock drawer. This is not even in the category "so bad it's funny". You'd think that even Christian Slater had some more sense than joining this smelly bomb. Now, Tara Reid ... I'm not complaining about her presence. However, if the purpose of putting this stick in the main role is to create a sex scene that I completely understand and support (hey, I'm a guy!) - I've seen more of her body at press conferences. <br /> <br /> There is no conspiracy. You will not waste time throwing it to you. The credibility of the story falls below "I did not have sex with Mrs. Lewinski." Acting is just a few cuts above "Street Fighter", which, incidentally, is one of the worst movies I've seen, I would recommend over that. <br /> <br /> Children, I recommend Video Game. It has a much better story, acting and many more emotions. As for the film, here's the spoiler - it's DAMAGE! Wait for the porn version.
