A few days ago I watched THE FIFTY WORST MOVIES OF ALL TIME documentary and here for the first time I heard about THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN. Being a fan of Schlocky films, I try to find some films from a documentary - not only in this AMAZING MAN. In fact, MELTING MAN is the first "bad film" I've seen since then and I have to say I'm rather disappointed. Although this is really a bad movie, nowhere is close enough to include it in this list. <br /> <br /> Now, before I watched the document, I enjoyed "bad movies" since I read the book "The Fifty Worst Movies of All Time" by Harry Medved. In spite of the same title, the book was released long before the document and document makers never gave Medved the idea. I saw about 35 out of 50 films from Medved's book, but I came to a deadlock - the rest of the movies are simply not available on VHS or DVD. I thought I would try a movie with the same name. <br /> <br /> The reason I was most disappointed with THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN was that there were some good elements to the movie. First of all, the special effects of a melting guy were generally really cool and disgusting. It is obvious that the professional (the famous Rich Baker) was involved in making it look realistically. I should stress, however, that there were more than a few cheap and bad effects - such as a floating plastic head and the way the monster ran after cutting off his left hand - you could see it "cleverly hidden" under the clothes! When it comes to history, it's just stupid. A group of astronauts miraculously penetrates Saturn's rings without being crushed. Then they comment on how beautiful the sun is - we can see close-ups. This is strange because Saturn is so far away from him - it should NOT look like this - it should be a big point. Regardless, the scene changes immediately and we are told that one of the surviving astronauts is in the hospital. What happened between the last scene and this one? Yes, it's probably someone. Well, soon the survivors run away and engage in a murderous craze when his whole body is drowning. <br /> <br /> Now, given that they have a psycho runner who looks like a melting popsicle, you'd think that the government would pull out all the stops to find it and stop it, right ?! Wrong. The general involves one lonely doctor to find him !! No army, no police - just some stupid doctor. Even after the bodies start to form, the doctor or the general do nothing to organize meaningful searches or get support. <br /> <br /> Now, considering the stupidity of the movie, you would not be surprised to find the following: <br /> <br /> When the drowning dude runs near the doctor's house, the doctor gives the wife a strong sedative and leaves her in home. the lovely old couple rides late at night, they naturally stop in the orchard to collect fruit and die. <br /> <br /> When a woman sees a drowning guest, he barricades the door to protect himself. It would be wise if she did not have the back door of the house next to her! Instead of just leaving the house and running away, she's just waiting! <br /> <br /> When the photographer and his model take pictures, the guy grabs his assistant and tugs her up. Why? Well, to give the audience a cheap thrill and make him rated flick. <br /> <br /> When the molten guy is finally found and the sheriff throws himself at him, the doctor stops him - even though now the monster killed about half a dozen people. <br /> <br /> As you can see, the movie is full of silly elements of the story. It's a very bad movie. But given the occasional good special effects, it just was not a terrible movie, as I hoped. Sure, it's a good idea to laugh, but not near PLAN 9 FROM EXTERNAL SPACE in bad condition and should never have been on the list of the worst movies.
