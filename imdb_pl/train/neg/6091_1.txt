I bought this exciting movie, great free, up, funny bloodshed. I do not have any of them. This film fails practically on every level, not in the least frightening or funny, it's just awful filming and it never gives viewers anything worth seeing. What is so bad about it is as far from being as harsh, brutal and brutal as it promised, there is very little violence. There is virtually no blood shed and no excitement. Action, direction and dialogue are absolutely unbearable. Honestly, it's really funny. I could barely sit down once through this total rubbish; I will certainly never want to see it again. Do not waste your time on celluloid waste in this way; this is probably the worst movie ever made. If I could give him minus the stars, I would do it.
