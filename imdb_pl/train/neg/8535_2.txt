As I said, the book was pretty good, which could have been a good movie if Melissa Gilbert was not so scary and unbelievable in the lead role. What was the accent to be like this? It sounded the same as her horrible Russian accent in another film in which I saw her. Every time she opened her mouth, I crouched. Three tries have passed before I was able to watch the whole movie. Brad Johnson was good as the second leader. <br /> <br /> I really liked the beach scenes. They added the much-needed brightness to get away from the depressing image of Melissa Gilberts. However, I think that they could, however, better use the views of San Francisco. It seemed that the night scenes were in fact SF, but I could be wrong. I do not remember that the character in the book was so depressing. <br /> <br /> Please, keep Melissa Gilbert out of any future films that require an accent!
