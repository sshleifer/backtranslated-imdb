What do you call the story of horror without horror and history? <br /> <br /> This is the most annoying thing in the movie: I have the impression that the writers never really decided what is going on in the film! Another thing to know is to give hints to the viewers and not to reveal them completely, but here you have the impression that the scriptwriters do not know it, the characters in the film do not know and viewers see that no one knows! (Remember "Cube"? Even this movie knew about yourself more.) <br /> <br /> I used a lot of movies from horror / gore from the 80s and this movie certainly has its roots deep in these movies. But many important things are missing. We really do not know anything about characters. They repeat blank lines over and over again. History is not really developing - it is not going anywhere. B-acting is OK in this type of horror, but in the scenario there is not much to do. We do not care about characters. There is nothing to remember. There is not even bad humor or unnecessary sex. And most importantly - no emotions, no thrills. <br /> <br /> You only get some of the commonly used elements of the horror genre. They show Lordi's monsters one by one, but their characters do not bring anything to history. <br/> <br /> I honestly believe that this amount of history, character development and atmosphere can be achieved with a minimum number of crew members and equipment. Oh, yes, the filmmakers did it - and more - about 20 years ago! I felt that viewers share embarrassment when the movie ended. It is a pity indeed.
