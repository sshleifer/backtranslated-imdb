The ultimate goal of Big Brother is that we know what to think, before we think, it has been realized. Is it a miracle or a sinister joke that people make mental simple jackets of their own free will twist into crooked shapes and smile like monkeys? Films and art no longer risk unknown people, but conclusions are rejected, deprived of life. <br /> <br /> "Notorious Bettie Page" is a nondescript case, suitable for a feminist course in first year studies. His lesson is schematic, rectangular and linear: "See how women are objectified, exploited, abused, and then thrown into the garbage by a society dominated by men." Bettie Page, apparently, was "queen pin" -ups from the 1950s, to which millions of men gushed. (All reviewers repeat this phrase "queen pin-up from the fifties," like a chorus of monkeys). Her story as an American sexual bomb is familiar: south, used by her father, raped, etc. In this movie she is naive, innocent, ignorant of the interests she serves and shamefully benefits from it. Although he believes in Jesus, he likes to play naked in front of the camera lens - only healthy boys from American male sex slaves are supposedly fantasizing. <br /> <br /> From the writer-director Mary Harron, Educated at Oxford I was a punker (do you feel the combination of privileges and "hypnotism" like me?): "I feel that without feminism I would not do it. feminist films in the sense that I do not do anything ideological, but I think that women improve my films. " What a cozy clique. <br /> <br /> The film simply tells the story of human life, its theme and purpose were praised and buried long before the film began. Mrs. Page has a boyfriend, but we can not see anything about their relationship. In fact, there are no intimate or detailed relationships in the film. <br /> <br /> You can not ignore his contented simplicity. In New York, where Mrs. Page is trying to best match and calm the world of the man, letting herself be bound by prison lines and tightly woven with black leather shoes and S & M corsets, the film is black and white. But in Miami, where he wants to get away from it all, joyfully removes his clothes and is photographed by a "liberated" woman, the film turns into color. <br /> <br /> How hell Harron does not "do" feminist films, "does not do anything ideological." Ideology has become so internalized, so it's founded, so programmed that it's almost invisible. Big Brother must smile.
