This British kettle for pots has one advantage: young men are evenly handsome. Older men are stubborn, right-wing Thatchery whose behavior restores the whole confusion of Reagan / Thatcher's years. However, young or old, morals in this three-part miniseries are widely suspected and no one goes particularly well. <br /> <br /> Nick is a handsome young gay, just after Oxford. This is not crucial for this story, but it has an extremely beautiful hair head that makes watching this drift much easier. Nick comes to London with a friend whose father Gerald is a wealthy conservative politician, and looks after his sister Cat, while the family is moving in the south of France. Do not pay attention to the fact that Cat, when it is upset, cuts off the assortment of knives and other kitchen utensils. Nick makes mistakes in their own gratitude for feelings and enters, discovering too late how much they despise and patronize him. Unexplained, Nick lives in this house for four years, but because the plot depends on this point, it's best not to question it. <br /> <br /> While Nick enjoys the most, he's unbearable. Soon, his cunning surrender to rich bigots forced me to climb the walls. Deeply closed except for Cat (he guesses his great secret at the sight), he likes some anonymous sex, so we know he is gay. Though it seems unlikely, Nick takes a lover who is even closer than he is. <br /> <br /> The lofty Tories despise and insult the two blacks in the film, so imagine the venom that spills out when Nick's sexual orientation is reported in the pavement. Gerald, in a true Tory way, has engaged in several personal and financial scandals, so the revelations about Nick contribute to his embarrassment. It gives Gerald the last chance to attack the unfortunate boy. <br /> <br /> With the exception of one brief moment of indignation, Nick takes on the abuse in silence and silent contract. Denial, self-loathing, naivety or ignorance? You decide if you can get through this whole thing without throwing something on the set.
