The words "Swedish" and "action film" do not mix. It becomes more and more obvious at every genre test. This is another failed attempt. <br /> <br /> Lasse Brunell (Shanti Roney) works in a military airbase with secret computer systems. One day, foreign criminals threaten to hurt his family if he does not do what they say. They want secret equipment and will do anything to get it. <br /> <br /> This movie has its ups and downs. And usually, in Swedish action movies, there are no ups and downs. So I think something in this movie had a certain quality. At the beginning of positive comments I can mention that the film is well-made technically. Pictures of airplanes and helicopters flying are well done and look very nice. The operation has very different quality. Shanti Roney makes a decent performance, while Maria Bonnevie is stiff and unnatural, as always (I wonder how long the Swedish directors will use her, even though she has the acting skills of a wooden board?). Stefan Sauk is funny as a "cool" special forces man who comes to the base to investigate. <br /> <br /> And what about action scenes? Well, as I said above, flying planes and helicopters are nice. But besides, there is nothing to talk about. And this is a common problem in Swedish action movies. There simply is not enough action. Maybe it's a budget problem, maybe film culture. I do not know, but it negatively affects the experience. Because to be honest, history and acting are not good enough to make this movie just that. <br /> <br /> I rate this 4/10 for the effort.
