Before I saw it, I saw some bad Christmas movies. But when I saw it, "Jingle All the Way" looked better than "The Godfather". "Santa Claus" is a cheerful movie about how Santa Claus helps some children, but almost feels demonic. Santa, cheerful ho-ho-ho, replaces evil, devilish laughter, which certainly caused that many kids left Christmas. The story of this massacre is very strange, which suits all performances and dialogues. Santa Claus lives high above the Earth at the North Pole, where he and children from around the world are preparing for Christmas. But Saint has an enemy named Pitch or Satan. Pitch is trying to ruin Santa's holidays, making of three naughty boys and creating diversion, such as moving the chimney and giving a hot handle. When Pitch causes Santa Claus to be attacked by a dog, Santa's midfielder, Pedro and Merlin, you should take Santa out of this marinade. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie, along with being even bad, is so strange. Satan dances a lot and seems much more merry than Holy. Saint Nicholas speaks about delivering gifts to all boys and girls, but it seems he only delivers up to 5 children's homes in Mexico. The reindeer are toys, and when the reindeer laughs, I'm amazed that it does not bring tears to children's eyes ... it's terrifying. Everything is terrible. The first 10 minutes are just Santa Claus playing organ, while the children are singing. Probably one of the most bizarre scenes is shooting Santa Claus in the butt with a mini-gun and laughs loudly while Pitch dances in pain. I think that parents better tell their little children where children come from than they show it to. The only positive thing is that you will laugh hysterically if you can appreciate bad cinema. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 85 minutes.
