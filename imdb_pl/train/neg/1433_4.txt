The paintings are great and reflect the landscapes of Canada well. On the other hand, the story was quite boring; In my opinion it was a love story in the forest, just like the Titanic is a love story on a boat. I did not think Gray Owl was a great ecologist. I usually like Lord Attenborough, but this one was ... bad.
