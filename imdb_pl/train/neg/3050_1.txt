When I thought that I would end up without a single movie "Bomb", my friend last night brought this famous home to my home. I was afraid of the worst, knowing his reputation, and it was as horrible as I expected. This is a Mexican mess, dubbed English and produced by K. Gordon Murray. He has horrible sets and effects, and he has a rather scary Santa Claus who does not work at the North Pole, but instead of a cloud in space and who has no small elves helping him create toys, but rather different groups of children from virtually every country. The opening sequence in which Saint. Nick laughs heartily when he watches monitors showing all the kids working hard while singing horrible Christmas songs in different languages, seems to last forever and without history. Of course, this Santa Claus does not comply with the labor law of children! <br /> <br /> In the end, we get a nasty and scarce student with a devil in red who travels from hell to Earth to make the young children naughty and turn Santa's Christmas Eve into a nightmare. Watching this movie is a monstrous and twisted experience that aims to scare young children and turn them off forever from Santa and holidays. Oddly enough, the name of Jesus Christ is often mentioned in this Christmas movie, which somehow makes it more frightening in the context of all the strange things that are happening. It easily creates my personal list of "The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen," but I'm sure it's nothing special.
