I watched it on the tube last night. The engaged actor first caught my attention. The first scenes attracted attention. Some funny a little sad. Good character development. I felt that the second third of the film had dispersed. If it was not for the early part of the movie, I would stop watching. All the time I looked at how it relates to each other. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I feel that this has never happened. I especially did not like the prolongation of the period in which several heroes spoke Yiddish (?). Was this the second shoe? <br /> <br /> Do I recommend? No, I think not. As other reviewers have mentioned, much of the slang is outdated (1960s), but it was not too distracting. The end completely turned me off.
