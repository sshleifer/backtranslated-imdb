First of all, I would like to point out that although I am not an expert, the way you conduct the trial will offend your intelligence. First, the accusation never proved that "easy learning" actually works. Irresponsible both for the prosecution (because they can get an appeal), and for the defense for not acting. As another commentator said, facilitated learning turned out to be untrue. Secondly, they used Terry as a translator who has personal interest and even testifies in a process that is simply stupid. If the court would let him testify in this way, he would bring someone neutral, or they would ask for an appeal. Thirdly, the accusation never asked the child specific questions about the accused (birthmarks, details of the event, etc.), and even when they asked him questions about defense, such as when it began, he could not answer. If this is not justified by doubt, I do not know what is and a competent lawyer would obtain an acquittal. <br /> <br /> The conclusion begins well with the pressure of being the parent of a child with autism, but the attempt makes the film completely unbelievable.
