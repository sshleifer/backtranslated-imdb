I've never been a huge fan of Mormon movies. Being a Mormon, I've always thought that humor was too exclusive for the LDS community and made us look like a group of obsessive wack. I hoped it would be a breath of fresh air, a Halestorm movie that I could finally discuss with my non-Mormon friends. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I thought, because he had a B-list talent like Clint Howard, Gary Coleman, Andrew Wilson and Fred Willard (one of my favorites), it would have to be at least a little ridiculous. In addition, church basketball is mature with the potential for many funny gags and the like. But I must say that throughout the film it seemed that no one knew what they were doing. Every joke fell, and every opportunity for a truly funny gag disappeared. Dialogue was insipid, and the movie was one of the worst characters I've ever seen. Each individual figure, but Wilson, was less than one-dimensional. It's hard to believe that after nine repetitions, the movie was still as repugnant as the train wreck I had witnessed. I can not express the rage I felt while sitting through it. My friends and I were additions in the last stage of the game, so we went to the premiere in Washington City, UT. Kurt Hale, the director, was there and I must say that I avoided contacting him after the concert. He waited at the door, apparently ready for feedback. I could not bring myself to tell him that his film not only took away a good one and a half hours of my life, but left a nasty, painful scar that I will never forget. <br /> <br /> Here were some specific problems: between the caretaker and the plump pianist there was a thread of a subtle love story, but these two characters appeared out of nowhere and could not be bothered, so my friends and I kept wondering why should they care for these two lame, uninteresting figures. There were many threads that appeared from time to time, each of which promised the audience a chance to laugh, but each of them came and went in a cloud of smoke, ending before you could even begin to look after. It was almost the whole movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was a big disappointment and I feel bad for everyone who is expecting the first REAL fun Mormon movie. That's true, jokes in this are not too exclusive for Mormons. On the other hand, it's hard to say what a joke was and what was the loud feeling of ringing in my ears. <br /> <br /> DO NOT look at this video. Remember the fantasy that this movie is fun. Save yourself the disappointments that I've gone through
