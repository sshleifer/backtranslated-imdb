Another violent, furious fantasy by Paul Verhoeven. Verhoeven is a mystery: it is hard to say whether he treats his disgusting impulses seriously, with sardonic intentions or works in total oblivion. It also seems completely unaware that all the wonderful visualizations in the world (and this has some outstanding ones) can not hide neglect in history, dialogue and performance. Kevin Bacon plays a corrupt scientist who discovered invisibility and uses it to lead to moral bankruptcy. Bacon is usually a nice actor who occasionally shows his dark side ("The River Wild"), trying to balance his boyish appearance; but considering the material, Bacon is not hated enough to force him. The other directors are Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin, none of whom are talented enough to make a solid impression, and who, forced to conduct an awkward dialogue, are ashamed. The highlight is the study with the majority, and disbelief must really be suspended.
