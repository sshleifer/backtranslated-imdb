It was a stupid movie with a predictable plot and terrible acting !! Willy Nelson was as stiff as his braids. The film seemed to be a very long advertisement of the bright red lipstick Jessica Simpson wore - especially since there were so many close-ups on her face. The assumption was not fun and as I said - sooooo predictable. Any money spent on making this film was a shameful waste. Any reference to other old Marilyn Monroe movies has not improved Blonde Ambition. It was also unbelievable - Jessica Simpson was able to enter the position of executive secretary in one fell swoop - it was ridiculous!
