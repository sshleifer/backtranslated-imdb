Scotty (Grant Cramer, who starred in the great B movie Killer Klowns from outer space) agrees to help three middle-aged boys learn to "dialog" with the ladies of this evil comedy from the 80's. Not bad as in the 80's jargon, which meant good. Bad as in bad. No nice characters, including, but not limited to, the kid who is the most bizarre guy since "Friday 13 part 2" "a girl who runs men, then sucks in when they want to touch her, and a heavy slob token, because after all, what would a sexy comedy without a fat slob be? Well, this one has two. This film is largely the bottom of sexual comedies from the 80's. And then came the next part, thus deepening the proverbial barrel. <br /> <br /> My class: D- <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: too big to count, you see even a bizarre-looking boy imagined with tits at this point think "Bachlor Party", but not so funny and VERY disturbing. <br /> <br /> Where I saw him: Comcast Moviepass
