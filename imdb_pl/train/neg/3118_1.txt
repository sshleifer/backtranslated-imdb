I felt the movie was dry ... very disappointing that no plot ... did not wait for something that happened and nothing dried up like bone ... a waste of money .. One of Robins Williams' worst movies ... if you do not believe it Me, wait a few months for it to be on DVD, because it seems like it's a pattern for movies that do not do well in cinemas as rentals before the end of the year ... This is the one you do not want to see or tell me why I spent for money! Plus, for the fact that it is such a new movie, only 8 people watched it ... It was on Friday evening, showing 9:50. I also felt that I needed more emotion or something that would wake us up. When the heroes spoke in the film, the voices were also very low, you could not hear what they were saying.
