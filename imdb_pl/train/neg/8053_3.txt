In principle, this feature version of Dead Calm was promising. <br /> <br /> However, the inability of director Eric Red to convince a hurricane leads to a flood of continuity and lighting errors. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the viewer is more charmed by the bizarre weather effects than the intended plot. The interruptible secondary spokes are similarly distracting. <br /> <br /> Charles Dance, by doing schtick "inbred hardwoods", tries to save the film. But finally, get a good night's sleep ... and have more ham to start.
