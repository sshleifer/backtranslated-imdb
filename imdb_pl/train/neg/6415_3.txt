It was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. It was slow, boring, not scary, not funny, not dramatic, not funny. <br /> <br /> Sarah Michelle Gellar was on her old book empty words of fear and shock. She could not sell her character or anyone else in the picture. <br /> <br /> For those who thought that resentment was "okay", do not look at it unless you take pleasure in wasting your time and your life. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for free, so I do not want this movie to be like a racket from a guy who lost 8 bucks on a horrible movie. It was free, there was still nothing, I hated it. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
