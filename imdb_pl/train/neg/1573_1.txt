How this piece of rubbish was filmed is beyond me. The only actor known to me is Judge Reinhold, an excellent actor whose presence is only a justification for introducing him to production. <br /> <br /> I do not even think that it's worth nominating the "Rotten Tomato" Award, this movie really makes B movies a cinematic pleasure. A car going down the highway with the police and no one knows how to stop the car, yes, right. <br /> <br /> The scenario must be written on the back of a cardboard box with cigarettes. Most TV movies are horrible, but it redefines the word. Check the acting skills of the bridge operator, pure Oscar material.
