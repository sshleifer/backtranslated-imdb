The only frightening thing about this movie is the thought that whoever did it could create a sequel. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, The Tooth Fairy was simply terrible. It seemed like a badly played movie for children who made a mistake, with the "wizard of Oz" melting and ending happy kids, combined with the evil effects of gore and swearing. <br /> <br /> Half of the cast seems completely unnecessary, except to be comfortable there to somehow be murdered. The sister of two brothers, Cherise, reader of aura and Mrs. McDonald, do not make any sense in the film - they could have included them in the main thread for some interesting side stories, but apparently they could not care. People watching the movie know that the characters are on some bloody death scene, but give it a rest, at least TRY and have a light story for them. The story is generally poor, with irregular character behaviors that make you want everyone to be eaten by a witch. <br /> <br /> Add a weak storyline, and weak act together (children are especially wooden) and the movie ends with a total failure. If only MST3K could do it ...
