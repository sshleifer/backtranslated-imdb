It had a great cast with big stars like Tyrone Power, Henry Fonda, Randolph Scott, Nancy Kelly, Henry Hull and Brian Donlevey, as well as some lesser-known but less known names. He also had Technicolor, one of the few films made with him in 1939. <br /> <br /> Now the bad news ... unfortunately I can not say too much about this story. He introduced James' boys in a completely positive light ... and Hollywood has been doing it ever since. Why these criminals always turn out to be "good guys" are outside me. This film captivates them and has made their enemies - people turn - into malicious people. The latter was so exaggerated that he was ridiculous. This is the movie world for you: evil is good; good is bad. <br /> <br /> Hey Hollywood: here's the message - the boys from James were criminals! Really - look at it!
