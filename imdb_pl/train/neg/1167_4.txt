I really tried to like this movie, but in the end it just did not work. I saw most of Kitamura's results and found it to be very changeable. Alive, like all his films, has an interesting storyline, some nice sequences and a lot of creativity. However, these features are very painful in Alive. The story is cool, if not the entire original one, and could create a nice ace movie. Unfortunately, the stimulation is painfully slow, and the movie takes time to start working before it reaches a fairly predictable place. The action is almost satisfactory, the final fight is pretty cool, and earlier about OK. The earlier one is also disturbed by the excessive speed of the camera, which results in less coherence. There are several interesting visual effects and some interesting ideas in the dialogue, but the film is still going on. The characters are neither well-modeled nor well-preserved, and the setting and general colors are gray and boring. The movie is not completely awful and has some interesting things, maybe a reasonable use of the fast scroll button can improve it. After about twenty minutes of working time it can be quite a decent sci fi thriller. But the full movie is boring. Recommended only for very patient and determined fans of Kitumura.
