I was hoping that this movie would be a bit funny, like other genres of this genre. However, it was bad and I did not laugh too much. Maybe you can watch it on HBO, or if you have a free rental to waste and you need a movie to kill time. But I do not recommend paying to see it. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple and simple, maybe it could be funny if the script was better. Jason Lee can be hilarious, and he gets a few laughs here and there, but the movie falls. Just do not go and see this. The direction is poor, but from what it is, directing is not so important. I think its main disadvantage is that it's not just ridiculous. See something else, do not waste your time.
