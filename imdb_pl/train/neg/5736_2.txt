This is one of the worst movies I've seen in years !! You could randomly take 5 people off the streets and they could work better than anyone in this movie. An absolute waste of time to watch. I gave him only 2, I like Gory's movies, but it's just ordinary rubbish. Acting (and I use this term VERY loosely) is terrible, someone please tell me that the 5 main actors in this film are doing their first movie? Do not waste time watching this. The hostel was somehow a better movie. I can not believe that someone spent money on it, I hope that for producers it will cost only $ 50,000 - it looks like a school project created by children who have no idea. Did it even go to the cinema?
