The assumption of this expected continuation was really good and after the great success of the remake I expected honestly. <br /> <br /> The sad truth is that this movie is really absurd and inept. Situations are stupid and beyond reason, and acting is really terrible. <br /> <br /> This time there are no nice characters or violins in contrast to the remake. In addition, gore is not so abundant, and when it happens, it is really bad. <br /> <br /> Violence is minimal and it's a pity, because there are many arguments that make you think there is room for heavy violence. I mean the SWAT team, which is hunting for a family of mutant cannibals. You certainly expect something else! When I watched him in movies, I wanted to get my money back. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a clear example of how cast movies turn out to be messy and show poor quality in all aspects. <br /> <br /> A mess that appealed to remake fans like me. That is why sequels are never welcome; at least this movie is not as scary as the continuation of the 1985 original.
