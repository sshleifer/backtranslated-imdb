I caught it accidentally on t.v. showing - and I could not believe how awful the whole experience was. For comparison, the original "A Man Called Horse" was a binding spell, because he was interested in it all the time. But this nonsense - words fail. It was bad enough to have a "story" depicted with all the influence of a wet loaf of bread, but this mistake was compounded by the obvious lack of subtitles whenever the so-called "Sioux" spoke. For God's sake, did not the filmmakers find enough Indians of North America, who were also actors and actors who would act as "Indians" including farrago instead of cheaters they actually used? I also thought it was quite embarrassing when Richard Harris revolves around the neighborhood at the obvious request of the director standing just behind the camera, telling him to run and jump from pointless point A to pointless point B to come up with footage and minutes. Absolutely terrible in every way!
