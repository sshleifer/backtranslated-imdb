I just came back from a free show and I'm very happy that I did not pay to see this very sub-steam movie. The theater was full and the crowd was a mix of children and adults. It seemed that only kids were laughing at all jokes with pat and fart (good god who loved to hit those poor mice in the crotch!). The film is quite youthful, unintelligent, predictable and mostly annoying. The characters seem to be simply thrown together to fill the empty space, and the relationships between them seemed very forced, without any spells. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film is more or less average and nothing stands out. They did a decent job imitating the appearance of Wallace and Gromit's clay, but otherwise it is a very forgotten idea. <br /> <br /> Although I was really bored with the whole movie, I chuckled several times. This is not an absolute failure, but I definitely would not want to see it again. If you are a parent with children (and you do not care that your children see mindless cheap jokes), feel free to see them, but everyone else should not be wasting money.
