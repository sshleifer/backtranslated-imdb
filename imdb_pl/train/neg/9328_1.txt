I'm lucky! A week before I came to the shelves with films, I got the top of this pathetic "horror movie" from Artisan Entertainment. Let me tell you ... I rarely laughed in my life, just as I watched this horrible megabun flies off the tracks and steals the title of "the worst killer movie clown" ever made of the unbearable stupid fiasco of Full Moon KILLJOY (I'm sure many of us are horror fans suffered because of it!). was shot on a DV and does not really look that bad in terms of digital quality, but the boy never fails in any other area where it counts! <br /> <br /> The story (light and banal as it is) looks as follows: Executive director (Ken Hebert, who also wrote the script and co-produced with the director) accepts the skeptical collaborator Tracy (Amanda Watson) and horny marriage Mark and Susan (Hank Fields and Chris Buck) during a weekend trip to a (yawning) secluded cottage `12 miles' from the nearest town. Along the way they take a strange hitchhiker (Melissa Bale) to the bar and go to their destination, where a night-long tale of fire about a murderous pajat slipping through the same forest area becomes a reality when every vulgarity, pot-smokin ?? friends disappear one by one, with only mutilated dolls left to tell about their fate. <br /> <br /> The killer clown does not even appear in the movie until the end and it does not look like a demonic show on the video box (except that it is morbidly obese). Basically, he spends an hour in the woods, heals wood and rhymes in rhymes. I can not say enough bad things about the cast, especially two guys and hitchhikers who either run their bland dialogue with minimal enthusiasm or worry about the most inopportune times. It really does not help that the script is completely and completely devoid of uncertainty, originality, intelligence, overall consistency and humor. For a few days I could talk about how inept this movie is, how many continuity errors are and how the whole production is amateurish, but I just nod, indicating that the whole package is quite stormy, including the Boy-This- Dry way. <br /> <br /> Please note that the film was released here in the US as SICK (SERIAL INSANE CLOWN KILLER). It is currently cataloged under the (original title) GRIM WEEKEND. <br /> <br /> Score: 1 in 10
