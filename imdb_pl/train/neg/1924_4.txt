DR. SEUSS 'AS GRINCH STOLE BOÅ»E NARODZENIE / (2000) ** (out of four) <br /> <br /> If you want to see a holiday movie that will inspire your seasonal spirits and continue the traditional tale of Dr. Seuss, do not look "Dr. Seuss" How the Grinch Stole Christmas. " If you're old enough to read this review, you're probably too old to enjoy this movie. It contains many colors, a creative production design and an ingenious set of costumes and costumes, joyful cargo noises, and characters are created to look like real inhabitants of the fictitious Whoville village. Unfortunately, the positive elements of the film end here; the rest of the production is nothing but an excuse for Jim Carrey to fool around on the screen, giving a devilish smile, and at the same time going through a too-wide scenario, without much to do. <br /> <br /> Many people recognize this story about how grinch stole Christmas from Whoville, so I will not waste time writing a detailed summary so that you can read. I will say, however, that the story of the film is performed in three main acts; the development of a smile and scenery, the Whoville festival and the vision of Dr. Seuss, who robs Who's of their Christmas. There are many famous names in loans, but no familiar faces. Like in "Battlefield Earth", I just do not understand why producers hired expensive actors just to protect their identity from unrecognizable makeup and costumes. Regardless, he is Molly Shannon SNL as Betty Lou, wife of Bill Irwin, then plays Lou Lou, father of little Cindy Lou, played by Taylor Momsen. Jeffrey Tambor is the mayor of Whoville, Anthony Hopkins lends his loud voice to the narrator of the film, and Christine Baranski is a lonely lost lover Grinch. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers are trying to bring originality to the story, adding unnecessary plot lines and focusing too much on the small Cindy Lou. The script by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman is just like everywhere in a movie landscape; director Ron Howard does not focus on anything, and the scenario is predictable, too broad and imagined. The only character who has any distinction here is Grinch himself, all other characters are puppets of the plot, shapeless and uninteresting. Dialogue is over-zealous and too banal to be pathetic. Example-Grinch: Oh, the Who-manity! <br /> <br /> The redeeming factors of the film go to the talented stage designer Michael Corenblith, the costume designer Rita Ryack and the extensive make-up department. "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" is a very good looking production. The scenes and atmosphere created by the filmmakers are detailed and imaginative; it's like the audience is visiting the world like in a dream. The people in Whoville are plastered with makeup, so much so that we can not tell the actor to recite a humorless line. Although dazzling, I really can not boast of performances because they are already expected due to the expensive technical department that takes their place. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey is one of the actors I can talk about. His performance is what almost destroys the film itself. He is too egotistical like Grinch, too exaggerated and comical to make history almost recognizable as Seuss's work. Surprisingly, although there are a few funny moments because of some cunningly cunning sequences, there is no laughter from Jim Carry's silly stupidity. It's almost as if the movie was written specifically for Carry so that he could overcome his role. This factor leads the film to a wild but brainless comedy that is just a shadow of the original Christmas classic "How the Grinch Stole Christmas." <br /> <br /> After this film, historians should check the coffin. The late author, Dr. Seuss, could fall over in the grave. <br /> <br />
