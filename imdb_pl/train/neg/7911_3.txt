It was not remarkable enough to be really awful, it was just incredibly bad. This story was not half bad, but the execution was simply terrifying. <br /> <br /> At the beginning she moved too fast to emotionally get involved in what was going on. It was wrong. The dialogue was so flawless, simply flat and boring. <br /> <br /> And the heroes, mutilated, made Deadpool boring. How the hell do you bore Deadpool? He was not even funny. He was not crazy. He was just an annoying guy with a few swords that he could not even use properly. <br /> <br /> Gambit was boring. And since when did he have telecoms, let the cards just float and fly, or super strength to jump hundreds of feet into the air? And what the hell was all these stupid helicopter movements? That is, we know that they are mutants, but they still exist in the field of physics. The round stick is not the edge of a helicopter, you can not fly quickly by spinning the super-duper. Which Gambit would not be able to do. Neither Deadpool, especially when used as a replacement for a real combat choreography. <br /> <br /> And this movie is proof that wire work should only be used by combat coordinators who know they are doing WTH and know better than using it in everyone. single. shot. as a replacement for a real battle choreography. <br /> <br /> Three of the most physical warriors in Marvel's comics (Logan, Creed and Wilson) and one of the worst combat choreographies I've ever seen in the latest movie memory. It was as if the stunt coordinator shrugged and left everything to the special effects guys. <br /> <br /> And then you had an explosion, with all those mutants who did nothing. Even the mutants who were shown in their cells to have powers (nice to see a Quicksilver nod), did everything when they got out. Only Emma-really-lame-for-this-movie-Frost and Cyclops did something. <br /> <br /> And since when was Logan so cute? And stupid: "The bullet will take away his memory." Do not you think that Xavier and X-Men would notice big bullet holes in the adamantium skull when they were X-rayed? I was sorry about the man Liev Schrieber who brought the good Sabretootha, considering the script. He made one of Marvel's more simple super villains feel real. But he could not save the movie from his own epic lameness. <br /> <br /> Seriously, it was the "daredevil" sucking level. A decent story, good actors, absolutely horrible execution.
