This movie was really terrible. Acting was the worst! It was worse than a student movie. Super tacky and I think the worst actor was an old lady. At first I thought it was an old movie. Then I remembered that it was not an excuse! I saw older movies with better acting and such. <br /> <br /> Music was terrible. It was really uncertain. The editing was poor (most of the dialog was synchronized.) <br /> <br /> In general, the film does not even deserve 1. I only watched it because I was so bored and the movie was not very entertaining. It was just ridiculous. The left toe of my deceased grandmother can make a better movie than this one.
