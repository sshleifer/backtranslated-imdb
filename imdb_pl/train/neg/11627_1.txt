I wonder who was responsible for this mess. Jokes would not work on Gilligan Island. If it was in the series, would it be a joke about Auschwitz, would Eva have to replace her oven, just to let Adolf suggest a genre that can hold 50? Another post compared this program to I love Lucy. The problem is that Lucille Ball was a genius in physical comedies and bizarre situations, and this mess was just badly done and offended my intelligence. <br /> <br /> After the destruction of the Nazis and the number of people killed, I thought that the very concept of a comedy about Hitler would seem repulsive, and most normal people would kill this concept before any episodes were produced.
