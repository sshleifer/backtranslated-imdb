Quite what producers of this terrifying adaptation tried to do is impossible to understand. <br /> <br /> A group of the best actors in the main cast (with a few notable exceptions) who give quite good performances. Penelope Keith is perfect as aunt Louise and equally good is Joanna Lumley as Diana. Everything copes well with the scripts they received. <br /> <br /> So much for good. The average would include sets. Nancherrow does not look like the house described in the book, although it's odd that the house they use for the Dower House looks very similar. It is clear that the Dower House is much too big. In later parts, writers decided to bring the whole story back to the UK, probably to save money, although with a bit of imagination I have no doubt that they could recreate Ceylon. <br /> <br /> Now to bad. Scenario. It is such a terrifyingly bad adaptation that it is difficult to find words to condemn it. Edward is not dying in the battle for England, but he is going through blinded. She makes a short look and then commits suicide - why? Loveday changed from a young woman, completely in love with Gusia, into a reasonable farmer's wife who can give up the love of her life with just a tear (less emotional than a Short Meeting). Gus, a man in love and passionately in love, is ready to give up his love without complaint. Walter (Mudge in the book) turns from a shallow unfaithful husband into a devoted family. Jess is mentally changed, a young woman who does not speak. Aunt Biddy still has a problem with drinking, but now without any justification. The Dower House is occupied by the army for no apparent reason except for a very short scene from Jess, who is afraid of armed soldiers. While the Miss Mortimer breasts are absolutely amazing, I could not see how their display moved the plot forward several times. Delightfully named Nettles become mundane Dobson. The word limit prevents you from continuing the list. <br /> <br /> There is a continuation (which I lost interest in watching after this nonsense) and I wonder if changes have been made to create a story on the topic. It is hard to imagine that Rosamunde Pilcher would approve of this grotesque perversion of her book; it probably lost control when the rights were acquired.
