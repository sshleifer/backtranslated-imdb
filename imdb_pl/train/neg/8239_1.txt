It's really the scariest movie I've ever seen. I just have no idea how anyone dares put it on the release. <br /> <br /> Production standards are terrible. There is no pretense in cinematography here. Working with cameras, scripts, acting and sound are incredibly stupid. I think there is a conspiracy, but you can do it in 10 minutes, saving us time to watch. Hysterical neurotic girls in the center of this song have no credibility. <br /> <br /> I would urge no one to spend time or money on this title. It's really awful. <br /> <br /> JDD - December 14, 2008
