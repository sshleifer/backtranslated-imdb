I watched this movie because I liked the conspiracy, a group of strangers are kept in captivity, trying to find out how they are connected. <br /> <br /> Of course, the first (and the best) influence on the scenery and premise obviously. I saw the film and although there was not much action, the story moved at a relatively good pace. <br /> <br /> It was a comedy that bounced off the character of two quarrelsome "alpha men" and it was a welcome surprise (anyway) to see how Melissa Joan Hart did not quit playing. <br /> <br /> Several things have failed me personally; 1. The pedophile was over-characterized, which made him involved in everything from children to dead bodies. <br /> <br /> 2. MJH's line that her policeman "got her into it" when he was actually the least deserved person to be there, did not know that he contributed to the events leading to their acquisition. <br /> <br /> 3. Conclusion ... What movie ends in the middle of something that's happening? There was no resolution, no hanger for the cliffs, no obvious end ... it just ends. <br /> <br /> And for that I dropped two stars from my rating. The first 2 points that I would allow to slide, but not the end!
