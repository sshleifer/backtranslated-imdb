My original review of this movie is simply the word sh * t written 2000 times. Although it was very accurate criticism, I felt that my review should be a bit more descriptive. <br /> <br /> I'll start with the main actress; her expression does not change once in this film, it does not show fear, happiness or depression. Her skills in body language come down to throwing her eyes left and right and look as if she did not know her on the lift. It's an emotionless shell that I'm guessing she had too much Botox. Her lack of facial expressions throughout the film is, however, persecuted by a pathetic romance with the main actor who seems out of nowhere and makes them go to the beach and fall in love within a few hours of meeting. The main actor, whose hair needs more attention than he was, was mediocre at best and never once did I feel really threatened. <br /> <br /> The only thing that leads from hideous acting is directing, plot and inaccuracies in the story. I've seen tampon ads with a larger structure than this movie. It's not development, it's just saying and doing things that I could never believe a real person would do. <br /> <br /> This film would not be bad if he tried to be crap as the target is writhing in the plane, but it was so hard to be a serious action, that I could not even laugh. I believe I now have a brain tumor from watching this movie and coming up with different ways to use this budget and the cg team to create something much better. If I bought it on DVD, I would blow the DVD to pieces, burn it and let it dissolve in hydrochloric acid for good. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM!
