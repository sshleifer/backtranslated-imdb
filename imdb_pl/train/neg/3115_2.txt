I rarely write a negative review for this site, but this time I felt compliant. Night Listener is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> In this movie, nothing happened, what ever - I did not care about any of the characters, I did not buy on the entire story of the type of mystery did not care how it ended ... nothing. <br /> <br /> There is no comedy, action, emotions, tension, nothing. The most important attractions are (no spoilers - there is nothing to spoil): a man climbing through the window, barking dog outside the hotel room, car passing through uneven ground and buzzing truck to the corner <br /> <br /> I really liked "One Hour Photo "and hoped for a similar amazing role with Williams, but unfortunately it was very disappointed. What's more disappointing, I'm sure there is a good movie somewhere - the idea was interesting and I should have sympathized with the heroes, but it just did not work for me. <br /> <br /> I could even give him 1/10, but this result is reserved for the remake of The Producers
