Why, oh, why can no one make a decent movie from a legendary tale? This is the second adaptation of "Beowulf" in which I have been disappointed for a year. But I must say that the previous version ("Beowulf and Grendel", with Gerald Butler in the lead role) was much better. This one was just a bit disappointing. This is a mess !!! <br /> <br /> What really pissed me off? Were they useless elements of the story, which they added for no particular reason (human victims? Senseless interest in love?), Is bad CGI or inconsequence of heroes or not inspired acting? Even worse was the way the beautiful Marina Sirtis looked so horrible !!! And do not even talk about this funny crossbow? <br /> <br /> And why they constantly reminded us that Beowulf had the strength of 30 men, and yet he never showed the slightest trace of such power throughout the film. Both monsters he fought were throwing him around, relying on his helpers to save his bacon. Even when he hit the arrogant prince, he did not knock him down. He was too dependent on the weapon. Beo-wimp is more similar. Certainly not a powerful Beowulf epic poem! <br /> <br /> I would like to finish it positively, but I can not really think of any of them. I can only say that if you ever read "Beowulf", you will be disappointed with this grim, inaccurate pretext for adaptation!
