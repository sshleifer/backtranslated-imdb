This film has a very Broadway feel - background, acting, "noise" - and yet that's all it has. Some "sense" of Broadway without a bang. <br /> <br /> The movie is at a slow pace, the picture is chaotic, the song "pops" on you so that you suddenly remember that it is a musical. <br /> <br /> Disappointing: Sinatra <br /> <br /> Unbearable: Sinatra's fiance --- for sure, the tone and accent of her voice were unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Acceptable: "I remember the numbers on my cube" <br /> <br /> The delight: Brando's subtle singing (very biased!) <br /> <br /> Surprise: how much Jean Simmons looks like like Vivien Leigh in her scenes in Havana. It's bone structure! How I would kill to see Miss Leigh in a role that once again challenged Brando.
