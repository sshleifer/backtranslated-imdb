I was very suspicious of the ideas presented in this film, but being relatively unaware of quantum physics, in addition to what I mentioned from the excellent "Short History of almost Everything" and what I managed to strangle in "Brief History of Time," it sounded interesting sometimes. However, the obvious nonsense of Indian history, who were unable to see the ships of researchers, was ridiculous. I really started to doubt what was shoveling at the moment, but then the clinker was to discover that one of the speakers actually "redirects" a freak named "Ramtha" who completely disrupted the application for me. <br /> <br /> What a waste of two hours.
