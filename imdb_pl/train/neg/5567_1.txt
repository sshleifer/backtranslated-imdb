Okay, I hired this movie because of the director ... he did some interesting movies in the past (if you have not seen Waxork, you're missing out on some fun). In any case, I had doubts about this movie from the very beginning, but decided to suck it and take a look. It's bad. Very bad. If you have not seen the movie and do not worry about spoilers, read on. First of all, the old saying "You can not judge a book by its cover" applies. The box for this movement seems to indicate that Jill is a stone fox with long hair with highlights. The back of the box has a cool shot of Jill with red skin and a few other shots. The description makes you want to rent a movie because it sounds good. You start to watch him and you suddenly find out that the movie is being played out (inexplicably) in 1977. Jill is a full dog who is not a girl on the cover. The film is not as predictable as it might seem ... and it is not a good thing. Characters do so many stupid things without a little motivation ... watching is embarrassing. 10 minutes before the end of the movie Dolph and another lady have sex for no reason. Besides, what sense Dolph had to kill the other woman in cold blood that helped him. Anthony Hickox, the director, should see the stinker when he reads the script. If he was set up in the underworld of the new millennium and made half-intelligent figures decent. Setting it in the 70's makes no sense and has no effect on history. Avoid this!
