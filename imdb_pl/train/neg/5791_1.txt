As a native film professor, I can honestly say that this is probably one of the worst films with native content I've ever watched. I'd rather get a root canal than watch this movie again. The use of stereotypes, non-creative attempts to use fragments of traditional coyote stories and poor work with cameras have only worsened due to unconventional plot lines and bad scripts. The writer and director showed the worst elements of a colonized approach to presenting indigenous people and communities. If this person is indigenous, he must go home and apologize to everyone he knows to be an apple and for the internationalized racism and weak sense of humor they have developed. If this person is non-native, he must seriously re-examine his white privilege and ask himself whether he displays uncharted, unintentional racism or is intentionally ignorant. I just hope that the indigenous actors in this movie had a good time and at least got money for their efforts. If you want to see good home movies, check out: Christmas in the clouds, Dance Me Outside, Medicine River, PowWow Highway, Smoke Signals ... just to name a few.
