If I was not forced to watch it for professional reasons, I would never exceed the first 10 minutes. And even then I admit that I quickly scrolled the parts. The film version from '63 was much better in every respect. Yes, I read that he is more faithful to the original art, but how wise it was for the writer to change the script in '63! It's long, stretches, the songs that are in this version, not the film version, are boring and unimaginable. The "Kids" version in the "63" version was very funny and was a real classic of the sarcastic humor of parents. In this version, Kim is much too old, Conrad is * absolutely horrible * (when someone stripped his shirt, I closed in disgust ... the director of this version has no idea what is sexy). This Conrad can not dance, he can not sing (he can not even stay in the melody) and he is simply repulsive. If Elvis Presley really was, his career would end before it began. As for the other actors, I was still waiting for Aleksander's wig to fall as she danced, and Daly completely stopped acting as Mama. See the performance of Stapleton in the film version to see the same role that someone who understands the comic time has done. This television version is nothing but a total waste of time.
