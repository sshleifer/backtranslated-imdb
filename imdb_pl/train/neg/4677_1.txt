What a load of leftist Hollywood farm. This film glorifies the rebellion as bold and noble when it comes to pacifist principles. The fable ends with a pacifist character, played by Danzel Washington, advancing on his betrayal. What are these Hollywood tools? Is it still viable for McCarthyism? <br /> <br /> If I sound cynical, it's because I have enough movies that have a political program. Military brass in this film is portrayed as what else? Gung-ho war warriors. Sounds familiar? Have you ever seen a movie in which the CIA or any government agency is not bad? Think about it. Once again, the Crimson Tide highlights this point. Hackman's character, U-boat captain, Ramsey, behaves like a crazy madman to the end, when, of course, he recovers, completes 360, resigns from bloodlust, suggests the promotion of treacherous Ron Hunter and regrets retreating from the service. The guy is rebelling, he's in charge of your boat, exposing the US to a serious risk of a nuclear attack, and you're promoting it ?? What a nonsense!
