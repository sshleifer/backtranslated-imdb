Heather Graham could not play a convincing lesbian if her life depended on it. Who are the film producers? ABSOLUTE WORST, the most UNREALISTIC film that I've seen for as long as I can remember. This movie is so bad that I felt compelled to register with IMDb and make sure that the rating of this "movie" falls. <br /> <br /> omg I'm Heather Graham, I just kissed a drunk cane, so while she's faint, I WILL REALLY walk around my room for HOURS asking myself a feverish question "WHAT I WAS ?!" Jesus Jesus , cope and grow up ... fondness for idiot producers ... and although I am in it, instead of the movie it's a pitiful excuse for the upcoming story, maybe it would be better to focus the story on a character who is mentally unstable. .. how is your so-called "lesbian" figure ... in the end I know that for the first time I had gay sex, when I left the next morning I jumped in the sky in excitement in the middle of the street ... honestly b * b, take a hug .. . <br /> <br /> WHAT ALREADY! and please note that there are many other flaws and frighteningly stupid aspects of this poor movement, but I'm tired of thinking about it. Most importantly, if you're a smart person, you hate this movie, and if you're not a smart person, you'll love it ... it's that simple.
