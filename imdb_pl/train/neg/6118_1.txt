This is not a very good story about the Tarzan epic. There was only one reason for this movie. John Derek wanted to show off his beautiful wife! Because Derek in '10' was at least a humorous movie and was the reason for nudity and sex. This movie is nothing but soft porn. If you do it, go well, then quickly forward and skip the rest! This movie (like Bolero) was again a vehicle for Bo Derek to show her horrible acting. She is undoubtedly a beautiful woman, but her poster is more exciting than this movie! Richard Harris was a better actor than this; it was one of his few mistakes! do not waste time on this movie ... instead buy a book.
