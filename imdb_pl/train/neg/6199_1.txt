First technical inspection. The script is so slow that in fact it is a 25-minute story passed to 1 hour 40 minutes. The dialogue is so flat and truly one-dimensional. Acting is pathetic, it seems that they really picked up classmates to read a few lines from the idiots' table. As for the whole "point" of the story, namely "war is bad" (oh, there is a shock!), It really does not exist. Without the scene "Let yourself be shocked and get a big advertisement" no one would talk about this film. It's so bad that it really bothers me to think about what better things can be used for money. Believe me, I've seen the bad movies of the "new emperor", but I can say that at least they were well done and well done while the camera wobbled during the two scenes! Read all other reviews - avoid at all costs and do not talk about it.
