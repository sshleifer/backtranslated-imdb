I was so disgusted with this movie that I felt obliged to warn others. This film has no history, no plot, no trace of purpose. The film begins after the standard introduction to the movie "Let yourself be afraid", which has so far been used by every film observer. So we can completely ignore the beginning. Soon, we're introduced to the main actress and from that moment it becomes clear to everyone that you just wasted your hard-earned money and it would be better to watch statically. (Unless you've seen white noise - EEK) Acting is IMPRESSION and everyone should return to the traveling pantomime from where they came. Having said that, even the best actors in the world would have a hard time watching this movie remotely. Their weak performances only contribute to the disaster. Meaningless violence and what I can only assume is the written word of another spoiled "eccentric" writer who is probably considered an artist, resulted in a movie that tests your patience. It was only when my fellow observer turned to me and said, "We watched it for 45 minutes," I realized that this film is as thin and tasteless as a cup of tea without a teabag. Apparently something was missing and unfortunately it was not an audience. Instead of suggesting what's missing in this video, let me tell you what it has: Stupid blonde (surprise surprise), Victim, bad guy-monster, about 2 minutes of plot, which is stretched out for hours, days, weeks, months .. and loans. <br /> <br /> Do you want a silver lining? Well, the blonde is a little saucy looking at some scenes, but expect her to want to see her face torn off for the rest of the movie!
