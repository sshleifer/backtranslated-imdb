The only reason to see this movie is the great performance of Thoma-Adcox Hernandez, which is not used in the film in the movie. As usual, Tom Villard is good too. Otherwise it is c ** p. Possesor does not even exist, how magically changes the letters on the theatrical tent to spell "Possessor"? Lame.
