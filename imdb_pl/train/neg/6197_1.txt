At the end of the movie, I asked myself: "Is this the worst movie I've ever seen, is it the worst movie I've ever seen?" The answer is ... Actually, after watching this movie and reflecting on its meaning, you simply can not find any meaning and you can only remember two rape scenes that are incredibly brutal and useless. It seems to me that the director tried to put this question to the head of the crowd: "what are such crimes compared to the horrors of war and extermination?". because I noticed that these two horrible scenes are directly related to the war and its horrors (during the first scene a rapist can be raped here, while one of President Bush's speeches about the need to start a war in Iraq and the second scene after the images of three criminals who hear they put a sword into a woman's vagina, there is a directly archival photo of World War II, but in fact, I could not really think about the relative weight of two different expressions of human horror, I was too shocked by what I just saw and felt (sorry for bad english)
