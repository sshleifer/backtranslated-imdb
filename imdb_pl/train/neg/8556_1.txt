OK, I like the idea of ​​the movie a bit. I am in a demographic age and identify with some stories. Even sometimes a tacky and senseless dialogue seems half-realistic, and in another film one could forgive him. <br /> <br /> I try not to destroy this movie as much as anyone else, but it is not so easy when the filmmakers do not try. <br /> <br /> The editing in this movie is horrible! Probably the worst editing I've ever seen in a movie! There are things you do not have to go to film school to learn, bending over a good assembly is not one of them, but the identification of the bad is. <br /> <br /> Also a shot ... Oh my God's shots, just awful! I can not even delve into the details, but sometimes we see random things popping up, and this, combined with editing, will give you the most painful experience while watching movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is created on low or no budget with 4 casts and the crew is not an excuse. I've seen short videos on youtube with much more artistic integrity! Joe, Greta, I do not know what the hell you think, but this movie is nothing but the masturbation of both your ego. You should be ashamed! In conclusion, this movie is similar to how a really lazy amateur porn movie will be filled with 3 or 4 bad sex scenes separated by long boring conversations and one disgusting masturbation scene. If it's not your thing, avoid it at all costs!
