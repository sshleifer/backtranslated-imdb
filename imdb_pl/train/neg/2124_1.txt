This film concerns the story of Eddy mentioned in the title and his return to old friends in the coastal community. The plot engages a group of friends when it comes to light that Eddy has gone as a means to deal with the death of a friend in which he feels somehow responsible. However, this is irrelevant because the choices made in production are very weak and not fully implemented. Scenarios do not always have to be "talkative", but they should at least help in the development of history. Here, one line of rehearsals, such as "he just took off" or "I know you do not have love in your heart", simply invokes the time worthy of the audience. Also every time the writer feels self-conscious, where to go next, he interrupts the musical montage of the hero walking through the fields to the music indie mood. Talk about hard attempts. If you are interested in a good movie, a kind that gives quality and content over style, then this is not a movie for you.
