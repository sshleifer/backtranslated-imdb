I am a fan of Batman's film and television. I loved the show (new and old) and loved all the movies. But this movie is not as great as some people hoped. In my opinion, this is a big disappointment. I think the problem was that he did not have a drama. Batman: Mask of the Phantasm and Batman Beyond: Return of The Joker have had a lot of drama. and Batman and Mr. Freeze: Sub Zero also had a drama. I also think that this movie will be released for Batman. The only scene that seems a bit dark is a great fight with Bane at the end. Anyway, this is the Batman movie. But I just rent her.
