It must have been one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I am 64 years old and I am a football fan. I was expecting to see a football movie. About 10 minutes later I started to wonder how such a bad movie (especially acting) could get to the theater. About halfway, I whispered to my husband that it was awful and explained the facts about the movie to me. Although I was a little offended (and I can see how some might be VERY offended if they were not Christians), when they were preached in the cinema, it was not that great. It was, however, a great matter to submit to such predictability and unrealistic behavior, and above all the quality of acting. It is an appropriate movie for a church trip, but it is shown in the church, not in the theater. Do I go to church? Yes. Do I want to go to church when I'm in a movie? No. Would I recommend this movie? Absolutely not!!!
