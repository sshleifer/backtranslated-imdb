This is one of the worst movies I've seen. The only positive thing I can say was that it was so bad that it seemed comical. First of all, there is no story. The actors seem to read the pages and do the stupidest things. Such as being hunted by dead people, but wanting to go out and look for friends. Also the zombies were awful, not as close as any other Romero job that gets a plug-in for the movie. And the most stupid part of everything was showing the video game's flashes in the action sequences. If you do not get into a video game, it's zombie shooting. What's more, all 20 people know how to use automatic weapons and hit the target without aiming at the weapon. And the way people die is so stupid. It's as if they run out of ammo, so stand nearby and wait for the jump. And when he was trapped in front of the house, they ran out of ammunition, instead of shooting at the door, so stupid. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERSION: If any of these actors appear in another movie, he was blessed with a second chance. By far the worst movie I've seen for years. Film B on Cinemax is better.
