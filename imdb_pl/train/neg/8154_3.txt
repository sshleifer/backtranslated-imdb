A long list of "big" names in this film (including the ubiquitous John Mills) did not lead me to such an extent that I could not judge the film based on its actual advantages. It is full of stereotypes, caricatures and standard scenes, from a modest hero from an aerial ace to a loud mocking leaflet. The musical piece was such that at some point, about an hour before the end, I thought the movie ended: a loud, growing crescendo, a great bloom and end, and then silence, but then the movie was continued! I did not find any real plot, accidental writing, but elegantly oppressed uniforms and a nice Jean Simmons (work in front of my nose) with thrilling little shit. I can not say that this picture has any of the ingredients that make the movie great. I found this maudlin, sad and small.
