After reading all the enthusiastic reviews about this movie and a few that give it so. In the end, I decided to throw in my priceless pennies. I agree that if it was not for Lauren Lewis and Chris Ferry, it would be a disaster. Filmed in Mariette OH. north of Dogpatch, where all real talent escaped south of I-77 years ago, at least as far as a gas tank would allow. I got a giggle from reviewers who subtly say they cereal a little better than most, claiming they were following the plot without alleged confusion. This little story of the Crook brothers is like an old album with no mention in it. As an American I understand the difficulties faced by filmmakers Ind. A trip to Romania would certainly destroy the budget. Let's face it, the whole movie was a loop at Claire's gas station, Claire at the roadside, Claire under the stands, Claire at home, Claire at the cornfield, Claire at school. Claire here and Claire there. It was almost monotonous and it would have been if she had not been the best actor in the cast. Josh and Jeff have to make a living, but they do not write a two-page script and change it in an hour, twenty minutes. Before you write another scenario of dreaming ghosts, watch the episode or two of the ghost conjurer or something and get some background. All the cast, with the exception of the above and a few others, were involved in their first and last movie. There is also the appearance of the co-director of Jeff, just like in all his films. Like Alfred Hitchcock, what? One of the things the film was talking about was that the operator had the fixation on derri√®re Lauren Lewis. Well, with all the sarcasm that is now happy, I still recommend a movie for a horror lover to see this young actress during her career (I hope) and that Chris Ferry gained the status of a black character worth watching.
