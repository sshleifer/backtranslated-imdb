I once promised that I would never leave a movie (personal policy that caused me to suffer from various types of dreek, such as Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact) - but Mr. Seidl almost succeeded. Hundstage was really a terrible experience. Anyone who sees this movie will think that the Austrians are an unhappy, pathetic group of late. It shows a world in which love and humanity do not exist, a world in which people humiliate one another only for one reason - to distract attention from their own miserable existence. Choosing a documentary style with unprofessional actors (most of them reminiscent of the imagination of the Austrian illustrator shocking Deix), director Seidl wants us to believe that this is a real life in the suburbs of Austria (Western Europe?). The viewer faces images of sexual orgies, violence against women and people with disabilities, madness and degradation. But this is not social criticism. It is simply a shock without any aesthetic value. Instead, you get bad acting, bad cinematography, bad filming. If someone needs such a movie to realize that there is something wrong in our society, that person had to go through life with his eyes closed. This is pseudo-social criticism of a blacksmith's hammer. And he looks at people in a patently condescending manner. It shows ugly people - this is not the reason why I hate it. But it presents the average people in an ugly, misanthropic manner. And that's why this movie is really mean.
