Film and acting are not bad, and Jay Hernandez does a good job playing Calito Brigante, but the movie forgets that it is to be a prequel to the hit movie. The creators of this prequel apparently did not watch the original road of Carlito, at least they did not care about continuity. This movie is a prequel, which means that the original movie has already set a story for us and this movie should end where the original starts or at least lead to it. In this movie, none of Carlito's old friends from the original did not even mention them. Luis Guzman, Pachanga in the original, is in the movie, but plays a completely different character. The original takes place in 1975, and the prequel takes place in 1969-70. Given that this movie is less than 5 years old, do not you think that one of your longtime friends Carlito would appear? In the original, Carlito is released from prison after spending 5 years in prison. It's only a few months between the end of the prequel and the beginning of the original! *** Semi Spoiler *** We know from the beginning of the original, Carlito spent 5 years in prison, so when the prequel gives us this Hollywood happy ending, it is an insult to the intelligence of the original fans. What happened to Gail? This lack of continuity caused that this film went directly to the video release.
