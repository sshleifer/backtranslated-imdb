This Worldwide was a version of a cheap man, which NWA with Jim Crockett Junior and Jim Crockett Promotions returned in the 80s at the localized stations "Big 3" during the Saturday morning / afternoon madness wrestling. When Ted Turner got his unsuccessful version of NWA Crockett, he changed it into World Championship Wrestling and began removing all NWA references. NWA World Wide and NWA Pro Wrestling have been renamed the WCW logo and retired from the road to Disney / MGM Studios in Orlando, Florida, to eventually become nothing more than just shows for Nitro, Thunder and Saturday Night WCW. Worldwide officially was the last WCW program in Turner, which took place over the weekend with the acquisition of WCW from Vince McMahon and WWF. Currently, the entire NWA World Wide / WCW World Tape Archive, along with the entire NWA / WCW Video Tape Library, was generally located in the vaults of the WWE Headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.
