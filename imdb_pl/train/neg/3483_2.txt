Surviving Christmas (2004) Ben Affleck, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Catherine O 'Hara, Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, Jennifer Morrison, Udo Kier, D: Mike Mitchell. Abandoned by his girlfriend, hectic yuppie does not want to be alone on Christmas, so he decides to return to his boyhood, imposing on a dysfunctional family who now lives there and bribes them to pose as his family. The nasty and one-dimensional appearance of Affleck, which mainly works with a flashy smile, makes his character stand out as an unbalanced mind, but Gandolfini and O 'Hara breathe some life into this mess. Even for farce, her stupidity is huge, there is no sense from stage to scene, and her sentimental messages are just as false as Affleck's smile. 91 minutes, rating PG-13. * Â½
