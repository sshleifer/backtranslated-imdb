"Masters of Horror" turned out to be a bad arena for "episodes of news" and although one can determine the specific case of "Screwfly Solution" by Joe Dante (one of the best episodes of the series, period), most efforts to do so met with a heavy anvil and impressive ( nothing scares a horror more than a soap dish). And "Pro-Life" simply combines reactionary views with ultra-violence; young Angelique (Caitlin Wachs), seen running through the forest, is almost hit by 2 doctors (Mark Feuerstein and Emmanuelle Vaugier), who are just going to work in a local (and isolated) abortion clinic. Father Angelique, Dwayne (Ron Perlman), is a cold, extreme right saint who will do anything to stop her daughter from abortion. If nothing else, "Pro-Life" has accumulated some hype for its controversial issue, but John Carpenter treats the whole venture with surprising indifference - it seems even less interested in making a film than the script itself (which is indeed weak); slow stimulation does not cause tension and simply slows down the plot. Even when Dwayne and his sons storm the clinic by firing a firearm, it is a stunning event; later, when the doctor is tortured by "abortion of men", the scene ends up as unreasonable and unnecessary - an effort to cut down the recorded movie. Poor performances (Perlman is unfortunately wasted) become the result of the script, and Carpenter's direction seems exhausted, as if "Pro-Life" was the source of his next hot meal. Before a spider-spider with a human head and a guy in a monster's latex costume hangs around the corridors, you just have to think about what the minds of this mess are thinking ...
