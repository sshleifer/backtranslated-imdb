My goodness is this movie bad. I was completely misled by my local film review because it is garbage subject to certification. Yes, yes, good guys wear white, bad guys wear black ... and good guys always win. Now go home and hug your children and feel how good you felt in Hollywood. Blech! I can not believe that this dead brain was created by Wes Craven. I'm guessing he needed some money to pay off his mortgage so he made that dung piece. It's a kind of production that makes everyone who watches movies regularly believe they can do it better or better than an experienced director. <br /> <br /> You see, a bad guy wants a sweet girl who loves her daddy, do something wrong with IL or hurt your daddy. But being a Mrs. All-American girl next door, we know she'll save the day and beat the bad ones ... the end. Girl power ROCKS. <br /> <br /> Well, only an idiot will find this fun ... "rollercoaster ride", let alone fresh or new. All the "super-dupes" reviews you see on this site come from industry hacks that make money from doing it, pay off the favor, or sell their souls to the devil. <br /> <br /> Rachael McAdams is beautiful ... yes, that's it. It's not a good performance, it's not terrible ... it's just sweet. She would have to show all the mass of her skin to save this movie. It is not hard enough to be a good woman leading the campaign. <br /> <br /> Cillian Murphy was at least satisfactory in 28 days. But here he plays a stupid villain who pretends to be wise. He gets his ass kicked back and forth by 5'5 '' McAdams, because she was a cheerleader ... and a hockey player ... and I'm sure he owns all Tae Bo tapes .... so she should be able to dig shit from an international terrorist to rent. I would not trust him to steal a pack of gum from 7-11. <br /> <br /> You see, this movie was made before, unless they did it right. Go again to rent any of Die Hard movies. You have distress in danger, international terrorists, with the exception of characters who are more likeable and trustworthy, and the bad guys are more competent and interesting. I just do not understand how Hollywood can still do such nonsense, as if they did not pay attention to the right models that can easily be copied. No wonder that movie revenues are falling. <br /> <br /> Throw 6 $ down the toilet and save 2 hours of your life you will never come back. <br /> <br /> ciao, FreddyShoop
