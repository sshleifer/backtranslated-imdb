WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS <br /> <br /> A few years ago I was able to see the first five films in this series, and planned to review the whole series of Elm St. However, only after two years I can not remember them to do it? I think they could not make a big impression. From what I remember, some sequels ?? Dream Warriors in particular ?? it was not as bad as it often turns out, even though the original was not classic. In general, the predictability of the premise (if people fall asleep, are murdered in dreams), is not suitable for narrative tension. But although I do not remember much of the first five movies, I know they have never explored the depths of Dead Freddy. <br /> <br /> The indication of how Freddy was public at the moment, can be judged by the fact that the film was only promoted to the death of the character. The fact that the conclusion of the film is not even hidden, but in fact the whole purpose of the film is illustrated by how empty, soulless and cynical this venture was. <br /> <br /> Given the morally dubious idea of ​​having molesting children as a charismatic villain, Robert Englund's horrifying interpretation wakes up with laughter. I always thought that Freddy's mockery of teenage victims was less focused on heroes than the teenage audience who could ever see these tripe. It's as if Englund was shouting "we know it's rubbish? But you pay to see it, so who laughs? "And I'm sure the victims of child abuse would be discouraged if they saw such an insensitive representation of their situation. Was Freddy's appearance in movies always so primitive? The only thing he does is a few "haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr? Har? Harars "and that's all. If it was the only Elm St. movie you've ever seen, you would never know the character at all. Even as a hero before his death in a flashback, Englund plays him as a black pantomime boo-siss with a bit of transatlantic irony (for example, Zawyżonej, badly placed and not at all fun). <br /> <br /> Acting is almost universally poor. Just look how many times Breckin Meyer abuses his gestures and body language. Only Kananga himself, Yaphet Kotto, retains his dignity. And when Roseanne, Tom Arnold and Alice Cooper appear, you can almost see the film sink into the mud. Also the script is completely poor, almost devoid of merit. Carlos (Ricky Dean Logan) opens a road map in which Noel Coward-like Freddy wrote jokingly: "you're who." When you are asked for a map, Carlos replies: "the map says we are ready". Who wrote the script, Oscar Wilde? <br /> <br /> Or maybe the scene in which Carlos is tortured by Freddy, his hearing amplified to painful levels? So Freddy torment him, threatening to drop the heel? potentially deadly sound, taking into account that all sounds are enlarged. Oddly enough, the fact that Carlos screams at the top of his voice so he will not drop it seems to have no effect. "Nice to hear you, Carlos," Freddy jokes, hoping there will be better lines. It is also worth noting that sleep does not appear immediately, so being unconscious does not allow immediate access to Freddy's world. Although as part of the narrative, it contains a human computer game, and the three-dimensional final logic is not that high on the list of requirements. <br /> <br /> Teens targeting this cast are really the most awful, disliking group in the series. Tracy (Lezlie Deane) is the only person who greets Freddy with "shut up, old man" and kick the scallops. And was the non-standard pop music always part of it? Freddy's Dead. No laughter. Without fear. Disinterest. No fun. <br /> <br />
