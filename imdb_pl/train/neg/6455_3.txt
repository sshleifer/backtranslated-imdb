A really scary movie. However, it should be expected. Clearly low budget: nothing so innovative, actress (if you can call what he does "actress"), which always plays a role in nudity in the shower scene, a man in a reptilian costume almost modeled on a predator, cabin forests, etc. But they are also exchange points. Although the story is not new, most are a few parts that are not so returned. First of all, a black guy does not die when he is attacked (for the first time) and is not even one of the first couples who died. But it's small. More importantly, there is a very interesting phrase about the experiments Kat and Wes and Steve I have not seen. When Steve told Kat that he knew what he was doing, I believed what he said and what Kat was saying. But when the creation revealed who he really is, I was pleasantly surprised by the newness of revelation. This may be due to my lack of experience with this genre or the fact that it is really a clever twist. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is very bad and do not watch it if there's something better on ... Unless you're in the mood for a cheap scifi flick.
