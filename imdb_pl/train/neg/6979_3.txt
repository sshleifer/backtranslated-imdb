I also watched the movie, and yet it is very well made, I found it heartbreaking and I do not recommend it to women who have small children. the train is really painful. And it is sad - it dies internally. Finally, he returns to the mountains of Applacian. All the money in the world that he makes from making dolls does not hide the grief he has. I remember her desperate face as she pulls money out of her clothes trying to heal her child. I'm surprised that this movie is taking place in Detroit, because when I watched it, I thought for sure that people came to Cincinnati, Ohio. It was also a way for the poor of the mountains.
