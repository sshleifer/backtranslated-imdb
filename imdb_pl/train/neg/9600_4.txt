A very strange, but sometimes elegant, exploitative movie without a real story, but enjoying the benefits of a stunning thrilling actress and a handful of pretty, macabre makeup effects. Daniella is a beautiful girl in her twenties, carrying a trauma of rape at the age of 13. Nightmares and hallucinations lead her further to the belief that she is the reincarnation of a female ancestor who was said to be a werewolf. He kills his brother-in-law during a night meeting and is admitted to the hospital. However, he escapes again and randomly devours more men when he flees from police detectives, doctors and relatives. Look and listen is very nice (really great soundtrack), but the lack of plot and continuity becomes irritating quite quickly. Fortunately, the main lady Annik Borel rarely wears clothes and fills boring moments dancing naked around the fire. The film is too long, too strange and too forgotten. The biggest surprise is the end when suddenly and unexpectedly director Rino Di Silvestro tries to convince us that his film is based on real facts. Yes, sure...
