Until the end, bad people have the advantage - always - which somewhat undermines the competence of good boys. Annoying is the few threads of an innocent man accused of a crime. Some unnecessary dialogue in which various boring legal issues are discussed. It's just an average, stupid old western, so what's this nonsense about keeping things "realistic"? Cagney's unusual presence in the western is one of the few - if not the only - funny part of the movie. Somewhere in the middle is a ridiculed marriage proposal; something like "Where is the Kid ?! Where is he ?! ... Oh, by the way, will you marry me? "
