Director Ron Atkins is insanely crazy. This ultra-low-budget film chronicles several days of Harry Russo's life (John Giancaspro, who was also a co-author), a crazy woman who receives a Rubberneck doll from her bitch. He starts taking orders from the doll to take huge amounts of drugs, raping and killing, not always in that order. What begins as a wall-using film, behaves well, but VERY is very VERY repetitive. I leaned closer to this crazy one. It's hard to forget once. As if Tom Green ever did a horror movie. <br /> <br /> My Class: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Laurie Farwell is fully nude; Jasmin Putnam shows tits and bush <br /> <br /> ANTI-eye candy: seeing John completely naked
