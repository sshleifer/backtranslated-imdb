Frank Sinatra was far from the ideal western actor. He was a great actor, From this to eternity, and Man with a Golden Shoulder are proof of this, but he did not have the body of a Western hero, you identified him as an urban guy. But he tried to do his job well with Johnny Concho, the fact that the movie was a failure at the box office, it was not his fault. I blame it for two factors: a) the story was too unusual, especially since Sinatra behaves more like a villain than the hero throughout the movie. In a genre in which people expected a pattern to get away from it, the film must be very good. b) history is not convincing, it is hard to believe that the whole city will allow Sinatra to do everything he wants, just because they are afraid of their brother. Also, when a man shows him a special holster that will open to the side so he does not have to pull a gun, you wonder if if it makes him invincible, why did all the shooters not take him? I think that this movie should not have been withdrawn, because every movie with Sinatra is worth watching, and despite its shortcomings it is still pleasant
