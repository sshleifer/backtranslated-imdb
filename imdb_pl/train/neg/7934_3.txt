A family traveling around the softball league of their daughter decides on a "scenic route" and ends in the wilderness. The father is an avid photographer, and when he hears about an old abandoned side show in town, he decides to take another detour to take some pictures. <br /> <br /> Of course, the side show is filled with inbred freaks that immediately kidnap women and leave a young son and father to cope alone. <br /> <br /> The only nice thing about this movie is that the family actually fights with their inbred torturers. In addition, there is nothing valuable in the film.
