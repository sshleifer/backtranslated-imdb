If you want to know what music the white people listened to in 1974, this is a movie for you. But you will also have to listen to many flutes and violins (see my remarks on My Girl 1 for reference). <br /> <br /> A lenient party: I turned to My Girl 2 with cynicism and irritation, just looked at the predecessor. But as a girl preparing to start my mother's search, my girlfriend 2 made me look at the subject of searching for my mother. <br /> <br /> In other words, everything I liked about My Girl 2 had nothing to do with My Girl 2, but referring to a character who asks how many adopted, "who is my mother"? And if there are my mother's home movies in the acting group, I will definitely make my own film about it. <br /> <br /> People are apathetic. Movies should not be apathetic. My Girl 2 (like My Girl 1) is simply ... apathetic. <br /> <br /> Avoid unless you are a complete juice that is comforted by a series of small annoyances.
