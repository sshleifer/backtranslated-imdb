This film differs from the documentaries of the "miracle of the human body" boldly, though bizarrely, choosing disgust for the viewer. In one scene, the camera closes a gigantic 50-meter zit, when a teenager squeezes oil and liquid from it. In another, the apparatus is partially immersed in a swamp of half-digested food and stomach acid as part of a pasta salad falling from the esophagus and falling into the goat. In the final tour the camera takes the viewer to a thrilling ride through the forest ... teenage hair under the armpits. Unfortunately, I do not do anything about it. See this movie if you have to, but bring your vomit bag and do not have a pasta salad before.
