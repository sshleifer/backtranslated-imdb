Designed only to annoy (or entertain) any self-respecting intelligent person. If the director's intention was that the viewer would not like the title character, it would be good, but I know there is no such thing as a Hollywood director who would criticize the American Marxist movement of the 1960s, especially the 70's filmmaker. There are so many idiotic dialogues here that sometimes I wonder if I'm actually watching a comedy. You would not be guilty for thinking you satire? the movie is so naive. Spacek has its share in leftist films, which leads to the obvious inescapable conclusion that the redhead is one of those Hollywood liberals. But does that mean they are not all? Nice tits, but s ** t for brains.
