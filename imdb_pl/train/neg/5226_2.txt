It was one of the worst movies we've watched over the past few months with a predictable storyline and quite a bad performance (mainly from supporting characters). Interview with Hugh Laurie on DVD was in fact more satisfying than the movie itself ... <br /> <br /> Hugh Laurie apparently put a lot of effort into learning to dance Samba, but the extent of his character was required only to be immersed in the children's end swimming pool. The film is based on the look of a beautiful girl and great music, but they are not enough for good entertainment. <br /> <br /> If you've never seen Rio or the interior of a British bank, this movie is for you. 2 out of 10.
