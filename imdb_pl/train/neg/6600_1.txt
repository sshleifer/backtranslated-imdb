Yowza! If someone who loves Laurel and Hardy can watch this movie and feel good about it, you're a better person than me! This film, while the great attempt to "imitate" Laurel and Hardy through appearance, sound and routine, is not enough to honor them, or even be a film of any substance. I blame Larry Harmon. Dialogue is torn from old L + H movies and unrealistically planted, the plot is mixed up with useless characteristics of other unnecessary stars, Pinchot's accent was strange to Stan, and while Sartain did a great job with Ollie's accent, he also tried hard to create a great mix that he was Mr. Hardy. Where was the (good) music number? Editing is unstable, the action is stiff, the lines are terrifying, physics is impossible - (though they may have tried to give it the impression of cheap sets?), And in general it is a terrible witness. It is more painful to watch than ATOLL K, where the legendary duo made their last movie in horrible writing from the 1950s and photography. Do yourself a favor and watch as many ORIGINAL films by Laurel and Hardy as possible and find out what it looked like. You know what MAGNATE is, right? Stan Laurel did not always respond half-morons to every sentence. <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for anyone who thinks THAT was a decent update / honor for boys. Where was THE CLASSIC THEME SONG?!? Why are you ruining "Here's another great mess"? Why do you skip the "smarter"? Why was there a senseless circle of associates ?! WHY MISS GULCH OF WIZZER OZ ???? WHY LARRY HARMON IS IN THIS? WHY BOZO!? Did THE LEARNING CHANNEL help finance it? <br /> <br /> Really. Fart jokes, for God's sake. <br /> <br /> FART JOKES.
