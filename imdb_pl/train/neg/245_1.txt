Beyond the shadow of doubt The mysterious planet is one of the worst films ever made, but it keeps love in my heart because the poverty of its special effects and the amazingly awful soundtrack in the first 15 minutes (and honestly all you need to see) connect, to create something that is fun to divide sideways. <br /> <br /> The opening scene in "space" is almost as unfathomable as cinematography, because bottles of dishwashing liquid pass by your eyes to suppress the dialogue. Before you think about whether you are going crazy, the loans are going on and the action is fighting for life. <br /> <br /> And besides the two-headed plasticine snail that terrorizes our heroes, you will also receive a double bonus with original voices and dubbed voices. Pure genius. <br /> <br /> The sad thing about fans of this kind of fare is that I only saw one copy, so the likelihood that you will see it alone is very unlikely. Perhaps I am the owner of the only existing copy. <br /> <br />
