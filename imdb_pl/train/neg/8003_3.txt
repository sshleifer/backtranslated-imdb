Do not be fooled by the "glowing" reviews quoted in the DVD box. "Strangely funny.", "Seriously terrifying freak." And the worst of all "STEAMING WITH JAWS." This movie is none of the above. <br /> <br /> I usually do not care about writing bad reviews about movies, but I can not believe that this is in a comfortable 7 on IMDb. He does not deserve it. <br /> <br /> After such an opening attack of daylight by a monster created by another, chemicals thrown by lazy scientists, this film goes completely nowhere and goes slowly. Basically and unbelievably the girl is kidnapped by the monster (I will give them points for a good creature's design, but this is not a WETA work), and her semi-comic family spends an hour and a half tracking her ... in the canals surrounding the Han River. There is no tension in their search, someone called it equally with Jaws? - and when they find her, you realize that it was almost pointless. In addition, a large part of the film is involved in government quarantine, culminating in one funny scene involving a guy spitting the gutter in front of the crowded bus stop. <br /> <br /> Blech. It was bad. I am not joking. Want to see a rotten movie with a monster? Deep Rising Rental. At least you'll save 30 minutes of your life.
