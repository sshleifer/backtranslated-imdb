This film should be called "plan 9 from Joseph Smith." I think his eccentricity is underestimated. It seems that the playwright read "Pawe≈Ç Ehrlich's folk bomb" (1968) and created a musical response created especially for the Mormons. the whole point of art lies in the fact that having as many children as possible is part of the plan of the "heavenly father" (god). and anything that hinders having more children is very bad. <br /> <br /> This version was filmed in 1989, which is misleading. this is Utah, so it looks and feels like in 1983, art was written in 1973 and of course theology is part of the 1840s, partly battlestar galactica. part of the action takes place on the ground, and part in the "pre-existence, pointless romper hall in which annoying children are waiting to get their bodies to come down, trying not to slam the door of the missionaries, losing arrows to the heavenly glory. <br /> <br /> is as scenic as it appears, but do not let poor theater players spoil your recognition for this mad Mormon universe, where "cool kids" are all in population control, (presumably) counseling their parents did not have more children !! having large families, at a time when art was written, cultural norm in the LDS community, and more importantly, considered part of God's plan, the church has since made 180, made family planning become the choice of parents, and large families are now much less a cultural norm, making the entire doctrinal premise of the film a modern Mormon! <br /> <br /> ahhh, but it's really only as good as music, there are catchy tunes that just will not let this movie die by the death of the seventies it was intended for. brother and sister sing each other love songs that make you wonder if something else happens there - blink. and hard, cool kids make new kids look like metallica. so cheer on it all! Gather family, create shooters and enjoy the show! <br /> <br />
