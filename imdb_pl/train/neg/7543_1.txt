The soldier is on the side of the road, making sure everyone1 obeys the speed limit (doing his job); then he calls for a woman who appears as a mother (in the backseat is a child); then he tells her what is wrong and BAM ... they are killed. Okay, this is the beginning of what I thought was a good movie. When I watched the movie in the theater, I was with my friends. It was our first night after summer, so we wanted to see a good movie. We all decided to see a suspense / thriller that looked good to everyone in the group ... it was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. I not only wasted $ 7 on a movie ticket, but I had to sit through torture for the brain. This movie began with mystery and tension, and I seriously thought that "this can not be wrong" ... I was wrong. The whole problem with this movie is that it does not make sense; even if you manage to do bad acting, the plot "not so frightening" and the whole terrible mess that this movie was, you'll still be surprised. It's not because you're not smart enough to understand, because no human brain can understand what this stupid movie is about. At the moment you can think: "Oh man! I need to watch this movie to see if it's as bad as the man says. " RECEIVE YOUR HEAD NOW !!! I'm trying to save you the trouble of watching this movie, telling you that it's so bad that it makes no sense to even consider watching it. Please, people do not make the same mistake as I thought this movie has potential ... no. I give this film 1 in 10 (if I could give zero what I would like to), and I do not recommend anyone to ever see this movie, you'll save yourself many sleepless nights trying to think in t.f. about this bizarre movie.
