I'm afraid you'll find that the vast majority of people who rate this film as 10 are very Christian. I'm not. If you're looking for a Christian movie, I recommend this movie. If you're looking for a good general movie, I'm afraid you'll have to go somewhere else. <br /> <br /> I was annoyed by the characters and their illogical behavior. The premise of the film is that teaching morality without teaching that Jesus is the basis of morality is wrong. One scene shows the main character telling the boy that the theft is evil, and then the character says that Jesus taught us. I find this offensive: are we to believe that "you will not steal" comes from Jesus? I suppose he wrote the Ten Commandments? And the theft was acceptable earlier? I rented a movie from Netflix. I should have understood the nature of the commentary film. Well.
