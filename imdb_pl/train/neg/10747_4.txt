Camp Blood III is a huge improvement in Camp Blood II because it has sound mainly in the right places and a basic story. This time they went a little further from the parking lot, and the other two films were filmed, which is a good move, because you can no longer hear cars passing through what is to be a distant wilderness. <br /> <br /> This time it's a reality show and a false clown that scares off the participants. This is not a new idea, I've seen at least three other horror movies with exactly the same assumption in which a real killer appears, but at least this one has a story instead of people just stabbed by accident. > <br /> Unlike the other two series, this one is at least good for a few laughter. I liked the sound effect of a shot when someone gets stabbed early and like a boom microphone hovers behind people like a phantom. <br /> <br /> I do not know why anyone would like to make a movie's third blood of the camp, I'd think it's better to start from scratch, but at least they tried it. Half-naked, distorted woman was a bit too big for me, it looks like they tried to keep continuity, employing some freak who would take off his clothes for $ 5, like in the second movie. They still did not come to the conclusion that the machete was used for a non-stinging cut, but well, it's a Camp Blood movie, what do you expect? If you like nonsense movies, you'll have fun with it.
