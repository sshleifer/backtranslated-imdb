It would be better to strengthen it by making it <br /> <br /> a 50-minute episode of Outer Limits. Too much unnecessary material and things like the main bad guy looking like he escaped from the Spectra of the Opera did not help. The whole sequence of "Night of the Living Dead" was extremely stupid and quite unnecessary. After all, if the dead were to punish anyone for their sins, now remind me exactly who kills everyone again?
