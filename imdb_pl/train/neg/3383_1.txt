For the first time I saw a musical live at Denver Center For The Performing Arts and it was absolutely stunning, Stunning and had such a fantastic continuity of story and dialogue that I liked it more than most musicals I've seen on stage. It is interesting that you have NEVER seen Zach's face. He was always in the dark, but his presence was powerful and directed the direction of all production. When I heard that they were making a movie of it, I waited with bated breath, but when I watched the movie, I was so disappointed with the disappointment that I felt cheated. The film lacks a captivating mood in live production and never lets you be completely in touch with any character. Personally, I would like to see the live version again, and if it is ever restored, I wholeheartedly recommend that you do everything to see it. It will be one of the most unforgettable impressions.
