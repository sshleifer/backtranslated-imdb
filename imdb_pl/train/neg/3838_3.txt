Terry West had a good idea in this movie. He just did not do it. Endless shots of a terrifying, outside-looking school environment that lasts forever and will probably affect the duration of the movie. Also at this school there are only 2 students. Misty Mundae is usually good, but this movie will always belong to Ruby LaRocca (which is the only reason to watch the film at the beginning). If the script focused on its interesting character, we would have a movie to watch. She is so GREAT !! Good news for DVD buyers, Terry West's earlier (and better) movie "Blood For The Muse" is a special feature. One thing I would like to say is that this movie seems to be such that someone who is not good at delivering a punch line at the end of a long joke to the end feels the same. Then look again at Ruby LaRocca.
