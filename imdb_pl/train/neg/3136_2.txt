There are many obvious noises associated with this film. Let's face it, but the main reasons someone will watch it are Leo and Cate, who are not necessarily the best actors in this movie. I'm not saying they are not good actors, I say they stink in this movie. The special effects were decent (and I will say that the filmmakers did a good job making the ship pleasing to the eye), but IT has even some serious disadvantages. For example, just before the ship, behind the main characters you see an unfinished picture on the blue screen. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I LOVE the story of the TRUE Titanic, but I consider this film an insult to this story. The editing was awful - there is no reason for the film to be over 2 1/2 hours (except the MAYBE biographic film), and the script and script were terribly slim. <br /> <br /> I will say that the music was probably better than I could have predicted (and not just the song "My Heart Will Go On"). There is one scene that stands out when the ship sinks and you hear striking bass music. This can be the main attraction of the film. As for the whole mood, he was very boring. I felt more relieved than sadness when Jack died, which, as I know, can not be what the director intended. <br /> <br /> I think it's awful in crazy scenes that they turned the beautiful story of Titanic hiped chick.
