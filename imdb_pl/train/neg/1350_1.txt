This film concerns essentially Grandmaster Inspector Gadget, Dr. Claw, who returned many years to the peaceful city of Metropolis. Claw plans to thwart the gadget once and for all, using a newer "cooler" criminal to help destroy the popularity of the gadget. Unfortunately, the film fails miserably, the series was great, but revived almost 20 years later with tragic results. Without the voice of Don Adams as the Inspector Gadget, he simply does not cut it; Dr Claw is not only less frightening visually, but sounds more like a wrestler with cold than his original, intimidating self. Granted that it is a movie for children, but the story is so painfully weak (God forbid, I mention the animation) that it pales compared to the original series. Someone decided to update Penny to accelerate her by two decades, she now has a somewhat punk, rebellious style of dress and does not play half the role she played in the television series. Gadgetmobile talks and also contains a storyline that focuses on all talking cars. Maybe I'm just a kid who loved the show, which was already tired, but I thought that the live-action version is more painful than I could bear, but now they go and spring is a complete weakening of the quality of the show us. That's more than I can take.
