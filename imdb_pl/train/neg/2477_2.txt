If you want to know the real story of Wendigo, I suggest that you take a copy of the original story of Algernon Blackwell. This movie was not only bad but had nothing to do with the book. <br /> <br /> I loved this book when I read it as a child (in "Campfire Chillers" by EM Freeman) and was so excited to see the film based on it coming out. I was so disappointed when I finally saw it. Another thing is that throughout the movie there were too many computer subtexts (politically correct) that did not take place in the film. When the book was written, the PC did not even exist. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is: do not waste time or money !! If you see it on the shelf of the video store, leave it.
