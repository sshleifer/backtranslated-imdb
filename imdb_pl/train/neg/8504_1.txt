Semana Santa is happily angry. It's so bad in so many ways that I do not know where to start. So, let's see ... Mira Sorvino, whose judge husband was shot while she was being protected, goes from Madrid to Seville for her policewoman. During the holy week (Semana Santa, see? ... everyone starts to sleep ... let's say it was bad at many points, even from the very beginning), the killer pursues his victims like bulls in the bullfight arena. He works with a male chauvinist pig Olivier Martinez and a nice Feodor Atkine. He soon discovers that he will be the next target of the killer (who wears a red robe). Why, oh, but why? <br /> <br /> Why ... this is a question that concerns my whole movie in my head. <br /> <br /> Q: Why did he go to see that A: Because I love Mira Sorvino (I forgive her for it IN THE FIRST DEATH) <br /> <br /> Q: Why on Saturday of the first week of the premiere we had only 8 people in the theater? A: ah-ah-ah. Spider-man was sent again the same day. But also the fact that the movie was full of amazing reviews. <br /> <br /> Q: Why was this movie created? A: I think money. But the boy did Mira money. <br /> <br /> then ... why ???????????? firstly, there is always something wrong with European co-productions. here you have French-English-German-Italian-Spanish-Danish production. yi-ha. <br /> <br /> Then I want to play on the same playgroungu, what American thrillers / slashers / whodunit / mysteries / anything. Even VALENTINE, though unnecessary, badly written and shot, was much better in suspense and fun. <br /> <br /> Then, to emphasize the story, the screenwriter wanted to add some political perspective to the story. Bad: done in flash-backs in a movement-like photo is certainly the most interesting thing in the movie. He could stick to it, he would not have to sit in the whole movie. Better go straight to the "Devil" by Guillermo del Trosa (El espinazo del diablo) to get clever fun. <br /> <br /> Then homophobia. Bull's-eye! The first victims are drug addicts S & M twins who have been stabbed. Annoying olivier Martinez goes to a dating agency held by a shaved, overweight transvestite with a blond platinum wig. All the time she calls the heroine Mira Sorvino a large dike. Do we need this kind of thing? No. Just unnecessary offensive remarks, just like ol'times. <br /> <br /> Then the tension. Yipee. No visible theme. The first murders are a mere illusion because they depict the famous painting. But no. And the revelation of the killer (of course the terrible fascist) could have been made from the very beginning, because it appears at the end of the movie because, I think, the time has come for the director to say: damn film, let's now reveal who the killer is and why he kills. <br /> <br /> Then the director thinks he is a director. Bad: lack of sense of uncertainty, lack of sense of managing actors, lack of knowledge about change of pace. A giant, a mega-bore. Scenes from the holy week are unnecessary (maybe the co-production rule says: ok, shoot in Seville, but show the Easter holidays of this beautiful and historic city.) This is a mysterious film for tourists!) <Br /> <br /> Then the actors. All evil. Mira Sorvino is plagued with death: practically doing nothing but stabbing her with the right hand. Everything she did best (assassin killers, powerful Aphrodite ...) was like it never existed. Olivier Martinez ... hi, someone here? When will the producers know that he is not an actor, but a mannequin without the ability to speak and feel? Feodor Atkine, bland and transparent. We only really respect Alida Valli, one of the greatest actresses in the last century (and I hope for more roles in this one). It is the main attraction because it is the only one that gives life to its poor lines. I will not mention other actors because they are only one-sided figures, uninteresting and shallow. <br /> <br /> Inconsolable direction, incoherent actors, unbelievable plot. Idiotism incarnate. <br /> <br /> Superwonderskope says: 1 <br /> <br />
