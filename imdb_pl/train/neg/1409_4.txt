In my opinion, it does not spoil very much, but I still wanted to cover myself. As executive producer, Morgan Freeman wants the audience to ignore the numerous absurdities of his character in 10 Items Or Less, a movie about intentional independence, and simply a mentor / be-all-that-you-can -be topic. The game of the alternative universe, a semi-conscious version of the real Morgan Freeman, which is run in the old Econovanie by the kid up to Carson, CA from Brentwood, to explore his next role in the movie. Why Carson is a secret for So. Inhabitants of Cal. He could save the trip and go anywhere in the San Fernando Valley and find the same items. Paz Vega is pretty to watch, crosses Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz, playing a dissatisfied grocery store on a large but slow local market, which apparently is the best source of research for Moragn Freeman. His character is known only as "He" to refer to how actors are perceived when they meet in the real life of average people ... "Psst, this is" he ", etc. Unfortunately, I was too distracted that He had all kind of wisdom, and he was not sure when he returned to his home in Brentwood, he had no cash or debit card, and he had no wisdom to carry a cell phone. If someone has such a high opinion about himself, he believes he has an answer everything like him, then I have to see cash and Blackberry, which shows intelligence and good survival instincts to preserve the great ego that He definitely has. Nothing really happens in this movie. I do not believe that one of the main characters was essentially flirting with the idea of ​​adultery, but then the thought becomes dreary. It was similar to Shopgirl Steve Martin's, without a sexual affair. It was indulgent and unconvincing to Freeman for the audience.
