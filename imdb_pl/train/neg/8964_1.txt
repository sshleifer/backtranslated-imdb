People familiar with the two previous Cube films know very well what to expect: a small group of people trapped in the jungle of traps in the rooms, paranoia, bad acting ... This one is slightly different. About half the movie takes place outside the cube, where we watch people watching people inside the cube (or at least five of them). <br /> <br /> I think that Cube Zero wants to explain what to do with the ankle, but you really do not get to know more than what was included in the first two films. Sure, there's an explanation there, but it seems pretty bad compared to what was suggested in the first movie. <br /> <br /> Cube Zero looks rather cheap (like its predecessors) and the fact that it shows more than just a few empty rooms only emphasizes this feeling. I was also convinced that there is no risk that any of the actors will win prizes in the foreseeable future. However, they brought back the traps from Cube 1 (I mean, they are almost the same, which is a bit of a shame). <br /> <br /> I know that many people in a sense appreciate this film and its relationship with the first one, but I feel that it is a totally unnecessary contribution to the franchise, which was not very good.
