Dick Foran and Peggy Moran, who were so good at HAND MUMA, are back for this very small offer from Universal Horror. But this time, instead of Wallace Ford as a comedian helper "Babe", we get Fuzzy Knight replacing a stupid friend named "Stuff". But the results are not so adorable, and the level of fear is practically nil. <br /> <br /> Dick is a businessman who comes up with the idea to start searching for treasures on a distant island in a terrible old castle. Peggy is one of the gang who comes for a ride. But there is a tall and thin lookalike of John Carradine in a black cloak and a big hat known as "The Phantom," which breaks the party in pursuit of a buried fortune. <br /> <br /> This "phantom" is not very mysterious and does not make any effort to even try to let his average guy stand in the shade to create some tension or horror. It's always nice to see Perky Moran, but besides, you can write it as one of the immediate forgotten Universal errors.
