`The Matrix 'was an exciting summer hit that was visually fantastic, but also thought interestingly provoking in the way' Twilight Zone '. The general rule applies here - this continuation does not match the predecessor. What's worse, he does not even compare with him. <br /> <br /> `Reloaded 'explodes on the screen in the most unprofessional way. In the first few seconds the first impression is generally good, because Trinity is shot in a dream. Immediately after the dive in the movie. After the disastrous first 45 minutes, it gradually gains momentum as they enter the Matrix and the battle of Agent Smith takes place. But he loses all speed when he reaches the 14-minute sequence of the car chase and becomes even worse at the big whining turn at the end. The worst thing is that the "Zion Rave" scene is too long. Not only is this absolutely nothing to do with the story, but it is also a pathetic excuse for pornography and depressive dance music. <br /> <br /> Aspect "Matrix" was a good addition, but in '' Reloaded '' they abuse it to seem boring. In the first there were interesting plot turns, but here it is too linear to be interesting. The film is simply a series of stylish entertainment that prevents us from realizing how it really is empty. It works on the incorrect principle that bigger is better. It seems that the series "The Matrix" quickly entered into special effects, flooded with fire, which other franchises, such as the saga "Star Wars" have. <br /> <br /> The acting standard is mostly poor. The best character, of course, goes to agent Smith Hugo Weaving - the only one who is somewhat interesting. Keanu Reeves is the definitive Neo, but in all special effects there is not much space to make a big impact. Laurence Fishburne, nominated for an Oscar, is a monotonous mentor with a lousy dialogue. Part of Carrie Ann Moss as an action chicks could have been made much better by any other actress. <br /> <br /> Poor, dumped movie "Matrix Reloaded" is a disappointment. Those who did not like the first one would rather not come to him. This one is only for die-hard fans. Even in its own sub-group special effects bonanzas (Minority Report, Matrix, etc.) It is still rather poor. My rating IMDb: 4.5 / 10.
