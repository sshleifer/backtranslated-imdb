Christ. Continuation of one of the most humorous movies of all time, it has at least decency to skip the songs (spoil the unbearable "Tomorrow"), but continues the tradition of nausea and distaste. This time, Annie and her friends go to London and get entangled in a plot by Joan Collins to blow up Buckingham Palace or such shit. The film has a bizarre sycophantic attitude towards its title character, which is at odds with how annoying it is: every time a small bugger squeaks Leapin 'lizards!' I felt my teeth crumble into powder. The film, which is photographed, rickety and shapely, has only one unforgettable line ("Unhand me, you stupid genius!") And the fact that it is not the original that recommends it.
