It's a very old and cheap movie - a typical low-budget B-Western in many ways. Gary Cooper was not yet a star, and this film closely resembles the early films of John Wayne, which were made in the study of "poor poems". In the case of both actors their familiar style and persona are still not completely formed. This incarnation of Gary Cooper does not look exactly like Cooper from a few years later (among other things, he says faster in this early movie). <br /> <br /> However, unlike the average B movie in the era, there are at least some interesting elements that make the film unique (if not good). If you ever want to see a woman who was married to Errol Flynn for seven years, this is your chance. Lili Damita plays the role of female love and it is a very, very strange choice of casting, because she has a heavy accent (she was French) and was not even close to being a movie star. By the way, she was also the wife of director Michael Curtiz. <br /> <br /> But for me the most memorable and strange aspect of the film is the seemingly homosexual subplot - something like the BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN from the 1930s (and we thought it was a NEW idea). Gary Cooper's character was brought up by two men who hate women and do everything in their power to keep Cooper away from women for most of the movie. The same misogyny does not necessarily mean a lot, but there are so many guidelines throughout the film that show that the filmmakers really tried to portray them as a gay couple. In particular, at the end, when one of them is killed, the other is shot by an arrow and abstains from death long enough to crawl into the body of his fallen friend, and then falls - with his hands stacked around him! It was quite sharp for those times and I think it makes this boring movie really fascinating! When it comes to Cooper and the story, the film is a bit disappointing and very negligible. Unless you are curious Damita or homosexual tones, do yourself a favor and find a better West.
