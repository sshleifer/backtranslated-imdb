Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child, the fifth edition of the Nightmare series on Elm Street and the worst sequel in history, even worse than A Nightmare on Elm Street 2. I was lucky to get Nightmare on Elm Street DVD set for my birthday and watched all the sequels. No doubt the dream child was the worst, I was also surprised because they were doing so well with the last two sequels. But I think they just lost their charm, the story was just ridiculous and I was not happy with where it went. Alice has become more and more annoying, she's not Nancy or Kirsten, so her film was not enough for me. Freddy also loses his fear, it was just a little stupid. <br /> <br /> Alice comes back and wears a baby, she can not be happier with her life. But Freddy also came back and will not be too light for her because she defeated him so easily in the fourth movie. But in any case, she wants her baby and be born again in the world. Have you ever wondered if Freddy also has parents? Well, it's A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child examines, and Alice quickly learns what Freddy's childhood looked like and maybe it's the only thing that can beat him. Dream Child is just a bad movie and insulting series. I do not think anyone would be happy with this continuation. This story was really stupid, it means it could work, but once again it was done the wrong way. I know that if you want to see the sequels of the Nightmare series on Elm Street, you should watch it, but I really would not recommend it, it is not worth it, at least in my opinion. <br /> <br /> 3/10
