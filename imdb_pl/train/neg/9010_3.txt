When you want the dragon to eat every member of the cast, you know you're on a bad ride. <br /> <br /> I came in with very, very low expectations, after reading a few other comments, and I was not disappointed. However, unlike other cheap and unsuccessful movies, this one is not really fun (and unintentionally) amusing in the whole text. <br /> <br /> -SPOILERS POSTĘPUJĄ - <br /> <br /> First of all, the plot is very inconsistent. Looking at "minor" errors such as growing up a dragon within 3 hours, the whole idea on which it is based is incorrect. Look, the movie wants us to believe that dragons come from outer space in the form of meteorites that really were dragon eggs. After explaining this, they show a peasant who pokes one with a pitchfork and the dragon jumps out. Later, the "mad scientist" guy talks about how dragons survived dinosaurs. So, apparently, people were nearby, when there were dinosaurs, or we just have a small hole in the story. Another important thing is that the laboratory is blown up with the force "half the weaker" than in Hiroshima. Then the two guys come in later to check everything, and almost unscathed! There is another dragon who grew out of who knows. All in all, it is very predictable. As soon as the guy mentioned cloning, I guessed that they would clone the dragon. This means that our bodyguard Mr. Smarty-pants is not as intuitive and clever as a movie you would believe in if you ignore that I knew that this movie would be about, you know, dragons. <br /> <br /> Putting it aside, the second worst thing is "special effects". Others mentioned the fake rocks falling at first, the CG helicopter and the dragon. It looks a little better than a droplet, but it ruined all that was associated with it, when on the other side of the hall he was walking the corridor in the same way. It must be admitted that flying dragons at first looked good from a distance (although the one in the cave is probably the worst in the whole movie). Scenes that show a million different shots of the same person standing in different ways are not. "Preliminary" screens with important statistics are not. <br /> <br /> Coming back to the actors, they were not the best, but I think they at least tried? They seemed more enthusiastic about what they were doing than many actors in the last "BloodRayne", for example, and you have to give them points. I noticed, however, that the woman who plays Meredith often had her face covered with makeup, which was much more lighter than the rest. She looked like she had a bad streak with white faces. <br /> <br /> The script is bad and bad. You really do not notice the music, but in reality it's not that bad, for the most part. <br /> <br /> The main thing is not to watch unless you want to see it because you hear it is bad (eg I did it, although the only funny thing is the wrong CG effects. Also, do not waste time and money .
