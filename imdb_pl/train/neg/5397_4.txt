I think it is one of Shakespeare's weakest works of Kenneth Branagh. After such great efforts as Much Ado About Nothing, etc. I thought it was poor. The cast was weaker (Alicia Silverstone, Nivoli, McElhone ???), but my biggest concern was that they buried Bard at work and cut out a part of the game to put it in music / dance sequences. > You just do not do Shakespeare, and then you play with art. I'm sorry, it's just bad. I love Cole Porter, just like the next person, but language, do not mess with Shakespeare. Skip it and look at "Prosper's Books" if you want to see a brilliant adaptation of Shakespeare's Storm.
