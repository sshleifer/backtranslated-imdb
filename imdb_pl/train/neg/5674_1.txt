My God, what's going on? Uwe Bolla's film and positive comments? Wow! <br /> <br /> It's nice to note that most of the positive reviews come from beginners to Bolla's work. I, as I stated in Uwe Bolla's previous reviews, only watch his films in the hope that he will do something good one day. I mean ... MUST DECIDE DONE! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Seed is not that day. I do not really know where to start from a lame attempt in horror, where Seed is. It must be remembered that all patients in the world are in this way because of observing various illnesses on video or on the web ..... or that's what Mr. Boll believes. I still can not find out all over my life why footage from real abuse and animal killings was needed in the first 10 minutes of the movie. I understand the idea that Seed (the killer) is scarcely and likes to watch such things ..... but he can not understand why Mr. Boll thought that putting REAL in the movie would work. Can he shock us? Hmmm ..... well, first of all I'm not sensitive and I can see everything on film. I do not think, however, that the use of real animal cruelty was the least fun. If you tried to shock me, it did not work. It reminded me of how much the world had broken because such things happen, and also because Uwe Boll can continue filming. This kind of context could work in movies from the '70s and' 80s (Cannibal Holocaust), but not in today's market. <br /> <br /> With this output, we can go to the fact that Uwe managed to give the movie a very cheap climate, such as BloodRayne 2. You can simply say that there was not a huge amount of money floating for production. <br /> <br /> As usual, Mr. Boll does not really care about a decent story, because we are treated on the basis of boring shots of policemen watching various films of Seed victims in the first 25 minutes. Each of these films ends with an accelerated distribution of the victim. It's all very boring and boring. I will not comment on the toddler scene because it is funny and is another cheap factor of "shock". <br /> <br /> If you manage to sit for the first 25 minutes, you will be treated by policemen passing through a very dark house to catch Seed. The lighting is awful here, and Uwe has an old fiasco, "I do not use a fixed camera," which he did with BloodRayne 2. Watch how the policemen die in a stupid way, until Seed gets caught. This scene is so damn stupid that you have to see it to believe it. The policeman actually tells Seed that he could shoot him. For some unknown reason, the cop did not shoot him. Given that Seed is a sicko that kills both children and adults, at this point in the scenario you would think that meaning would win. <br /> <br /> From this moment on we are treated on a silly scene of execution, and then through cops burying the seeds alive (and they know that he is alive ... why not shoot him in the head ????), after which the seeds leave from the ground, then they kill a random woman with a hammer and then kidnap one family of cops. <br /> <br /> What I'm trying to reach all of you is that it's just STUPLE! It's even stupid Hollywood horror .... just stupid. Uwe Boll can not run ****. Everyone with a bit of taste would agree with this statement. Anyone who watches this movie and finds it amusing in any shape or form must seriously look at himself as a person. <br /> <br /> Once again we are treated as a badly played, directed, lighted, produced, script written piece of UB crap.
