At least with a teenage geek he gets movies with girls, the guy is usually unpopular with girls. In a 40-year-old virgin he is replaced by a 40-year-old guy who is popular with women, but somehow remains a virgin. But you should not engage your brain in this movie, did I miss being sleepy for 20 years? <br /> <br /> One of a series of films in which 40 people behave like teenagers, and for some reason, women consider it attractive enough to want to have a serious relationship with them. It is difficult for me to understand how a country that has produced such great television comedies seems to think that in laughter it has to rely on raw and shallow figures. They made gross movies. They made an act like all Americans are 15 years old. Where will they go next? <br /> <br /> This movie is a stupid and primitive pastime that has nothing to recommend.
