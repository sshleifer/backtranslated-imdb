I wonder what the director tried to do with this film. But the problem is that it is not very good. There was nothing really original about the film, and although the plot was well-presented, the main characters were a bit shallow and did not bother with any of them. <br /> <br /> Rather bland (and sometimes even bad) the photo leaves a bit to be desired, but I think that you can not expect much from people who just do a low-budget movie for the heck. It is unfair to browse the movie and compare it with other high-budget movies. But unfortunately, it has to do. It is not very good in itself. It is still not very good compared to others. But it was not without good points! I liked the plot. It was built quite nicely and well connected at the end. Sometimes, in really dark scenes, it was also possible to create a terrifying feeling. <br /> <br /> However, in the end, the movie does not make an impression. The characters are almost non-existent and we do not care about any of them. Each of them may die, but it is possible to indicate the final "survivor" from very early.
