I'm 13 years old and I hated this movie as the worst movie in the world, I completely wasted watching it and was disappointed with the reason on the cover, and the reverse looks pretty good, but I was wrong. but when I saw the delta, it was a completely different and bad actress, and I really did not know how many years the two girls tried, I was so confused. the movie was in a sense misleading and I did not like it, but I watched the whole movie just to see if it would be better but no, it was boring, boring and I said BORING .... and I think that many people did not like it it's as good as me
