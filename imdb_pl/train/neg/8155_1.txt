Actually, I prefer Robin Williams in his more important roles (eg Good Will Hunting, The Fisher King, The World According to Garp). These are my favorite films by Robin Williams. But Seize the Day, although well played, is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and certainly the worst movie of Robin Williams (even worse than Death is Smoochy, Club Paradise and Alladin on Ice). <br /> <br /> Every good story will have its ups and downs. This film, however, is one giant. I do not need a good Hollywood cheese festival, but I must have something other than 90 minutes of complete and total hopelessness. This movie reminds me of "Love Liza" (which is actually worse), because it seems that the only point of the movie is to see how far one person can go. Reply? Who cares.
