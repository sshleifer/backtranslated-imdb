I did not think the French could make a bad movie, but I was clearly very angry. As previously stated, this movie basically uses the title character as a starting point; her image of life and person has nothing to do with the real Artemisia Gentileschi. <br /> <br /> The script is awful - pretentious, slim and deplorable - and its rewriting of facts is extremely offensive, even in a genre that too often maintains its life by distorting it, not telling stories. In addition to a pretty decent set design, the physical charms of Valentina Cervi are the main asset of this film and it is obvious from the very beginning that the filmmakers were aware of it; they do not waste time inventing various "erotic" sequences that have much more in common with the exciting ones than the development of the story or characters. Unfortunately, the appeal to see a pretty young girl in a state of mock sexual arousal can not and does not support this movie. Acting is extraordinary, and the score is too general, despite the interesting chord or two. The pictures are fine, and there are some nice colors, but there are also quite funny sequences in which the effects of distorted lenses are more suitable for a movie from the 60s than a costume drama. In any case, the script leaves the camera on the body of Artemisia too often, and too rarely on her paintings. <br /> <br /> In total, almost complete failure. It's not smart enough and tasteful enough to be a serious movie, and it's too slow and pretentious to act as soft-core pornography. In the end, the French can fail!
