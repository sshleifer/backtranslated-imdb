This movie is a very bad attempt to make money using the classic theme. I used to love Superman films, but he made me want to shoot myself. Very poor acting, scandalous special effects and a plot equal to zero. To sum up: Superman leaves the Earth because scientists have discovered pieces of their home planet, some were in space (duh), do not say anything to their girlfriend before he goes away (again duh), he starts on a spaceship (?!?), He comes back I think that five years later, and I can not wait to re-connect with my girlfriend (who now destroys my son, who in my humble opinion is at least 7 years old). What about Lex Luthor? Are you trying to grow a new continent to sell land? Please !! <br /> <br /> I vote 1 in 10 in this film, just because I can not vote for 0. If you have something else to do, do not go to see this movie and even if you have nothing else to do, Stay home and watch TV!
