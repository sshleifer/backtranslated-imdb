No real conspiracy to do this, just a series of short skits playing VERY old jokes. At first I chuckled once or twice, to my disappointment. But even after 73 minutes this movie is worn for too long, and then it becomes stale and boring (with some nudity sprinkled here and there, so that you do not sleep). It's still as bad as this movie (and it's quite rotten), it's a comic gem compared to ANYthing by Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg (Date movie, Epic movie, Meet the Spartans). sad way. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: 11 par boobs, 3 shrubs, 3 donkeys <br /> <br /> My degree: D <br /> <br /> Red DVD code Extras: The original trailer of this movie; and trailers "Beyond the Door", "Dead Pit", "The Farmer", "Obsessed Ones", "Power Play", "Sole Survivor" and "Wacky Taxi"
