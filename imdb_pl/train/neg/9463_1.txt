Medium-spirited and degrading degradation to the classic children's story is not only devoid of the charm of the ancestor, but devoid of any talent. Mike Myers should not only be ashamed of his horrible performance, which is a clear break with what Jim Carrey did, but he should give up acting together. It's so annoying that you'd like to win shit with him if you could jump into the movie. The sets are ugly and the photos are very weak. This year I saw a lot of bad movies, but it does not just take away the cake, but it is undoubtedly one of the worst movies.
