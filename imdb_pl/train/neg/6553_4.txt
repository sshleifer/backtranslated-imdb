Years after the collapse of the last of the big corporations, the world fell into a new dark age in which cyborgs gather for their parts. Cash, a cyborg woman, travels to a wilderness doctor to get a message that she is pregnant. In an escape from the Recyclers (bounty hunters who hunt cyborgs), Cash tries to find the way to Cytown, a mythical refuge for cyborgs. <br /> <br /> "Cyborg 3: Recycler" is the third (and last far) entry in the CYBORG trilogy. The first film was originally planned as a continuation of MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE, but it was quickly transformed into a standard post-apocalyptic martial arts festival, which became something of an iconic classic because of the bad action scenes. CYBORG 2: GLASS SHADOW was a sequel that actually improved in relation to its predecessor, but it was not widely seen (and was rejected by those few who perceived it as a cheap feed). <br /> <br /> This film, firstly, tries to be a combination of the first two films (the first was a tacky action movie, while the second was a smart story about Cyberpunk), but unfortunately it does not meet both criteria. The budget was of course lower than CYBORG 2, and the film was set in desert wastelands (like many post-apocalyptic action movies from the 1990s) filmed in old industrial buildings to save costs. <br /> <br /> The story of the film focuses on a story machine, a story of a pregnant cyborg that is as interesting as it is absurd (this film is not the first to try this idea; the OVA ARMITAGE III series uses it more ). But the film falls into the same trap, the victims of which are so many low-cost science-fiction movies that hooked (synthetic organisms) are just androids. Visual effects are nothing more than prosthetic arms and makeup effects. <br /> <br /> Acting is quite standard for this kind of film, with the main actress (Khrystyne Haje) as the worst performer on the screen. Instead of joy because of the news that she is pregnant, she behaves like a wryta and grim. Her stars are much better, Malcolm McDowell is a typical gangster who animates the scenes in which she appears, and Richard Lynch has a great time playing as the main villain. Particularly noteworthy is Andrew Byniarski, who plays Lynch's right hand, who will later appear in the remake of THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE and his prequel.
