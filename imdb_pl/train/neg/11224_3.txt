... and even then even they can live without seeing it. Honestly, this movie (if it's called that) is really interesting only for slavery freaks. Fans of Bettie Page will not learn absolutely anything new (and I mean * nothing *), nor will they enjoy the warm fuzzami of experiencing anything familiar, beloved or valued. <br /> <br /> There is no point in a bleak scenario, wooden, less than a theater community, a complete lack of direction, poor lighting or any other production value in a bargain basement. It's definitely "Hey, children, let's make a movie!" Making movies in the lowest order. I suppose you can be grateful that at least they knew how to start the camera. No, I am sorry to say that none of this is important, why this thing is so simple * evil *. <br /> <br /> It's bad because a young lady playing Bettie Page, a somewhat mischievous girl whose only resemblance to Queen Krzywe is her dark hair and bangs of a trademark, completely brings nothing to the role except to be tied up and gagged. This is clearly a good thing for her film career before and from this miserable excess, but not for the miserable surplus, which consists mainly of many beautifully reproduced B & D fragments placed between horrible biographic scenes outlining Ms The Fall of Grace (so to speak) . There is probably more information about the life of Page in the beginning and end credits than the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled. This is not a worthy movie accompanying the "Notorious Bettie Page". This is not a worthy movie at all. It is a fetish piece that trades the charm of one of the biggest pin-ups of all time and does it without class, without style and without a real sense of Bettie Page character understanding. No real fan of Bettie Page will consider him a disappointment, I guarantee it. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. If you are free, remember that time is also money. Yours may not be worth much, but I bet it is worth it, that you will be sorry that you wasted your time on it. That's all, I'm done, you've been warned.
