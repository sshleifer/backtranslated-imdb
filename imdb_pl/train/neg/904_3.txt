"Stella", starring Bette Midler in the title role, is an inveterate squeezer of tears. Located in the north of New York, Stella Claire works as a bar maid, pouring and dancing in the living room for workers. One night there comes the tap of a medical intern, Stephen Dallas, who woos Stella, and during their affair impregnates her. He rejects both his marriage and abortion proposals, sends him to a lucrative medical career and raises his daughter in extreme poverty. 16 years old, and my daughter became a wonderful, loving, young lady. Dr Dallas is not excluded, still maintaining a fragile but caring relationship with her daughter and ?? Acting and the script are so exaggerated that you will moan almost in every scene. The main criminal is Bette Midler, but right behind him is John Goodman as her alcohol buddy. Each scene seems more imaginary than the previous one until the final, which is really hoot. This film, adopted as a drama, has nothing more than Grade D, but as a camp it wins unintentional B +. <br /> <br />
