Happy Go Lovely is a waste of time and talent for everyone, including the audience. The lightness of the old, wrong identity and false lines of scandal are forgivable. Very few people watched these films for their stories. But usually they had some interesting small characters involved in sub-threads - not here. They usually had an interesting choreography and breathtaking dances and catchy songs. No Happy Go Lovely. And Vera-Ellen, as a female leader, played the whole movie as a second banana, who was desperately looking for a star who would play it - and instead she was asked to make a movie and could not do it. The Scottish apartment was wasted. Usually, omnipresent droll Scottish whims are absent automatically. Photography was for pedestrians. Music numbers were for pedestrians. Cesar Romero gives his usual professional performance, chewing the scenery, because no one else has played the role of producer, often described by Walter Abel and Adolph Menjou. David Niven is okay and no one could have done David Niven like David Niven. At the end of the day, if you love Niven like me, that's reason enough to waste 90 minutes on Happy Go Lovely. If not, skip this.
