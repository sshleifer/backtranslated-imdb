This movie was a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> I accept the opposition of critics. This is not the case when the material does not correspond to the level of actors; here the actors (Bette Davis and James Cagney) are not just material. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were just as big as Davis and Cagney, and look how it turned out that One Happened One Night - all-time classic. With a very similar story, Davis proves that she has no talent for comedy (well, that is the only comedy she has ever tried!) Davis' one-note performance exudes irritation, but none of the nuances of acting in It Happened One Night. Cagney, who was a great comedian, just seems to be out of sync with his costar Davis. The script contains a few decent lines and gags, but delivering seems more suited to drama than comedy. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is the soundtrack, which, like the delivery of Davis and Cagney, seems a more appropriate light drama than a comedy. <br /> <br /> Jack Carson, who played similar roles throughout his career, dealt with a very similar material. In a fairly typical supporting role, Eugene Palette provides a decent performance. In a slightly different role than the old western relic, Harry Davenport, is very good. But in one of his worst appearances, William Frawley is quite annoying. The constant reference of his characters to fictional cops is a weak attempt at irony. <br /> <br /> I really love each of these artists and it's a pity that as a team they do not achieve more chemistry and do not have a better result than The Bride Came C.O.D.
