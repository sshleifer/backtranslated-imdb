Alan Alda plays real writer "Sports Illustrated" George Plimpton, who was once invited to the Detroit Lions football team as an honorary member. A rather pale, incomplete drama interested in fantasy. Director Alex March makes an interesting thread on this material, taking photos in a quasi-documentary style (with commentary macho), and at the same time giving stories a bit of a capricious fantasy; Still, by showing cinematic brilliance in this configuration, it turns the main narrative into chaos. Satisfied, unshakable performance by Alda is another difficulty, although the supporting cast is filled with real pro-athletes (and Lauren Hutton shimmering as Alda's girlfriend - how is it with fantasy?). * 1/2 of ****
