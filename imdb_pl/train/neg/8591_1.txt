I'm trying to decide if jumping into a wood shredder would be more pleasant than the thrill. It ends with the destruction of what used to be a classic pair of movies. With Jedi, Menace, Clowns and Sith, we have the death of Lucas' career. He wants us to swallow Annakina, which is Vader's nonsense? I never believed that it was true. This movie confirms these feelings. History has not worked since Phantom Moron, and every new movie simply applied nonsense, until only the parade of toys remained. I have to go. I know where there are any new rocks to throw. Do you want spoilers? Coming. Luke and Leia are NOT related. Vader is NOT their father. Duke Countoo should change the page while he can still. Yoda has less verbal skills than Yogi Berra. His advice was never good to anyone. Obi Wan lied to Luke for the first two films. Annakin did not build C3P0. He found him in the desert and lied to his mother that he created it from scratch. Chewbacca has fleas. This whole mess with Vader and the fall of the Republic can be blamed for that stupid b *** h Amma-Lamma-Ding-Dong. If she had any brains, she would not have come in a light year from Annie, but she'd said what George Lucas had written for her. What a drug!
