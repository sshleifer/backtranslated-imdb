My wife and I are partly amused by Howie Mandela's performance .. I also like Shatner - even when he's the most pathetic ... <br /> <br /> But this is the absolute worst performance on TV. <br /> <br /> Cancel this program. It sucks **. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can say is that girls are hotter at this concert and seem to wear less clothing than Deal or no Deal ... <br /> <br /> Questions are a mix of too-easy and unbelievable questions. And watching Shatner or the player says "Show me the money" makes me want to vomit ... <br /> <br /> This one will not last long.
