I'm glad I saw this movie after Mr. Sandler became famous. <br /> <br /> It's bad ... bad, bad, bad. There is no story. It's like watching a painfully boring home movie. <br /> <br /> I really like his other movies ...... but if you're a fan like me ... stay away from it. It can change your thoughts about Adam. You can never regain your strength after the horror movie is ... I had a better time watching old people playing scrabble at home .......
