Why is this exhibition so popular? This is above me why people like it. I think it's one of the worst comedy series. <br /> <br /> Because it's so popular, I tried it more than once and I can not go the whole episode. <br /> <br /> First of all, acting is terrible. Everyone is concerned that watching is annoying. They speak with unnatural voices, use unnatural tones and have an unnatural body language. I've seen better acting in a kindergarten school performance. <br /> <br /> Second, it's NOT FUNNY. The plots are boring. They are not creative, intelligent or funny. Should sitcom not be fun? Why do not I laugh? <br /> <br /> At the end, what is the seventies? It's just as authentic in the seventies as 'Happy Days' was in the fifties. <br /> <br /> What's up with Ashton Kutcher? Who threw this talented dweeb? And now he's making movies? Oh, save us all! <br /> <br /> If people think that this is a high quality television, it worries me.
