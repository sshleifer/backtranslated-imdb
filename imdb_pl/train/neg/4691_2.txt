A real movie explosion literally. This British movie is boring. <br /> <br /> What an exciting plot! The terrorist places bombs on the train. How could the writers and producers of this stinker turn this into a boring story? <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford, an expert called for unloading a bomb, gets a horrible writing material. Of course, as he is called, his wife, Anne Vernon, intends to leave him. No wonder we've never heard of Miss Vernon. After such a film, it would be enough to end her career. <br /> <br /> The older man who loved trains and disturbed is our version of the 1962 old dementia. I thought it was very offensive to show this man, even at the end.
