So that night I decided to watch Tales from the Hollywood Hills: Natica Jackson. Or Power, Passion, Murder, as it is called in the Netherlands. When I bought the movie, I noticed that Michelle Pfeiffer played in it and thought I had to say something about quality. Unfortunately not. <br /> <br /> 1) The plot is really misleading. There are two feature lines during the film. Only they have nothing to do with each other. Throughout the film, I've been waiting for the moment when these two fictional lines will be combined, so the plot will be clear to me. But it still is not. <br /> <br /> 2) The title of the movie says that the movie will be about Natice Jackson. Sometimes it happens. As the film said, it includes two different stories, and the part about Natice Jackson is the shortest. So the next title of this movie would not be a bad choice. <br /> <br /> At the end of my story, I really recommend that you leave this movie where it belongs on the shelf in the store in a place that nobody can see. By doing this, you will not waste 90 minutes of your life, just like me.
