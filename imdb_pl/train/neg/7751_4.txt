First of all, CGI in this movie was terrible. I watched him during a marathon of bad films on the SciFi channel. At the end, when the park owner is killed, this is probably one of the worst CGI examples I've ever seen. Even Night of the Living Dead had better animation. <br /> <br /> He said the movie almost did not have a story. Why were they especially on this island? Well, it was not in the movie. And why did people still come to the cat area? Does not make sense. <br /> <br /> One thing that stood out in this movie is a moderately good game. In the film "B made for TV" acting was very good. Parry Shen stood out in particular. <br /> <br /> If you have absolutely nothing to do on Saturday, watch this movie. This can be good for some unforgettable quotes.
