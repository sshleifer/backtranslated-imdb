I mean, I thought I heard this dialogue in the movie, but it was so bad and out of place that I really can not believe it. I laughed so much about what must have been the worst writing and action in human history, I was seriously concerned that I could have a heart attack and die in the theater. <br /> <br /> So this is the scene I'm talking about, the "hero" just watched as his brother crashed, and the car of his brothers exploded next to him (the hero). The "hero" threw the expected "fit", seeing something so tragic, and people tried to stop him from falling into a burning car. <br /> <br /> In the middle of his match and his uncontrollable anger / emotional breakdown says "I'm so sad" - said it well? Am I crazy?
