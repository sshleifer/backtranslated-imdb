The battleship is sinking ... His survivors, hanging on a nearby life raft, sit and do nothing while we enter their minds into a series of long retrospectives. <br /> <br /> Although the name of Noel Coward is just one that you will notice during the subtitles, everything in it is caused by Lean. And technically it is very good. David Lean only KNEW movies from the very beginning. There are many moments in which Coward's research dialogue takes second place, and the Lean visual sense occupies a central place. Try the soldiers leaving the ship at the end and the whole scene; shot in the direction of singing hymns, the scene in which we are at home, which is bombed. <br /> <br /> Noel Coward is one of the worst actors I've ever seen. It is completely wooden, it does not show emotion, character or humanity. You see in his eyes that he does not really listen to what the other performer is saying, he just waits for them to finish so that he can hurry with his own line. <br /> <br /> 7/10. <Br /> <br /> It's episodic, a bit repetitive, and memories overwhelm history: there is no central story that goes forward, it just gives a general view of the character. Nevertheless, it is an interesting movie worth watching - and a good Lean debut. It is not a very deep or penetrating film, it is definitely a propaganda film, but also a presentation of the editorial skills of Lean - all about how the songs are connected.
