I went to this movie, expecting it to be similar to The Matrix or Pi. Boy, I was wrong. Yes, the film has a poorly written, poorly preserved plot (with animated CG cells and peptides to run). However, the true purpose of the movie is "silly" talking heads spewing the new age of well-being between the story segments. <br /> <br /> Sure, it sticks out innocently. At the beginning there is some real quantum physics. It states, for example, that electrons exist both as a particle and a wave, and that an atom is usually an empty space. However, the film makes a huge (and unscientific) leap, saying that subatomic quantum effects also occur on large scales. Talking heads take it even further. According to them, the real ones are: <br /> <br /> - When Columbus arrived in the Caribbean, the natives were unable to see his ships because their minds were unable to see something so different. -Meditation can reduce the murder rate. -You can walk on the water with positive thought. - Your thoughts can change the formations of ice crystals in bottles of water. <br /> <br /> And hey, it's only in the first 40 minutes! <br /> <br /> Watching the movie was torture. This movie gave the impression of a movie that would show you to join the cult. After doing my homework, I realized that it is simply. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it can be seen as a comic comedy (although it's not fun). <br /> <br /> Save time and money: do not watch this movie.
