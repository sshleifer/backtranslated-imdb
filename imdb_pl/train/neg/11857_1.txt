The worst movie ever !!! See real movie reviews from the pros in this video. Check out Rotten Tomatoes online for several independent reviews on this video. The comments on this site are apparently from people with some financial interest in this film. I think that positive comments are very misleading. I am amazed at how negative comments are so bad about this movie, and positive comments sound like a speech at the Academy. Do not waste your hard-earned money !!!!!! This movie is delayed !! I can not believe that such a film will ever be made. Why should Hollywood waste time on such garbage? This movie is a trial of nothing. I ask myself what looser, in fact, would sink his money, producing such garbage. I went to the hit, and the assistant even told us not to waste time or money. I did not listen and waste time and money. Please do not make the same mistake! It's really "the worst movie ever made!"
