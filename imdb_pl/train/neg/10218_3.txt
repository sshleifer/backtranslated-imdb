** Spoilers included ** <br /> <br /> I have heard from various sources that this movie was controversial and that the ending was particularly frightening. I did not expect a total change of tack for about twenty minutes. What begins with a typical cowboy / Indian western suddenly turns into a very boring romantic "comedy" about Honus (Soldier Blue in the title played by Peter Strauss) and Cresta (Candice Bergen), who escape the cavalry attack. Most of the film then focuses on these two unmatched people, hence the romantic comedy. Donald Pleasance then appears and kidnaps them for no apparent reason. They then flee and both appear (separately) in the cavalry base on the eve of the attack on the Cheyenne base. When Cresta was married to one of Cheyenne's chiefs, he escapes from the cavalry base and joins them. So far so ordinary. Then comes the end. After more than an hour of bad acting, in which they dress with each other, they will not connect with each other in the story, and then the film turns into a exploitation consisting, among other things, in cutting off the head and shooting the child in the back of the head. Similarities can be drawn using Wild Bunch at this point in the movie, but Wild Bunch retains the same tone and does not resort to extreme disinterested violence. In some respects, Soldier Blue reminds me of Frank Perry's last summer, which completely changed the tack at the end of the shock. I did not hate the Blue Soldier, nor did I consider the ending particularly disturbing, but it turned out to be quite boring because of unnecessarily brutal ending. If you want to see a movie with a truly disturbing slaughter of innocents, I recommend Elema Klimova Come and See.
