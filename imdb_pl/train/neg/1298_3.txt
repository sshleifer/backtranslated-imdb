Sogo Ishii can be a qualified filmmaker in the right conditions, but Gojoe tells the story of a warrior monk and his only rival, descendant of the Genji clan. The film has the main features of low-budget production, including blurred combat scenes and clumsy assemblies (such as can be found in underdeveloped doram). Monk Benkei informs his spiritual teacher that his destiny is to overcome the mysterious spirit that protects the Gojoe bridge at night, but he does not realize that this decision will lead him directly to a conflict with almost every element of society at that time - but who could deserve enlightenment. <br /> <br /> There is, however, no lack of ambition in presenting the conflict between the saint and the world. Artsy flourishes in some photographs and editions to compensate for the loose style of making movies. <br /> <br /> Disappointment.
