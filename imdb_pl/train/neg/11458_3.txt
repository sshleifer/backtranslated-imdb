I am pleased to remember the period of greatness of Bo Derek and the attention of the British press (especially mucky Sun & News of the World) - everyone after her small role in "10" with Dudley Moore. Understandably, there has been a lot of confusion with her photogenic face, crystal-clear blue eyes and perfectly shaped bouncing breasts. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, acting is and has never been its strong point! I think that they should create one of the three-fold collection of discs that you will always find in the chance DVD packages - Orca, Tarzan the Ape-man and Bolero. All of these films could be nominated for "So bad they are great." <br /> <br /> It would be a "need to buy" guilty! If you ever read your press or Mrs. Derek's comment, please do not be offended - you have always had a weakness for you, and the world is more important than worrying about the game. Lots of Love.x
