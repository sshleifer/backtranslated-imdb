I can not say it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. But on the other hand, I can not say it's one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> OK, it's basically a girl skating, she's good at it, she wants to go to an expensive school, I can not afford it and she has to take a scholarship on the ice. He must hide his secret of skating in front of his friends. <br /> <br /> Personally, I did not like the actress playing Katelin. Absolutely, she could not cry to save her life, she just gave out the failing sounds, like a toddler pretending to cry, to get her own way. <br /> <br /> Katelin was just an annoying person. The way she tried to act for everyone was nice and helpful. Also the part where both skaters call her names and say something about her choreography, and she says she "draws the line", made me embarrassed. <br /> <br /> We all knew where it would go and Spencer. Classically, they did not like each other, and at the end the meeting was just typical. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think it's a movie to watch if you like skating, but if you do not mind, the main skater is very annoying. It's good to kill time basically.
