I went to this movie hoping for the best. I like musicals from war times in general. Dick Powell and Lucille Ball did a good job with their roles; however, the writers gave them a boring dialogue. A loving interest between them did not give any real growth; it was suddenly there. I did not think much about music; the best number was the fragment we heard about Spikeu Jones from "Der Fuhrer's Face". One complete number that Spike Jones had little of his great musical comedy; quite tame things, even with a monkey. The comedic scrawl of Bert Lahr was infinite. <br /> <br /> There were parts to be enjoyed: Lucille Ball was quite an interesting viewer and there was a good selection of bit players who really deserved more time on the screen.
