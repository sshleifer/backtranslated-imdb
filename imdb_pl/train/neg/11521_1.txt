This movie is really one of the worst pieces of trash in history. It's really surprising that something so terrible can be done. But if you can withstand numbness, character development and direction, you can break away from the soundtrack, which is so frightening that it is fun. The film begins terribly and quickly becomes impossible to watch. Someone should give someone involved in this movie some comfort, because his career was probably ruined because of involvement in the movie. If you finish watching this movie or have already seen it (I feel your pain), these words came too late. For everyone else, stay away at any price or be aware that the movie is so bad it will waste 2 hours of your life. Then at least you can clean up or see something.
