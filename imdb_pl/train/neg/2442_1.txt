I do not know why I'm still doing this !! I still defend the Dutch and Belgian cinema and say that it should get more credits and chances ... and then you hit your head with a laughter like this! Intensive Care is a terrible production and probably the worst thing ever to happen in Dutch-speaking countries. This is a Dutch attempt to create our own series of horror films, clearly based on basic American classic slashers such as Friday 13 and Halloween. Producers and authors wrote very high, but they fell really low. Intensive Care has become an embarrassing product for everyone who has been involved, and therefore a real cult movie here. It is almost impossible to hunt for the original copy of this and it is only shown for special occasions, such as "Night of Disgust". Exactly 5 minutes, Intensive Care tries to tell a story, and even create a story ... then it changes into a movie about poor and low-brain madness with macabre - but very funny and cheap - makeup effects. The acting of the entire cast is disgusting, although some respected names are involved. The leading male role is played by Koen Wauters ... This guy may very well be the best known and beloved artist in Belgium. He is a beloved singer, host of television programs and an idol of many young girls. But he never mentions the thing in which he played. Like everyone in the Netherlands, he tries to convince himself that Intensive Care never happened.
