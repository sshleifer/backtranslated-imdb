Holy cow, what a piece of this movie. I did not know how the filmmakers could take a 250-letter book with them and turn it into a movie. I do not think they knew either! I do not remember any fart or burping in the book, right? <br /> <br /> They took it all the time, the children's classic, added some farts, belches and sexual inuindo, and prostituted him with KAKA joke. That should give you a good idea of ​​what Hollywood producers think. I must say that it was visually interesting, but the brilliant visual story is ruined by the toilet humor (if you even think that such things are funny) I DO NOT want the children I know think it to be. > <br /> Do not take children goodbye, do not rent a DVD. I hope that spirit spirit Doctor Suess will appear who persecutes the people who created this movie.
