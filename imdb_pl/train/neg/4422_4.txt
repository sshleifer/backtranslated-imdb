This one is a real bomb. We should believe that Merle Oberon is the hidden daughter of an ambitious politician who must prove to Tom DeLay in the thirties that he is worthy of support as a presidential candidate. Poor Merle can not go anywhere, but he is surrounded by politicians and their shaky, shaking wives and supported only by kind-hearted Harry Davenport. He joins two blinds on a blind date, and Gary Cooper appears. Some rodeo shots could revive things, and la "Misfits", but without that luck. Gary later breaks into a formal dinner at which Merle presides, and although he is invited to sit and join the group, he reads a lecture about their snobbism. Where did the sudden eloquence of this uncertain cowboy come from? The most frightening scene in the film is the spectral event that Gary keeps in his unfinished home for his absent wife, Merle. Will it never end? One to avoid.
