It's the worst movie I've ever seen. I was about to get up and go out on Tape 4, but I threw him out. Now I consider myself a masochist! Afghanistan? Give people! Who is an idiot who forgot to hide Sanskrit billboards? I thought the main actor (George Calil) was particularly inept. Apart from bad behavior and feverish camera shake, I thought that using the events of September 11 as the reason for "Larson the Lunatic Implodes" on the screen next to you was disgraceful and disrespectful to the victims of September 11. Using the phone from Larson's wife Sarah, apparently from one of the terrorist aircraft that day, it was terrifying. Shaking the camera did not make me feel nauseous.
