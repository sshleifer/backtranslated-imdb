Ronald Reagan and a group of American soldiers in the North Korean POW camp. They are tortured ... We learn that North Korean communists are bad people ... We learn that Americans' beards grow very slowly during torture days ... <br /> <br /> I tried to stop it, but in the end I burst out laughing from this movie. It was a scene when Mr. Reagan comes out telling the communists that he wants to be on their side. Then he asks for a bottle of brandy. Then, keeping cold sobriety, he takes a drunken companion, Dewey Martin, for sulfur to heal Martin's hangover. Of course, the North Korean communist guards are as stupid as they appear. So the drunkard distracts the guard, while Reagan goes to get something from the drawer next to the empty boxes. I'm sure the boxes were supposed to contain something; but of course Reagan makes him shake enough to reveal that they are empty. You have to laugh! I think that "Prisoner of War" will refer mainly to the family and friends of those who worked on it - otherwise it is a waste. <br /> <br /> * Prisoner of War (1954) Andrew Marton ~ Ronald Reagan, Steve Forrest, Dewey Martin
