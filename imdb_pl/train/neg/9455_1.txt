Well, I think I know the answer to this question. For money! We were so bombarded by Cat In The Hat advertisements and goods that we almost believe that there must be something good in this film. I admit, I thought the trailers looked bad, but I still had to give them a chance. I should have followed my instincts. It was a complete Hollywood piece. Once again proving that the average person can be programmed to believe what they say is good, it must be good. In addition to the abusive fact that the film only lasts about 80 minutes, of course, he began with the eaten moths scenario. It is a flap full of unsuccessful attempts at meaningless humor and horrible pastel scenery. He is jumping all over the universe without any purpose or direction. This is then combined with ............................ yes, I will say this, BAD ACTION! I could not help it, but I felt that I was watching "Coffee Talk" on SNL every time Mike Myers opened his mouth. Was Kot supposed to be a middle-aged Jew? Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning were not a reward either, but Mr. Myers should disappear somewhere under the rock until he is ready for the next Austin Powers movie. F-, no stars, 0 on a scale of 1-10. Save money!
