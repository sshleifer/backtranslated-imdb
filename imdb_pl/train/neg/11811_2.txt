You know when you're on the bus and someone decides to tell you your life story, and you sit there with a pathetic smile on your face when all you really want to do is hit the fool and leave? Well, I had a similar sensation while watching this movie. Ok, I decided to go and see Aprile, and I knew about Nanni Moretti's liking to make himself the only star of Caro Diario, but after about half an hour of this last part of his memories I wanted to give Moretti madre all the slap. Caro Diario was funny, unusual and at least some other characters managed to get a word in the margin. But in Aprile Moretti has exclusive rights to dialogue, so all you hear for an hour and a half is a high moan about how his politics is the best, or what a weird piece of popular culture tickles his fantasy at this moment. He also finds time to refuse films that he does not like, something that I thought was reserved for losers like me. Certainly being in a position like him, one would think that he would try to do something about the cinema a bit more intelligently than this. Maybe thanks to the right movie, with some ideas and a decent structure, or maybe one that is not completely dominated by an annoying voice. And when he began to sit down over his newborn child, I just wanted to be accompanied by someone normal, preferably not obsessed with the film director with a strange tendency to sticky music. The next time someone who you do not know tries to tell you your life story, give me a slap. Each blow will be a small victory in the fight against morety.
