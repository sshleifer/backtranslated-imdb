I watched Written on The Wind starring Rock Hudson, Lauren Becall, Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone - Robert Stack was awful - just damn awful - he was supposed to be a charming millionaire - instead he went away like a moron from the word Go - the story was stupid and overgrown, and 3 "romantic" threads did not have chemistry. Dorothy Malone somehow won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress - though her campus tramp character was boring - think of an older sister with Splendor in the Grass filled with malice and bitterness that lacks charisma. Director Douglas Sirk transferred the entire cast through a dialogue that was forced, and the end result is a waste of 99 minutes. He had an actor's episode who played the lead at Get Smart
