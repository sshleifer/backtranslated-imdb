It could have been a good episode, but I had to turn it off. The British national team was terrible to watch. Did the artists ever set foot in Britain before filming? At least a foot in England? I do not think any Briton would have such accent beyond the comic sketch of The Royal Family! Also for two English boys ... well, I do not think any English boyfriend would act, talk or dress like any English kid in the history of the British nation since preteen Prince and Harry. To American filmmakers. There are more than 1 country in Great Britain. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland ... which means more than one culture! I can deal with stereotypes, but it was so bad that I could not see it. The fire looked cool!
