Wesley Snipes is James Dial, a rental killer, a CIA agent and a pure special agent. In his spare time, he chooses a cowboy hat and raises horses with the names of macho, such as Beauty. <br /> <br /> Enter Agent Collins, his supervising officer. Enter a new task - kill a terrorist in custody in Great Britain. Of course, the United Kingdom being an allied state is a perfect place for secret operations and shots outside court rooms. <br /> <br /> The attack is a big success, except that the escape plan was successful. So Dial's partner and local liaison are killed in action trying to escape the police while Dial becomes a hot property, and the London cops try to get to him and the CIA trying to get rid of him. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for Dial the safe home is routinely visited by teen Emily Day (Eliza Bennett), who loves to spend time with cold-blooded killers with arrest warrants and help them escape bad British law enforcement agencies ... < br /> <br /> With a script like this, I say more? On the plus side, Wesley Snipes is Wesley Snipes (whether it's a professional or a con), and the movie is quite addictive. The editing is very divergent and has an effect on the stomach.
