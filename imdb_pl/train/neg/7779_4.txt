The "true" story of the late monster that appears when an American industrial plant begins to pollute the water. Playful, though not very good, movie about monsters has many people who are trying to get a monster and find out what's going on, but not in a completely engaging way. Give him points for giving us a huge monster that they clearly built to scale in some scenes, but take some because it looks like a harmless puppy. The fun operating movie is pleasantly stupid in a good mood. (My only complaint is that the print used in the Elvira edition is so weak that it looks like a well-used copy of a videotape that's been 20 years ago).
