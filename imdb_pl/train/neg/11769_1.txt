Someone owes Ang Lee an apology. Actually, many people do it. And I will start. I have never been interested in the movie Ang Lee Hulk, because of almost unanimous bad reviews. Even the best cable ducts seemed to rarely show them. In the end, I decided to watch it yesterday on the web in USA and, wow .... <br /> <br /> SPOILERS FOR LUDZI ANG LEE AND NIESAMOWITEJ HULK <br /> <br /> Was it boring! I almost did not get Ang Lee to Hulk. Eric Bana was expressionless, Nick Nolte was horrible, Sam Elliott was unlike himself (and it's not funny, he's usually a nice character). I really think they chose Eric Bana because his indescribable face was the easiest to follow with computer graphics - and it was clear that Ang Lee Hulk supposed to be similar to Bruce Banner in his state of discontent. When Hulk fought the mutated poodle, I was ready to admit Hulk as the worst superhero movie. <br /> <br /> But then something happened. About three-quarters of the way through this boring movie, it was truly exciting and - I dare say it - quite convincing - an extended action scene that begins with the escape of the Hulk from the holding room in the military base, the fight with M1 tanks and Comanche helicopters in the desert then riding the R22 F22 to the stratosphere to be caught on the streets of San Francisco. It was one of the best sequences of actions created in the movie about superheroes. And I must say that CGI was quite good. It does not mean that Hulk was completely convincing. However, it did not require a greater suspension of disbelief than is required in many action movies other than superheroes. And this is no mean feat. <br /> <br /> Of course the ending became really stupid when Bruce Banner's father turned into a kind of changeable villain, but the previous long sequence of actions shamed the short heroism of Iron Man. And in general, apart from animated mutants, it really seemed that CGI in Hulku tried very hard to convince you that it is real and really interacts with its environment. It certainly was better than I expected. <br /> <br /> OK, but what about The Incredible Hulk? Guess what ... It's boring too! He has only a few Hulk performances and here's the thing - CGI in this movie is awful. Perhaps the Hulk version of Anga Lee sometimes looked false and on others he was drawn in cartoons - but he also had his convincing moments. The amazing Hulk looked ridiculous. It had a shade of skin and muscle tension that did not even look like a living creature, just a type of computer generated texture. It was really ridiculous. Light, environmental and facial effects did not look five years older than those of Ang Lee, they looked 10 years older. And there really is no excuse for it. We really live in a time when computer programmers can spoil a movie as accurately as any director, actor or cinematographer ever could. <br /> <br /> Worse, the writer and director of this film seemed almost nothing to "Fail" Ang Lee. All the same mistakes are committed. Bruce Banner is practically devoid of emotion. The general is so unrelenting, unbelievably one-dimensional that he seems to be a faker than the Hulk. Interest in love is unconvincing (I have to admit that Liv Tyler is more emotional than Jennifer Connelly, although both are fairly easy on the eyes). Tim Blake Nelson almost the same as Nick Nolte, even though he's only in the movie for a few minutes. Hulk does not really do much in this film, certainly not more than in the Ang Lee version. The Incredible Hulk was a bit faster, but because nothing really happened, it's not worth much. Oh yes, the villain is just as insidious as Hulk. In fact, it is much more interesting as a human than a monster. <br /> <br /> In this way, I can definitely say that the Ang Lee version was better: if I ever have the opportunity to see the version of Ang Lee again, maybe I can sit through it to see good action sequences, or in another If you try, try to appreciate the dialogue even more (it's more likely that you just scroll through the good parts). But in The Incredible Hulk, there is absolutely no single scene that is worth seeing once, let alone twice. This is really a heap of superhero movies. Animated CGI is an insult to the public - at least in the Anga Lee version it looks like they tried to make it happen (of course with the exception of the giant poodle). <br /> <br /> This is absolutely in mind - amazing how the filmmakers wanted to erase the bad feelings associated with Hulk Ang Lee, doing almost exactly the same movie. <br /> <br /> This is thanks to Edward Norton, who seems to distance himself from this film.
