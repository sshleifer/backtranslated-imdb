A scary movie that is supposed to be independent. He needed some addiction to something. <br /> <br /> This completely unhappy movie concerns the interaction between the Irish. Have you tried to imitate the great movie "Crash"? If so, this movie crashed completely. <br /> <br /> Just too much is happening here, and the culmination is running a little brat and throwing stones at buses and cars, which of course causes chaos. > The movie is too sharp for it to work. One woman loses her husband after 14 years and her younger sister is cheated by a competitor. This causes the previous sister to become bitter vet and walk in clothes that are not worth believing. The older sister is also embittered but soon finds an affair. <br /> <br /> Then we have 3 losers who buy masks to rob the bank. Of course, the robbery does not work, but it seems that there is no punishment for cheaters. Perhaps the punishment should rest with the writers for failure to create a coherent movie.
