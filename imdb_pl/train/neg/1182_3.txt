This movie is little more than badly done, fetish porn, and that says a lot, considering similar nonsense that was made in that era. This was recommended to me by a friend as a "unique movie experience". He was right. I suppose he meant a joke. Not disgusting, not even shocking. Just average acting and bad attempts at shock art. Some of the value of the camp, although I do not think that the creators of this film had such intentions. And, as the previous reviewer mentioned, it's sex with a guy in a bear suit. Do not spend a lot of money on it. Try to borrow it if you have to see it. Or contact me, I will gladly sell you my copy for half price. <br /> <br /> I may have to see another film from this particular director, because it seems to have some consequences. But if this is something, I regret again that my 2 hours of life are gone forever.
