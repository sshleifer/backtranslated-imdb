I remember one Tuesday, exactly on June 18, 2002. I was napping, trying to convince myself to get out of bed when I heard a terrible explosion. I went to the kitchen, where I have a view of several districts in south Jerusalem and saw a pillar of smoke rising from a distant point, the sight of the smoke was followed a minute later by pounding sirens. I remember how I rushed to my bedroom, taking out my binoculars, returning to the kitchen and noticing the image of the broken glass. The bus was still near the receiving station where the terrorist boarded and murdered 25 passengers with one click to the TNT device, many of whom were on their way to school. My good friend's wife was sitting in the back row bus, a seemingly arbitrary and senseless decision that saved her life. <br /> <br /> I am sure that every Israeli has at least one terror - a similar memory that he would never want to have, and it was only a matter of time before someone made a film about it. As it turned out later, the film was supposed to become a suppressed memory of its own. <br /> <br /> The film is about dry writing art, Haim Buzaglo (he played the character, hmmm, Haim Buzaglo, who also wrote and directed the film), who spends most of the day running open competitions with his empty page a text editor. In the meantime, his girlfriend, a reporter in the Israeli commercial channel, decides to do a piece about a former officer with debt. Buzaglo, bored and somewhat paranoid because of the syndrome of "what on earth, it's a hot darling, he's dating me", asks a private eye about making out about his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> As a detective, he acts in his investigation, his observations permeate art and later the life of its actors. In the meantime, art transforms from a comic book into an accusation against the restraint of Israeli society. As for the film, well, the movie becomes a crazy editing exercise, put in its tiny cardboard figures and incredible dialogues, while drifting away from the subject it was about to deal with. > When I say "cardboard characters", I refer to characters who, under the obsession of the scriptwriter / director for a "significant" movie, were devoid of real dialogues and a bit of honesty. I will not talk much about it. Suffice it to say that I am sure that homeless male prostitutes rarely go to the theater. With the intention of looking at art, i.e. <br /> <br /> This film according to Haim Buzaglo himself is the first part of the current trilogy of the program. I sincerely hope that the other two films will be derived from experiences such as those I wrote about at the beginning of my review, in contrast to the isolated world of characters that do not exist and have nothing interesting. <Br> /> <br /> 4 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter. <br /> <br /> PS This film was a breakthrough in austerity policy. It was filmed in ten days, the entire cast was working for free, and the total cost of the film was about $ 12,000 (no, I did not skip zero or two, twelve thousand dollars). You wonder why the Blair witch's project took $ 34,000.
