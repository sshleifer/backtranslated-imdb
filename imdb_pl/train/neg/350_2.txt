Fishbourne's appearances (which seem strangely funny) and (short description) Ed Harris are unusual, unlike Connery, who seems to make no sense in his role and ends with the motoric behavior of an 80-year-old man. In fact, the scenario does not make sense; imagine 60 minutes. happy end-plot plus a sudden addition to the bend without any argumentative structure in relation to the character. It's more like an accident than a script and it can be useful for exam purposes at film schools. The more you recall details, the stronger this impression. The death penalty is not a problem here, although it has been the subject from the very beginning; it seems to disappear without further comment. The subject and the environment could be good.
