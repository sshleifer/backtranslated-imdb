Poor Robert Englund performs another flop and at the expense of Tobe Hooper, which usually creates quite good horror movies, but in this case he failed. Englund plays well-known Marque De Sade, who in the 17th century was imprisoned for being obsessed with the pain and pleasure of bringing pain to herself and others. This story is so confusing with a flap from one century to another and I was wrong about what was going on and what the purpose of the movie was. I only saw a young woman who was imprisoned by a strange lesbian who decides to keep her for herself, and this young lady is fascinated by this Arab with a lot of money and learns that she is going to kill her, and then Englund enters the century to another, claiming that he is a descendant of de Sade and tries to kill her because Madam Momoselle reminded him (written so badly) or whatever she was in the picture above the wall of De Sades. The movie was awful, I'm surprised Hooper for Englund in this movie, and the special effects were so false and funny, especially the part with eyes. Englund tries to get back from his hit Nightmare on Elm St. using these extraction and removal needles to extinguish people's eyes. Horrible, absolutely horrible.
