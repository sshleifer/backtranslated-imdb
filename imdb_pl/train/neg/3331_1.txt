Dreck about three beautiful women in California who go to a festival (or something like that). All hotels are booked, so they must spend the night in a terrifying old house. They do not know that there is a terrifying resident who likes to kill ... <br /> <br /> Yawns. Boring, senseless, completely stupid movie "horror". Bach and her two pals are certainly beautiful, but the movie itself is boring, boring DULL! Bach and her friends are not actresses - their faces are empty. The final "revelation" is ridiculously predictable and there is no blood or blood to interest you along the way. There is an expected feminine nudity, but it is not enough to save it. Boring, aimless and unknown (not without reason). And 1 to the end.
