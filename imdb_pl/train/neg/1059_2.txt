I watched the movie last night and I'm struggling to remember it. The story is about a group of criminals who are escaping from the cosmic penal colony. They fly to the moon in a space bin; when they terrorize dumpsters who work in Moonbase. <br /> <br /> It strikes me that junk low-budget sci-fi movies often include either desert planets or, like this movie, criminals fleeing the colony. Why do not I have a clue. But I can say with certainty that such films are always diabolical. This one really is not an exception. It starts quite well with a decent credit sequence and halfway the good soundtrack of dance music. Then it turns into a boring science fiction thriller. In fact, in this movie, there are not so many consequences that I literally try to write a helpful review, so if you read this, I'm sorry that I can not enlighten you in the subtleties and nuances of the film. As a reminder, I remember the arduous group of villains, a tedious group of gadgets, several nuclear warheads and a hologram of a naked woman. Besides, I'm fighting. <br /> <br /> If you think you might be interested in lunar trash activities, I would not hesitate to recommend this movie. I also recommend it to those who want to send their friends to sleep and steal their wallets.
