This film is extremely boring, tells the story of the owner of the gas station and its life. There's nothing interesting happening. The director really "kept it" and feels like a camera following a woman who lives her life. I had to watch other films of this director for lessons, others were not so boring. This film was also watched on commission ... better to be worthy of boredom with good grades !! Generally, if it is not required, do not watch the movie. But do not discount the other director's films because they are not so bad ... and do not discount other films about Africa, they are usually good, especially if they are performed by a western director.
