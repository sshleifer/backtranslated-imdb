I agree with most of the Columbo fans that this movie was an unnecessary format change. Columbo is a unique policeman with unconventional police methods. This film looks like a remake of other ordinary detective dramas from the past. And this is a disturbing point, because Columbo is not an ordinary detective. <br /> <br /> There are two parts in the film that intrigue me. First of all, I can not find the title of this movie. This is misleading. Perhaps a better title would be "The Vanishing Bride" or something similar. Secondly, Columbo hides evidence without giving a reason (at least for viewers) why he does it. <br /> <br /> I do not feel betrayed, only disappointed. I am glad that Peter Falk returned to the usual Columbo. <br /> <br />
