Cuba Gooding Jr. he is a secret service agent who blames himself for the murder of the US president. I will immediately point out that this is not the type of role to which this talented actor is known, and this movie shows us why. He works with a persistent reporter (Angie Harmon) to discover the plot surrounding the death of the president and so on, blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> Even with the cast of James Woods, Cuba Gooding Jr., Anne Archer and Angie Harmon 'End Game' do not attract your attention, simple and simple; part of the action is good, acting is not bad at all, and history, although stereotyped and done earlier, could lead to a fun and enjoyable movie - DO GO NOT! Writing the script and direction is absolutely certain, it does not draw you into a story or make you think of any character. <br /> <br /> 4/10 It's boring, predictable and dull.
