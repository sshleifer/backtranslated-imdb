It's almost certainly the worst western I've ever seen. The story is consistent with the formula, which is especially popular in Western films and martial arts - the hero learns that the family / friends were murdered, so the hero decides to take revenge, frustrates the ineffective lawyer, rescues the kidnapped loving lady and murders an arch-nemesis expert in a brutal duel. This formula has often been successful - otherwise it would not be a formula - but Gunfighter is the most refined performance you will ever see. Scripts are terribly simple and offensive; it sounds like a high school student wrote a dialogue because he lacks depth, maturity and realism. The sound is bad; sometimes it looks like dubbing. The pictures are poor, and the sets are sometimes only facades. Acting is pathetic; certainly some contractors may blame the scenario, but others can not use this excuse. I hope that I will never see Chris Lybbert again as a speaker; every time he says a line that should be angry or mean, he does nothing but lower his voice and just sounds like a child trying to play macho. Speaking of Chris Lyberth, who plays Hopalonga, check out his duds (if you dare to watch this movie): he wears these new clothes that make him look more like Roy Rogers than a hard-working, neat cowboy. If you like other movie dishes that only serve to worship the imaginary size of Hopalong Cassidy, get it, but if you have more than two neurons, look at something else.
