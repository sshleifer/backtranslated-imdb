** SPOILERS ** I rented "Tesis" (or "Thesis" in English) based on the later effort of director Alejandro Amenabar "The Others". Based on what was a brilliantly measured and frighteningly effective crawling movie, I assumed that his previous efforts would be of similar quality and I was in the mood for a good horror. Instead, I ended up with the most boring, unreasonable excuse for a bad movie that I've seen since the German movie "Anatomie" (which reminds me of this movie). <br /> <br /> The plot has potential, but it is thrown away in the first 20 minutes. He revolves around the thesis of innocent Angela student psychology (Ana Torrent - Jessica Harper's necrosis) about violence in films. For some strenuous circumstances, too stupid to enter, ends up in the possession of a "snuff tape" on which two men torture, maim and kill a young girl by the camera. Angela and her friend from horror, Chema (Fele Martinez), are shocked but intrigued by the tape and decide who is responsible for it. <br /> <br /> This leads to ... well, nothing. <br /> <br /> They never really give the reason why they want to find the girl's killers (because they definitely refuse to contact the police during any of the evolving events, even when their own lives are at risk) and the mystery itself is so inert like Graham Norton in a room full of bunnies. There is only one correct "tip" (the type of apparatus that the killer uses) and this is very weak and b) he left within the first 20 minutes. The rest of the so-called "untangling" appears only thanks to blind luck, more and more absurd twists and SLEW terrible, transparent and completely pointless red herring, which are thrown only to deal with the time of running. <br /> <br /> Seriously - Amenabar may know his stories about ghost stories, but apparently he has never read a detective book in his life. The key to a good whodunnit is having a large group of potential suspects and eliminating them one at a time, with wise deduction and gradual discovery of more and more evidence before we get to the final turn. In "Tesis", * POTENTIAL SPOILER AHEAD * the identity of the killer is correctly guessed by amateur "detectives" almost immediately, and then we get 100 minutes of a writer who tries to drown us from the scent until the idea is over, he throws his hands up and says "OK, you have me, it was after him"! As for any logic or motive of crime - there is no luck. You're watching a bad movie, if that's what you mean. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps "Tesis" away from being a stupid, badly written thriller is the way you actually try to get some ridiculous, confused "point" about violence in movies. I have no idea what position she's taking on this subject, but she seems determined to throw in a lot of misleading, confused psychobabs, between the rest of the gibberish, and say, "Look at me! I'm political! " The final scenes in which the "point" of the movie is supposedly stuck in the house are so completely absurd and childish that one can not help but wonder if Amenabar now feels embarrassed when he observes it. If not, it certainly should. This is a total "amateur night in the slass house". <br /> <br /> Generally, I can not believe I've wasted two hours (I felt like at least six), hoping that something will happen. The urban legend of "snuff movies" (and that's basically all they are, in spite of how this movie tries to suggest that they are some kind of criminal phenomenon embracing the world!) This is an area that can be so temptingly used in good horror movies ("Videodrome "Someone?), But it's easy to go through the line in a childlike" would not it be fun if! "Territory with him (eg:" My Little Eye ") ..." Tesis "reaches the lowest level for the" snuff movie "genre . At every level, it's better to leave dead and buried. I'll give him 1 in 10 for cool lighting, but it's all done.
