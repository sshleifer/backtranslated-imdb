I saw it at the gay and lesbian film festival in Philadelphia. <br /> <br /> What can I say? Contrary to my better judgment, I liked it, but it seemed to me that the acting was a bit ... weak (I mainly noticed it in a teenage boy's family). I mean, the script was not in the beginning of the star, but the actors did not make me believe in relationships. <br /> <br /> The plot is also predictable. <br /> <br /> Nonethelss, I liked it. The heroes are friendly and the plot is not difficult or annoying. It's cute, the characters take care of each other and I do not count it as fifty minutes badly worn. <br /> <br /> But I do not recommend.
