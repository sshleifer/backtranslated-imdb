What a bad image of professional police officers is displayed on television while watching this alleged "Reality" program. One can only hope that the actual legitimate suspicion that leads to the probable cause that leads to all the circumstances associated with the "stop", then "Pat Down" outside of his own robe, and then be able to express why the officer entered someone's pocket and took out contraband, was cut out of the scenes, because if it was not, arrest in most places would be cast if they even passed the superior. A warrant report by radio is not the actual existence of an order unless the sender has an original order in hand. If the dispatcher reads from a computer printout, he is good enough to arrest, but this does not necessarily mean that the order is still valid. Because I did not see a Dis-claiming from CBS (I could have missed it), CBS may be in trouble.
