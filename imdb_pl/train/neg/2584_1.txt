American Pie: Beta House is the sixth American Pie movie in the series. Although it really has nothing to do with the original three American Pie films, except that some characters are to be associated with the protagonists of the original trilogy, and Eugene Levy is in it (does not this guy have better concerts?). <br /> <br /> There are very few compliments for this movie. There are no funny jokes. Acting is painful to watch, especially a girl with a "southern" accent, which sounds more like the impersonation of a Canadian by a British woman pretending to be a highlander, using the word "yes". This movie makes me feel like an idiot. Why I did not go to college, where no one goes to classes (but all receive good grades), girls consistently take off their clothes in public, everyone has unprotected unprotected sex without children and sexually transmitted diseases, and you can ejaculate everywhere family photos of a girl without her thinking? Really, this series has dropped to softcore porn standards. Perhaps the next one will eventually break down and hire Ron Jeremy in the lead. I'm sure they can simply link it to the series by removing the third uncle Stifler or something like that.
