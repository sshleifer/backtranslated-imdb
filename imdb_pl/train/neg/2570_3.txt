I read that "There is a girl in my soup" appeared during the low period of Peter Sellers. Watching a movie, I'm not surprised. Nothing happens in the film. Seemingly the mere presence of the sellers and Goldie Hawn should help the film; it is not so. The whole film looks like they just randomly filmed everything that happened without anything. Maybe I have not seen every movie about middle-aged people and older people who try to be hippies, but this movie gives such movies a pretty bad reputation. <br /> <br /> In total, both Sellers and Hawn have made far better films than this, so do not waste time on it. Quite worthless.
