Hammerhead is a combination of a mad scientist with movie genres of deadly sharks. With a little throw type Jeffrey Combs plays the aforementioned mad scientist who creates the essence of a human / hammer shark. Oddly, this being is actually his son who turned into this monster to prevent death from cancer. Or something. <br /> <br /> A group of co-workers is invited to the private island of the scientist. In the end, they are used as a shark bait or shark partner. For unknown reasons, the head of the IT department was transferred as part of this team. Who knows why? Fortunately, he turns out to be a resourceful, though slightly overweight, character of Ramboesque. I'm working on the assumption that he learned how to deal with an assault rifle as part of his daily work as part of the first line support. A normal day for this IT man probably involves fixing someone else's network connection, followed by a call to shoot the villains. Or maybe a call to repair someone's computer must be planned between physical confrontations with terrestrial human-shark hybrids? In any case, it is amazing and saves the day. He even gets a girlfriend. <br /> <br /> The shark is slightly lame, but probably, judging by the effects in this movie. And the movie moves at a decent pace. This is of course a complete hokum, but if you buy a movie called Hammerhead and you expect it to be a complex drama about the emotional conflicts experienced by a man turning into a terrestrial deadly fish, you really do not have anyone to blame but yourself. At the moment there are guns, blood, girls, and maybe even an exploding helicopter. It's garbage, but not as bad as some might say.
