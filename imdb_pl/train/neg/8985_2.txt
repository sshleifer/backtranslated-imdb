Previous comments encouraged me to check when it appeared in TCM, but it was a serious disappointment. Lupe Valdez is great, but he does not have enough time on the screen. Frank Morgan and Eugene Palette are playing well-known but promising characters, but the script leaves them alone. <br /> <br /> The movie revolves around the character Lee Tracy, who is, at best, an egocentric, physically and verbally abusive jerk. The "audience" reactions are poorly thought out and unbelievable, making "sansanigans" seem like ideas of a bad writer. And it stifled credulity that Lupe Velez's character would fall for him. <br /> <br /> The "one-line stinging" mentioned in another review must be dependent on the observer, because I did not even notice that it was done.
