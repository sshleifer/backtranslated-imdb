Anyone interested in science fiction at a distance should start from scratch. Everyone says STAR WARS and STAR TREK are the best science fiction movies at the beginning, which is okay, but the truth is that TERMINATOR and this film, SOYLENT GREEN, is definitely a better choice than these series. SOYLENT is probably the best kept secret of science fiction. It remains one of the largest, but most forgotten films, but the influence of its surroundings is becoming more and more real every day. Charlton Heston exaggerates with his role, but he works. Edward G. Robinson, in his last role, draws the most from him in SOYLENT GREEN more than anyone else, and his last scenes are moving. <br /> <br /> It's Manhattan in 2022, the world is overcrowded is an incredible fortune (a small jar of strawberry jam costs $ 150). Soylent's big boss is murdered, and police detective Thorn is on the case. <br /> <br /> The secret to soy greenery is not a secret if you do research on the film. SOYLENT is pleasant to watch, but the whole scenario is a joke. It's just as cheap as the whole production. The script and drama of the actors made the film, but it was totally fun. It seems that everyone is a moron and no one knows the rules, specifically the cop Thorn, who just likes to roll into people's apartments, mindlessly browse and steal everything he wants. Heroes' interactions focus attention on the film, but you still realize that SOYLENT GREEN sucks. A nice piece, if you have time, but do not expect anything more.
