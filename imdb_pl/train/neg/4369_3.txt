*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Juggernaut is a British "thriller" released in USA by First National. Karloff is Dr. Sartorius, who has to leave his research because his funds have dried up. Karloff is forced to retreat to France and start a medical practice. He is being offered a woman who wants to get rid of her older husband. He knows that Karloff needs money. <br /> <br /> Karloff agrees with the offer and soon becomes a personal doctor of the husband. All the while, the wife jokes about the city, and the local does not have a good playboy. Karloff finally injects the poison into the old geyser and begins. However, his son (from another marriage) arrives a few days before the murder and learns that the will has been changed. When he spills beans on his wife, he gets mad and even bites his son's hand. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Karloff's nurse lost the hypo that Karloff killed an old man. When Karloff finds out he does not get any money, he asks his wife to poison her son. The nurse suspects Karloff and finds a missing hypoglycaemia. The analysis shows poison, but not quite when Karloff kidnaps the nurse. <br /> <br /> To briefly tell the story, the nurse escapes, takes the police and manages to save her son, who is to be injected by Karloff. Instead Karloff injects himself and dies. <br /> <br /> This movie has some good points. Karloff is possessed and plays the type of crazy doctor he did in "Devil's commands and the man who lived again." It is strange, however, when he sees him walking stiffly and slightly bent. We never know why it goes. I suspect the director found him more sinister. <br /> <br /> An actress playing a wife with a double time takes over something terrible. He has a French accent. Even though she is behaving badly, you still hate her (or maybe you hate her because of her acting ...). <br /> <br /> A bit below average for Karloff's vehicle. If you buy a copy of Sinister Cinema VHS, the sound is somewhat uncertain.
