It is important to note that one of the heroines was raped during the "drunk rage" by Russian soldiers, which is completely untrue. This movie should not be shown only because of this. <br /> <br /> There is also a statement from someone that the KGB chased "Jews, Gypsies, etc.", which is "worse than the Nazis." KGB was looking for so-called Zionist agents who were (believed by the KGB) imperialist agents. Quite differently than in the case of naming Jews throughout the whole nation. Gypsies have never been hunted. The KGB was a political and political tool, but from an internationalist point of view. The communists did not really distinguish nationalities. <br /> <br /> The whole movie stinks like a fake movie. The main character does not speak Russian, the characters in Berlin contain typographical errors, the KGB general looks completely false. Some so-called "Russian proverbs" are completely invented, and the list continues uninterruptedly. <br /> <br /> It is not recommended to watch - this movie is full of lies and false things. Instead, go to the "Good Shepherd".
