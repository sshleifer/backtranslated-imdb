Ah yez, Sci Fi Channel produces Yeti, another disgusting movie. I was particularly busy with scenes immediately after the crash, in which, when those who survived were desperately looking for matches, at least half a dozen fires were burning? for no apparent reason? at various points of the wreck. The fire seemed the dominant topic. They were looking for corpses for lighters and matches, and finally finding a box built fire every day, apparently 12 years, but no one ever collected wood. So when did the vegan (hah) burn the bodies, what did he use to accelerate? I mean, those guys were frozen? maybe not. Despite the seemingly low temperature, everything that ate the yeti was bleeding. Maybe it's just me, but even in a completely unbelievable story (none of the survivors have ever heard of the yeti, or the hideous idol until the very end), if you take care of minor things, larger offers will become more acceptable. Oh, what does the prologue (1972) have to do with the rest of the movie? A revolver, warm enough to hold in his hand, he froze and did not shoot. Give me a break. Well, at least we have Carly Pope, another extremely charming girl from Canada. And, with little irony, Ed Marinaro as a coach. <br /> <br /> Well, I might as well add that the rabbit they ate (even though it looks like a chicken) is not a rodent but a sandchop. If it was a squirrel (or rat), it would be a rodent, but it still looked like a chicken. And the authors missed the real chance that someone would notice "Tastes like ..."
