If you've ever seen this movie, you would know it! If you have not done it yet and want to see the classic BAD movie, I suggest you see this movie because it's the worst place. So if you're REALLY bored, go and rent it. If you want to know what it is like, here's my brief summary: Adam Sandler was employed to work on a giant cruise ship with some Ms Universe models and five other people. Adam does not like how one passenger gets all the sticks, and he tries to take witty jokes. BUT WAIT! Worse! You have to rent a movie yourself to see how bad it really is.
