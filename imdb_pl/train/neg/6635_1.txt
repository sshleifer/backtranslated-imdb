Four years after he made his debut as a director in the home artist "Welcome To L.A.", Alan Rudolph shows us what he really wanted from Hollywood, to be one of the guys. "Roadie" is frat-boy-fracas with barny fights, horny harpies, Art Carney in a broken wheelchair ... and Meat Loaf behind the wheel. Meat Loaf (playing Travis W. Redfish!) Is a rather charming presence on the screen and perhaps in a smaller role (in a better movie) can actually be kind, but the script by Zalman King is full of stereotypical humor and helplessness. Meat Loaf is wide open and moronic. Alice Cooper, Roy Orbison, Hank Williams, Jr. and Blondie all look - and everything looks embarrassed. They certainly should, "Roadie" is one bad journey. NO STARS WITH ****
