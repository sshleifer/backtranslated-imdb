There are people who will highlight everything! This is the only explanation I can give why the House of the Dead movie exists. And this is just a frightening part of the whole movie. It's so bad that you turn off videos forever. I really wanted to turn it off and switch the TV to the paint drying channel, but my word had to suffer because of it all. I do not know why I do these bad things. <br /> <br /> As if it had meaning, here is the basic jist of "history". A group of 20-year-olds is so desperate to go to an island in the Pacific Northwest (in fact Canada because it is cheap) on "Rave of the Century" (consisting of about 8 people and unshakeable music) that pay some rocky old a $ 1000 fisherman to take them there after they miss the main ferry. It must be delightful to be worth this whole cake! Rybak warns them that the island is also known as the Island of the Dead (hold on - I thought it was THE DEATH HOUSE?) And that everyone is doomed to death by yadda yadda yadda. <br /> <br /> The first mistakes here. Why a tiny rave (Stulecia my leg!) Would be held on some distant island? Why would anyone want to pay for money? Why pay more for a rocky old fisherman to take them back when they could just come back with others? <br /> <br /> Upon arrival, they discover that the rave (consisting of about 2 tents, a small stage and the port-a-john) has been broken, there is blood everywhere and no one is around. What would any rational person do? Run, of course, for your life. But no, those unaware, of course, blind people decide to look for them. Soon they discover an old, crumbling house that is 50 times bigger inside than outside. There is another half hour of tripping in the forest, as an excuse to kill some of the smaller characters, and after many boredom they return home again. Characters like a movie do not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> In this ghastly catastrophe there is a lot of noisy dialogue, shameful acting, a mumbo-jumbo exposition and zillions of clips from the once popular arcade game. Same name. Why it was widely accepted as a good idea for filmmakers I will never know. The clips have no reference to any of the scenes and degrade the trash even more, if at all possible. <br /> <br /> This has nothing to do with the game, except for the cheap, one-time line at the end. It makes Resident Evil look like a movie glory. Hell, even the Double Dragon movie seems to be worth many Oscars compared to this trash. Jurgen Prochnow is the only one who will come out of this with undisturbed dignity. He could just take his money and run, but he tries to make the best use of the horrible scenario and brings a bit of pathos to his character. The rest of the cast I'm afraid of. Characters are idiots and deserve to die. <br /> <br /> Besides, if you cut curses and senseless nudity, I see no reason why this movie can not be shown on TV on Saturday morning. It is not scary at all. Pirates of the Caribbean are more frightening than the evil skeleton in this movie. Where did all the bad guys come from? At the beginning there were only a few people on the island. I think that justifies the reason why they decided to re-use the footage. I'm not kidding, you'll see that the same zombie dies a dozen times. <br /> <br /> Who is ultimately guilty of this scandalous waste of celluloid? None other than the director of Uwe Boll. His control over the film does not exist. It is clear that the actors have no idea what they should do, and the zombies do not really take it seriously. Actors seem to read memory cards because they are still in the middle of long sentences and talk as soon as they see the next card. It's all very unnatural. <br /> <br /> Plus the movie is shot like a two-part mini-series. In fact, I've seen better TV productions. And do not start with editing. The film is an incoherent mumble with thousands of pointless shots and dozens of meaningless panes with cameras. No real skills or talent have ever been used. It really surprises and disturbs the mind, how you can get unfathomable movies, and George A. Romero can not even persuade anyone to pick up the phone. House of the Dead makes an idiot reference to Romero in a lazy attempt to be "postmodern", but only annoys that they think THIS is in the same league as the TRUE zombie movie. <br /> <br /> Why is it worth it, the 1.85: 1 anamorphic image looks great, and the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is clean, but not very impressive, and only serves to pronounce the heavily used ADR even more. The DVD contains additions, but why torture yourself. Is this review not sufficiently warned? Stay away! You are all condemned, I tell you! Lost! Lost!!!
