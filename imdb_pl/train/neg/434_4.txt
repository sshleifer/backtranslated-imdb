Already his first claim that desires are always artificial is completely wrong. <br /> <br /> When does rejecting Jehovah's Witnesses take his own documentary about movies? or anything else - it's time for everyone to have their own. Although far away, far more intelligent than, say, Paris Hilton (I know, this is not too difficult), Zizka's lips spit out as much pain as her, just another kind. He combines the worst of both his professional worlds: psychoanalysis and philosophy. Both fields are well-known for providing b * lls expertly with a lot of freedom in creating unprovable theories, insolence without beginning and end, and combining concepts almost randomly, in the process of abusing English by creating a semantic jumble just a mother can love. Example: there are three main brothers Marx, and therefore a "great" idea to connect them with three levels of human consciousness, id, ego and super-ego. I'm surprised he did not play the clip from "Snowhite" and did not make an analogy between the seven dwarfs and the seven levels of Gahannah (Muslim Hell). It's like Schumacher's assumption "The Number 23": play with numbers long enough, and you can come up with any theory of the cockamam you want, even combining ancient Greeks with the death of Princess Di. <br /> <br /> TPGTC has an entertaining element: watching crazy, slimy sweat like a hog, with masking delusions, how intellectual analysis can be great fun. Why watch the "cuckoo's nest" or another drama of a madman's house when you can have Zizka for more than 2 hours? It's like watching a fun train wreck. Admittedly, he is almost funny on one or two occasions. <br /> <br /> I have always been surprised by people who are desperately trying to pick up filming for lofty intellectual social science. By giving idiotic movies, such as "Birds", this thought, and hence, merit, probably has its fat creator laughing at his grave. The harsh truth is that the vast majority of films have zero intellectual value, and a few of them that have some intelligence do not require a shrunken philosopher to draw a map to understand them? unless someone is a complete idiot. Zizek sees layers and layers of meanings in the most banal films. Hallucinogenic drugs must be quite popular and cheap in Slovenia ... <br /> <br /> When Zizek showed a hole in the bathtub in the scenery of the "Psycho" shower, I thought he would say something about galactic black holes; how they suck life from the stars, just like Janet Leigh's blood sucks in the tub. Or maybe he could say how the hole represents Leigh's vagina, with blood flowing to her instead of outside (as in menstruation), which is some kind of "clever (Zizekian) irony." Speaking of which, the real irony is that if Hitchcock really wondered about every scene (and script), his films would not be illogical, stressed nonsense, which they often are. The purpose of these analogies of holes in the bathtub was to show how easy it is to improvise about "hidden, deep meanings". And when you add Zizka's fanciful terminology from philosophy and psychology, by imposing these terms on these analogies like decorations for a wedding cake, you get a chaotic mix that can instantly impress the uneducated - ie, Easily sensitive and gullible. br /> Zizek says here many (involuntarily) funny things, one of the most absurd ideas, when he associates cleaning Anthony Perkins with a blood-soaked bathroom with "job satisfaction, a job well done". Do not laugh ... Neither Hitchcock nor the writer of Psycho could even have the slightest amusement with this view that Perkins can have fun - cleaning the bloodstained toilet - while they were doing / directing the scene. Speak of putting words in your (dead) lips, but in the context of misinterpreting what the director had to "say". <br /> <br /> I like Zizka's initial thoughts on the wonderful "Solaris" by Tarkovsky, but then he is to ruin the rare good impression by dragging "anti-feminism" and other nonsense to his theory. <br /> <br /> Zizek's attitude to logic is that the dog is approaching a plastic bone. "I want to play with it all day!" The logic has its own rules and should not be violated - at least not publicly - by people like him. It seems that he considers logic, evidence, common sense and reason as enemies or ordinary toys; concepts that should be avoided, turned to fit the final goal, or simply annihilated. Zizek is a hippie posed by LSD, and all his favorite films are his personal "2001". <br /> <br /> The fact that Zizek focuses on the two most overrated directors - and those whose films often LACK intelligence, if any - such as Hitchcock and Lynch, only reduces its already low credibility. I was surprised that De Palma is not more visible; is another bad director who writes inept scripts. Zizek has a day with Lynch's incomprehensible "Lost Highway". There is as much interpretation of the movie as people who watched it. Zizka's commentary that the viewer is willing to accept the funny, "groundbreaking" setting of von Trier in "Dogville" I snores. <br /> <br /> However, Zizek not only invents things as he goes, but also likes "bleeding obviousness". Like all "social scientists" (oxymoron), it wraps its very banal "observations" into articulation (if it is full of spitting) and sometimes complicated language blankets. After all, sociology works in exactly the same way: it allows us to believe that we hear something new, when in reality what we all know, but is said in a meaningful way - which will cheat a more inattentive listener. <br /> <br /> I expected that men in white suits will suddenly appear out of nowhere and accost him in loonie-suit ... <br /> <br /> Slavoj Zizek: soon as a persecutor in a children's park near you. <br /> <br /> http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Fedor8/150_worst_cases_of_nepotism/
