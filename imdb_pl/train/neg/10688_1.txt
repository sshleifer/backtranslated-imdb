I spent almost two hours watching a movie that I thought would be worth seeing with all the good actors. I could not believe it when the movie ended and I had absolutely no idea what had happened ..... I was furious because I could use this time to do something else ... I tried to understand everything I really had no idea. Thanks to those who invented it and explained ... good or bad, better than nothing to know !! Who was the woman in the dark hair movie we saw several times while driving? Where did the First Lady know that her husband was cheating on her? At the end of the movie, Kate said she would finally learn the truth. Does this mean that we will be subjected to the final game 2?
