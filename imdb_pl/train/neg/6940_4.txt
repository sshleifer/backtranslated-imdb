When you have two skyscrapers with performers smashed against each other, the least you can expect is a great camaraderie, and that's how it is in this film, in which we have 64-year-old romances by Amitabha Bachchana in 34-year-old Tabu. Wait! In fact, it's all in the name of the plot, so instead of "cheeni" it is the content of "Kum" in this Adman, which became the virgin effort of Director-Writer R. Balka ... <br /> <br /> Trust two older actors who they brought home a house with their wise cracks and bitter-sweet moments, when love happened in this unconventional pair, and all that can be found in the slow but refreshing first half. The places of London captured during the rainy season are enchanting. At the end of the first half, the affair ended and the mission ended. There is little to say. Therefore, in the second half, the strange opposition takes the form of the girl's father, as far as Satyagrah is really a test of patience. It is just as strange a climax as to how it surrenders. The result, the other half is dry, flat, without energy. There is a subplot with a girl dying of cancer that does not have much impact. Despite this, the film is recommended because of the fresh approach and performances.
