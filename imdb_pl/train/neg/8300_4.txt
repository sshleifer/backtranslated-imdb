This is the continuation of "A Christmas Story" which is called "A Summer Story".

Unfortunately, Hilarity fails. <br /> <br /> The original worked because of its disrespectful nature and honesty - everyone could relate to it. This one is just stupid and not funny at all. The last film by Charles Grodin - no wonder! This is one of his poorest roles. I felt sorry for him. <br /> <br /> Mary Steenburgen has little to do, everything is a formula, and you have to wonder why they even cared. competitions with whirling peaks ?! Unfortunately, this is the best part of the movie ...
