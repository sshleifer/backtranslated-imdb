A badly written script without nice characters. As for the comedy, I forgot to laugh. About 2 conceited friends are cheating to bring women to bed (without sex scenes) and another friend (who is semi-provocative) who sometimes cheats too, but is mainly considered a guy who is overwhelmed. The three friends meet and fall in love with the same woman (Amanda Peet). Somehow it happens without any romance. The three guys stopped being friends because they were dating her separately. She cheated them because of their friendship because they had cheated women. - Bad movie
