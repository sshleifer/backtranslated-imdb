Wow, I love and respect almost everything David Lynch did. This film, however, is similar to the first film made by a filmmaker. <br /> <br /> To give some examples: <br /> <br /> 1. David Lynch is usually the creator of visual films, however, he had little visual artistic content (empty walls, "shots up" with a ceiling in the background ) <br /> <br /> 2. David Lynch is usually proud of the sound, but even the hum of the camera can be heard in it. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is very difficult to swallow the idea that it had something to do with this movie. unless ... <br /> <br /> ... this is a joke, on the part of David, to force fans to search his website (for many hours) just to find this drivel. I hope so, because at least this idea is fun.
