For Daniel Auteuil "Queen Margot" was much better. For Nastassja Kinski `Paris, Texas' was much better. The biggest disappointments were Chris Menges ("CrissCross" and "A World Apart" can not even be compared with that) and Goran Bregovic for using the same musical theme from "Queen Margot" for this movie (Note end of the movie). If it was an American pop movie, I would not be surprised; but in the case of a European film with more independent actors and the director, a similar approach to child abuse without original insight is very simple and disappointing. There are some bad guys who kidnap and sell minors. There are poor children who hate people selling them and waiting for someone to save them. And finally, there is this great hero who kills all the bad guys and saves these poor children from evil people. Each character is shown in simple black and white categories: good versus evil. Plus, from the very beginning, I could understand how this story will end. Is this the end of the history of sexual abuse of children? I believe that the difficult issue of child molestation and pedophilia is far more complex than what is shown in this not very original film. I think this movie was not disturbing, but very disappointing.
