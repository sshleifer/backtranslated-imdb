In short: it is a romantic comedy that really WANTS and TRIES is something more. He wants to be Harold and Maude, Annie Hall, a graduate student. He wants to be deep and human. He has interesting shots from the camera, lighting, music, editing, which give him the character of an important movie. The dialog box is smart - sometimes. There are several moments of "loud laughter". <br /> <br /> But here's what stops him from finally being anything more than a formal night-time cable, in-flight, a time-killer: <br /> <br /> 1. David Schwimmer - how many times Joe a sad puppy sack stares into space with an open jaw before it gets angry? Maybe some drool would help. <br /> <br /> 2. Gwenneth Paltrow - it's really flat here and not just in the chest. Her role is to be that lively, nice, caring girl who constantly gets into bad situations, as a result she is very confused and that is why a sad loser, like Schwimmer, has any chance with her. But Gwenneth plays her very boring. Combine it with the face of a puppy dog ​​(above) and you have very little chemistry to worry about. <br /> <br /> (I still imagined someone else in this role - for example, Kate Hudson.) <Br /> <br /> 3. Scenario and story - things that happen are basically irrelevant; all the problems end with such a neat and tidy bow that it seems that the whistle sounded and the screenwriters just said "oops, it's time to wrap it up, catch the train!" So they pulled out a Hollywood book, checked all the boxes, and returned home .
