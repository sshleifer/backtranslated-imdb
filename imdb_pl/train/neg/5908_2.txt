This one is a little better than the first one. He still relies on many of his moods, which basically say that Bond's old films were not realistic. After so many parodies, you wear it thinly. The girls were more interesting in this. <br /> <br /> There is a huge amount of total humor. I hope one day a real comedy will come back.
