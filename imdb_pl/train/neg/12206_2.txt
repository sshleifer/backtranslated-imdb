I see no reason to enter this movie in a very detailed way. Sylvester Stallone once again John Rambo, author and survivor of "A Season in Hell", recruited from prison by his only friend, Major Richard Crenna, to secretly return to Vietnam, take pictures of American prisoners who are believed to be still alive in terrible camps and return without engaging the enemy. <br /> <br /> A big chance. What if he did nothing more than sneak in, take pictures and slip away? Who will come to see the movie? <br /> <br /> It's basically a Stallone muscle festival. Preparing for his mission, we see how his well-oiled muscles bulge. (They are oiled and bulged all the time.) There is a ritual binding of black skin, ugly guns, and even uglier knives. Black guns are cleaned, folded with loud clackings and almost as oily as Stallone muscles. The arc is tested and, yes, has enough impact force to break through the enemy's forehead. The knife is sharpened by slippery claws. <br /> <br /> Stallone and one of his prisoners betray one or two suits from Washington, cynical politicians who, as you can bet, never even fought in a fist School of grammar. You do not have courage, you know? Just sit with your feet on your desk and drink foreign beer. <br /> <br /> The film does what it intends to do, but what it intends to do is simple. He deliberately popularized the popular myth in the mid-1980s, that in the North of Vietnam, a number of MIAs were silently kept in unfortunate camps. Bumper stickers were ubiquitous. (Free our MIAs.) Why should they stop them? It has never been fully justified, but perhaps in order to transform prisoners of war into slave labor - in a country that has absolutely no resources outside of work. Or perhaps because of their propaganda value as an instrument of humiliation of the United States - a propaganda weapon that the Vietnamese kept secret from the world. <br /> <br /> Rambo is treated in the Middle Ages by the North of Vietnam. He fell on his neck in pig dung, then pulled it out of his wrists, and his muscles were still visible. Then, not being satisfied with a subhuman Vietnamese, a Russian officer is brought in to act as a Gestapo officer - "Vee haff vays of MAKING remember". Technologically advanced Russian uses psychology and electricity, not just dump pigs. <br /> <br /> Rambo returns and declares that he intends to drift aimlessly until "this country loves us as much as we love him", raising another myth that vets returning from Vietnam were uniformly spat and cursed, so I think that we have chosen so many to Congress and have appointed others for high positions. Three lost presidential candidates belonged to this despised group. At least pointless Rambo drifting left room open to the sequel that appeared quickly. <br /> <br /> Action movies with Schwarzenegger and Willis and others have been acidified by wisecracks, but Rambo is devoid of humor. He travels dully through his phantasmatic ideological swamps, killing without mercy, barely speaking, barely able to speak. Speaking is a sign of weakness.
