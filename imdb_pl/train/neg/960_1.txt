About her. I was so disappointed that this film was just a rip off of the Japanese Ring. Well, I think the United States has also created its version, but at least it was just a remake. So sad. I really enjoy watching Filipino movies and I know that wonderful things can come from such a small country, so I can not believe that it happened. Claudine and Kris are such big names, surprised that they will be linked to plagiarism. For all beginner filmmakers in the Philippines: you do not have to bend so low to make money. There are many movie lovers who watch films released by Filipinos and enjoying them!
