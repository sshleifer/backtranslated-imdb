I heard about this novel a long time ago, many of my friends told me to read it. I looked for him in every place and finally found him. This is a book that every person should read, because he is a genius and because of his vision. I liked each page. <br /> <br /> I knew about the film and I could not wait to see it. When I was finally very disappointed, many of the things in the book are not in the movie (I do not think it's a spoiler), which makes the movie logical ... Michael Radford may be a good director, but a bad writer. Especially as adoption of books. The film is not dark at all, writing is really bad, the only good thing, even great, is acting. John Hurt is an amazing actor and the only face I could see as Winston Smith. <br /> <br /> I'm the most annoyed by IMDb people who called it "The best adaptation ever" without even reading the book! Or knowing something about writing on the screen! <br /> <br /> You can understand the clarity of history by reading a book, do not consider this an alternative. As a book fan I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> The points I gave for this movie are about acting.
