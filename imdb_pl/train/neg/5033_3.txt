Murders take place in a desert city in Texas. Who is responsible? Slight news about mysterious and racial tensions (the latter do not really match), but otherwise strictly for fans of fans who appreciate gore and nudity, which are two conventional elements of these films. <br /> <br /> Dana Kimmell (from FRIDAY 13 PARTS 3 infamy) appears as a quasi-detective teen brother. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of **** <br /> <br /> MPAA: rating of R for violence and blood, nudity and some language.
