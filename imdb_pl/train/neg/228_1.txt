I thought it was a movie in New York: wrong! It's a bit of a British village scenery. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a comedy: wrong! It's a drama ... Well, until the last third, because after telling it becomes completely "abracadabrantesque", a symbolic word for the French presidential mandate. This means that even the motives of nonsense would like to feel honestly. <br /> <br /> What's left? Maybe a good duet of the actress: Yes, I know, they are 3 friends, but the policewoman is invisible to me. The high doctoral student surprises with his hit, and McDowell provides a great acting game as usual, all in a delicate, soft and almost silent attitude. This gentleness puzzles me because, like other artists or directors, the same pattern repeats itself over and over again. In her case it is, regardless of what the movie is, it is always the same character determined by her feelings, her values, which live an infinite number of different stories. I still do not know how to set the boundary (or fusion) between artists and works. <br /> <br /> Another positive aspect of this film is its feminine touch and interesting different points of view. Women have their own way of life, even if they are all alone. It brings a lot of tolerance and learns to testify how the same and unique reality can be seen in as many ways as people can. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film is quite visible, but the great final cuts want another vision.
