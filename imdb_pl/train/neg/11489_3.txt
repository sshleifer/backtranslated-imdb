In the United States, very few films about Rome were made, which were not made in the days of Julius Caesar or soon after. The Hollywood epics of sword and sandals are mostly Christian, which makes it difficult to get to the earlier history of Rome (Spartacus was probably the first exception to this rule and encountered some resistance in Hollywood because he did not have Jesus in it). /> <br /> There is at least one picture that takes place not only before Caesar and Christ, but it is established when Rome was only one city among many on the Italian peninsula and it has just supplanted the hated King Tarquin and created the Republic. <br /> <br /> However, this is not a historical film; it's peplum, and while production values ​​are not the lowest, the operation and characteristics are cardboard. I can only imagine what the dialogue in Italian was like, but with wooden English dubbing it is very camp. At first, I had a few good laughs. <br /> <br /> I have not seen many films of this genre, I missed most of Hercules films from the 60s. It's fun to a point, but as the movie grows, it's a bit boring. <br /> <br /> One thing is certain: if I saw this movie when I was ten years old, I would love to love it. At this age, I went to anything with the Romans and fought with it with a sword. At least this movement evoked childhood memories.
