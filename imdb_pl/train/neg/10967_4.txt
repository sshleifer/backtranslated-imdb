Believe me, I like horror movies. I like science fiction movies. I like independent films. And I like low-budget movies. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I like bad acting, scripting, wooden lines, unlikely situations and the like. However, I did not like holidays on Mars. <br /> <br /> It just does not work on many levels. For all the reasons mentioned above and many others. This includes the senseless, gross use of images of female genitalia. And many allusions to male genitalia in a very Freudian way. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that this results only from ineptitude. In contrast to some attempt to do something really different. I mean every movie that lasts for years just can not maintain the level of compatibility and concentration required by the modern audience. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that the whole movie was just a dream or a hallucination of the main character. Unfortunately, it was going to happen because we saw things unfold on the screen. <br /> <br /> The only kindness I can express is that the picture at the end was amazing. If it was used at the beginning, instead of at the end, it could have allowed the movie to start in 2001 ... <br /> <br /> Wrong, they did not try it. I just do not understand what was so important in this movie that you even had to do it. Was it a story? Certainly it can not be like this. Were these characters? I doubt it; I mean, I could have lived without knowing about Ed 15. Was it a dialog? Definitely not. Music? Perhaps, but it is more likely that the unbridled ego of clients must be petted. <br /> <br /> Much better efforts fell on the floor of the cutting room.
