I was browsing Netflix and came across this movie. Having fond memories of the book as a child, I decided to check it out. This is a movie that you really should give. <br /> <br /> It's just not worth watching. It is very boring and uninteresting. I feel that this would be the case even for young children. There is no magic that the book contains. This movie is not scary, but you just will not care about ten minutes. <br /> <br /> There are moments that just happen. The witch's character is not very good. The family behaves as if it is not surprising that these strange things are happening. I know it's a movie for children, so as an older audience, we're not allowed to delve into things, but the whole movie seems to be written and produced by people who have never had any experience in making movies before. <br /> <br /> The DVD that I started to skip in the last moments of the movie, instead of trying to fix it, I just turned it off and sent it back to Netflix. I really did not care how it ended. Skip this movie and read the book.
