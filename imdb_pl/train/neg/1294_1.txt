The main theme of this film seems to be confusion, because relations, surroundings, acting and the social context lead to the same place: confusion. Even Harvey Keitel seems to be out of his element and lacks the usual impeccable brightness, direction and intensity. Worse, his character's name is "Che" and we were told (directly, by the narrator) that he is not "that" Che, just a guy named Che. Family relations remain unclear until the end of the film, and after determining, the family is divided - the younger generation is in America. So trivial. Other reviews discuss how the film shows the impact of the revolution on the boy's family; however, the director's political attitude is dark at best and we are never quite sure who is responsible for the bloodshed. So they lost their property (acquired through gaming) - so what? The refusal to take a political position during the making of a film about the Cuban revolution is a strange and cowardly choice. Not to mention the film in English! Why do all these Cubans speak English? No wonder they did not get permission to film in Cuba. And if family life is the most important thing to look at here, it would be great if we could find out who is who - we are "presented" at the beginning - a cheap way to explain the relationship in the whole movie! Acting was mainly shallow, wooden and unbelievable. "Special" visual effects were confusing and distracting. References to American films - and black character as a Greek choir - strictly unpaid, intellectually ostentatious and consistently out of place. I watched the whole movie just because I was waiting for clarity, or for some point. It never happened.
