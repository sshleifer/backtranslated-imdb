I watched this with my girlfriend after I stumbled across her when I was pushing the channels. <br /> <br /> I think we were both hoping for something like a happy family, cute Christmas movie, but we were very disappointed. <br /> <br /> actor playing a soldier, he seems to have some emotions, his face looks the same, regardless of whether he cuts the Christmas tree, seeing the girl he loves when he is kissed by his boyfriend, or when he is happy surprised by the girl he loves, he is a terrible actor, and none of us made him laugh. <br /> <br /> Then there is a charming blonde, gifted with the ability to count dots and cheat on her boyfriend, what a catch! and her ambition in life is to live with her parents and count more dots. <br /> <br /> So it's basically a story about a guy without any emotions and feelings that falls on a guy who counts dots and codes on his boyfriend, is as predictable as possible, and really a waste of time, nothing you gain, watching it, other than some strange laughter, because it's all so banal. <br /> <br /> I love it when her father tells them only fries, not French wine, and everyone laughs, this is the attitude that is going on in this film, and moreover, if my girlfriend daddy me boss I would have told him something or, but not our veteran army, not sir, let everyone guide him. <br /> <br /> The movie is what the first blood would be if John Rambo was burnt like the biggest mollusk in the world.
