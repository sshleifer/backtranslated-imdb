Without reading the novel, I can not say how faithful this film is. History is a typical mysterious material: the assassin attacks newlyweds; The investigator falls in love with his partner and is diagnosed with a deadly disease. Yes, it sounds like a soap opera and it's exactly like that. The first two-thirds are boring, except for murders, and the last 1/3 makes a partial return when it raises the speed towards twist conclusion. <br /> <br /> The operation is strictly defined, although it is hard to blame the actors themselves: the script is horrible. During the last 1/3, you stop noticing because the movie really gets interesting, but it's only the last 1/3. Director Russell Mulcahy is very involved in his element, but there is only what he can do with the television budget and network censors on the back. It is quite limited to quick cuts and distorted lenses, although he managed to push a pair of "under the floor" photos during murders in the club toilet. Unfortunately, because this is done for television, nowhere you can find interesting compositional details that he uses so well with a wider picture. Note to producers: give this man a reasonable budget and anamorphic lens when you hire him. <br /> <br /> In summary: this movie is bad by cinema standards and mediocre for TV standards (instead, watch CSI). If you fancy such a movie, I have some great suggestions: take a copy of "Deep Red" Dario Argento (my highest recommendation, great movie), "Opera" and even "Tenebre". They are stronger in every category.
