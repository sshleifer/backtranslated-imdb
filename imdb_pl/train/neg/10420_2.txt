OK, I know that many people will probably be indignant about this review, because Watership Down is the "classic" and standard element of most people's childhood, but seeing this movie for the first time at the age of 18, I must admit: I really hated him. <br /> <br /> We watched this movie because my sister read the book and really enjoyed it, and many people who were saddened by the words "Watership Down" - their memories of watching the movie as children and tearing their emotions over seams - he recommended it. Honestly, I regret that I did not bother. I gave it the benefit of doubts; Generally I do not like to stop watching the movie in half. This was an exception. It was really, really, horribly, disgustingly boring. This movie was probably the slowest thing I've ever seen (imagine a doped snail in space) and really did not do it for me. The play was fine; the backgrounds were nicely done, if not a bit bland and twee, but the rabbits themselves were not very charming, and the animation was quite nervous and poorly produced. <br /> <br /> I do not intend to go into great details about the plot; in fact, it's a story about a group of rabbits that leave their labyrinth because of the infiltration of people in the area. In general, a moralistic story about the dangers of human interaction in the environment, uses anthropomorphic rabbits to convey the message. For me, I regretted that they would not be gassed, not because I was a terrible sadist, but because the characters were uninspiring, annoying, boring and generally quite rude (oh, I'm terribly English). I found myself watching the clock all the time while watching the movie and it took me a whole 20 minutes before something really happened, and even that was a terrible anti-climax. <br /> <br /> If I were to praise in any case, I would have to admit that the concept of showing children the dangers of building in the village and, hopefully, unveiling the arrogance of people, etc., is quite good. Perhaps it is generally sanctified and preaching, but the message he is trying to portray is good in nature. The musical score was not bad either. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this movie is pretty bad. I could not watch it all the way, and I would probably be forced to eat my own legs in pure boredom. It is true that it is not "Torque" wrong, but it is still not high in my eyes, so I gave it 2/10. <br /> <br /> I hope it will help.
