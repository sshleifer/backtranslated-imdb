If you like original cast and SNL shows, avoid this movie at all costs. When my friends and I left for the first time, we waited in the queue for over an hour to get to the sold-out movie theater. in the middle of the movie the theater was 3/4 empty. We did not want to leave thinking that it would be better. After the film was over, we were the only ones who stayed in the theater. The film lasted only one day in all theaters, and then disappeared from view. In interviews with "Mr. Mike "refused to comment on this movie. The film was an intimate joke about the episodes of SNL, which appeared shortly after the premiere of films and closing in one day. We all tried to contact Mr. Mike over the phone and mail to get a refund, but we were completely ignored.
