The premise, though not entirely ridiculous, was definitely ridiculous. What should happen was to simply waste Tritter on the second meeting with Triter. House hires a guy and disinfects Tritter. In real life, Tritter would be penalized for harassment, an episode of a rectal thermometer would be revealed in court, providing motivation and opportunity, and hospital lawyers would make minced meat from Tritter and the specific department in which he worked. He would be in prison like anyone who would be involved in the persecution of House, Chase, Foreman, Cameron, Wilson and Cuddy. The lawsuit would have allowed House to get a tasty bill, enough to give Vicadin his old age. While Tritter had finished somewhere, riding a taxi, he tried to rehabilitate himself, doing good to people for two years, before people fell to the fact that they had seen it all before.
