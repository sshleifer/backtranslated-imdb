Maverick a policeman with family problems and a passion for using a weapon? Check! A single place with a valuable object that asks for theft? Check! Tasteful looking interest in love? Check! Different gangs of stupid cardboard villains with suspicious European accents? Check! A German-sounding bad guy played by an English actor with a bit of coarse dialogue for every occasion? Check! Corny one liners? Check! <br /> <br /> Honey, is this movie wee wee or what? Cliches are as dense and fast as an avalanche, and most actors simply stand around staring at how bad the script is! <br /> <br /> In a glaringly cheap and cheerful way, straight on the video, just rip the Die Hard up on the top (along with a few notched lines from the above) we have all the usual platitudes of moves that are graded gradually when we go together with some old-fashioned violence and nudity thrown to wake up anyone in the audience who might just have nodded. <br /> <br /> Jack Wild is a full policeman in the mode of John McClane, who even manages the time of an ancient evil guy with a gun who used all his balls at one point. <br /> <br /> There are a few well-known recognizable faces among this mess that I can only assume I need cash and / or I just played it for laughs from a senseless opening scene that had nothing to do with the story until the last improbable conclusion concluded with dialogue, and even more resolute cts. <br /> <br /> Checking this three pound of effort from an occasional supermarket basket on IMDb I was surprised that this bag was born not one but two parts, I have to find these jewels on DVD! It seems that the first continuation is the rip off of Under Siege 2 and the second continuation, well, that's good! One of the things that is always a bad sign is that the actor who plays Jack changes with every movie and even the character's name seems to change in the third part. <br /> <br /> Still, blind purchases of cheap DVDs would not be the same if the studios did not throw away the material of this terrible quality !!
