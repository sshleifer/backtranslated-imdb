I had the misfortune to watch this garbage at Sky Cinema Max on a cold winter night. I'm not a big fan of horror movies, because most of them are just rubbish. This one is even worse: it's one of the stupidest pieces I've ever seen in my whole life. Horror? Yes, there are horrible things in it: acting, script and special effects - Oh my, I was laughing at this ridiculous attempt to run for 90 minutes. Actually, if it was a comic book, I would give it to 5. You do not even think about borrowing it, unless you want to mock the producers. I did not vote for one because I was laughing all the time ;-)
