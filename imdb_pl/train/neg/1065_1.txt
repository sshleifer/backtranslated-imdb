Based on a friend's recommendation, my wife and I invited another couple to this movie. I really apologized to them - all four hated it and spent all the time looking at our watches, waiting for the film to end. Half of the vignette is bizarre, with a very low entertainment value. There were several scenes in Paris - for example, I could not wait to see pictures of the Latin Quarter, but I could not really recognize anything. Most of the scene was in the bar. Nobody in the theater laughed at anything or reacted in any way. If you like bizarre, pretentious, pseudo-intellectual movies, do not miss it. If you are on earth, like me, you will be sorry that you saw it.
