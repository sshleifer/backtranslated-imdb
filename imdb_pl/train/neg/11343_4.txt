First watched 2/2/2003 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Jim Kammerud and Brian Smith): Drab and not a spectacular alleged continuation of the original, classic animated `101 Dalmatians'. Yes, the movie continues where it ended in the first, but the problem is that the game is like the original. One of the great things in the original was the desire of a story that does not exist. Animation for Disney is also very little spectacular and the only thing we get is that the same characters go through the same kind of history from scratch. When Disney stops bothering us with sequels, repetitions, etc. Etc. Probably, when we stop renting or buying the average price they put up.
