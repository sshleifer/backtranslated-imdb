In this film, supporters of Chávez (Venezuelans and non-Venezuelans) simply lie about the dramatic situation in our country. <br /> <br /> They did not say that the conflict began because of the announcement of Chávez, who dismissed many of the best PDVSA employees for political reasons only. <br /> <br /> They did not say anything about more than 96 television breaks given by Chávez in just 3 days in "CADENA NACIONAL" (a kind of confiscation of private TV signals). Each with about 20 minutes duration. <br /> <br /> They did not tell us anything about General En Jefe Lucas, Rincon Romero, general inspector of the armed forces, who is a traditional supporter of Chávez. Even now, despite its announcement, there is the Ministro de Interior y Justicia. After returning Chávez took Charge of Ministro del Defensa (equal to the Secretary of Defense in the USA). <br /> <br /> They did not say anything about Chávez's orders for shooting against the pacific concentration of people who were seeking elections. br /> <br /> They said nothing about the people in this concentration who were killed by the supporters of Chávez (both civilians and military armed forces). <br /> <br /> They present some facts in the wrong order to lie. <br /> <br /> They have said nothing about the civil society of Venezuela, which is even now demanding elections to resolve Chavez's crisis and actions to avoid elections. <br /> <br /> That's why I'm telling you ... This movie is just a lie or a big lie.
