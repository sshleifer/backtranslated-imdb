I love horror movies, low-budget, 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's ... but how can anyone think that this is a very good horror movie? let's compare it to titles in similar house-building films. haunting, usurper, luminescent. or for a similar technology-based horror that was better than FAAAR (though still LARGE from the brilliant) Demon Seed. OK, I will be honest ... let's compare it to horror movies for TV! do not go to sleep ... waaay creepier and better done. a lot of salem, nocturnal persecutor, night gallery, do not even go to the basement or crowhaven farms were much better. * SPOILERS * above all, for such a good scene as this bloody shower scene, you have a scene like the opening scene ... oh! garden hose comes alive to spray a few frisky teens! HORRIBLE. also what we understand about the home ... apparently must use video cameras to see what is happening, and it is a very emotional home. not a ghost, demon or being, it's a "possessed" home, but what? we are convinced that the inanimate object has learned to love suzie / margaret, our hero? now that I'm on the subject of suzie ... another scene that totally disturbed me, this poor old crazy lady comes, says she was your nurse, pours her heart, falls into a boiling pool, fights in agony for 45 seconds and what does Margaret do? does she risk her hands burning to save that poor older woman who came to warn her about her life? no, she stands and looks! acting in the majority was better than the average in horror, but it's the end of positives. at least a more interesting and fun horror about a dead object that kills people by watching the bed of death: the bed that eats. I have the impression that people who have rated it so high or have not seen it since it was aired, or remember that they were scared of it as children. this movie was less merit.
