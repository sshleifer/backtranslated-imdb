This movie was sucked! They took something from my childhood and raped in the outhouse! This movie was so bad that I wanted to go home and hold my Dukes and cry in the corner. The cast was terrible! It was not The Dukes, Stiffler and Jackass were driving the car. When is the evil Boss Hogg? When Rosco was a tough guy? They have never been! The head of Hogg was greedy, and Rosco was an idiot. When did Jesse smoke cigarettes? He never did! Do not get me wrong, I am very liberal and there is nothing wrong with a small chibie, but there is no place in this film! The only good thing about this movie were pre-movie trailers and end credits. It was a waste of time and air. Avoid at all costs !!!!!!!!
