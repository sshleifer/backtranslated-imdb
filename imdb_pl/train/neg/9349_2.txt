This movie was terrible. I gave him a high score of 2, as I saw worse, but very few. <br /> <br /> From the stereotypical beginning of the ending of the film at the beginning and returning to the beginning at the end of this film, everything that was in a box with tricks used for making movies, for children, like a child with too many toys was used. There was a never-ending, boring, repetitive narrative, slow motion, frozen cage, flashbacks and combined images, etc. - none of them improved the dull movie. <br /> <br /> It's called "16 years of alcohol", but there was not enough drunkenness and drunkenness, there was no image of withdrawal when the movie jumped all over without a coherent sense. This story was badly written and very pretentious, and the direction was just as poor and it's a pity that people have earned more money for more of Mr. Jobson's films, previously known to be in the garbage and television group, which makes the film so important . <br /> <br /> I realized that it is a great difficulty to see it to the end, but in the hope that it will be better, I continued bitter, but it really was a waste of time and I'd better not bother.
