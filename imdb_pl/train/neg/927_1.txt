I mean, really, like Charles Band, the head of Full Moon, he released a complete stink like DEMONICUS. My point is that it should never have a green light. The story is repetitive, the characters are weak at best, there is no real story about Tyranus, and besides, he is a bad guy. Then the writer or director tries to get a bad ending. This is a bad ending, Demonicus gets up. The last survivor escapes the deadly cave, and then the image of Chimera comes to life, I can add it cheaply and drive it out. Then, as she goes home, FUNHOUSE ala. The statue, which was destroyed centuries ago, reappears for no reason just to collapse on it. It does not make sense. What the hell Charles thought, letting this pile of puffs be done, with four different film companies that were so desperate for the movies. They could have asked me, I had better ideas than DEMONICUS. THANK YOU TURKEY.
