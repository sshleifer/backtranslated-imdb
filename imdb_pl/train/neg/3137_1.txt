I, like many people, saw this movie in the theater when it first appeared in 1997. It was a movie below the average, definitely not a "masterpiece" that all the "Titanic" fans like to watch. First of all, DiCaprio is a terrible actor no matter how you look at it. People just like him because of his appearance. His "acting" skills rely mainly on telling many shoddy lines and trying to behave sexily. Secondly, the film itself had a pretty boring and simple story: the girl falls in love with the guy, the ship is on the sinks, many shit love scenes later. Anyone with an intelligence quotient above 50 will realize that it is not a genius in any way. It is also not original. In addition, the director felt the need to drag him for over 3 hours. I could compress it into a one-hour block without losing the plot. In summary, "Titanic" is the most-overrated movie so far. Why so much attention and money is beyond me.
