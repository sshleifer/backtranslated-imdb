When I first chose this movie, I was intrigued by the basic idea and wanted to see what would happen. I'm a fan of animation and I love it when it's successfully combined with live material. However, the animation in this movie concerned everything I liked. Although it must be said that the performances of the actors were excellent. Visual appearance - including animation - gave a wonderfully disturbing air to the song. However, it was anxiety associated with exaggerated images, both visual and scriptural, that you practically got hit in the head. The most annoying thing was that the relation to the story was small. It seemed that the plot was in the corners at irregular intervals, giving the effect of stuttering, which significantly weakened the flow of the song. The breaks in Felisberto's voice - especially at the end - were very much like a desperate attempt to fill holes in the conspiracy that had been ignored in favor of side problems like the whole ant (and not even properly addressed). I'm afraid that the whole song turned out to be at best a "reasonable first attempt" of a teenager who spent too much time reading DH Lawrence. Not what you expect from experienced filmmakers.
