Children love dinosaurs. It's a bit of their culture. But they have the Earth ahead of time. Original. At least this movie had a heart. This. This movie is simply pathetic. Just because children love dinosaurs does not mean that you can simply slap every old story and show it to children. This movie has no story, the whole premise is stupid, and this is more because of the numbers. Not as a sucking soul like Theodore Rex, but from light years to being Earth ahead of time.
