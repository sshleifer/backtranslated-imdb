A typical thriller, it was made many times before. A simple outline of the plot; Liott's policeman is obsessed with Russell's wife, and he's trying to get a good Kurt so he can have her. You can not predict it, you do not even try to guess, the plot is a plot and there is no thinking. It seems to me that the only reason for watching this is seeing how it develops, but nothing is done originally or interestingly. There is nothing to say about this movie, it is not particularly bad, but there are also no good points. Russell plays Russell and you know what you'll get when you see him in the movie. Ditto Liotta. Stowe has an annoying Cher-esque voice. I read the outline of the plot and saw the film in my head, it was so obvious and basic. I looked at it and landed in front of my eyes exactly as I imagined. I did not feel a drop of emotion all the time. I do not have a feeling for this movie, it's like I've never seen it. That being said, it's quite a senseless movie, right? Nevertheless, I will give 3/10 for some reason.
