I still tremble at the thought that I will NEVER see this movie again. <br /> <br /> I saw action movies, I even liked them a few, but this movie is on top. <br /> <br /> Not only has the worst male actor in history (Sly Stallone) starring, but the plot of the movie is so stupid from the beginning (why not rob the money when the plane is on the ground, much easier to believe the fact that a person with intelligence quotient is smaller than his sheriff. <br /> <br /> What's more, the story does not have any twists and turns, a three-year-old child can guess what will happen next. This is a set of clich√©s (action genre ), in which Sly plays even worse than other films (he was better even in Rambo III if you watch this movie as a comedy, not an action movie) Now there is an actor who can not act A) surprised B) sad C) anything else than his basic face. <br /> <br /> I would still like to emphasize that this movie has two factors that can make some people like it. EXPLOSIONS are unique, but then ... you can see better on the 4th of July. LANDSCAPES are great, but then ... there are documentaries about the Alps and the Himalayas, so you can see better views this way instead of wasting time on this movie. <br /> <br /> Instead, watch a different movie, there are hundreds or even thousands of better action movies.
