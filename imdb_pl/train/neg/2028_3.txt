At first glance, "Show Me The Money" should at least finish the full season. You've always had the entertaining William Shatner as your host, surrounded by a dozen beautiful, long-legged models of bakers, commonly called "The Million Dollar Dancers". You had competent players who had interesting stories to tell about your life and who probably knew many curiosities of pop culture. And you had big money! So what went wrong? <br /> <br /> The format of this game was a failure. A good game show requires at least two of three things: very simple rules, exciting stimulation and the ability of the viewer to play at home. The best, the longest, have all three. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, SMTM did not have any. <br /> <br /> The rules of this game were one of the most complicated games in the history of prime time games in history. Let me try to explain how the game worked as short as possible. <br /> <br /> The competitor started with a single word or a short phrase, followed by the letters A, B, C (subtle plug into the network?). Each letter was connected with a separate question, everything started with this word or phrase. When a player chooses one of the letters, he can answer this question or go and choose the second letter. If they pass, they will have to look through the next question and have the same option. However, if they went through the second question, they had to answer the third option. <br /> <br /> After they answered and before they found out if their answer was correct, they had to choose one of 13 dancers on stage, each with a different amount of money in a roll next to each other. They revealed their amount in dollars (from $ 20,000 to $ 250,000) and depending on whether the player responded correctly ... or answered badly ... this amount will be added or subtracted from their pool. <br /> <br /> Still with me so far? In addition, there was one dancer who had something known as The Killer Card. If you chose a dancer with the Slayer Card and your question was correct, you were safe and the game continued. However, if you were incorrect, you had one last question to answer. If this last question was wrong, you did not play. If you understood it correctly, the game was continued. <br /> <br /> There was no quitting, you did not leave with the money you had earned until you answered six questions correctly or you did not have six questions or you were so far in a hole that you can not make enough money to return. I understand? Fine! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem, as I saw it, was the total lack of tension due to the game design. The player could give questions that he knew they did not know and answer many of the questions he knew by reducing pressure. Then they could still find a low dollar amount, even after deliberately omitting the question, which meant there was still no "drama". And the fact that they could answer five questions badly and still have a chance of winning was a big mistake. The speed of the questions was deadly slow: often the questions were so obvious that it was not easy to try to create tension as if there were any doubts about some of the most common answers. <br /> <br /> Stimulation, lack of any real tension at any point during the show, and these very complicated rules prevented this program from working, despite Shatner's Terpsichorean talents.
