I still do not know why I forced myself to sit through the whole thing. This "movie" was not worth the DVD-R Memorex on which it was recorded; I thought I was watching the final result of a group of middle school students stealing their parents' camera. This is by far the worst movie ever made. Really, deep down, I want to sue Aaron Yamasato in two hours, which he stole from my life. <br /> <br /> Apparently, it's deliberately going to be wrong; But if you're done in hell and you're forced to watch this 90-minute doo-doo coil, you'll see that Yamasato is really trying to make a fantastic movie. Actors try dramatic performances comparable to Crimson Tide, but they are approaching The Marine. <br /> <br /> Playing nonsense is just the tip of the iceberg. Camera angles are awful. The plot is, at best, a C movie - the plot is not even good enough to be considered a B-Movie caliber. Dialogue tries to be dynamic and witty, but it is nonsense like everything else. Rumor has it that a copy of the script attracts flies. In addition, the techno result is annoying ... not because it is techno, but because it is NON-STOP. That's right, music plays ALL THE TIME in the background, acting as a subliminal reminder of how bad this thing is. I do not care what the reservation says, I do not buy it. BOTS was deliberately not so bad because it is too serious in itself for what it was: a joke. <br /> <br /> This "movie" was very low on budget. But that does not justify the record suction factor. Great movies are born from content, not from the budget. BOTS did not have any. <br /> <br /> Let me continue to express the overwhelming power of this 90-minute waste of time: if I had three ways with Jessica Alba and Jessica Biel in front of TV and Blood Samurai, I would be there sooner than Steven Seagal in the performance decision. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly some people will try to defend the movie. Two, maybe three. They will say: "It's a grindhouse chop-socky!" Or "tacky in a good way!" Or "it's so bad, it's good!" These people are idiots. The film is either good or bad. There is no such thing as a good bad movie. But there are things like idiots who like bad movies. Do not get me wrong; there are many films that are not taken seriously, but they are enjoyable and entertaining. Slither is one. BOTS is not. <br /> <br /> This suckfest takes about an hour and a half, and in my humble opinion it's 90 minutes too long. The best thing about this "movie" is the DVD cover, so the next time you find yourself near the basket for Wal-Mart DVDs, look at it - DO NOT TOUCH, just look - and go quietly.
