Lorenzo Lamas appears as Jack `Solider` Kelly, a former Vietnamese veterinarian and renegade policeman who embarks on a search and destruction mission to save his sister from forestry ores. A cruel movie is so cheaply made and so bad that Ron Palillo is third, and yet he has 3 minutes of time on the screen, and even these are not good. Generally a horrible movie, but the scenes with Lorenzo Lamas and Josie Bell hanging on a tree in sacks and gagged are worth a few (unintended) laughter. An improved sequel follows.
