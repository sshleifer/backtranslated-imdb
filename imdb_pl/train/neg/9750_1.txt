The film, a universal version of the Protelco-MLC production, is a boring repetition of the theory of breaking the molecular structure of the object, capturing it in the cell as "clean energy" and then sending it back to the "target area." There is no explanation why it is necessary but Professor Paul Steiner (played by pock-mocked actor Bryant Haliday, "Devil Doll") thinks it's something to sacrifice him and his assistants, Pat Hill (Mary Peach) and Chris Mitchell (Ronald Allen), alive. <br /> <br /> During the experiment, before he noticed the Dutch scientist "Lembach" (Gordon Heinz), his machine fails because of sabotage, so he himself "designs" him secretary, Sheila (Tracey Crisp), to seek revenge. She twists, and he comes out like a "roast pork" with the power of men's infestation. <br /> <br /> With this newly discovered power he manages to drive some Cockney's idiots, the bodyguard named Latham (Derr ick de Marney) and his laboratory head, Dr. Blanchard (Norman Woodland). He can also break into the pharmacy and steal a pair of rubber gloves and a black coat. <br /> <br /> In the end, despite Hill and Mitchell trying to help him, the clown destroys his equipment and himself. In general, a completely senseless movie without any news. <br /> <br /> Also one of the most depressing colorful movies you'll ever see.
