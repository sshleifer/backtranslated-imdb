The idea for a thumb is not the winner the second time. ThumbTanic was not as good as Thumb Wars for many reasons. I think that, above all, Mr Oedekerk had much less work with the Titanic shipment. In contrast to Star Wars, the Titanic movie has not become (yet?) A cultural myth and there are far fewer references that will resonate with the public. <br /> <br /> In ThumbTanic holes are filled with one-off jokes that really do not seem to be related to anything. For example, the hero's insinuation that the heroine is not clean during the "jump off the ship" scene - it is not funny. Rather, you just think, "Did I miss something in the original movie?" There were too many such baseless jokes (see PajÄ™czak). <br /> <br /> In contrast, sending a smarmistic ship designer made sense and was fun. It was also very fun to send a guy in a movie who wanted to go "faster" as a maniac running demanding * everything * was "faster", including the sinking of the ship and being the first to die. Such jokes meant something in the Titanic context and added meaningful humor to the thumb. <br /> <br /> The media thumb, faces and voices are still fun. Props and sets and CG animation deserve recognition. In general, although ThumbTanic proves that quirk will not work, this movie still makes you laugh and giggle until the end.
