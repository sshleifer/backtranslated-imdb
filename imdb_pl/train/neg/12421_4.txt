"Deathrow Gameshow" Mark Pirro from 1987 is a black comedy that is extremely tacky in many parts, but sometimes very funny. This movie would certainly be a lot better, the acting is terrible, and some extremely bad scenes make it difficult to watch at times, but the concept is fun and has some fun moments. <br /> <br /> In the near future (1991) the game shows have changed. Chuck Todean (John Mc Cafferty) is the host of the "Live Or Die" game show, in which those sentenced to death have a chance to play for their lives and money. Candidates who fail the exam are killed on the air using a variety of methods, such as guillotines, electric chairs and other, more bizarre devices of execution, and then applause by the audience. The show is of course more than controversial, and Chuck did a lot of enemies ... <br /> <br /> "Gamesrow Deathrow" is incredibly tacky and shitty in many respects, and acting is terrible, but it is undoubtedly fun in many parts especially if you're a fan of dark humor. You did not miss anything if you did not see it, but it is definitely a fun and good time. 4/10
