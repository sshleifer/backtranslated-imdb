I think scarecrows are terrifying, so it's a pity that this movie does not do them anymore. <br /> <br /> A group of robbers perform an emergency parachute from the plane to a huge field of scarecrows. One of them is lost along with the prey, and the rest chases him when attacked by inexplicably bad scarecrows. Acting is hammy, and scarecrow does not impress (when they move). A positive aspect is that the director loses tension from static scarecrows. As Alfred Hitchcock says: "The bomb under the table goes out, and it's a surprise. We know that the bomb is under the table, but not when it goes off, and that's the tension. "
