You can not imagine how I expected the king of ants. As a great fan of Gordon, I was waiting for the European premiere with the despicable anticipation. Especially that I loved the last achievement of Dagon - Gordon - so much. The premiere of King of the Ants took place in my country and it was Gordon who came to present it. Unfortunately, I could not go and congratulate him later. King of the Ants is his most inspired and mediocre movie. Really, the quality level has never exceeded the standard television thriller standards. The plot outline is terribly routine and with the exception of a few weak scenes, the typical Gordon-touch is never recognized. What's more, the already weak script has more holes than the Swiss cheese bowl! This involves a young crook who has been hired to commit a murder. So he does. And of course they do not pay him. And, of course, he falls in love with the victim's wife. And of course he avenges himself ... Only the sequences in which the guy descends into a spiral of madness are worth mentioning, and they are the only ones who remind you that you are still watching Stuart Gordon's movie. Actors' performances are below average with McCenna as a heroic lowlife, George Norm Peterson Wendt as a plump bastard, and Kari Wuhrer as a good-natured sex bomb. Extremely illogical things are happening constantly, and the nausea of ​​history becomes irritating very quickly, while the effects of makeup are not enough to please even amateur horror writers. I have read some other comments about the King of the Ants, claiming that this is the best Gordon, because in the end it is an inspiring and mature film. Well, if it is. much. Well, I think that every good director finally ends up with steam and inspiration. It is a pity that he also defeated Stuart Gordon.
