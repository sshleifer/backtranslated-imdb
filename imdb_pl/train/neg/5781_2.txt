Roman Pola≈Ñski has done many, many films that are unexpected. His fame stuns me. Nothing stands out as the highest point except for Chinatown (I did not see "Knife in the Water" or "Tess"). Any contribution he made to the film ended over twenty years ago; his work is simply embarrassing, safe and / or boring (The Pianist, Frantic, Oliver Twist, The Ninth Gate, Pirates). <br /> <br /> The child R had to mean the end of the assumption the moment he came outside. This is produced by lux and quite a high idea for the movie "horror" from 1968 (Never show a child). But it's just a misunderstood horror. Everything is artificially so much that the plot line becomes hopelessly clean very early (Um, thanks for this destructive title finale), and on a clear day you can see a turn of action ending for many days. It did not support my interest. I think that regardless of what the movie would be, it was completely derailed by a version from the 1960s. Farrow is such a long-term, helpless housewife. Its fragility is sold out ... it is extremely annoying. There are no real ideas in it ... nothing to consider except being the mother of the devil. <br /> <br /> The Dakota is barely used for this amazing potential.
