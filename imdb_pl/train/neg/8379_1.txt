Like other reviewers mentioned earlier, I would like to know which moron actually read the script and went "yes! This is it. This is the next movie we're going to smoke! "And whoever is that person should look at the head for real brain activity. Because everyone who is responsible for actually spending money on doing this after reading the script, well, I'm happy to give you my email address, or maybe you just want to give away some more money. This movie is horrible in every way. <br /> <br /> The Wayans are funny, at least they can be. They made some good movies and they had incredibly entertaining performances along the way. But here, not only does this assumption contradict all logic, it is not only horrible, not only the entire offensive film from the beginning to the end, not only the direction is amateurish, how can be found, but really want to pay to see this movie. Maybe if it was for free ... no, it would still be a waste of time. <br /> <br /> I would usually be willing to write a long, detailed review of why this movie is so bad, but it's enough to say that my brevity speaks. It is the smallest common denominator and is as indecent as a heart attack. <br /> <br /> 0 / 10.I speak my first ten of the worst films of all time!
