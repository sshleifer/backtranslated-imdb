Where, where to start, describing the complex misery of Neil LaBute's latest attempt to create films? <br /> <br /> There are many types of movie fans, but definitely the most annoying and shallow is Mr. Intriguing. You know the intriguing, right? <br /> <br /> He is a guy who, regardless of how stupid, bad and incomprehensible boring movie is, says: "Oh dear, I do not know why everyone hated him, I thought it was intriguing." He is the type of guy who intrigues the smell of dog poop. Especially when he smears him in the shape of Hitler's mustache on the upper lip and marches around the house, crying for the brilliance of science fiction, which has poorly veiled references to Greek mythology. He is also the guy for whom this version of The Wicker Man was created. No one else could stand it.
