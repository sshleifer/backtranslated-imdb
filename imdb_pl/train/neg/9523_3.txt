The plot of this film is not strong at all, there are a lot of holes. If you approach it as a car movie, it's not bad, lots of great cars in it. The reason I like it is because I'm from the area where I was filmed. The greatest pleasure for me is seeing recognizable places in St. Cloud MN and watching how the city has changed since 1989. This is an interesting historical piece for us residents. It seems that every time a movie is made, everyone wants to have a relationship with it. You can not find a copy in any of the local video stores because they were all stolen after the VHS release. If I get a copy from Japan on eBay, I find it interesting to see how the drag race path is in the whole city. I did not know that the director came from St.Cloud.
