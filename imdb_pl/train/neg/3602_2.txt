I am an avid lover of the B-Rate horror movies and watched my big piece of scarce photos, so I have a significant advantage to evaluate this film. It easily ranks in the top row of the worst horrors of the 80s. It is not as terrifying as the Night of Demons, it is not as bloody as Re-Animator and it lacks the camp value "There is nothing there". Having said that, this movie has no value. Remember that graphics are a completely different movie. Pictures of frames at the back of the DVD box do not come from this movie. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$ (There is a lot of violence, but we have seen it before: the killer kills youth students and occasional team members, cutting throats and all other tired methods of murder that use horrors). <br /> <br /> NUDITY: Brak <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ (The story focuses on Francine Forbes - who after this movie wisely changed her name to Forbes Riley - who takes jobs at the university, people start to die, and Forbes believes that the killer is attacking her, to be honest, you can not bother, because the script does not add character to anything except Forbes. <br /> <br /> ACTION: $ (horrible at all levels.) This slasher has a feeling school production - college, because students can do more than this. Forbes presents a bit of talent, like Seminara as one of the students, but everyone else is the "additions" of acting caliber).
