One of the earliest films of Frances Farmer; At the age of 22, she is absolutely beautiful. Bing Crosby is in a great voice, but the songs are not his best. Martha Raye and Bob Burns are interesting, but their comedy, probably great in their time, is really trivial today. Roy Rogers also appears as a singer. In my opinion, it's worth watching only if you're a fan of Frances Farmer and maybe a fan of Bing Crosby.
