Henry, the veterinarian (Paul Rudd), and his overbearing fiancé, Kate (Eva Longoria), are looking for arrangements at the last minute. It's their wedding morning, and Kate is in a frenzy, giving food suppliers generous information about her food presentation requirements. But horrified by the terrible ice sculpture of the "angel" ordered by Kate, he arrives without wings. In the next fight with the sculptor, the heavy "ice" virgin falls on Kate and sends her to the underworld. Now, a year later, Henry's sister arranges the psyche to tell the young vet that Kate would like him to meet other women and move forward. However, a beautiful medium, Ashley (Lake Bell), begins to be interested in Henryka, to the great disappointment of her catering partner (Jason Biggs). More importantly, Kate returns from the other side to ravage Ashley because she is not about to let another woman get Henry. Can anything be done to bring Kate back to heaven for good? This is a terrible romantic comedy, one of the worst that this fan has ever seen. No, it's not a cast because they try to make everything work. Longoria is beautiful and funny, because the overbearing fiancée and Bell have an unusual style and humor that is also contagious. Biggs, the funny thespian is also totally wasted. Regarding Rudd, a very talented performer (see Anchorman, Knocked Up, or Clueless, please), he tries the hardest of all and, in fact, is the main reason to see this clunker. Its charm, appearance and easy joke make the film bearable. But nothing can change a mindless scenario and a horrible direction in the winner, absolutely nothing. So if you're a fan of romantic comedies, think long and hard before you spend your money on it. Even if there were free tickets for your knees, warn that this movie is a near death experience for those who love cinema of love and laughter.
