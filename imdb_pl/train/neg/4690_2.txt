This British movie is really awful and it's hard to believe that Glenn Ford is in it, though it almost sleeps. The idea for a train bomb sounds good ... but it turns out that the train stops at most of the movie! No action, no traffic, only a static train. The area in which the train is parked is evacuated, so there is no danger for anyone. In fact, this movie can be used in film classes to show you how to DO NOT make a movie of a suspense. Real tension arises when the audience gets to know things that the heroes do not know, and this fact seems unknown to the director. SPOILER: the train actually has two bombs, but we are convinced that there is only one. After disarming the first bomb, there seems to be no reason to watch the movie. But at the last moment, a villain who has no clear motivation for his actions reveals that there are two. We are also not sure WHEN the bombs will go out, so we do not even have the classic sequence of tensing a "ticking bomb". A good 10 minutes or more is spent watching French wife Glenn Ford, who thinks he is leaving and then wonders where he is. He's such an annoying figure that we do not care if he'll come to terms with it, so when he does, there's nothing emotional about it. Most other characters are quite devoid of personality and none have any problems or problems. It's only 72 minutes, but it takes a long time because it is boring and boring. Do not waste time.
