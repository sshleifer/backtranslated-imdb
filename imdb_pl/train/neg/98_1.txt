I received this movie as a gift, I knew from the DVD cover that this movie will be bad. After seeing him for over a year, I finally watched him. what a pathetic movie ??. <br /> <br /> I almost did not finish watching this bad movie, but it would be unfair to write a review without watching the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Trust me when I say "this movie sucks" I'm really shocked that some bad filmmaker has been funded to make this pathetic film, but it could not have cost more than $ 20,000 to make it. all you need is a cheap camera or cellular camera. About 15 people without acting skills, a letter written by several drunk people. <br /> <br /> In the first part of this very bad movement, the reporter (Tara Woodley) suspects that he will be drunk on the way to report on the city being pursued. It is completely unharmed. They went to a house that was supposed to be abandoned, but fortunately it was almost completely furnished and a bottle of alcohol on the threshold of the door was there. just for the supposed to be a drunk man, but everything is not what it seems. <br /> <br /> Then the alleged drunk man starts telling ghost stories / zombie tara. <br /> <br /> The fist of his stupid bad stories must be the worst in history. <br /> <br /> his story <br /> <br /> Sgt. Ben Draper let one of his soldiers die from total exhaustion (I think this is happening) after he let poor poor private soldier Wilson sit down, let him dig a grave, and then he fell down a soldier, Ben Draper <br /> <br /> he buries it in a shallow grave. <br /> <br /> But Sgt. Ben Draper is surprised. his wife / girlfriend knows about it, and she and her lover kill Sgt. Ben Draper will take revenge on private Wilson (next to the grave of a soldier he sorts murdered). A soldier wakes up from a grave in the form of a zombie and kills them for revenge on his behalf. <br /> <br /> The spinning ending was so bad. <br /> <br /> Even if you like B HORROR movies, do not watch this movie
