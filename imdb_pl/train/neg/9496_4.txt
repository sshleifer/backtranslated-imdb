A frivolous romantic drama directed by Clint Eastwood on love relationships that develop between a wonderful hippie (Kay Lenz) and a real estate agent in Los Angeles in his golden years (William Holden, surprisingly nice in this highly imaginary arrangement). The script is small, but not devoid of thoughtful fragments; Still, the scenario is so banal in a middle age that most of the picture is childish. Maybe it worked much better with different leads: Holden and Lenz do not match each other (her attitude is so small that she seems to chase), making their intimate scenes less moving than just uncomfortable. Dated, smudged-romantic, and mostly unforgettable. ** with ****
