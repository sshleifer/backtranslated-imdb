"People I Know" is a group in which there is no one to root out, and nobody cares about it - despite the efforts of a talented cast. <br /> <br /> Pacino delivers his usual strength as Eli Wurman, the former chief advertising agent hollowed out throughout the life of moral corruption. But unlike Michael Corleone, it is impossible to invest emotionally in this character, his dilemma or his fate. <br /> <br /> The film follows Eli's preparation for the benefit of a liberal political issue, while the distracted by the client (Ryan O'Neal, good in the guaranteed part) the latest "dirty laundry" - in this case, the companion of a television actress who tied up with the wrong people. Tea Leoni brings her usual power to this supporting role, although again the script does not give her much to work with. As Eli's sister-in-law, Kim Basinger manages to evoke compassion despite the incredible mechanics of the story. <br /> <br /> This movie is only for those who like to watch Pacino, and enjoy other directors. Unfortunately, between the scenario and the "People I Know" direction, it is strictly amateur. Hence his limited cinema version and fast journey to DVD. Look out for being warned.
