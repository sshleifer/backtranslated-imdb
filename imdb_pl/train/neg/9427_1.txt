When I rented "Unhinged", I was expecting a gore movie. The box even claimed that the film had extreme scenes of violence that were cut out of the cinema release (now I have serious doubts that it will be released in the theater). After finishing the film, I was wondering how she could even get the video version. <br /> <br /> The plot looks as follows: a group of three young women traveling by car smashes his car on a tree. These women somehow go to the residence where there is an extremely sexist woman. In addition, the film consists mainly of useless scenes that aim to make a movie long enough to release it. <br /> <br /> One of the things that make this movie awful is acting. Lisa Munson, who plays the main character, seems to be reading his poems from memory cards. Others that work are bad, but not as bad as hers. Another thing that makes this movie bad is the camera technique. Many pictures are taken by cameras attached to the ceiling. It gets very annoying as the movie progresses. To top it all, there are very few gore, which makes the box very confusing. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time on this one. My rating: 1 in 10
