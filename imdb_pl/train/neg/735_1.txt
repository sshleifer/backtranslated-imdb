Five-year-old Michael sees his mother murdered by his serial killer, the father of The Highwayman, who later commits suicide. "20 years later," adolescent Mike (Gordon Currie from PUPPET MASTER 4 and 5) invites seven of his friends to his quiet grandparents home to "control his own fears" at the Halloween Night. Morty, a life-size wooden doll, kept in the attic by an Indian golden hand, is possessed by the ghost of her late father and kills them with the help of a phobia. Characters are thrown out of the window, drowned in the toilet, eaten by rats, blown up, etc. Morty transforms into a dad and a tree, walks around and makes stupid jokes. After finding a girl chopped and stuffed in a cardboard box, the characters stay at home, act cheerfully, joke and have sex. <br /> <br /> Morty's project is good, and Betsy Palmer (Mrs. Voorhees from the original Friday of THE 13TH is surprisingly delightful as grandma, but this thing is even more senseless and confusing than the original and is full of false horror, wrong actions, dead heroes, repetitions of flashbacks and annoying distorted photos from the camera, plus only two minorities (Indian and half-black girl) are the first to die.
