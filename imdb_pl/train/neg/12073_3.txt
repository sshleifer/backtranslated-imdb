*** SPOILERS *** With the gathering of family members and servants of the late Christopher Dean, John Carradine, to hear his last will and testament, they get some surprises in this dean's fortune, some $ 140 million. The money will be divided between them, but only after successfully spending a week in the dean's residence. There seemed to be confusion in this story when we later learned that it was really a night's sleep, not a week's vacation at the residence, so that guests could qualify for Dean's money because almost everyone would end up dead at sunrise. br /> <br /> The first victim of Dean Curse has nothing to do with gaining and money from the late Christopher Dean, the local sheriff Dan Garcia, Rodolfo Acosta. Acosta chopped off the head in the fridge and then served on a platter of shaken groups of guests. Later that evening sweet little Chin Greg and Laura, Jeff Morrow and Marry Anders, a small animal dog found dead outside in the pond. <br /> <br /> In the movie, all the people in Dean Mansion are taken one by one until they reveal who the killer really is. Then we have something that seems to be a double surprise in history, in which the original killer is suddenly killed along with the other two guests. A real killer ends up not only getting all the loot, $ 140 million, but in the end does not have to share it with his accomplice by doing it to him or her, giving him a poisonous cookie that kills him on the spot. br /> <br /> Nonsense who did it, and a haunted house, a movie with a cast of such immoral and unlikely characters that even the mother, let alone the audience, would have trouble. There is everything you can think about by engaging selective guests, including S & M's incest sadism and of course giving away and giving blows twice, without even counting the murder. Just do not worry about who will survive to collect Dean's fortune at the end of the movie, hoping that, against all hope, none of them will. <br /> <br /> Even the big surprise at the end is not really a big surprise, because the killer's identity reveals itself when the filmmaker forgot to keep his face in the shadows, so that you can see who he is before he even reveals himself! Then we have feature turns that eliminate the killer along with the number of other guests just to make the movie a bit more confusing than it already is. The final turn of the action, which can be seen from up to ten miles away, was to show how intelligent this obvious killer is, who cheated almost anyone watching the movie.
