I watched this movie yesterday and I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham and Tom Cavanaugh basically had to wear this incredibly incredible scenario for five hours (or whatever it was). From the beginning, every element of this movie is unbelievable. This movie has made me giggle a few times, but they were mostly shocked that the director / writer actually expected us to believe in many messy distributed elements that tried to combine this movie together. Gray (Graham) and her intimacy problems. Things become interesting when she realizes that she and her brother are unexpectedly PERFORMING too much. <br /> <br /> Interesting, intriguing. However, instead of unraveling this story into something credible and tasty, the director still takes Gray into these absurd twists of action that do not make any sense at all. Being an LGBT person, this film seemed to reflect what all heterosexuals think in the process of going out. (I will be offended if the writer's weirdo.) If it were not for the sweet chemistry between Cavanaughem and Graham (which was understandable, forced), I would give him 3 stars negative.
