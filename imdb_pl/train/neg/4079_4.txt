I bought a DVD of this movie for my girlfriend, who has the same name in the movie as the girl ghost, and likes movies about paranormal phenomena. The film was shot entirely on video, so it has the appearance of a special PBS. The special effects are false, but the film has really terrifying moments that made us jump in our chair. There is a particularly effective fear associated with the statue of the Virgin Mary. <br /> <br /> HOWEVER, acting is wrong, the "feature" scenes are long and very boring, and I will tell you that I have no idea what happened at the end. If you get a movie, rent it, if you buy it, make sure you pay less than 5 USD.
