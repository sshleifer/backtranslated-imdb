The Danish film "Slim Slam Slum" surprised me as the worst movie I have ever seen. I did not think I could get my list of bad B movies, but this one deserves gold. It's not funny. It works badly, filming badly, and the plot is bad. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it has three girls in it. I really believe that this movie can spoil the second Danish film "Stjerner uden hjerner" as the worst Danish film ever made! And that is really something. Congratulations in advance!
