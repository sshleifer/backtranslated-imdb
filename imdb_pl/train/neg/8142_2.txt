After being bitten by a bat in a cave, a doctor named John Beck passes through an accelerating transformation into a bat-man. His wife assures him that there is nothing wrong with him, it's all because of rabies or anti-rabies drugs that he's the local cop thinks John is responsible for some gruesome murders. "The Bat People" by Jerry Jameson is a hellishly horrible movie. The script is deadly boring and there is neither gore nor nakedness in it. so passionately boring, that after suffering you get a headache in disbelief. Even the young man Winston designed a creature from a bat that is completely pathetic and unforgettable. Avoid this stinking like a plague. from 10.
