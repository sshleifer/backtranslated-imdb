Whatever happened to Keaton, I want to know. <br /> <br /> Actually, I do not know, I was crawling, waving, thinking that I ought to owe half the bookmakers in Vegas, or maybe not, maybe just washed her brain blackmailed and bored with death. Rich enough to adopt a third world country, she had to somehow play another cut-out drool'athon cookie, based on the same character she had changed from the "Father of the Bride" ("91"). You'd think she's going to face Mr.Bean. <br /> <br /> (Spoilery) <br /> <br /> So hubby (Dax) gets fired by the unbearable son of the boss, his mother (Keaton) leaves her father after the classic row and breaks up with her own show of dogs, about these little bastards. Hubby has cold feet for diapers, ticking wifey and hey, let's leave the cosmic cadet as a second home guest for good, all in one day, because it's so funny and original. The wife is fed up and leaves, mom leaves her father for the cosmic cadet, and the couple catch up, 86 very long minutes later. <br /> <br /> If you must have a cosmic cadet, he also can not be cunning, can not come up with any excuse for his stay, and if mom leaves her father, can not jump into a pumpkin pumpkin just because some screenwriter he struggled to comfort himself. <br /> <br /> For this gag, in which they invite her only to discover that she has her dog's dawn in a taxi, must now be banned. And you have only one unbearable two-dimensional boss who denigrates. Another film killer would be a film screenplay in which a cosmic cadet works, apparently more lame than the one who is real, again, dejas-ad-nausea. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler does not seem happy here, her voice was sometimes weird, I wondered if it would multiply her later, and she is smart, she coped with great roles and forgive her for Jersey Girl, she was susceptible to disasters, it could happen to anyone. Dax Shepard was very visible and it is generous considering the material. <br /> <br /> Personally, it's the director, the screenwriters, and especially the producers I would like to see tar'n'feathered before sending to Guantanamo as toys for prisoners and I keep this "lite".
