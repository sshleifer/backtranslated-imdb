Spoilers in this review are offered as a public service, because the only way to enjoy this costume melodrama is to know that our heroine, Lady Barbara Skelton, is raped and shot in the end. Not a moment too soon. I'd make the screen myself, but I was afraid I would hit James Mason. <br /> <br /> The original novel from 1943, entitled "Life and death of the wicked Lady Skelton" (probably people do not whine about spoilers, wrote a woman, an English navy brat who was either worried or cynical, or one and her character is stunningly beautiful, and the author seems to think that if you have beauty, nothing else matters, but other things matter, such as the fact that Barbara Barbara's direct and only answer when someone stands in her way, The murder of three men in five attempts: the femme fatale series, has a case of a dissociative personality disorder that should land in Bedlam or Newgate. <br /> <br /> Lockwood plays it as a narcissistic vampire, wearing so much makeup that I thought of her as Joan Rivers from the restaurant age (or the era of Joan Rivers restaurant, ha!) However, Lady B. is irresistible to all three main characters - Michael Rennie, Ja Mesa Mason and Griffith Jones, who do a good job, like Patricia Roc. Of course, all three devotees realize in a short time what the psychotic bitch Barbara is, but the conspiracy keeps them all in their orbit, until one of them finally shoots her - accidentally, in something that has to be either irony or just desserts. Given the dramatic death scene with the boom lifting the camera through the windows and the heavens, I suppose we are going to give her peace of mind with her death. But that's her first corpse that we do not care about.
