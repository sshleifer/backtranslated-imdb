There were some funny ghost movies that came out of Hollywood. Cary Grant was an angel in "Biskupia's wife" (1947). Of course, Topper's films were best in the late 30's and 40's. And recently, Warren Beatty "Heaven Can Wait" (1978), which was a remake of "Here Comes Mr. Jordan 'from 1941. They were well-written, funny, funny comedies, all of which focused on supernatural creatures such as ghosts and angels. <br /> <br /> Now comes writer-director Jeff Lowell, who debuts in the feature film with the story of an inevitable, bizarre young woman, Kate (Eva Longoria Parker), who is killed on her wedding day and then returns to harass a fresh woman a baked spiritualist, Ashley (Lake Bell), who falls on her fianc√© Kate, Henry (Paul Rudd). One thing is clear at the beginning: Longoria Parker is not Constance Bennett (Marion Kerby in the first two films "Topper"), which is the standard against which all female ghosts are measured. <br /> <br /> There's a poem at the beginning when Henry's sister, Chloe (Lindsay Sloane) tells Henry, "You're not smiling." That aptly described my situation in this movie. <br /> <br /> The main problem with the movie is that the script is not too funny. But it got worse thanks to the presence of Longoria Parker, who just rubbed me the wrong way every time she appeared on the screen. To start with, adding her lack of comedy talent, is covered with so many pancakes, who knows what she really looks like? Kate is killed while setting up for a wedding by a falling frozen statue. It is so unreasonable that an angel who instructs her about what her afterlife is like, comes out on her (well, she just just disappears), so Kate is on earth as a ghost, not knowing what her mission is. <br /> <br /> Chloe wants Henry to break out of funk, which he naturally descended after Kate's death (from what I've seen with Kate, he should feel a wonderful relief), so he introduces him to Ashley, who does not really do I know what he's doing as a spiritualist (he's also catering to make ends meet) to see if he can get Henry to contact Kate. There are many meshugaas that last. <br /> <br /> The emptiness in the film is embodied by the story "B" revolving around Ashley's assistant, Dan (Jason Biggs). It was thrown at the end, but the way Ashley deals with it shows she's just as crazy as Kate. Because Dan is apparently drawn by both these women with serious defects, he deserves what he gets. <br /> <br /> Finally, Ashley appears, and the fun should begin. This is not a shame, because in other hands it can be quite fun. How is it, Norman Z. McLeod, Constance Bennett, Roland Young, Alan Mowbray and Co. they have to turn around in their graves to see that this is what they made their first two films "Topper".
