What? Is Jamie Foxx supposed to be funny? Does he really believe he is funny? Well, it's fun watching his confidence in being funny. A man has no identity ... I mean, you can immediately see who his idols are, Denzel Washington and Martin Lawrence, because he's trying to imitate them in most of his films. The only problem is that it does it wrong, uneven, and what comes out, it's some parts where it looks a bit like Denzel, with that macho-s ** t attitude, then suddenly it becomes Martin Lawrence, funny and awkward - stupid comic. There is nothing personal about it, that is, it adds nothing to the personality that he is trying to sell, and I'm sure he has nothing to say in person. He really is Mr. Dull-boy personally. <br /> <br /> I really hoped that Hollywood, and the black community in America would find someone better to put in super stardom, like Don Cheadle, but maybe pathetic Jamie better represents the generation that remixes the old.
