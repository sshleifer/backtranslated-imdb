It was a painful experience, the whole story is really, so I will not go into it, but the acting was terrible, it's the part at the very beginning, when the scientist's brother goes to work, and actually before leaving we wear a white coat at work, I thought that working with biologically dangerous material meant that you should wear sterile clothes in a controlled environment, and the laboratory itself looks like a school lab, and the monitor has a file cabinet that has nothing to do with the whole scene. to make this technical place, and the scientist actually eats breakfast in the laboratory, and next to it is a jar with biohazard signage, and his boss enters it and does not even tell him about it ... not to mention bad behavior can not be very bad nothing worse than what my advice does not look at and I thought nothing could be worse than the house of the dead, apparently the films of Uwi Bolla look like a classic Shakespeare compared to that!
