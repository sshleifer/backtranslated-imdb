This movie was bad. This movie was terrible. Acting was bad. The setting was unrealistic. The story was absurd: a comet that appears once in eons is about to appear one night. Most of the world's population decided to watch this comet. The next morning everyone, except a few, was transformed into dust from comet radiation. People's clothing is still intact, there are plants that are still alive, but people have been turned into dust. No bones, nothing. It's ridiculous. How can radiation burn people, but leave their clothes and other biological substances intact? <br /> <br /> Moreover, the comet has mutated some people into monsters that eat zombie meat. Their make-up would not even look scary on a newly born child. Insane Clown Posse scares me more ... and they look stupid. <br /> <br /> Then there were those who survived. People who were surrounded by steel when the comet passed were spared from zombies and death. How can steel block the radiation of a comet that presumably burns people in their tracks? <br /> <br /> It's equally offensive to play 60's in the background through parts of the movie, or rock from the 80's, which does not serve the movie and makes you want to shoot your TV. <br /> <br /> The stupidest part of the movie, however, are the characters on which he focuses: two Valley Girls and Chakotay from Star Trek: Voyager. These three characters were completely unrealistic. Who would have sacked the day after the apocalypse with mutants eating meat running everywhere? There were four 5-minute horror scenes throughout the film, and most of them are dreams. Between these scenes is a simple dialog box that makes South Park seem intelligent. The silence between the basic dialogue was painful. I could make a better movie with four monkeys and a Cheetos bag. Never watch this movie.
