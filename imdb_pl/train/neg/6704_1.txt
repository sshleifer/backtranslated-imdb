it's just a terrible "comedy" - it's a really bad movie. there are no fun elements. no jokes that are funny. I do not know how some people may claim that this gloomy short film can be "smartest" or "qualitative". maybe, if it's the only movie that the person has seen, you can make this claim of the brothers. but I've seen thousands of better movies: leonard part six (now, it's fun)! I do not know how the brothers are even considered eligible for inclusion on the online film base: they look more like home video than a real movie. <br /> <br /> jokes aside, skip this movie. the root canal is more pleasant than this frivolous, nonsensical material.
