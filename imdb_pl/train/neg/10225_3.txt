Now, I'm the first to admit when I say something that can be blasphemous or unjust, so I'd like to apologize in advance for my rant about how much I did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> That also sums up this fact. I did not like this movie. More specifically, I did not like the concept of the film. The photos were good. The mood was nice. And acting was satisfactory. <br /> <br /> But history is stupid, inaccurate and misleading. It is also offensive. <br /> <br /> I am the quarterfin of the Indian Cree and for some reason I feel offended, on a personal level, by the nature of Whitaker's character. First of all, he's a black guy. And this is not a racist remark, I swear. The thought of a white, Latin, and even indigenous American waving a katana on the roof offends everything that represents the katana. Katana represents the soul of a samurai, imbued with the souls of his ancestors who lead and protect samurai. In order for Ghost Dog to use his weapon instead of Katana, he is also an insult to the blade and souls inside, and how on earth did he get Katana? It must be one of those replicas, which further insults the samurai caste. <br /> <br /> Also Ghost Dog did not show any honor. At the end of the movie, he shoots a bodyguard from the back of the window, and then kills a man, shooting him in the face through the tap. This is not only a cowardly way to kill an enemy, but rather a ninja way; silent killers; a group that is denied by samurai, but hates it all. <br /> <br /> Then he tries to kill his boss when he finds out that his boss is bad. Do you know what the real Samurai do when he finds out that his master is bad or dishonorable? It is killed to prove that he would rather die and then lower himself to the level of his canine master. <br /> <br /> Everything in this form was a huge contradiction with the real code to which all Samurai apply: Bushido. <br /> <br /> So we have great pictures, good atmosphere and similar acting with a satirical plot and premise (which is unfortunately the most important aspect), which makes it an unsatisfactory general film and insult to anything that has the honor of bushi ( samurai). <br /> <br /> 2,5 / 10 ble√≥w
