I do not know why, but for some sick reason, I think that since I played the Disney sequel, I just decided to see 102 Dalmations. The first movie, which was a remake of the classic Disney movie from Glenn Close in the role of Cruella De Vil, looked like a hit, but it was just a bomb. I think the reason why these films do not work is the fact that 101 Dalmatia, the original, was a cartoon, it just worked better and was more attractive to children and adults. It was not so funny because adults run around trying to act like fairy tales, not just human beings. I understand that they are trying to make sure it's attractive to children, but it's ridiculous to see how the actors in the movie behave. And the history of 102 Dalmations is not so good. <br /> <br /> Cruella De Vil has been in prison for some time, but the situation is changing when she is proven to love animals and be a nice person. But her reputation is now damaged as a puppy-nappy, but she buys a dog shelter and is suddenly loved by everyone and seems to have changed. But when he sees his Dalmatian curates, he goes crazy and starts seeing spots, and she loses them. She's back in revenge on puppies and is still determined to get the Dalmatian coat she always wanted. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close is such an amazing actress, very unappreciated, but taking Cruella De Vil is good, but let's face it, this movie made the funny villain even more stupid. Besides, as cute as puppies, it just works better for animation, sounds stupid, but it's not as reliable without a cartoon and their personality in the mix. I really would not recommend 102 Dalmations, that's fine, but if you agree that the first movie was just a waste of time, it's the same. <br /> <br /> 2/10
