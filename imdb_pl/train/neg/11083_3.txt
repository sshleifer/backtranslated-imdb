This movie was late at night when I saw it. It was interesting at first, but it did not convince me as a whole. I'm not a Tyson fan. Actually, I do not like boxing at all. It's a barbaric, obscene and double face (according to society) that some people receive money for beating each other. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I felt that the beginning of the movie is OK. Actors in order, especially George C. Scott (as Cus D'Amato). I do not know how reliable this movie is. I did not read books and books about boxing or Tyson. I do not know anything about this man, but it was quite fun. <br /> <br /> During the film, I felt that he lost some of his charm and I lost interest. I managed not to fall asleep, but the last hour was not good enough.
