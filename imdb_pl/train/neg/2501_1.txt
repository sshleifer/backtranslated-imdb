I saw it on TV that night? or rather, every now and then I jumped to another channel to watch infomercials when I could not stand to watch it anymore. It was bad. Really very bad. Not "bad, that's good", I just feel bad. How has it been financed? Who thought it was a good idea? My friend from the audition of the actor and I was told that he is not good enough to play a bad guy, but I think they meant "saving himself and escaping from this steaming stack @ # $%". I bet the rest of the cast has been given the option. To be honest, acting was difficult to judge because of the terrifying false American entries. The shooting was dullllllllllll. The action was awkward and stiff. The dialog window was unreadable. The ship was definitely the saddest thing. In fact, the Interislander ferry is a shabby boat and does not scrub well on the film. Instead of trying unsuccessfully to make it look like a new liner crew with pieces of glitter wrapped around rusting surveys, I'm not joking, they could change the scenario to explain and even celebrate misery. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Do not watch this movie, even as a joke.
