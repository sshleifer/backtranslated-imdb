I must admit I am very disappointed. <br /> <br /> This version can not compete with the 1995 version in any way. The reason I watched it was that I was not completely satisfied with Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth, and he thought that Rupert Penry-Jones looked a lot more like the captain I had imagined when I read the book. And he was also. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is the only redeeming quality of the movie. The rest is not Austen. <br /> <br /> Miss Elliot would NEVER run the streets of Bath this way. She was not in her character, and she just was not done by the lady of those times. Anne Elliot from the book was a lady and she had dignity. There are other painful anachronisms, but that was the worst. <br /> <br /> Although there are 3 important quotes from the book, they are at completely inappropriate times, warning those who know the book that another important part of the book will either be missing or completely changed. <br /> <br /> And although this version is not much shorter than the other, it seems that everything is hurried. Very little attention was paid to the introduction of heroes, showing their instructions and motives. Important scenes have been omitted. How could they have massacred the last scenes in this way? A disaster ! And it was not as beautifully photographed as the others. <br /> <br /> No, no, no. If you love Austen, do not waste time.
