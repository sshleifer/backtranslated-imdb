This movie was horrible! I rented it without knowing what to expect. I watched the first 5 minutes and the movie and I knew it was a bomb. Acting was bad and there was no story. The monster is sooooo fake. the lips are not moving. Why should they have a doctor playing on a xylophone to kill a monster? Just angry, do not waste time. (1 of 10)
