This movie was probably inspired by Masculina Godard, f√©minin and I encourage you to watch this movie instead. <br /> <br /> The film has two strong elements, and these are (1) realistic acting (2) impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Besides, the endless stream of stupidity strikes me the most. Lena Nyman must be the most annoying actress in the world. He is acting so stupid and with all the nudity in this film ... he is unattractive. In comparison to Godard's film, intellectuality was replaced by foolishness. Without going too far in this topic, I would say that this is due to the difference in the ideals of French and Swedish society. <br /> <br /> A movie about your time and place. 2/10.
