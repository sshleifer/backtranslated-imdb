Effect (s) without a cause are usually not possible in the real world, but in the world of Hollywood remakes is not only possible, but required. The Haunting was subjected to a computer procedure thanks to the first-class operator-director-turner, who once promised (Jan de Bont-Speed), but since then he has produced a string of large budget trash (Twister, Speed ​​2). > <br /> The actor is unnecessary in this type of movie and they seem to understand it.

Why not watch effects in the service of a good story, and not just for your own good?
