What a scary movie. Do not get me wrong, Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are good actors, but apart from a few interesting sets, the film is mostly absorbed by hysterical submarines screaming, crying, sweating and generally crazy when something goes wrong. /> <br /> Take it with simple pages to make sure the audience still understands what's going on (the scene where Denzel Washington explains to the radio mechanic, how he must be like Scotty in Star Trek, is nothing more than a joke ), and you have a subdued thriller unworthy of acting. <br /> <br /> Let's hope that the real nuclear US navy is not in the hands of such a scenario! <br /> <br />
