This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I rented it as a joke, expecting to be fooled with the first few scenes and let me say that I have never laughed so hard in my life. The first scene in which the ninja jump out of the air and start a huge, funny fight for fire is one of the most amazing moments in my life. This is not a movie about dinosaurs, but a movie that makes (and does not mean) a genre of action. I did not see the first two, but judging by the complexity of the plot, I do not think I missed. If you want to see a movie that fits perfectly with a six-pack or any herbal remedy, I urge you to borrow this movie and sit down and watch the 100-year progress in the cinema thrown into the wastebasket
