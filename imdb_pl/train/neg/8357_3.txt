Man, man! What a rotting movie! But this is the pleasure of my childhood, though I hate to admit it. They were showing this movie all the time on my basic cable system. Where I grew up in San Jose, California (just off the border with Cupertino), we had what we called in the G cable system in our cable system, and in fact they showed the same one time again and again. Wanda Nevada was one of those movies. I fell in love and lust for young Brooke Shields and loved her cunning adventures in the Grand Canyon in the 1940s. The script almost does not make sense, the direction is bad, the few most important is that there is Henry Fonda, a lot of dialogues that are so bad that it's good, and the cool song Carole King played on the final subtitles. You may have to be stoned to really enjoy this movement. And hey, everyone knows there is no gold in the Grand Canyon!
