It's the worst movie I've ever seen. I was cheated thinking that it might be good because there are some of my favorite actors in it. Now I want to hit Jason Schwartzman in the face for accepting this role. I was physically sick after watching this movie. I really do not really understand Hollywood sometimes. There are so many people who try to break in, that I'm sure you can get off the top and get the best. In this way, the worst film you make is the equivalent of Ferris Beullar instead of this slime. Knews such as a hair doll and blatant peeling jeans ads added humor to the film. I am glad that I avoided this movie and watched it on television. This proves that January editions should be avoided at all costs.
