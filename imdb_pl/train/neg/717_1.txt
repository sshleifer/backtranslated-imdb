It was supposed to be a parody of the LOTR trilogy. But that was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Bad acting, bad script, bad everything. THIS IS MY PERSONAL OPINION. I have no doubt that there are people who will like this sense of humor, but there have been better parodies on films by renowned directors like Mel Brooks and Zucker Brothers. I work in a movie theater and in a DVD store, and the success of the film was similar in both areas: in the films it was a nice (but not big) success in the first two weeks, but then when reviews from those who saw that they are not very good the movie fell very quickly. The DVD sale was good for a short time, but no one asked for it. In the last ten years, the two worst movies I've seen are The Ring Thing and Torque. I can not decide which one was worse, but I'm glad that there are so many good movies, so I do not have to think too much about this question.
