I love Zombie-Movies and I love amateur productions. And Meat Market 2 begins really promising, with a nice tribute to the Fulci's Classic "Zombi". <br /> <br /> So I bent over and started to be impressed. Okay, some of the make-ups are great for any budget movie, and some of the actors (vampire and cook) really stand out, but there's nothing else. <br /> <br /> I did not expect a new Romero here, but there is not one sequence in the whole movie that would have even a little tension or shock. The director certainly knows how to put shreds of the body and interesting eating habits, but now (after two parts) it's time to learn more. <br /> <br /> In MeatMarket2, Gore rhymes with boredom - for me it's not enough - I'm sorry. <br /> <br /> ** with *****
