Sarafina's concept seems to be a sound concept, beyond the musical perspective. He tries to combine optimistic African music with a story describing the terrible conditions and atmosphere that black people had to endure while the film was set. The contradictions of each of these two elements are too bright, and the film never justifies such violent changes between joy and terror. If it was just a drama reflecting these conditions, it could be a good movie, but the scenes of school children shot down by soldiers are not exactly next to the songs. <br /> <br /> In addition to a bad assumption, acting is not the best either, Goldberg gives average results, just like the rest of the cast. Generally disappointment. <br /> <br /> 3/10
