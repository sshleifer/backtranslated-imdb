There are bad movies, there are films that are SO bad that they become almost an art. This is one of those movies. My partner and I are still shocked, you know, staring into space and drooling! You could say that the people involved (I hope they changed their names to protect themselves) had a great time and were definitely not shy. I give to the three of ten only because of free sadness and REALLY the bad effects of gore. I was laughing loudly during most of the movie, so I think you could say that it was nice. Watch out for the viewer, the above words in no way mean that it is a good movie, because it is not. In my defense, I can only say that it was impossible to give up a movie with such a BIG title!
