What a horrible movie. I love the cinema of monsters, but I could not see even half of the horrible actors, cartoons and fatal special effects. Nothing pays off in this movie. The heroes come either from endless stocks of suicidal stupid cannon fodders, or from vain, uninspiring socks' puppets. The plot is based on the formula, cutting and pasting, standard scientific-amok drift. Even CGI is terrible. You know it's bad when you can not even rely on film to provide good candy to your eyes. No surprises here, just the same old one. This is really one of the worst films ever. Director Roger Corman should be hung on the street lamp so that children can use it as a pinata.
