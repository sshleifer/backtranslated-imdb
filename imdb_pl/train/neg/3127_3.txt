The archaeologist (Casper Van Dien) accidentally encounters ancient, well-preserved underground mummies, 40 feet high in the Nevada desert. They are determined to keep it secret and call a Jewish interpreter to help establish its history. Mumia, as explained at the beginning, is the son of a fallen angel and is one of the few giants that apparently existed in "those days." To save her son from a devastating flood that was to kill everything, he mummified his son, burying him with several servants for centuries - planning to revive him from then on. In our day, the fallen angels are still walking on the ground, and the mummy is resurrected and a ritual is expected. Most of the film is slow, it has a lot to do with biblical nonsense and a few bad fights in the air. Mumia looks decent, but it is not visible enough. It should have more to do with it, but it was very much ... eh. Do not worry.
