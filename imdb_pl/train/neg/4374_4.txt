<br /> <br /> Entrails of Virgin are so bizarre and incomprehensible that they allow the viewer to interpret them subjectively, applying whatever meaning he desires, in his inexplicable excesses of sex and violence. If it was the intended feature of the film, it would be a work of postmodern splendor, but of course it is not. <br /> <br /> Without going too far into the plot summary, let's take a quick walk around the events. In a quiet cabin, there is an orgy that includes topless wetsuits and a diaper. An arriving van joins the orgy, but the monster that I like to call a "mud ninja" unknowingly accompanies it. This monster precedes killing participants of the orgy one by one, with the exception of the proverbial virgin (if you do not count on oral sex) who receives his sperm and consequently becomes so passionate that he masturbates with someone's severed hand. <br /> <br /> He finally has his bowels out, and then there's a scene that seems to suggest he's pregnant with a little muddy ninja. Do you have all this? If you're going to rent this movie, it's best if you do not speak Japanese and do not have any subtitles. In a season filled with boring Hollywood movies, placing it in a video recorder can be a cinematic analogue of shock therapy. Certainly it will be something else.
