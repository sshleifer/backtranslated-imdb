What can be said about this film, except "watch out". Christmas Eve should be labeled with a warning label like cigarettes, because it was harmful to my eyes and ears. I am rarely dissatisfied with the movie "b" of the horror movie, but this movie could not even scare the five-year-old. The goal of an unrelenting madman who feels like blood in a movie is that he should look almost like a god, as if nothing could stop his mad rage, but in this movie a living psychopath stuck in the chimney a bizarre attempt to surprise the next victim and of course follow the popular The legend of Santa Claus is a reminder to the viewer that this man is not dangerous in any way, because he is too stupid to be dangerous. In total, the total loss of the film.
