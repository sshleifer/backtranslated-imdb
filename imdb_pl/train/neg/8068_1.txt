I did not have HUGE expectations for this movie when I rented it for $ 1 in the video store, but the box showed at least a small promise with a "deadly cut" "more gore! More sex! "Can not go wrong! Well ... no need to add that the box is a scam. As in Hades, the actors and actresses of this caliber have signed up for such a low film? <br /> <br /> It all starts with a drunken college girl who leaves a family home or other such building and says something useless crap for her boyfriend (?) when a camera with bad steadicam follows her. Then he is chased by some guy in a transparent plastic mask and caught by the other. They cut her wrists for no real reason and you see when they "cut through" that someone drew incisions, which looks like a crayon. <br /> <br /> From there, repeat the same subject of the girl who is being hunted / killed unskillfully by two guys for about 84 minutes. Add a shot in one shot. This is Soul Survivors. <br /> <br /> I would not have a problem with this movie if the box did not cheat me for the movie. If I borrow a bad movie that claims to have more violence and sex ... I want more violence and sex! One full shot in the front in 85 minutes from the chick, which is clearly androginous and gore, which would not scare the child, does not cut it. If it is a Killer Cut, what is Theatrical Cut ?! Of course, I doubt that this trash would be put in theaters at all. Shame the actors in this movie. I could see how their screens debut here because they did not do anything before, but they were all set up before release. I do not know if the film was filmed before they were all set up, and the studio sat in the movie until they were half-big names or not. But I want to know ... they really spent 14 million dollars on the film ?!
