I see that someone has already thought about a similar analogy, which was similar to the first thing that came to my mind after watching this movie. They said the ingredients were there, but there was no story. In addition to the sexual scenes bordering on child pornography (which I think could have been edited or presented more suggestively in nature than graphically, I would compare this film to a recipe that has been torn in half. List of ingredients, no tips on how to combine them into a finished product. the beginning lacks character development and history development ... unfortunately, many times in this monotonous nonsense we are teasing with conspiracy pieces, and we think "Ahh-OK ... in the end we will find out more about why this scene is happening ... or. .. WHO this character is ... or maybe we will finally get to know and appreciate this character more ... or better understand and engage in this relationship between characters ... etc. "But there is no happiness! On the contrary, it has been tempted many times me to just turn it off more than once, but stick it when the carrot was hanging down, just to find what in the mini-story in the above mini-plot (and this faintly before put up) was just a trick, why I stayed with him until the end, is a secret, except that IFC has a better choice and gave him 2-1 / 2 stars (another secret). It's not that the heroes are not like SOME degrees, or that you can not identify with them or even their humanity ... it just could have been much better with a little effort. I noticed that he was filmed in Santa Cruz and I wonder if it was not a film school project. It is a pity that I could not give this better review, but to be honest, it was a frustrating and disappointing loss of an hour and a half.
