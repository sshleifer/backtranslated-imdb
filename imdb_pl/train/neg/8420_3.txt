Despite the excellent cast, this film is uninteresting, especially from the perspective of aviation. It can be a bit better than the glaring "von Richthofen and Brown", but not too much. "Blue Max" remains the best of the small market in the last 35 years, while "Darling Lilli" is fun if not taken seriously. It is interesting to speculate what ILM can do with Zeppelin and Gothas in the new, high-quality WW Iero movie.
