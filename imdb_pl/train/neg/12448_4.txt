Clint Eastwood is Bronco Billy, the leader of a corpse from the Wild West, one of the six regular maladies who create a concert that breaks through on a break. The seventh member of the group is a woman, Billy's assistant, but such women never last long, and the position is chronically open. Enter Antoinette Lilly (Sandra Locke ?? at the time, Eastwood's girlfriend). It seems that Miss Lilly, as the doctor calls her (Scatman Crothers), is a would-be heiress who will receive the property of a father who has died long ago if he is 30 when he is 30 years old, cartoon Geoffrey Lewis. <br /> <br /> What is the plot of this movie? Hard to say. There is a romantic tension between Billy and Miss Lilly, but the problem is that in the first half of the movie it's so haughty, bland and disgusting that when it suddenly becomes "one of the troupe" in the middle of the movie, it's not just unbelievable , but the audience is good for it. There is a chronic lack of funds for the performance of the "Wild West", but this topic has not been touched enough to become the raison d'Ãªtre of the film. Miss Lilly's situation is that she is stuck in the rural west, cut off from funds that fuel her spoiled life in luxury (mistakenly believed to be dead on the part of the family and the press). But should we really believe that she could not go back to New York, and she was waiting for a fortune if she gave her some effort? <br /> <br /> No, the purpose of this movie is that Billy is the leader of the family, a nice group of losers who stick together thickly and slim. It's a warm, fuzzy movie? or at least trying to be. <br /> <br /> On the way Clint shows us his skills with a pistol, even frustrating the bank robbery in the shooting, which is grotesquely out of place in a relatively non-aggressive movie. One of the gangs is arrested for an old charge of evading the sketch; Billy bribes the local sheriff. The series's tent is burning; the orphanage makes them new. But many mundane traps do not make a plot. <br /> <br /> The problem is running or missing. In addition to Scatman Crothers, the supporting cast is quite amateurish. Eastwood is not at the top of his game, though he looks better simply because he is surrounded by such a nondescript group. <br /> <br /> And the movie lasts for 116 minutes. At what moment? Good question ?? <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
