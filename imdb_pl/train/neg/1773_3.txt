Oh, honey! I am rarely bored with the movie "horror", nor does it make me laugh like this. After a thrilling clash with an intriguing assumption, he descends in little more than a skilful movie, with some supernatural and sexual parties. Usually, excellent Alice Krige is wasted in this, and the twists are ridiculous. Do not bother unless you're really desperate. Rating: 3/10.
