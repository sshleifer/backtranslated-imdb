My wife and I had high hopes for this movie, but it was a big disappointment. This was the version of Mr. Magoo from Native American. A pitiful father who fails in everything that tries to fish, hunt, obviously surrenders his family to his wild fantasies. His "visions" are not only funny, but in this process he lies to his son many times about various obvious matters. Words can not express how bad this movie is. Children and wife are very real, which makes the film even sadder. I do not understand humor ... unless you like to laugh at other people making fools of themselves. I do not understand how it could bring rewards. Save your money, it is not worth borrowing.
