Lipstick is another shiny movie breakdown. I'm trying to come up with one good thing I could say about the movie, and I have a problem with inventing something. My guess is that the red dress that Margaux Hemingway had at the end of the movie was the best part. Writing and screenplay were not the worst I've ever met, but it could have been a lot better. Lipstick was very pleasing to the eye. The sets were very shiny and looked nice. The staff was fine. I felt that Anne Bancroft was the only feasible figure in the whole movie. It was sad to see Chris Sarandon wasting his time on this movie.
