This movie was written by Charlie Higson, who previously performed the "legendary" Fast Show and his own program based on one of the characters of the Fast Show (Tony, a car salesman). He also wrote James Bond books for children. <br /> <br /> Actually, I've seen only Gordon movies based on Lovecraft's stories, and each of them is wonderful. Here Gordon tries to do something else. The style is completely "contemporary", which means wobbly camera, fast and strange cut, cool chillout music in the background. It seems to me that it works quite well, but it is still pointless and cheap. This makes me often think of a camera that shakes its dv camera with actors / actresses and tries to make stylish movements in photos (hoping that something will come out of it). The cast is good and the atmosphere is the result of good direction. I think the main character, "zero" young boy, is quite interesting in his "zeronessie". The fat man is also good. A guy who looks like Alec Baldwin, but he's not. But soon after the beginning the film turns out to be something not so interesting: in this case I mean the endless line of sadism and disease scenes. There is not much humanity in this film / story: it is completely pessimistic, and every person in this movie is disgusting and hopeless or soon dead. Needless to say, there is no humor. It's vomiting with a length of 1'40 without any relief at any time. In any case, Gordon remains one of the most interesting filmmakers who are active today, and I think about this film as an experiment and as a failure in it. Sometimes everyone has to experience being lost to learn and find a way. This may be Gordon's most uninteresting and empty work.
