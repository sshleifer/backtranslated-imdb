Look, some of the interesting things that Pat's hero healer, his son Gordon (the TV ministry seems to be a family business) and Terry Meeuwsen (won the Miss of America in 1973, wearing swimwear and showing off his feet, oh God, kind!) say when our poor viewers are sick and need help. <br /> <br /> 1. Someone with a "purulent right tooth" has just been cured. Someone with "twisted intestines" has been healed.3. Then Terry said that there is a person with a "strange state" (you mean God does not know?), Burning the feet that has just been healed. Then Gordon said there is a man (who narrows it down!) With swollen sinuses in his right cheek, with a lot of pain behind his right eye, but he's healed now. 5. Someone with problematic right hip, limited mobility from stroke, now is able to walk. 6. Terry said she saw someone with severe stiffness in the neck, but she did not know the exact condition (God does not know?) - that the person is now healed. 7. Someone paralyzed on the right side, especially (Not exactly?!) Now the right side of the face has already been cured. The man (who narrows down the world population) with the plate in the skull has constant problems, and the doctors simply do not know what to do. Terry said she saw bones spin around the plate (Funny bone ?!), And the masculine pain disappeared, he was healed now. <br /> <br /> How our Pat war hero helps our sick and poor people. 1. There is a woman in Kansas City (Missouri or Kansas, but it narrows her down). Which has the bay that you are now drying, thank you Jesus. 2. There is a man with financial need - I think that one hundred thousand dollars (I think their god must go to school or something like that!) This need is being met at the moment, and within three days the money will be delivered thanks to the wonderful power of the spirit saint. Thank you, Jesus. 3. There is a woman with cancer of lymph nodes in Cincinnati. <br /> <br /> I do not know if he has yet been diagnosed (Ask your vengeful god Pat), but you do not feel well and you are now dissolving this cancer! (What?!) 4. There is a lady in Saskatoon (I assume that Canada) in the curvature of the wheelchair, the Lord straightens what is now and you can get up and walk! it's yours. Thank you, Jesus! Amen, Amen! <br /> <br /> When Pat Robertson had prostate cancer, did he go to Peter Popoff, Oral Roberts, Benny Hinn, Terry or Gordon? No! On February 17, 2003, Pat went to a REAL DOCTOR to undergo surgery! (You mean he does not trust his friends healing the faith, Terry or his own son Gordon?!) <br /> <br /> When LT Pat Robertson was in Marines during the Korean War He was an alcohol officer, responsible for keeping officers provided with alcohol. He was known for drinking himself and frequent prostitutes and he was afraid he had contacted gonorrhea. (They should ask the healer for help!) <br /> <br /> The reason why Pat slipped out of the fight was his daddy Absalom Willis Robertson (D Va from 1946-66) was the chairman of the Senate Committee on Military Measures. <br /> <br /> Terrorist Attacks, September 11, 2001. We imagined that we are insensitive and are caught up in pursuit of health, wealth (Pats worth from 150 to 200 million dollars!) material enjoyment (residence in Virginia beach Virginia with helicopter landing pad!) and sexuality (He had sex with his future wife before marriage, who had a son!). It happens (terrorism) because God raises his protection against us (Statement issued on 13 September 2001) Pat Robertson reminds me of a Burgermeister about Santa Claus who comes to the city, and his evil, vengeful god reminds me of Venger on the Dungeons dragons. <br /> <br /> The broken brother Gordon does what Pat's dad tells him, and Terry is a paid woman who does not have her own minds! <br /> <br /> It will really catch you! On September 5, 2005 at the 700 Club, a reportage by Gary Lane from the Christian Broadcasting Network came from outside the Congress Center in New Orleans, where the poor victims of the black catastrophe were all over the weekend. "A lot of leftover suggests a way of thinking some evacuees," Lane said, "contain this voodoo cup with the inscription," Let the curse be with you. "A souvenir mug of a plastic mug from one of New Orleans's countless stores with trinkets appeared on the screen. title of Guerrilla Warfare and Thugs 'R' Us. "Said Lane, pointing to stacked or rap CDs scattered on the ground (his bigotsky dad Absalom taught Pat racism well!) <br /> <br /> If any of you good people ever think about donating these sexist bigotowe people, please God's name, do not sponsor a softball or basketball team, give a shelf with food, be a big brother or a child's sister, but please do not give people because they have been around for over 40 years and will not solve anything. <br /> <br /> If you still do not believe me, type Pat Robertson overheard the commercial break on the web and hit the search engine, and when you hear what he really likes, I know for sure that you will not give one cent to those liars! And by the way Terry used to divorce and Pat talked with divorce many times at his concerts. <br /> <br /> I like to say hello to people from Dover in Pennsylvania, Orlando, Florida and nice people who hit Hurricane Katrina and I hope it will be a pleasant day. Was Operation Blessing helpful to New Orleans? (I doubt it!) Let our readers know! I do! By the way, if you're sick, go to a real doctor and let everyone laugh at those liars, and one day Burgermeister Pat, Gordon and Terry can go somewhere else and take their angry god Venger with you!
