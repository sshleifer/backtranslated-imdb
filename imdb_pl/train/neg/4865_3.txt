I just did not like this movie. But then I loved Babe, a pig in town, and I was spoiled by talking movies about animals that are exceptionally well made in every respect. The animals were not nice. Everyone was annoying, especially the rock rabbit Chris Rock, but what I could have expected was Chris Rock. I believe that I smiled once or twice on a few lovely lines, but that's all.
