I would not say it's useless, but if it was not for Netflix, I would not even have it at home. Eccentric president Steve Martin's chain of health food stores collapses. It's just not funny. He is another person in BIG rejection of SNL, who can only find work until the next SNL movie. The birth coach with the lisping Elmer Fudd is as funny as the original one. Amy Poehler simply performs the same moves as in the 7-minute SNL sketch, which is recently as entertaining as SNL. The only thing that happens in this movie is that Tina Fey is easy in her eyes. The ending was predictable as soon as you heard that her character could not get pregnant. The subject could open up to other comedy attempts, but it seems simple, not very funny or creates laughter.
