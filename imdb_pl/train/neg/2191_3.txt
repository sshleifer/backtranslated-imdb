A doctor who tries to fulfill a medical dream of transplantation secretly experiments with corpses from the hospital with varying degrees of success. His last best chance comes when he wraps his girlfriend's head in love with his jacket when he rescues her from a burning vehicle. <br /> <br /> I was looking for cheese and I believed that I found it. It has everything that bad movie seekers look for - chest and brain surgery with surgeons leaving virgin white scrubs, unique camera angles (I always love watching the rear wheels of cars), cheap music for strippers with clarinet and one of the longest death scenes in film history. But unfortunately, these bad ones are good-times-they can not overcome too bad-stinking episodes. <br /> <br /> Jan in the Lord annoyed me, her buzzing monologues in a hoarse whisper, a bit smaller than the bad laugh and the fact that she was kept alive with some Colombian homemade coffee and 2 DD batteries. <br /> <br /> I could not even entertain the terrible, hyperactive and moral rightness of Dr. Bill. Usually, such hams make these films compulsory in my opinion, in this case I was bored with them. <br /> <br /> In my opinion the best part of the movie was the version of "body shopping" from 1960 and I even found myself nodding at the time. <br /> <br /> Do not spend money on this - there are better bad movies that entertain your sick sense of humor.
