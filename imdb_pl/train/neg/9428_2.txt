Usually, I do not devote time to comments that few read, about films that only a few will see. However, in this case I feel that I have to warn everyone who can consider wasting time on it. I just finished watching it just five minutes ago. It's just one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Acting is terrible, there is no conspiracy, and production values ​​are at best the level of poverty. I know that even a low-budget movie can be great, but not this one. The only thing that could save this movie for all fans of horror - more gore and cut on the screen! The total number of times this situation occurs three times is off screen. Although it is effective and quite disturbing, when it happens - especially in the case of the final scene - it simply lacks it. The film is too long for its content to be minimal, too heavy, and therefore almost impossible to view. What's happening? In short, three teenagers irresponsibly and consciously leave the house, driving through an isolated area where over 20 girls were kidnapped and murdered. Their car, of course, breaks down and is taken to an old boring home inhabited by three crazy people - one of whom is a psychotic killer. All three are ultimately murdered, one by one, out of the screen, after what seems like an eternity of boring, slow nonsense. As I said, the only things that are worth seeing even once are murders. Do not buy it or just rent it, and do not be fooled, as if I were by misleading the art and description of the movie. Save your money and your time.
