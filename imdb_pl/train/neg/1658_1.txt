This is probably the most boring movie in history. I really could not wait to see this movie with the actor / director Roman Polanski. I think I'd rather see Three Amigos than ever watch this movie. He quickly moved from the DVD player straight to the trash. I apologize to those of you who apparently liked the movie, but you probably also liked New Coke. I can not understand why anyone would enjoy this movie, it is slow, boring and there is no real story. Wait 105 minutes for the movie to start. I understand that it was done in 1976, but it was the era of bad television around. Thank God the disco and Three's Band disappeared along with stop sign and Bay City Rollers. Well, only my thoughts.
