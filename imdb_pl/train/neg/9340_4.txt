What a wasted cast. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most disappointing movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> Usually Roger Ebert does not disappoint, but I feel cheated after watching this movie. <br /> <br /> The only thrill is seeing Elizabeth in her bra. This is a sad statement about this movie. It promised so much, but it was like dry humping transvestites. <br /> <br /> This is self-defeating tripe. <br /> <br /> I can not express my bitterness deeply enough after I sat down in this movie and I hope I can warn you against the same disappointment.
