the guy who wrote, directed and stared at this shocking piece of rubbish, should really consider changing the guardian. Yes Rob Stefaniuk, I mean you! Seriously, who funded this shit? there are so many talented writers on whom you can spend your money better. I think the idea is great, but acting, scriptwriting and directing are just awful! The jokes are not funny, I understand they are going to take a mickey. BUT, do it with style, this movie screams in 1995. On Saturday evenings live. I repeat once again why studios give money to hacks like Rob Stefaniuk - NEVER GIVE UP TO COMED IN THE OPPORTUNITY OF DIRECTING AND STARS IN HIS OWN FILM. DUH!
