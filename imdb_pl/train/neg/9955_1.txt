The whole thing is very beautiful, when we looked at ... photos from the European location were a good idea. The main actors are attractive. The score is easy to handle. <br /> <br /> BUT YOU NEED! And a non-fiction developed! From there everything fell. Pacino sleepwalks, and Keller still talks about how bored he is. Honey, honey, you're not alone. When he makes Mae West's imitation, you may have to hide your face, it's painful to watch. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine how the actor or director of Sydney Pollack got involved in this or better asked why it ended so smelly? <br /> <br /> Since death is represented in almost every scene, in one way or another, perhaps you should have a little pleasure here. Maybe he should feel empty and cold like death. But I still can not recommend it.
