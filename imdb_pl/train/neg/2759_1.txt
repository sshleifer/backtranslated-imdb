Funny, laughs loud ... but not comedy. I especially liked the ambulatory gag of the ambulance soaking up the "dirty tramp" that screams angrily at them "you dirty bums", I mean wow, someone's online diploma in literature pays off! The worst scenario imaginable, with the introduction of a plot in a rapid, funny motion in the story, the development of ZERO characters (even between the characters who meet ... it's as if everyone knew each other for years and trusted each other) a suspicious voice from additional effects and role-playing holes ... oh, God, there are feature holes there !! Honestly, I write this without even looking at the whole thing, but I certainly expect that the last 30 minutes will not exactly complete this pathetic attempt at the cinema ... thank God that we have a good look, to do a bit we forget that the movie is a load ... Well ... use your imagination to finish this particular sentence!
