Wow. That's as much as I can say now. Who is writing it? Who produces these things? What self-respecting actor would agree to "act" in this matter? Oh my God! I do not know how I managed to go through this movie, but I assume I had 8 cups of coffee that day. Good Lord! It was one of the most terrifying and predictable fragments of photos I've ever witnessed ... and I do not plan to watch it again for recording. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie for the first time when I bought a DVD (ERROR # 1). I mean ... I thought, hey! Julia Stiles. I like her. She is nice. I will watch it as soon as I return home (ERROR # 2). I tried to watch it, not moaning every five minutes, wondering when this crap was coming to an end, I really did. But I could not. It was one of the worst things I've ever seen. I mean ... what about the thing in which he imagines what will happen and then he will come back to real life? It was annoying enough when my father did it in "Parenting" like ten years ago. "Jokes" - and BELIEVE on me, it requires LOT to name them - they are stupid, the characters are banal and forgotten, the story is completely predictable ... all this makes the film HIGHT TO RECEIVE HISTORY RECORDS! I should have guessed that something was wrong when I realized that I had never heard of this film. It was most likely a simple DVD. <br /> <br /> For anyone who thinks about watching this, I have one piece of advice. NO! FOR LOVE OF GOD ... NO !!! I'm ashamed that I have it in my DVD collection and I can not get rid of it ... Nobody, I mean, NOBODY wants to buy it from me! And I'm talking about used and third hand stores that buy mud from shoes and stick them to the shop window. This should let you know what CRAP is like.
