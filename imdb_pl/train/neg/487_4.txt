What did the director think? Everyone who has read the biography of Artemisia is impressed by her courage to face a public rape process in the Renaissance and even to suffer torture to show that Tassi was guilty. This fact shows true independence and emancipation - MAN is at its most terrible hour. Why should Renaissance films be so clinically and romantic, are we afraid to see the harsh side of life or have Hollywood humor won? While I would always defend the director's freedom to create his own reality in the film, I have no point in turning Artimisia's story away from my head. A very disappointing choice for the creators of this movie.
