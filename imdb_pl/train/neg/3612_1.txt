The Nut case is murdering students, can a new teacher stop madness ?! <br /> <br /> Believe me, you will not worry. <br /> <br /> With a title such as the Splatter University, immediately Collect that this movie is not a high art. But worse than the Splatter University does not even qualify for fun junk. Splatter U is so badly made - the story is mindless, the characters are thrown away, and the whole movie is devoid of the essence of the imagination. Needless to say, there is no tension or atmosphere or fear. This drivel is not even brave enough to shed any nakedness (for the cheapest thrill of everyone). There is no entertainment (even cheap laughter) around this uncompromising slass, and it just becomes a complete boredom. Down people from the barrel - even die-hard supporters will want to think twice before watching, let alone pay money for this movie. <br/> <br /> BOMB with ****
