An insatiable and unequivocal "new" Columbo, who sees that a man in a macaw takes part in the nephew's wedding, only to let his bride disappear into the wedding night. Columbo bada ... <br /> <br /> And for that matter: indifferently crossed out and surprisingly charged with flat writing, given that it was written by Robert Van Scoyk, who wrote a very nice story of Columbo "Murder Under Glass" in the glory period of the detective ; there is not even a murder you can talk about, and the greatest originator for Columbo on the part of the screenwriter is to narrow down the number of suspects using photos taken at the wedding, including all those who were there! <br /> <br /> Deprived of every possible feature of Columbo, I thought I was watching the episode of Hill Street Blues. An insult to the story of the series, with a properly functioning style of a soap opera. Very avoidable things.
