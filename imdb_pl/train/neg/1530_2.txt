I regretted that I had not recorded MĘŻCZYZN W BIAŁYM so that I could see it <br /> <br /> "What? You mean you really liked Theo? "<br /> <br /> No, that means I could see it again to see if he was so late, stupid and as embarrassingly preposterous as I remember it /> <br /> Many people claimed that it was created for children. Can I suggest that children did it too? because the entire script structure is devoid of any discipline on the part of producers and writers, and many sets seem to be attached, because it seemed a good idea at the time. <br /> <br /> The cast did not help, but I really started to feel sorry for them. Honestly, you can believe that during casting the cast had to lie to their families, that they were making a movie with a hard porn movie, which was a reason for shame because it must have appeared in something as grim as this. To give you an idea of ​​how bad acting works every time BAYWATCH, Donna D'Ericco disappeared from the narrative, I waited patiently for her to appear again, and after a few seconds I forgot she was in the movie. Did you understand? A star from BAYWATCH will appear, and a few seconds later you will forget that they are in the movie. This tells you everything you need to know about the MEN IN WHITE standard <br /> <br /> It's good that he is trying to be a live cartoon similar to THE GOODIES (although THE DISMALS would be a better adjective for this movie), though the film deserves credit for never dropping into the toilet, but taking into account that it is a movie for children (this did not prevent ITV from broadcasting at 11pm), there should be no humor in it.
