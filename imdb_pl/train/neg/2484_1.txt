I still can not believe that Wes Craven was responsible for this piece of shit. This movie is worse than "Deadly Friend." The plot is stupid, the acting is mediocre and the movie is deadly boring. Craven hates his debut "Last House on the Left" - an absolute masterpiece of this genre and likes (probably) this turkey. this.
