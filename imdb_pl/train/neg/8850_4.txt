Now this movie will not scare anyone, but it was interesting for two reasons - two main reasons and a smaller one - well, that's three reasons, right. <br /> <br /> The first reason is that special effects are interesting. I think they are quite interesting and a bit spectacular. Seeing the hair growing on Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning was terrifying, especially when they participated in the ménage à trois. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that Marsha Hunt is the famous "Brown" Sugar "Rolling Stones song and that she was on the infamous nude stage in London's cast of the musical Hair. <br /> <br /> In addition to the special effects, there were two other points of attention in the film and they were repeatedly issued during the closing of the points. I lost count, but I swear that Sybil Danning has exposed these points to us at the endpoints at least a dozen or so times and maybe even more. They were the most distinctive feature of the film.
