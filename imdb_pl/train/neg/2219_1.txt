Perhaps one of the most overrated so-called classic horrors ever made, includes the unforgettable Michael Myers and the great actor by Jamie Lee Curtis. <br /> <br /> However, its coefficient of repeatability is close to zero, there is an inexcusable amount of time devoted to the dullness / culmination of real events. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of movie in which you can leave the microwave popcorn and not miss anything. <br /> <br /> How many sequels were born, I will never understand. <br /> <br /> Thank God Rob Zombie is processing this. And generally, I hate remakes. <br /> <br /> Certainly compensate for all random gaps in filling sometimes with bizarre points of interest, which are originally missing in the original. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that we think must appeal to, just like we learn that we should enjoy Dickens. <br /> <br /> Do not assume it's a classic.
