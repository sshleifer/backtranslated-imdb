Celia Johnson is good as a nurse. Michael Hordern is good as a Capulet, although it is his usual neigh and neigh, not a patch on his King Lear. John O'Conor reads the same verse as Brother Laurence, though he never takes it. Alan Rickman is good as Tybalt, in the first of his "yuk" roles that would make him famous. Christopher Strauli's Benvolio is nice. <br /> <br /> The scenes are nice, if not stunning, as in some of BBC Shakespeare's. <br /> <br /> And that's all. The rest is poor to terrible. Rebecca Saire turned 15 during production and has no idea how to operate Juliet - she opens her eyes wide and moans each line in exactly the same way. Patrick Ryecart is poorly adapted to her, and his self-esteem is inexplicable. The balcony scene flows smoothly and smoothly, without any emotional or erotic influence. Their death brings relief. If I had a dagger, I would have offered it many hours earlier. <br /> <br /> Anthony Andrews is unspoken as Mercutio, a big shock if you remember his great job in "Brideshead Revisited". He breaks the mirror of Shakespeare's poem into a thousand fragments of two or three words, and then exclaims the fragments in a way as separate and incomprehensible as possible. In this production, Queen Mab resigns. Horrible. <br /> <br /> The director, Alvin Rakoff, shows only the intermittent gift of placing the camera in a place where he will show us what we want to see. The opening brawl is particularly inconsistent. There is humor, however, when in later fight Romeo evidently kneels Tybalt in shoemakers. Tybalt then grabs the offended region. But did it succeed? <br /> <br /> R & J is a long game. This version is not recommended for use in the classroom or many more.
