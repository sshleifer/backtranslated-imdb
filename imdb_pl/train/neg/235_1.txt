The fine can not raise this routine story of a secretary murdered by her married lover. In this one-sided narrative about romance and murder there are more questions than answers; and because we only have a prosecution, none of these questions will be answered. This is a kind of tariff that appeals to the "He Woman, Man Hater" clubs in America. As it is presented, this is a story of an innocent woman who is simply "caught" in an affair with a married, loud attorney. Could it be that if she were not expecting her boyfriend and had an affair with a married man, could you avoid the whole nasty, murderous, dirty incident? When you watch it, do not worry about going to the fridge, you will not miss anything.
