It's probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Jessica Simpson not only has no acting skills, but the script is incredibly shallow and bad. You hear a serious dialogue "I love you more." "No, I love you more." I stopped watching the movie (online) after the first half hour, I could not take it anymore. Her "southern charm of the girl" just does not work and is really annoying; her attempts at slapstick humor fall, and she makes lines as if she were reading the script directly from the site. <br /> <br /> Poor Luke Wilson. Did not he read the script before he agreed to do it, or did he fall in love with Papa Joe's promise of great profits (Jessica's dad and film producer)? I hope he knows better than to sign up for another movie like this one. Luke Wilson is actually a good actor - I hate to look at the painful expression on his face when he suffers from bad dialogue. <br /> <br /> I also think that the previous commentator giving this film 8 out of 10 was probably or somehow involved in the movie, or hired by Papa Joe to give the film a better rating. Nobody in their right mind would find this engaging movie. <br /> <br /> Jessica has a lot of money, right? Can you buy acting lessons?
