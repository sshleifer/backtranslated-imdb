This film was a huge disappointment in terms of direction, intellectual niveau, plot and the way it dealt with the subject, painting. It is a slow-paced movie, reminiscent of the Wonder Years episode, with a terrifying lack of depth. It also does not convey the message in a convincing manner. <br /> <br /> The approach to painting is very elitist, limited to vague and subjective terms as "beauty". According to the creators of this film, "beauty" can be experienced only in the kitsch landscapes in the style of Bob-Ross. Good art according to this film can be achieved using the basic (as at the elementary school) level of color theory and many sentiments. In some parts the film is offensive, eg at some point it is said (celebrating dancing on the tables) that mentally handicapped people are not capable of expressing emotions or expressing them through painting, their works by definition are worthless "nonsense" (quote). <br /> <br /> I do not understand how the film can get such a high score, and then, so far, few people rated it, and only selected very high or very low ratings.
