The effect obtained in this story of a psychiatrist who engages in cheaters is so manipulated that I must assume that it was a desirable intention. The sets are artificial and I never felt that I was watching a movie. It seemed that the actors simply read their poems instead of answering each other. While the film has elements of the early film noir (except that it is in color), the approach is so exaggerated that I almost have to say that it is a parody of the genre. <br /> <br /> Given that the presentation had not spoken to me, I expected at least a captivating story. Usually, I'm quite slow when it comes to action-story tales, but you could see what's coming in the first fifteen minutes. At the moment "Come on, I forgot about $ 80,000," I thought it was really funny. For a psychiatrist with experience in gambling addiction, behaving stupidly is unbelievable. If at any stage she behaved like a normal intelligent person, the whole story would collapse. <br /> <br /> This wooden production left me cold.
