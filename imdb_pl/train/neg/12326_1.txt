A woman (Sylvia Kristel) seduces a 15-year-old boy (Eric Brown). They're having sex ... but it's all related to some stupid plot or something. <br /> <br /> Easily one of the most disturbing erotic comedies in history. Does anyone realize that this film sheds light on child abuse? I suppose it's okay, because it's a teenage boy - if we had one with a man seducing a teenager, it would be (rightly) outrageous. I'm sorry, but making this boy does not justify it. He is still sick. I realize that Brown was already aged (when it was 18), but LOOKS 15. I'm just worrying that some people think it's OK. <br /> <br /> Set aside acting (Kristel is beautiful - but can not act; Brown is one of the worst children's actors I've ever seen), and constant nudity gets boring and is not even remotely erotic. <br /> <br /> I saw this nonsense in the theater in 1981. I was 19 years old and my 14-year-old cousin (who could easily pass up to 18). HE wanted to see it - I did not know, but I decided, what the hell? We went in and bought tickets for three teenage boys who were obviously underage. My cousin thought he was boring, and three other kids were half way! Let me be clear - three boys from TEENAGE have left the movie with lots of feminine nudity! That should give you an idea of ​​how bad it looks. I am surprised that it has ever been released. And 1 to the end.
