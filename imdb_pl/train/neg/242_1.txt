From the poorly imaginary feature line, which almost makes no sense for bad dialogue and chaotic scenes, until the final fall, bad acting (even Peter Falk can not find his way). Ms. Bertinelli's performance is devoid of depth and emotion, like her stars, William Russ, as brother Hank and David Cubitt, how love interests Noah. Jennifer Pisana as Soccoro, the daughter of one dad, Noah, is almost unbearable, let alone singing. But who can blame them with such material? Michael J. Murray's screenplay is, at best, a minor. <br /> <br /> Every year, during this time, I search TV guides and look forward to some of the truly classic holiday and inspirational holiday films that will appear on the small screen. Films such as "Miracle on 34th Street", delightful "Shop around the corner" by Ernst Lubitsch and of course "Scrooge" from 1951. There are classics by Frank Capry "It's a great life" and "Meet John Doe." Hey, forget about the classics. What about "Home Alone" or "Home for the Holidays" with Holly Hunter and the great performance of Robert Downey Jr. <br /> <br /> My gift for you is on the way advice. Your time will be better spent looking for these videos than finding "Finding John Christmas". Merry Christmas!
