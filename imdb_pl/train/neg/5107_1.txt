At this exhibition there is a British edition, which is less extravagant than the American version. The person concerned will receive a new kitchen or bedroom and bathroom and is wonderfully grateful for what they have. The American version of this program is everything that should not be in reality. Instead of making a few improvements to the house, which the residents could not afford or do themselves, the whole house is rebuilt. I do not know if this show is trying to show you how a poor social welfare system exists in the United States, or whether you are begging enough to get it. The vulgar product placement, especially by Sears, is also unjustified. Instead of swapping one family in a poor area with potential millionaires, it would be much better to help the community as a whole, where instead of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on one house, build something for the whole community .... maybe a place where DIY tools and power tools can be lend and return together with building materials so that everyone can benefit if they want to. Handing it over to one person can cause great dislike among the rest of the local community, which still lives in the same neglected homes.
