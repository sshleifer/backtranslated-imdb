Mavenki dream home of art. Discounted, discounted, exaggerated; pretentious melange, which not only did not deserve the Best Picture from 1951, but it was dwarf from the beginning. Place in the Sun, Detective Story, Streetcar Named Desire, Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man; if you call it, if it appears in 51, it is better than this house of art. The closing ballet is a flap for the crowd of intellectuals, out of place and in a bad movie. Few actors were less capable (in acting) or less charismatic than Kelly and Caron. My # 12 Worst of '51 (I've seen 201 movies), and among the 5 worst Oscar winners for the best movie.
