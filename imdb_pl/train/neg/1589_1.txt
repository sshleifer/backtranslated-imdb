It's unbelievable that the scenario as banal and completely absurd can make any screen even small. The dialogue in this film makes Catwoman seem to be a classic of high culture. Billy Zane plays a bad harmonica game, he impersonates Elvis, a gunslinger, a martial arts master who risks the life of an outdated former football player who became addicted to gambling, played by the winner of the Nap. Program "Next Action Star". His performance is as cold as ice, not cool. The "movie" is set in Vegas, and because people play poker, the writers thought it was the perfect place for a movie about a guy who tries to survive 24 hours in front of a ubiquitous, rich gambler who offered his goal of $ 2.4 million if can survive all day. And so the hunting takes place. Hunting stinking with impressive explosions, building site settings, tacky cinematography and liners containing the word "bet" or "gambling". The winner is also cast in the mix, but for what reason I have no idea. Oh, but do not worry that fans of "NAS" also lose unforgettable scenes. The ending of the surprise will knock your socks off if you love predictability or plagiarism. Joel Silver should re-evaluate her decision to sell even more. It is a pity that he can not give me these two hours of life.
