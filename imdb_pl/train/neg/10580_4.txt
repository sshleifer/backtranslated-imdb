I saw it last week after receiving a cheap DVD. I wanted to see it for centuries, thinking that the plot is very intriguing. So my disappointment was at least wonderful. I thought the main actor was very flat. This kind of part required a performance like Johny Depp in The Ninth Gate (which is almost a complete rip off), but it seems to me that TV budgets do not always reach that kind of acting ability. I also thought the direction was confused and boring, just to remind me that Carpenter had not made a decent movie since In the Mouth of Madness. Regarding history - well, I was disappointed there too! There was no way that it could meet my expectations, but I thought that the payment and explanation were poor, and the way in which he finally won the anti-climatic film, at least. <br /> <br /> one of the main AICN contributors and one can say that he loves his cinema, but I would like to get a better result from such a good initial assumption. <br /> <br /> I took the DVD back to the store the same day!
