Absolutely terrible adaptation of a great book for children. Severe and unhealthy humor, terrifying parts and disgusting story of a mother's boyfriend who wants to send a boy to a military school to get him out of the way, makes it completely inappropriate for children who will most likely want to see it because books (3-8) years old . Do not waste your money, time or good judgment.
