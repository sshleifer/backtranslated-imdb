Before watching "Dahmer" I thought that no movie could be worse than "Freddy Got Fingered". I was wrong. In conclusion, "Dahmer" is a story about a gay serial killer who almost does not kill and almost entirely consists of Dahmer's meetings with gays before they were killed. No conspiracy can be found and it serves no purpose when it comes to telling us about "Dahmer". Dahmer will only know that by watching this movie, he liked having sex with men. Horrible acting, terrible directing, horrible writing, horrible things ... If you have to choose between watching "Dahmer" and vomiting bullets for three hours, go with vomits ... it will be less painful ...
