This movie is not as good as all of Christ's films I've seen. And I am amazed that in this story Pilate wants to finish Jesus when the Holy Scriptures (and other films) say otherwise. There is also a very important issue missing: Resurrection. None of the other films skip this very important part: the faith of all of us Christians lies in this very event. As Paul says in one of his letters: "If Christ has not risen from the dead, our faith is vain." A very impressive scene for me in this film was to see the remains of palm trees on the streets that were used when Jesus entered Jerusalem. <br /> <br /> Finally, unlike my Jewish co-commentator, Jesus was NOT a myth. In fact, he was also JEW. There are many documents (religious and secular) that prove the existence of this extraordinary man (or maybe I should say that God has become a man) who really changed humanity. I highly advise him (considering that he is a historian) to read about Flavius ​​Joseph, the most brilliant Jewish commentator from the first. Century.
