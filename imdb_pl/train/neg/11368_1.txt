This film was more effective in persuading me to a Zionist conspiracy than a Muslim plot. And I am a Jew. <br /> <br /> Someone is going to journalism school? Read the editorial? Rhetoric from the first year? These alarmist claims, presented in a pleasant way, can be convincing. But without offering the recognition of possible contradictory arguments, or feasible (or not at all) solutions, few sources and any dubious origin, this makes the argument an ineffective diatribe. <br /> <br /> And thank God for that - I would not want anyone leaving the theater BELIEVING any of these racist spankings. <br /> <br /> A good lesson for me - and let's hope a warning story for you - to read about the movie.
