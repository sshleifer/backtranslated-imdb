This movie was yawning from titles to subtitles, boring to boredom, and acting is wooden and stiff! I must admit that it was the director director Richard Jobson, but who on earth has lit a scenario as poorly developed as this one? It looks like the next money in a drainage government project (Scottish Screen is a surprise, surprise). I have fallen asleep almost three times and my review will unfortunately have to be more restrained than this one. Please, Mr. Jobson, what have you been doing before sending this sedative to the movie, come back to this!
