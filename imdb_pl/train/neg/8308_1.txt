Entertainment Tonight has been going downhill for several years, but from last night (17 August 2006) They have reached a new level. <br /> <br /> Trying to raise the level of emissions, they decided to publish real photos of JonBenet Ramsey's body in their puzzles last night ... saying: "Photos from a case you've never seen before". The two photos were graphic and very disturbing. One was on the side of her face and head / neck and one could clearly see the cord that was used to strangle her neck and bruises on her face. It was so terrible that I could not believe it. How is this related to ANY related Hollywood Entertainment ?? Nothing!! They have reduced their level of dignity and values ​​to a new low level .... and it shows. It used to be a premiere program to watch ... and now it's just junk. <br /> <br /> From now on I will be watching Access Hollywood.
