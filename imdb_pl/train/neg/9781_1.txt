I do not think I'm too far away, saying it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm working on a list of my favorite war movies: "The Longest Day", "To Hell and Back", "Bridge on the River Kwai" (all black and white) that have good threads, rich characters and great acting. I saw better dialogue and action in a high school written by a student in one act. However, the plot is not a bad premise - it is simply badly implemented. It's a bit like a traffic accident, but I could not turn it off! The film does not need big money or big sets, ie "Twelve Angry Men" and "Lifeboat" to be good ... so the budget is not an excuse. What were they thinking?
