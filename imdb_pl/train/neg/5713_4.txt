There is nothing worse than renting an Asian movie and surviving the American movie. <br /> <br /> It's just my opinion, but a good thriller depends on creating nice, intelligent characters. When it comes to sympathy, the heroes of Say Yes are a peculiar marriage. Nicely done. Unfortunately, they are stupid unbelievable. Let's calculate how the terrorized by the persecutor unfairly behave. <br /> <br /> 1. After the hitchhiker threatens you with death, tell him which hotel you are in when you blow him up. <br /> <br /> 2. Defeat the infernal persecutor in broad daylight and against dozens of witnesses, thus allowing him to be charged with assault. <br /> <br /> 3. Do not hesitate to inform the police about the persecutor and just assume (for no apparent reason) that the police officers were bribed by him. <br /> <br /> 4. Trying to escape, let your mistress get out of sight as much as possible to ensure that the persecutor will kidnap her. <br /> <br /> 5. After getting help from someone who finds the persecutor after kidnapping your wife, remember to send them back as soon as possible so that you can face him. There is no point in being unjust, right? <br /> <br /> I would never expect that any person would be immune to a few mistakes in these stressful conditions, but the characters in Say Yes are so dense and cause so many incredible errors that it's virtually impossible for the viewer to look after for their safety because they are victims of their own actions. It kills the pleasure of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> In case you wonder, screenwriters do not stop at weak characters. Because they are certainly weak to write this kid, they decided to make situations so absurdly unrealistic that all sense of reality goes beyond the window. <br /> <br /> 1. Stalker kills a policeman at the police station? while the hero sleeps no more than ten feet. <br /> <br /> 2. The Stalker engages in all sorts of dubious activities in broad daylight and around many people, but no one other than the married couple seems to notice his strange behavior. <br /> <br /> 3. The stalker is experiencing an absurd amount of violence that would kill every human being. <br /> <br /> 4. The "suspense" scenes had no imagination. In fact, some of the scenes were direct rip offs of American films. <br /> <br /> The only positive is the decapitation at the end, which was quite a brutal scene because it was asked to my wife. It is a pity that the filmmakers followed this with an outrageously stupid ending that emerges from the left field. <br /> <br /> Really, the Koreans behind creating Say Yes should be ashamed. What's more, they should simply move to California and work with people who are making films with a similar disregard for quality and intelligence.
