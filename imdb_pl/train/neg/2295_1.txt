A meaningless boring movie with a charismatic Mercurio completely wasted. Released for a minute on Thursday at one local cinema and avoided by the entire Sydney population with the exception of myself and four other people. BACK OF BEYOND is a project that apparently was created by a producer looking for a fee. Local actors such as John Polson and Terry Serio deserve better (well Polson turned into the director of lame thrillers such as SWIMFAN and HIDE AND SEEK), and Terry Serio seems to never get guernsey except the role of a bandit. But Paul Mercurio should become one of Australia's largest exports on the screen. Such roles are the main disappointments, and such films are simply a waste of talent and time.
