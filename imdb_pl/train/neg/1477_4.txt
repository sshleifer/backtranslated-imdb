I saw Dolemite, as well as (Avenging) Disco Godfather, two other wonderful works of canon blaxploitation from our friend Rudy Ray Moore. But this movie, The Human Tornado (aka Dolemite 2), will always occupy a special place in my heart. For pure stupidity, lack of skills in film production and absolute enthusiasm (to be honest, a bit too much), The Human Tornado can not be crowned. <br /> <br /> The opening scene sets the tone. Our old buddy Dolemite is getting caught with a white woman when some racist local cops attack a house for no reason and you would not know it! A woman in bed with a giant Dole is nothing but a sheriff's wife. Her scream when he sees him: "He made me do it!" Dolemite shout: "& $ * @ $ are you really ???" Subtlety has never been his strong point. <br /> <br /> The most important? Very young Ernie Hudson cameo (fame Ghostbusters), continuity errors (characters looking one way in one shot, the other in the next, Dolemite suit changing colors in every shot in the night club) and demonic eyes in her first scene. <br /> <br /> But the real joy is Rudy Ray Moore himself. Did the man really think that he looks great in this movie? I certainly do not know why, but you must admire his enthusiasm. Will it be a jump completely naked from the cliff, or barking orders to the rank of his gang (eg: Quick! To the cave! I have a plan to let this mother $ * @ (% and dig my own grave!) The man is committed. Certainly he is following sideboard, never more than every time he does kung fu. The climax battle is filmed at high speed, but occasionally slows down so that Rudy poses and clenches teeth as if they accelerated the movie as a result or if they really wanted us to believe it was so fast In any case, "Matrix" is not. <br /> <br /> A human tornado, like the original Dolemite, is an incompetent movie with huge proportions, but at least it is funny and you have to give recognition to the people for their effort, but not so much.
