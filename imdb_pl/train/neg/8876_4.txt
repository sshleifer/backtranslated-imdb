Something like a family parody between "An Officer And A Gentleman", "Heartbreak Ridge", "Full Metal Jacket" (and no doubt other films I can not remember now) in a rather boring movie with bright spots. Gags are always there, where you expect them, and Damon Wayan's lines are, well, predictable. As I said, unfortunately this movie will never surprise you ...
