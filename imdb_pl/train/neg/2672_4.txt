I can not say I'm experienced in the foggy Mundae movies, when I only saw a handful, but it's obvious that it was done on narrow ground, and although it could be respectable that the filmmakers were able to do the Tomb Raider inside the garage, it's not because that it is perfectly obvious that they were doing it. The film only works for forty-five minutes and this is definitely a good thing because there is not enough conspiracy to stretch it for longer. It has something to do with a bad Nazi scientist (who looks as bad as a porn star playing a Nazi scientist ever), a mummy that is clearly a man wrapped in toilet paper and Misty - a version of Tomb Raider that stays on the summit much shorter than Angelina Jolie in a large version of the budget. I must say that even despite its flaws, this movie could be better. At the beginning, he has Misty Mundae, and even better, if you ask me about it, it's also the stars even hotter Darian Caine. The couple engages in all the lesbian sex you would expect from the movie Seduction Cinema, and it happens at the expense of a non-existent plot, although it is not really bad. Of course, this is a junk movie, but the fact that it's short is his merit, and if you're after lesbian sex, you can do worse.
