I was willing to endure many of the late spring / summer action movies, but overall it was due to the fact that most of them have reasonable payouts (ie Cool special effects, interesting twists, comic value, Steve Buscemi, etc.). This movie, however, did not have that. The only thing we got was a cheap thrill after a few minutes of Eva Longoria's splitting (the Maxima release is cheaper than the movie ticket). There is an embarrassing lack of plot, tension, storytelling, character development, continuity, etc. I would move into details, but to be honest, maybe already - I gladly forgot most of the movie. <br /> <br /> All the time I was in the theater, I was kicking for not spending the afternoon watching the 24th season on DVD. Save money on this. Unless you really, really, really like Eva Longoria's neckline.
