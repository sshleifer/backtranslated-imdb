I was expecting a movie similar to Deuce Bigalow, which I liked. However, this dud seemed to last forever. This is one of those films that enjoys a sad placement of PG-13, and at the same time is not suitable for children. Jokes are not just jokes, they are primitive, lewd, and many acts go beyond the limits of not only bad taste, but also legal and moral decency. It seems that many scenes have been cut to get the PG-13 rating ... it's a pity ... it can make a bigger splash than in a R-rated movie if it's funny. (I do not really recommend this movie, it's a waste of time ... and I'm a movie lover and I'm ready to give away everything. "After 45 minutes, the movie felt like it would end ... and the boy was ready for it. peculiar, but it does not save the rest of this swamp / tourist trap of the rental agency 1/2 stars (I'm glad I saw it as a freebie ... I would be sick to pay hard-earned greens for these tripe)
