... because 99 out of 100 times, producers have lied through their teeth (or someone else) to force you to rent or buy their * mercifully censored *. <br /> <br /> The Shock-O-Rama cinema proves the truth about it again with the release of "Feeding the Masses", perhaps with good intentions, but completely inept and gloomy entry into the zombie genre. People, it's not only low-budget filming, it's VERY low-budget filming by a group of people who - sorry, I know they have families that love them - will never, never be in variations in any meaningful way. This is one pitcher baaaaaaaaaad mooin, people, and not only because it is cheap. <br /> <br /> Acting is mediocre, but I do not blame the actors; they had no direction. They had no direction, because the script was a half-baked zombie fantasy, with no sense in real-life film storytelling. Characterization is thin at best, not due to poor dialogue and meaning. Did I mention that the script and direction are pretty bad? They are. There is no drama, no tension, no great moments, nothing. The whole premise of media suppression by the government is wasted on sophisticated "commercial breaks" and an inaccurate plot that escapes rational analysis and clumsily jumps to a ridiculous finish. Syd Fields would not be happy. <br /> <br /> How could the government suppress the truth about a scathing zombie epidemic when reality would be seen everywhere? Why should they give them something more than a cursory attempt? Nowadays, cellular cameras with wireless access, what can they hope to achieve for over a day at best? Now, if they cover something like their own fault ... but "Feeding the Masses" never investigates such possibilities. Instead, he wonders about absurdity and poorly exhibited events to look for laughter and / or meaning, praying that his audience will not notice the almost complete lack of production value beyond the basic equipment for film production. Has anyone got paid in this movie? I hope that the actors did it, at least for the time devoted to the career of dead streets like this one; at least the technicians had to get some reasonable professional experience. <br /> <br /> Even zombie fans will not gain much from "feeding the mass". Gore is incredibly domesticated for non-budget in his rank and there are no characteristic sets or unforgettable effects. In fact, all are forgotten. KNB has nothing to fear. <br /> <br /> Even junk like Aussie stillbirth "Undead" were miles before "Feeding the Masses". Excuse me, guys, we're going back to the drawing board and I'm taking deceptive marketing with me.
