An obvious attack on Microsoft by people who do not seem to understand the general intellectual property or market economy. <br /> <br /> Loony liberal tim robbins play a painfully obvious caricature of goals and are a caricature corporate villain waving right and left. <br /> <br /> While microsoft sometimes engages in anti-competitive activities, it is unlikely that they actually murder people. That is why the film is ridiculous and ridiculous from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The "deeper" point is clearly that the main technological innovations should be free to the public, and not subject to intellectual property rights. However, this ignores the fact that most major innovations would never have been developed without the market incentives (and rewards) provided by intellectual property. <br /> <br /> One thing is to oppose anti-competitive behavior - it's common sense. Another thing is the opposition to market competition, and this is what the mantra of the film represents ("knowledge belongs to humanity"). <br /> <br /> One more example of Hollywood's complete lack of contact with reality.
