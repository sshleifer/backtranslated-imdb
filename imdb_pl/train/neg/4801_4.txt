I really wanted to like this movie. It has a nice prison layout, conspiracy theories, bloodthirsty zombies, a perfectly hideous touch of the 80s and is the director's effort of actor John Saxon, who also plays the wrong (you guessed it) bad guy. It reminds me of some (beloved) Italian horrors. But the direction is very wooden and there is no nightmare / horrifying moment. It just lasts and lasts, and then (logically) must end. More uncertainty and more daring visualizations and their use as an iconic classic would be sealed.
