Just kidding! It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It was so bad it was fun. My friend and I deliberately hired him because he looked so bad. Poor old horrors are always good for some laughter. The story stinks, some voices are dubbed, the quality is terrifying. But I watched it for sure!
