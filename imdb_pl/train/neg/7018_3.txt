Completely forgotten. Especially because of poor performance. This is the first movie I've seen with Dax Shepard. To my surprise, it has been around since the late 90's. I thought he was a novice because his acting was so bland. I can say the same about Liv Tyler. Although I saw that she was doing well in other movies, she gave Clare Cooper a strange personality. Liv is not an actress who gives the hero a fiery emotional personality like Diane Keaton, but it was weird to see her in whispering. It seemed that there was no very good chemistry between the actors at all and I think that Diane Keaton sensed it too. She is a fantastic actress, but in this film she seemed a bit exaggerated. She felt as if she wanted to make this film as soon as possible. I would not blame her.
