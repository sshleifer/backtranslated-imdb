I'm glad that the people at IMDb were able to decipher how the genre falls into this genre. I suspected he was trying to be a comedy, but since it seems he wants to be a dark and solemn melodrama, I was not sure. In the case of comedy, it is amazingly devoid of even the smallest undertaking in the field of humor - until the absurd ending of the "turn" that confirms how much the time of the whole movie is wasted. It is difficult to describe how truly amateur HAZING is. Has anyone involved in this movie had any idea what to do? Actually, it's worth watching so that you can look at the screen in disbelief and disbelief, how awful it is.
