Ah WINTER KILLS, based on Richard Condon's novel, which concerns a conspiracy that killed the President of the United States 20 years ago. I knew that Condon also wrote THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, who was dealing with a similar topic and could not wait to see the intelligent thriller <br /> <br /> WINTER KILLINGS left me cold. This is not a thriller - it's a piece of worthless shit, probably the worst movie I've seen this month, and the boy has seen many bad movies in June. The problem lies both in the direction and in the scenario, and seeing that William Richert was responsible for both, he should be completely blamed for this unusual farce. <br /> <br /> There are two things wrong in the movie. First of all, the way everything is presented in a completely top-notch manner. It's not like OTT, which says something like this James Bond movie with David Niven and Peter Sellers, but it all has an advantage over the others, because the actors completely rob their performances. It could be justified if the film had an entertainment value, but there is no such thing. As a satire she is very stupid, so stupid that she almost becomes unseeable. Secondly, the scenes seem to be cut so that they become meaningless. Take, for example, the scene in which the hero faces a crazy militia leader called Dawson. Dawson tells the protagonist that he has 30 seconds to start, and then cuts off the hero on the plane. Scenes start and end without a rhyme or a reason <br /> <br /> A horrible movie that is an attempt to pass
