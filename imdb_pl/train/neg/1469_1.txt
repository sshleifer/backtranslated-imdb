Just like watching movies about a neighbor's summer camp, "Indian Summer" is a boring dream. Eight campers graduates are barely represented when incredibly boring flashbacks of characters that we know nothing about begin. Great actors, Alan Arkin and Bill Paxton are completely wasted in this film. One observation of the camper that "everything seems to be much smaller than I remember," repeats at least ten times, enough to force you to twist. The anticipated pranks are neither funny nor original, unless you think that the short sheet is a real "outing". This film was a huge disappointment, considering the great talent. "Indian Summer" did not make me miss home, only sick. - MERK
