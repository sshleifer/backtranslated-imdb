Race car drivers say that the speed of 100 mph seems fast until you have driven 150 km and 150 mph seems fast, until you have traveled 250. <br /> <br /> OK. <br /> <br /> The Andalusian dog seems breathtakingly bizarre until you see Eraserhead, and Eraserhead seems breathtaking until you see Begotten. <br /> <br /> And Begotten seems breathtaking until you see the works of C. Frederic Hobbs. Race fans, there is nothing in the whole movie world like the works of C. Frederic Hobbs. <br /> <br /> The spirit of Alabama is approaching like each of his films to a coherent story and applies only to hippies, rock concerts, voodoo, ghosts, vampires, robots, mages, corrupt international corporations, elephants and Mystery Gas. And a fantastic Woodmobile, of course, flying through the Sunset District in San Francisco. <br /> <br /> What's really surprising is that someone gave him a lot of money to make the Alabama Spirit. There are sets, lighting, hundreds of accessories, costumes, lots of effects. It somehow causes the spirit of Alabama to be WRONG. You watch a horrible cheeseball like 'Night of Horror' or 'Plutonium Baby', and at least some of the idiosyncrasies are justified on the grounds that they apparently made a video from the 'Discover' cards. But the Spirit of Alabama was made with a real budget, and this is EVIL. I mean the scenario of a tribe of cannibals living in Thunder Bay, Ontario, building a secret temple in the forest of Twizzlers, and no one is beating MY door by waving a checkbook - how did this guy get funding for FOUR of the most unstable movies?
