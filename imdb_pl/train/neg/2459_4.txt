Of course, I did not care about the things that come (aka "The Shape of Things to Come"), just like most viewers do. This means that there is a good chance that you will like it more than me. In any case, it is worth hearing a video described from a different point of view. <br /> <br /> Directed by William Cameron Menzies, who had so much experience as the set designer and even more as an artistic director, this is the film adaptation of HG Wells's own novel of the same name. In my eyes, it helps to show why a great novelist may not necessarily be a great screenwriter. <br /> <br /> The film begins in 1940 in London's "Everytown". A war arises and the inhabitants of Everytown are afraid that they can reach them. It does. And it turns into an affair lasting for decades, which essentially destroys civilization. Wells and Menzies are jumping forward in time to show us different scenes related to the war and its consequences. We see two pilots, one shot down, reconciling with the consequences of their fight. We meet a post-apocalyptic community ruled by a would-be ruler. We meet a man from a developing futuristic society. We see how technology changes. And finally, we are fully aware of this futuristic society around 2036. Where the leaders are debating the merits of sending a man to the moon. <br /> <br /> It may sound potentially very exciting, but it just does not work like a movie. Structurally, the film is too episodic, with a small amount of dramatic connection. In the third segment I completely lost interest in attempts to follow the form. I could barely organize them in the first few segments. Still a parade of new faces. We will not know anything about any of them. <br /> <br /> It does not help that individual segments, with a few exceptions, seem to be awkwardly routed and edited. Sometimes they are also manipulative - they can almost start to feel like a propaganda film. But perhaps contradictory, the segments are also a bit cold and emotionally dry. <br /> <br /> In fact, one long episode is more like a music video / promotional industrial film. If you find shots of building a futuristic city, with lots of large machines, lots of welding and so on. At some point, a guy who looks like an astronaut, waves to the camera through futuristic glass. The music for this section is somewhere between the militaristic and overblown result of horror. I can not say that Things to Come consists of engaging material in terms of drama. <br /> <br /> But a common cry that supports Things to Come is that it's a "movie about ideas." This may be true, but there are a few problems if we look at it this way. First of all, it still does not make _ the movie_ act, i.e. as visual and sound dramatic graphics, and two, there are too many ideas presented here. <br /> <br /> The main idea is that of war and what it does to civilizations. It's a great thing to do the movie. It is also extremely predictable in World War II, because "Things to come" were shot and filmed in 1935 (Published in 1936). Wells has some interesting things to say about the war, some of which are against the usual interpretation of the film. For example, the ending seems to suggest that another war will break out or explode at any moment. The general message seems a bit pessimistic. Wells seems to show that war is just a part of human nature that can not be removed, although it does not exclude "progress" - it can actually drive progress, at least indirectly. <br /> <br /> It would certainly be enough for one movie. However, there are many other ideas. The scene between the two pilots is one of the more moving scenes of the film. He deals with a complex dilemma. One pilot shot the other, but now he has to help him. But the shot down pilot carried a poisonous gas that was now rolling around the field. They can not breathe gas at the same time without harm. A girl appears. They only have two working gas masks between them. The shot down pilot offers his mask, as he says he dies. What to do? It's not that the scene itself could be stretched, but ideas - a bizarre complex of helping each other and trying to hurt each other in the middle of a war - are enough to build a movie on <br /> <br /> Another example. During scenes depicting a would-be warlord, in a post-apocalyptic environment, there appears a horrible contagious disease called "wandering disease". Turns the victim into something like drunken zombies. The usual procedure is shooting victims on the spot to stop the disease. This material is treated as if it were a reflection. It's a great idea and he deserves his own film. <br /> <br /> Similarly Wells presents future society as controversial socialist ideas. It was also enough for your own movie. It's just not possible to deal with so many things effectively in 100 minutes, especially when it's about the heart of the movie instead of the dramatic attractiveness. <br /> <br /> However, there are reasons why you should give things to at least one viewing. If you're a science fiction fan, this is a movie of historical importance. Taking into account Menzies' background, projects and stage designs are interesting, even if the photos seem extremely outdated. Also interesting is how Wells was predictive or retrospectively amusing in his "predictions". I especially liked the moon's propulsion, which strongly resembled the journey to the moon George Méliès from 1902 (Aka Le Voyage dans la lune). Just do not expect too much from things to come.
