The contest for the worst film Warner Bros. Kay Francis is stiff. I only saw eight of them, but Comet on Broadway is the worst so far. The best thing is that it is short. Oh, and Orry-Kelly's dresses (of course) are fine. James Wong Howe's pictures are not. Kay Francis looks oily and much less attractive than usual. Minna Gombell, which I do not know otherwise, is good as a semi-hard "burlesque" dancer (she looked more like a fashion show than burlesque). The final shot - Kay Francis and her child (when the child found out that Kay Francis was her mother, did I sleep?) Going down a dirty path towards a jail painted in foggy contours on the sound stage is not funny. The whole movie is so cheap, so unbelievable and so careless that he feels infected with acid cynicism from everyone who created him: Warner Bros throws trash into bucks who do not know, in Warner Bros.'s cynical respect, what they get is rubbish.
