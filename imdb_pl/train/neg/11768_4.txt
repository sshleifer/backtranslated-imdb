This re-launch is like a processed McDonald's meal compared to the very good but very underestimated Ang Lee Lee from 2003's The Incredible Hulk. <br /> <br /> "The Hulk" Anga Lee is a comic book for a thinking person. The appearance of the Hulk takes some time (about 40 minutes), but when it does, we see a conflict in the center of our hero. He's doing his best to avoid losing control, but as he admits, when he gives in to his rage, he likes it. <br /> <br /> Now compare this with the order of Edward Norton, where there is no show of conflict in his personality and turns into a Hulk every time he gets excited, and his heart rate reaches 200 beats per minute (not 183, not 197, but exactly 200). For this reviewer it was similar to the introduction of midi-chlorates in The Phantom Menace, which say how strong "strength" is with one, as if the mystical ability could be assessed through a blood test. In the 2008 film, everyone Bruce Banner Ed Norton must keep the pulse below 200, monitored by the device pinned to the wrist. And as for the record, it is extremely difficult to get a heart rate of up to 200, even through a very joyful run, especially for a physically fit person. <br /> <br /> Emotions are driving Hulk Eric Bana. He suppressed memories of his mother's death and father's role in early life. He's calm on the surface, but there's anger under him, angry enough to fuel the Hulk when he's released. But Hulk never kills intentionally, even the attacker. First of all, he just wants to get away or get closer to Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly). It overpowers its riflemen and saves a fighter in one critical scene chasing him before the collision. <br /> <br /> In the 2003 film, the visual effects are there, but if necessary. Action scenes (and there are a lot of them) are necessary for the plot, in contrast to the 2008 movie, in which action is inserted for the action itself. <br /> <br /> In his quest to turn him into a "fugitive" story, Ed Norton loses concentration on how Bruce Banner feels about Hulku. For him, Hulk is a dangerous side effect of the experiment that went wrong. And Louis Leterrier, the director who catches the clue of Ed Norton, does not add an emotional dimension to the Banner-Hulk relationship. The story can be summarized as follows: Banner is being hunted, and Hulk is kicking the ass, Banner is clamped, and Hulk is kicking the ass. Repeat if necessary. <br /> <br /> The only thing that contradicted the 2003 movie is that it is not as faithful to the comics as the 2008 version. However, even though I am a fan of comics, I would prefer a movie that is not as faithful to comics as a fanboy's dream, but has a heart over a loyal but produced and soulless version of the comic in 2008. <br /> <br /> Maybe Ang Lee should read more comics. Iron Man, also released in 2008, is a great example of a movie that is true to its comic roots and has a heart.
