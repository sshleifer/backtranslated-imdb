I'm trying to imagine a scene for Dark Angel. "I think about the Matrix, I think Bladerunner, I think that the chick who plays Faith in Angel is wearing shiny black skin - or a stick like her, leave it with us. Only - take it! I will do it without any plot, dialogue, character, decent action or budget, only loud noises and a hot staff in a shiny black leather astride a big pulsating bike. , truth? <br /> <br /> Brilliant, shallow, grim, formular, dispassionate, boring, boring, stupid, devoid of humor, expressionless, barely competent. Live anime action without any action or even life. SF just likes Joe Fanboy. :(
