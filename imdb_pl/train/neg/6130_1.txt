In the early 1980s, Kurt Thomas was a hero in the United States. Men in his position inevitably receive film roles that exist only to take advantage of it. I have no idea why Thomas paid for this film, but I would have to pay a large amount of money to agree to make a domestic fool in the film. The film is of course derived from the movie "Enter The Dragon," like most martial arts. Only instead of a real martial art they invent an absurd new martial art, accurately described by one critic as "Kung Fu intersection and break dance". The player (of course Thomas) is hired to save a lady from an impenetrable fortress, but every room has a prop, which is exactly what Thomas needs to kick a midfielder. Of course, he fights with the main villain and of course has a fanciful fight that will only come as a surprise to those who have never seen the marshal of film art. There are accents that appeal to nostalgic types, especially the hairstyles of Thomas and many male stars. But the only reason you watch this movie is that you have a grudge against Kurt Thomas, who now wants him to never set foot on the set.
