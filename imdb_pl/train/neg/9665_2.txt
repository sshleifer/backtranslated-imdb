Interesting? Hardly. The "scientific evidence" that the film presents in its point (which is basically that the Jews are cancer) is so stupid and bad that it is almost ridiculous (if we did not know what happened in those days). /> Important? No. I can not imagine that the Germans (even in this terrible time) would like or believe in this film. Compare this with the Triumph des Willens Riefenstahl. This was my film, which I was impressed with. It's just stupid rubbish. <br /> <br /> The "best" part is a scene from M (one of my favorite all-time), where (Jew, as the announcer is so loudly reminded) Lorre plays a child -cholester and murderer. In the eyes of these creators, only the depraved mind can do it. UH Huh. I did not know that M was Hitler's favorite film, right? <br /> <br /> No, it's just STUPID. Even for the Nazi-propaganda genre. 2/10.
