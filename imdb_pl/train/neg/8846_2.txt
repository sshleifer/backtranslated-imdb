In the installment of the mini series of the Babel Tower series, the narrator describes the tower builders as "descendants of Moses". <br /> <br /> It's like saying that George Washington lived many centuries before Alexander the Great. br /> <br /> Or the bulb was invented before the wheel. <br /> <br /> Or that the projectile was the precursor of the bow and arrow. <br /> <br /> I have to say more? <br /> <br /> Writers of The Greatest Heroes of the Bible should at least pay more attention to the chronology of biblical people and events.
