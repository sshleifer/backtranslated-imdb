I gave this film a very honest chance and it betrayed me. This is very little more than a black and white excuse to bored the audience, even when the egoist Bogdanavich (who did much better with TARGETS) gets "great performances" with lots of hams in his debuts. There are a lot of stereotypes related to teenage sex from this movie, such as "Doing the Teacher's Wife", "Impotence", "Doing the Ugly Prostitute" (which is very awkwardly filmed and crushes things to a complete stop, not really everything is happening) and a thin draft. <br /> <br /> I suppose this movie is supposed to be funny because of all sexual nonsense, for me it was just annoying. I was seriously more fun cleaning my nails than watching this mess.
