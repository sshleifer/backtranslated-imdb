It's not my fault. My girlfriend told me to watch it. <br /> <br /> There is nothing positive to say about this movie. For many years, there was an idea that Madonna could work, but she can not. Over the years, the idea came up that Guy Ritchie is a great director, but he's only average. Embarrassment. <br /> <br />
