I remember when it was in cinemas, reviews said it was horrible. Well, I did not think it was so bad. It was fun and had a lot of humor about families during the holidays. <br /> <br /> Ben Affleck is a rich guy who needs to find a family for Christmas to please his girlfriend. He goes to visit the house where he grew up and has a family rental agreement for the holidays. I really liked the law scene, where they sign a contract. It was funny. <br /> <br /> So he makes stupid family requests and even writes scripts to read them. Of course, the family has a hot daughter for being interested in love. He learns that holidays are not so bad after all. <br /> <br /> In addition, the whole act of doo-dah was funny, especially when they replaced the first black guy, and the girl's parents do not even say anything about it. And the parts in which doo-dah hits his "alleged daughter". FINAL VIEW: I thought it was worth checking if you caught him on the cable.
