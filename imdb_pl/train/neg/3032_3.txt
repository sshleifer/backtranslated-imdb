Somebody told me that it was one of the best adult movies. Since then I have discredited everything that this man told me after watching this movie. It's just terrible. Without going into long descriptions of different scenes, feel free to do sex scenes are at best uninteresting. Jenna in normal clothes at the beginning was the highlight of the movie (looks good), but from there everything is down.
