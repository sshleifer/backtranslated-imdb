Trying to imagine something as bland as SENTINEL would be quite difficult. The problems are numerous. The result is horrible and full of holes in the story. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas performs in the role of Pete Garrison, the Secret Service agent who "took one" for Reagan while trying his life. Many years later, Pete is assigned to the White House Family, mainly as the guardian of the First Lady (Kim Basinger, L.AU CONFIDENTIAL). Problems arise when we see Pete's close involvement in the first lady and the sudden threat to the president himself (David Rasche, UNITED 93). When Pete fails the printing exam, he was considered an unhappy agent by researcher David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland, 24 television series). <br /> <br /> As the presidential coup grows, Pete is in the running of his own people. His only confidant is the First Lady and he is reluctant to tell anyone about his feelings for each other (which is why Pete let down the polygraph above all). But is Pete really innocent? Or maybe he just tries to buy time until he can kill the president? If he is innocent, how can he help prevent an attempt to assassinate while escaping from the Secret Service? <br /> <br /> One of the great, overwhelming problems with this movie is that there is no justification for a presidential threat. Is this not the case in this film? You could think like that! But the audience is never informed why the killer wants to kill Prez. Hmm. Someone forgot to put it somewhere in the script? <br /> <br /> And what about the new partner of David Breckinridge (Kiefer), Jill Marin (Eva Longoria, CARLITA'S WAY)? It seems that she was included in the movie only as a piece of $$ - candy. What was her purpose? Did she do anything other than look pretty in tight pants and a low-cut blouse? <br /> <br /> There are so many problems with the basic premise of The Sentinel that it's funny. The action is too easily hampered by "What ...?" Answers that are definitely spoken by those who are unhappily watching a movie.
