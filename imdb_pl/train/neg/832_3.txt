I give this film props that are very well made and quite well preserved. BUt I could not exceed the unbelievableness of the whole thing. <br /> <br /> First of all, the game is built around the concept of "Russian Roulette", which must be completed within an hour. the big problem is that if you are doing a live show, you have the possibility that your first player will have bad luck that will draw a "real" ball. So what are you doing? You have 50 minutes of the show to fill and nothing to show. The aftermath is that it's okay, you'll reach the end and the first five players will survive, which means the number six has a ball and can not get a payout. At this point, he will not shoot himself, so this is a kind of anti-climat. <br /> <br /> second problem, almost as big. Human nature. People will shudder, panic, dirty their underwear and do things that otherwise would not be very good television. Too much randomness. That's why the "real" reality TV is actually scripting and even more edited. <br /> <br /> (The only accidental thing is the rage of an "executive artist" about women's victims who were in fact rare in history, predictable because they went through shooting without any effect.) <br /> <br /> We are convinced that the exhibition ratings will increase when it lasts by 1am in the morning (unlikely) with an Asian token girl announces any increase in ratings. <br /> <br /> A point in the race and sex. The big surprise is the films of two minorities (one gay) and two players who survived. We have two white men left and, of course, a slightly less lovable one is the one who buys it. The purpose of such a show would be randomness, but the guy you like is the guy who dies. <br /> <br /> Climax is that after spending two hours on television suicide, Eva Mendes (Mendes produced and played in this movie, so there is no one to blame, but she grows when someone dies What did she mean, what was going to happen? Immediately she was shot by an outsider who is angry at the whole thing (the motives have never been explained), and the show has become a big hit. Really? <br /> <br /> problem the media satire is that it must either have some ground in reality, or it must be so large that it is ridiculous (such as the Web). This is not.
