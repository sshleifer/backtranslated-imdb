This film is limping from the moment of indulgence to the moment of indulgence, promising to develop into something worth resisting. But it's not like that. It is flat, self-conscious, unimaginable and boring. <br /> <br /> A series of set photos and backgrounds does not create a movie, they create a calendar. This kind of pathetic document of the socialist pseudo-drama ("It's REAL that it REALLY happened") not only does not entertain, it does not convince, so it does not even work as a social story. Cliches mixed up with bad acting make the film very difficult to finish, and the entertainment factor disappears quickly. Characters are one-dimensional, they never develop as much as they feel. The director's ego is the biggest character in this film.
