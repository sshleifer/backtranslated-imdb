I saw this movie when it was released, and my reluctance to get stuck in me all these years. <br /> <br /> Here's why: <br /> <br /> It seems that Greenaway's goal is to take every literary picture from Storm and make it literal. If the character were to say: "my heart is running away", we will be shown a real human heart with attached wings of pigeons flapping across the screen. <br /> <br /> This process makes us deal with some luxury paintings, but ultimately it is an easy exercise. And it becomes deadly boring. <br /> <br /> I do not regret the pleasure that other viewers have found in this film, but it's worth knowing that not everyone in the audience was delighted.
