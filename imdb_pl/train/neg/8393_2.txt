John Carradine, John Ireland and Faith Domergue, who as players saw better days in better movies, met in this horror movie Grade G about life imitating art in a mysterious residence. <br /> <br /> For Carradine it was in those in the last two decades of his career that he appeared in something about the theory, it was better to work regardless of what you did and pay these payments. With this marvelous voice, Carradine was always sought after for horrors, and the man did not discriminate in the slightest of what he appeared in. <br /> <br /> Playing in the caretaker of an old gothic residence, which director John Ireland rented for his latest low-budget slasher movie. He even has a cemetery, but with a missing inhabitant. Faith Domergue is an aging Irish star, and Carole Wells is a young ingenue. <br /> <br /> In the last twenty minutes, most casts have died, which is no longer dead. The script is so inconsistent that I'm still trying to understand what's going on. I will not waste more of the gray substance on it.
