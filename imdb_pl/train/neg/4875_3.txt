My grandmother took me and my sister to see the movie when he appeared in cinemas in 1998, so we were happy to buy tickets, popcorn and soda, and went straight to the theater and sat down to watch the movie. When it ended, the audience did not applaud, I remember that I heard a few people claim that they did not like it, I did not like it, I thought it was rather stupid and not worth seeing. Eddie Murphy was hysterical about it, but apart from him the whole movie was bad, I rarely laughed at the part, I also remembered that other people in the theater hardly even laughed. And what I really thought was bad was talking to animals, because talking animals only exist in cartoons, in live action movies, they are totally mutt! I said that, apart from the hysterical turn of Eddie Murphy, who brings, this movie is not worth watching, it's rather stupid. <br /> <br /> I've seen Eddie Murphy in a few movies and I thought he was funny, I just said he was the only funny part of the movie, and I did not see Eddie Murphy in the really "great" movie "Adventures" Nash Pluto. " This movie is not a movie that I really recommend, because apart from Eddie Murphy, you probably will not like it, especially because of the many talking animals! <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie a rating of 3 stars out of possible 10 stars.
