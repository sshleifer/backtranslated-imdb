Note: I could not bring myself to write a constructive Prom Night review. It simply can not be done. Instead, I looked through what I was thinking about while watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Things I've been thinking about while watching Prom Night: <br /> <br /> -I'm tired of those dreams where these complicated deaths will only happen to the main character who will wake up just before that if he bites him. Of course, when I say "fancy death", I mean slit throat on the screen or push into the stomach. Is the whole "just a dream" not ruined by Dallas? Speaking of which, I wonder if a couple stabbing in the stomach will cause immediate death. <br /> <br /> - The film lasts only ten minutes and I can count the horror stereotypes on two hands. This is not a good sign. <br /> <br /> - Even after meeting with the main character's boyfriend I am convinced that he will die. Does anyone want to place bets? <br /> <br /> - The killer in this movie is a teacher who is obsessed with the main heroine, Donna. (By the way, does anyone think that Donna is the horrible name of the main character of the horror movie?) Three years in prison he spends maximum security before he gets away and discovers that Donna is celebrating the school ball. Although there is no accountability with the taste, I seriously wonder who would take all this time to persecute someone as boring as Donna. <br /> <br /> -High schools allow for promotion in hotels and do not follow students. Apparently, students are able to buy a hotel room and enter and leave as they please. I suppose if this feature point did not exist, the movie would be 90 minutes of boredom and accidental biting of dust every time they go to the bathroom. I suppose the compromise for their excitement is my total boredom with everything. I've already played "count pieces of chewing gum under the seat" and "guess how much money I have in my wallet" and I'm only in the 20-minute sign. How else will I play? <br /> <br /> -Note to yourself: do not forget about milk and bread on the way home. <br /> <br /> -Dear scriptwriter: You've used enough fake horror to go through this movie and any other remake of horror this year. <br /> <br /> - The 1980 version of the movie was not very good, but compared to the remake it was like Citizen Kane, at least The Godfather. Jamie Lee Curtis had one of many horror movies after Halloween, and at the end he had a bit of a "twist". I miss Jamie Lee. I would like her to behave more. <br /> <br /> - Apparently there is not much dancing at the ball. Instead, the girls fight with their boys for a place where they intend to study. I've heard that all these colleges grow up by name and I can not help thinking who those girls have to betray at the entrance exam to get there. <br /> <br /> - The killer must carry a bag of really effective cleansers and rub his mess between scenes. This is the only logical explanation of why he could stab someone on the carpet or in the bathroom and before anyone goes to the hotel room, there is no sign of a fight. (On the other hand: This is a very lazy assassin, Michael Myers went hunting for his victims. Speaking only.) <br /> <br /> -This is official: all the audience in the theater is supported by the killer. What caused this? Did Donna ever come back to her hotel room while the mermaids went, ordering everyone to leave the building? Was it her continuous dreams and how even after going through something dramatic in the aforementioned dream she insisted on recreating her steps to the shirt? Or was it the unconvincing performance of Brittany Snow? I must say that it was all above. <br /> <br /> -Okay, who had "died off the screen in the third act"? You win the pot. <br /> <br /> - At the end the movie is over. My friend turns to me and says: "Donna was not very smart." This is an understatement of the week. It's like saying that a tornado is a small gust of wind or a week's power outage is a minor inconvenience. <br /> <br /> -I can not wait to get to Rotten Tomatoes and see if anyone gave it to your favorites. <br /> <br /> - I can not recommend it. I refuse this. It's as lazy as in horror, and the only way to enjoy his cheese is that you're under the influence of at least ten beers. And unfortunately alcohol is not served for theater patrons. <br /> <br /> Rating: * with ****
