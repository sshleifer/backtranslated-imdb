Perfectly stupid weapon. I think the guys dancing at the beginning of one of Steven Segal's films were going to make Jeff laugh, making their own forms to dance music at the beginning of this stupid movie. The plot is predictable, the fights were fair, and Jeff behaves the same way as the couch, which beats some weapon in one scene.
