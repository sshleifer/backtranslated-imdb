After a long period in space, looking for the remains of the planet Krypton, Superman (Brandon Routh) returns to Earth. He misses Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) who is married and has a son with Richard White (James Marsden). In the meantime, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) plans a bad plan, using the crystals he stole from the Loneliness Fortress to create a new land and immerse the US. <br /> <br /> After so many wonderful Superman films with unforgettable Christopher Reeve, or TV shows such as "Lois and Clark" (and Teri Hatcher) or "Smallville", a great expectation was created for the return of Superman in the version of Bryan Singer. Unfortunately, the horrible story is too long and boring, with many unnecessary parts, no emotions and overrated in IMDb. In addition, the romance between Lois Lane and Superman is something shamefully funny. Twenty-two-year-old actress Kate Bosworth is wrongly cast, playing the role of a mature reporter and an experienced mother of a five-year-old boy. Brandon Routh is two years younger than Tom Welling, who plays Clark Kent's "Smallville" teenager. The figure of Parker Posey, Kitty Kowalski, is actually a stupid caricature. The last one, but not least, and despite being a great Lex Luthor, Kevin Spacey is forty-five years old, so he is older and older than the rest of the cast. The bold conclusion looks like a soap opera and is terrible. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Superman Returns"
