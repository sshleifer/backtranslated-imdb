It was obvious that this movie is aimed at addressing the audience Chick Flick, which I sat down for a few and liked the most. It was, however, a very annoying attempt by Heather Graham to become the next Meg Ryan (which became annoying by itself). Her acting was exaggerated and she seemed hyperactive compared to her friends who were relaxed in their roles. This movie could have been more because there was an adequate budget for settings, actors and a decent story. Both my wife and I agreed that at the end it was "Muck", because the film ended with a painful embarrassing amount! Better luck next time, I hope Miss Graham will stick to the films she belongs to, like from hell.
