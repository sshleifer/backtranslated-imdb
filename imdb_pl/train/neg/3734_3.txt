An incomprehensible mess. Most things in the movie look more or less like in 1987, But then futuristic things appear like a police cop's gun. And this car! The director seemed to be in love with colored lights. The only really notable performance was the girl who played Valerie, but because there was no listing, I do not know which actress she was. This one is worth missing. Degree: F
