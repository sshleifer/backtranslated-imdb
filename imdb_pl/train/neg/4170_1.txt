It is simply impossible to watch. If there is a story somewhere, it is buried so deeply under the scary characters and frightening work of the camera that it is imperceptible. There is a group of vampire hunters who walk, they make theirs, and the vampires they kill have little strangers in them. They drop their heads and talk like Speedy Gonzales. If you can imagine the blood and hiding puppet of a foreign puppet, screaming in horror as a cowboy who throws her cattle, it is here. These people are loud, nasty, brutal and just very annoying. There are also anti-human people who stand in their CGI spaceship, being so incredibly pompous that you can not take it. These people make Hillary Clinton look like a right-wing extremist in comparison. They are friends with some vampires or something ... who cares. <br /> <br /> Then there is work with the camera. Do you remember how everyone hated a thousand cuts per minute from the last Rolleball remake? The people who created this movie LOVE these things. There's enough here for three really bad nu-metal movies on MTV. <br /> <br /> Nuff said. This thing smells. For comparison, Dracula 3000 is a masterpiece.
