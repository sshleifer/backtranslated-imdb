The young scientist tries to continue the work of the deceased father on the regeneration of the limbs. His overbearing mother convinced him that he had murdered his father and monitored his progress in his own evil goals. The young doctor uses reptile DNA, which he extracts from a large creature, and when his arm is comfortably detached a few minutes later, he injects his formula and grows into a new murderous arm ... Although the special effects in "Cut off ties" are quite good and grotesque, but the rest of the movie is terrible. The cut off hand behaves like a snake and kills several people. A big opportunity. Acting is mediocre and the culmination is stupid3 out of 10.
