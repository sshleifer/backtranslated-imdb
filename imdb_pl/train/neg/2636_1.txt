Tonight I saw a movie on a free preview and despite the fact that I did not pay a penny to see this movie, I still felt cheated. Ladies and gentlemen, time is money, and if you see this movie, you leave Benjamin in your place. Acting is inert, at best; Kiefer Sutherland calls his worst incarnation in Jack Bauer, and Michael Douglas looks like he realizes he made the wrong choice, leaving Catherine Zeta-Jones for the time it takes to launch that turkey. Eva Longoria is not a subject; it looks like he is reading lines from a teleprompter. And if you can not see the "mole" in the first 20 minutes, you have just landed on this planet from a world without a television and a recycled plot. If you really want to see a good secret services thriller, borrow In the line of fire. If you see and buy it, you will start to worry about the president's safety because the Secret Service looks and acts like adult versions of the 90210 types. Regardless of your feelings about W, let's hope that this "art" does not imitate life.
