Disney approaches the well too many times, because everyone who has seen the original LITTLE MERMAID will feel stunned. Celebrating the birth of their daughter Melody, Ariel and Eric plan to introduce her to King Triton. The ceremony is quickly broken up by Ursula's sister, Morgana, who plans to use Melody as a defense tool to win the king's trident. By stopping the attack, Ariel and Eric build a wall around the ocean, while Melody grows up wondering why he can not go in there. <br /> <br /> Horrible and scary is what describes this direct sequel to the movie. LITTLE MERMAID 2 gives you the feeling that everything you watch seems to come straight from other Disney movies. I think Disney can only plagiarize! Do not tell me that the penguin and walrus do not remind you of another LION KING duo! <br /> <br /> Other disappointing moments are the rematch between Sebastien and Louie, the royal cook. They were not playing! The climax between Morgana and EVERYONE seemed another disappointment. <br /> <br /> I will not give anything, but in 75 minutes everything seemed incredibly tight and too much to deal with. Disney's embarrassment, LITTLE MERMAID 2, it's better to rent and laugh. Then you can prepare for the rest of the other Disney sequels that will drown you later.
