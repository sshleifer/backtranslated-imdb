I was interested in watching this movie because I knew it was based on Christianity. The director had a good idea / intent when creating this movie, but it could have been better. I can understand why someone would still have feelings for what they believe is the greatest love of their lives. However, I did not understand why the director made his friends so insensitive, mean and naughty. The main character continued to apologize to his friends when they were so bad to him. They did not understand at all and used God as a reason to explain their behavior. The main character, no one else knew if the girl was divorced, she was still married etc., but they were against him, solving the old feelings that had to be resolved. His friends were to be Christians and should have been portrayed as supportive, whether they agreed with his decision or not. So many times we do things in life, in which we do not apologize to those we have hurt in the past, and when they tried to do it, everyone was against him. The ironic part of his new friend was accused of persecuting for just looking for an old friend when she did a really strange thing to get his name, address and phone number ... she seemed to be a persecutor! she did not look like a friend at all, but she cared only for herself. God is love ... and I think God wants people to be with the person they were supposed to be with, and I feel that the film has done terrible injustice, making it seem that God does not care for true love ... only then you stay with someone you have badly chosen. We all make mistakes ... it's about what steps you take to fix. As I said, the movie had potential, but I was tired of repeating a one-sided point of view and clung to the throats of viewers through his so-called ... good friends. This film was not compatible with Christian faith in love, but I give it C for the effort.
