My husband rented it in the video shop, thinking it was a tension. (Never reads a summary). <br /> <br /> Well, it would be fun if the thing could be seen. It simply is not. The same thing over and over, without intrigues and WHERE did they find the main man? The leading man, Michael Des Barres, is not even quite handsome, especially when it comes to this role. In addition, sexual harassment at work is something you want to see, borrow Michael Crichton's "Revealing." At least Michael Douglas looked good in the early 90's. <br /> <br /> Alexander Paul, who is usually observable, plays an embarrassing scene here. Illuminative effects are also available cheaper than in a home webcam. Do not waste time on renting. 0/10.
