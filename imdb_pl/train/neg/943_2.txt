Here is an interesting little movie that strictly defines the phrase "low budget". Our physics teacher, who has about nine children, creates a strange serum that causes "molecular reorganization." Students are hopelessly killed by fake concoctions of sandwiches and school supplies. Sounds like the resurrection of classic B movies from the 1950s, right? No! This is not an example of good camp fun, which is a way to get out of the sign. A great presentation of the breasts and cigarette butts results from our desire for pleasure, opposing the horror, which should have 99.44% more in the first place. Entertainment at the bottom of the barrel at its best, supported by mugs of red blood and dead student bodies. Cruel movies like this will make the disastrous GURU THE MAD MONK (1970) the work of an intelligent genius who has a master's degree in film production! It's an automatic "F" so calm!
