This is the only movie I have ever seen, which prompted me to write criticisms on any website, which is a significant statement from someone who likes the "Monolith Attack". This movie is perfect for anyone who wants a harmless movie. For example, she is deprived of sex and violence. I believe that this movie is safe for children of all ages. This movie is perfect for anyone who does not want to play, challenge or stimulate in any way. Adults could easily sleep in front of the TV while the children are watching the movie. Do not be surprised, however, if you wake up to find children who have turned off the TV and started playing the board game. As an adult who enjoys entertainment who likes everything from mundane to fantastic realism, drama, comedy and action, all these adult things that reflect real life on earth and / or stimulate the imagination, this movie has nothing to offer.
