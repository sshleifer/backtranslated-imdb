Williamson's accent is difficult to pass. He speaks incredibly quickly, as if he was in a hurry to get through the lines. During monologues, he acts as if he was talking to someone when he should talk to each other. All this and his bald point just irritated me. He was just too old for the role. Reading the other accounts of Williamson, maybe he got the part because he was furious, and the director decided to follow life a bit - art or forced acting. When the actors declare that Hamlet is angry, you believe in it! Marianne Faithful is a stunning beauty and could paralyze the role of Ophelia and still get a pass. The set is dark and ominous, but it looks as if it has been shot in a real castle, especially scenes in tunnels / corridors where the dead king shines like a big light in the sky.
