I just watched it, and my better half could not believe how horrible and bad it worked. If anyone else thinks he is good, you must be happy about it. I gave up the night to watch it, everything was done before. IT MEANS. the hostel comes to mind, but at least it did not make you feel bad with bad acting and no plot, the same old things hatched, I read so much about this film, even recommended it to my friends, someone said it was good! there is no bloody, frightening or addictive revulsion to the average "frightening movie" that needs to be said, please, do not worry about this movie. get Mary Poppins. it's terrible now! I'm leaving now, I'm going to the cinema and watching something more frightening, maybe a little sun
