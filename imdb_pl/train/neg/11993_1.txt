After watching only half of the movie in school in November, today I saw that he was on the Flix channel and decided to watch it to see the rest and write a new review. <br /> <br /> The book on which the movie is based, Hatchet, is OK. However, this is a terrible adaptation. <br /> <br /> Horrible (and I mean horrible) acting, bad dialogue and medium cinematography make this horrible adaptation of Hatchet. <br /> <br /> The film starts with Brian, who is a stereotypical image of a teenager from the late 80's (he is wearing a tinge, he is banging his head in 80's rock dance music), and his mother is driving a car to get in to the plane and fly to see his alien father (his parents are divorced ... now they signal a dramatic break.) Now Brian said goodbye to his mother and the dog and flies to his father. The pilot is a fat, ugly, naughty man (not like in a book) who after 2 minutes in the air has a heart attack and dies. The book has more details when the pilot has more pains and it seemed that they were in the air a lot longer before the pilot had a heart attack. <br /> <br /> The plane (in the next two minutes) left the fuel (leaving viewers assuming that it has been there for many hours, even if the sun has not changed position, and the scenery looks exactly the same). Now it is broken on the ground. <br /> <br /> This is the point in the movie where everything is different than in the book. The book said his jacket was torn to pieces, but the movie is perfectly tearless and tears (it looks like he just bought it), he never said he climbed up, saw a wolf, and fell asleep up there never He did not say he was attacked by a bear (he said he was an elk, but not a bear), he never said he eats some worms he does, never mentions a second tornado or that he learned to get these sparrows, brush them up and eat them or this little trap for a fish farm (which one of tornadoes destroys), nor mention that it hurts ribs from one of the tornadoes. <br /> <br /> Do not even think that you can name what was shown in the movie, tornadoes. All this was just a storm of wind that knocked down some of his things. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of this camp fest were Brian's bad memories (which were never mentioned in the book), especially the stereotypical scene of Brian waking up, coming up to the window and seeing his dad (with all his stuff packed) that can fit perfectly only to the back of his truck) leaving and shouting "DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDD !!!!" (but of course his father did not hear him, although he was just outside) and punches the window (wtf?) <br /> <br /> The ending is the only thing that is close to what happened in the book (I said close.) In the book, I think one of the key things the rescue pilot said to Brian when he landed was "you're a child who they were looking for! They stopped a month ago. .. "however, they left this line in the movie. <br /> <br /> Brian is a pitiful epilogue (somehow without advice or therapy) returning to normality with his family. I think we were supposed to be gathering for Thanksgiving (because they had a turkey on the counter.) Then he shows his temporary home (because what in the movie seemed three days, but the book was for several months) and his ax, still on the tree, where he left it (also did not happen in the book), showing where he had written the message, so perfectly done: "DOM" (where should we really believe that it was engraved so perfectly with this ax?) <br /> <br /> No quote can summarize this movie better than when Enid from Ghost World said "it's so bad that it's gone well and it's bad again." Excellent description of this movie. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it to anyone (who has not read the book) and I'm just watching a movie, not a ch I would love someone who read the book (because they will be disappointed and bored with death). <br /> <br /> For those who have read the book, leave what your imagination created as a movie. This is awful and will bring your thoughts about the book. <br /> <br /> 1/10
