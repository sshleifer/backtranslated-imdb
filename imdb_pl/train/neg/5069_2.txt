I have a serious problem with this series, a few in fact. For now, just a simple list. Later, I will go on to a more detailed one: superficial figures, laughter and boring humor. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to look at the rest of this, look and read only to make you feel better (as if you were seeing something in this program that I did not) to the often annoyed teenager from Canada. TV viewers for new, good performances (Arrested Development, Dexter, etc.). Friends are equally responsible for reality TV, "Two And A Half Men" and "The King Of Queens," like TV directors. Now with a review. <br /> <br /> These characters have no soul, they are exactly the same in every respect (except sex and hair color). They react in the same way in boring situations and are completely safe in their bodies. Where is the conflict and the humor accompanying him? Why will not Rachel explode when Monica begins to meet Rachel's enemy? Why is Joey not thinking about suicide because no one takes him seriously? Oh right, because he is stupid and he feels good about it. This is the curse of having perfect characters: permanent conflict and (God's weapon) personality becomes impossible. <br /> <br /> The path of laughter is the only thing that should die right after birth. Any program that has it is almost certainly the opposite of fun. How can I make such a broad generalization? When a performance that claims to be a "comedy" requires laughter from someone who WILL REACH YOU, it must mean that the audience would not laugh without it. Laughter destroys humor, preventing quick returns. Humor becomes a construction, not a free being (see The Office, Arrested Development). <br /> <br /> This leads to my next point: humor is boring. There is no way to make the perfect hero something more than a bit humorous (apparently without laughter), because our everyday humor comes from the recognition of our faults. So what if Monica was 17? He immediately recognizes that what he does is not right and breaks with him. There must be some conflict, not an immediate solution. Maybe my mother will find out, or one of her friends tries to get rid of him and ends up seducing him. It would be great, it would be like a battle for protection! So now I have presented evidence for my position. Many of my friends love this program because they have not heard about Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development, many of my friends hate this program because they have recently started watching Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development. <br /> <br /> In my life I watched very few "friends", but I watched enough to notice the huge flaws that make me, in my opinion, completely unobtainable. If you have read this far, thank you and I hope that at least you will start to watch some of the performances that I mentioned.
