It's hard to believe that the action-packed movie "Li Li" could be so boring, but it was a transcendent basket. The story is a combination of other Hong Kong movies from China. Martial arts action are all special effects and lack of human talent. <br /> <br /> This is a comic story about a group of superhuman soldiers who are to be killed because they are mentally unstable, one of their number (Li), which stops an incompetent army to save them rebuilds life as a pacifist librarian. Rescued assassins return with the plot of quality Austin Powers to take over the world, and Li throws new life to save the world. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was called the plot of a thin wafer and a comic strip of 25 cents of special effects. But I suspect that even eight-year-olds watching Ninja turtles would find this young and empty one.
