City girl Meg Tilly receives a horrifying phone call from her mother and, understandably shocked, goes home to rural family excavations to face the mystery: why do all homespun people play in a bizarre and disturbing way? Thriller radiation, with a nod to ecology, has angry inhabitants of the town, which (laughs) includes two women staring at each other with lust in a public place, and Tim Matheson receives oral attention from the girl on the bench in the office. The picture is too stupid for words, it wastes Tilly's longing and silent intensity on the trash, forcing himself at the same time into a bend that he has no hope of getting out of. Part of the pictures by Thomas Del Ruth is good (especially the fire sequence set in the garage), although it fails by the ineffective edition - and the rather vague finale. The simplified scenario does not have a surprise or shred of originality in the sleeve. * 1/2 of ****
