For those of us who lived through these weeks filming in the city and around the valley - not to forget the tedious days of closing roads and "making movies". As a reminder, those who live here - Boulder Creek, Bonny Doon, Davenport, Big Basin. etc. The bank was a BC fire brigade; scenes of the chase included Moon Drive off Hwy 236, Empire Grade Rd and Hwy 1. <br /> <br /> Production: Jeffrey Jones was the most accessible, Matt Broderick was above us all - even then. As for the movie - a script joke, and even more laughter about acting and story - but who cares about this level. A nice time capsule for those who like our scenery of the coast and the valley. <br /> <br /> Additional comments; Joe's Bar (Jed's Tavern in the film), the original name of the movie was: Welcome to Buzzsaw - parking at Old Erbie was a town square, arrows from the yard were from Grove Street in Boulder Creek; turn off the thinking cap and see a few actors in their early days.
