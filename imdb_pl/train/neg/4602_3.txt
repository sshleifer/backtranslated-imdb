A movie without a conscience. Drifter agrees to kill a man for a gangster for money. Then they cross him. Meanwhile, he falls in love with the deceased's wife and without her knowledge that he is a killer, he moves in to her. Then "accidentally" kills her when she finds out. Then in WALKING TALL a kind of heroism, revenge on the gangsters who crossed it twice. The first problem is that by agreeing to a murder through employment, the tramp loses a sense of compassion, dignity and heroism. We can not accept any goodness in him and as a result the rest have no moral center. We just do not care about this guy. A wife (nicely played by retrieved Kari Wuhrer - sheriff in EIGHT LEGGED FREAKS), a high-class lady who runs a homeless mission, likewise loses a certain degree of compassion, jumping to bed with a homeless vagabond (despite her evidently weakened state after her husband's death). And when does he find out he's a guy? what is she doing? He closes it in his home (as if ALL houses had locks that can not be opened from INSIDE) and begin to criticize him. Stoo-pid. George Wendt, however, is great in the role of a powerful bandit. Director Stuart Gordon did much better thanks to RE-ANIMATOR and DAGON.
