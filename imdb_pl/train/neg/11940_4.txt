Well, I'd be lying if I said it could easily compete with Spiderman or Batman movies. Even so, he was more attractive to me because of moral value. First I bought VHS, when my son was about 2 years old and immediately became his favorite. My wife and I are avid supporters of Robert Townsend and have been using credit cards to fund their first Hollywood Shuffle. It is true that he must use the talents and knowledge of technical advisors to make films more credible, but his films are still fun. <br /> <br /> The meteor man provides the hero with a sense of modernity. I've always thought that if there were superheroes, they would not have the same scenarios as in comics. A meteorite man is a realistic hero with real problems: a broken car, bad neighborhood, local gangs dealing in drug trafficking, using children to distribute, etc. The scope of his mission remained in the community. <br /> <br /> What turned out to be really fun, beyond the performance of James Earl Jones "forever" how the neighborhood reacted to his newly discovered powers. It did not take long before they had a full program for him, of course without his contribution. It was fun to hear how they offer it to other communities in which their large families lived. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot was poor, the movie was predictable, the action was bad and the continuity was broken, but it ranks first among my children. Robert Townsend works on making films "home". I doubt if he'll ever be recognized as a talented actor / producer / director who he really is, but there are always and always will be those who love him for his efforts. <br /> <br /> One point to consider a movie that I think is funny: during the entire battle with Simon nobody tried to call the police ???? In addition, what kind of mother and father do you know that they will watch their son fighting from the window? My mother would be there, scratching on my side, from head to toe. Dad would load a gun. lol <br /> <br /> Rent it and check it out. It's worth seeing at least once and well for those who are fans of Sinbad, Luther Vandross, Bill Cosby, Big Daddy Kane etc. Great job with cameramen Robert!
