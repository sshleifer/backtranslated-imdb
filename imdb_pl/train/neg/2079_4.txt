I'm a huge fan of Ivan Reitman - I loved Evolution and did not like Ghostbusters? You already know from the trailer that Uma's character will be dumped by Luke. So the accumulation is, of course, at the moment when it releases its superpowers on it. But the payment does not end. (light) giggle, but once again everything was in the trailer. <br /> <br /> No one is breathing like Uma and Luke is Owen's diet in his good days. If it were not for Riann Wilson, you would sit there with a grinning smile until your cheeks begin to shrink. It's a comedy, right? <br /> <br /> It's not terrible - it just sits like a musty cracker behind a fridge. It could have been so great to send movies about superheroes and feminism, but both fail. Let's see if Jason Reitman can save his last name.
