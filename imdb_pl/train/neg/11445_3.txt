I've seen a lot of nonsense in my life, but goodness, Hot Rod takes the cake. Another evening I saw a free show in NY. I can only hope that they will show a fun version to paid customers. Big laughter was rare, the story was uninteresting, and the characters were, at best, one-dimensional. One of the attractions is a fun dance stage with Adam Samberg. It was invaluable and was the only scene I really laughed with sincerely. Besides, I can only remember the randomness and dead air. Fans of SNL and Samberg may be disappointed. I know that I expected more from him. In short, I definitely do not recommend taking part in a free show or paying for watching this movie.
