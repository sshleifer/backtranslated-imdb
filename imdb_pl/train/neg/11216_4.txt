It's just a good movie about a woman who is a twin who has a disturbing visions of her sister in danger at home. Then she returns home to find whatever is not good and that she will have to find out what happened to her sister and why. <br /> <br /> This is something that almost works, but it does not do it. t quite. I really can not understand why it did not work, but it was good enough that I would like it to be better, or at least I got little things, like having girls who play twins in flashbacks to be closer in size. It seems to me that what is wrong with it are many small things that are just bad.
