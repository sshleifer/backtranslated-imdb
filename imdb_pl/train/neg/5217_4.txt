Meet Peter Houseman, professor of rock star genetics at Virgina University. When he is not playing on the court, he blows in his mind and drops his panties during class lectures. Dr. Houseman is working on a serum that would allow the body to constantly regenerate cells, allowing people to become immortal. I would also like to be immortal if I looked like Christian Bale and got a sweet lovin woman that only the VU can offer. The choice of old and ugly university professors does not take care of the popular Houseman and cut off funds for his project due to the lack of results. This means that Peter uses himself as a guinea pig for his serum. To my surprise there are side effects and he, take it, metamorphosis! into something that is embedded in our genetic DNA that has been suppressed by "millions of years". After a full day of getting to know him, he also puts stress on the depression of Doctor Mike. She has a son. His name is Tommy. He is an angry boy. <br /> <br /> Metamorphosis is not a scary movie, it's just not well made. During all this time I could not avoid the fact that the film was filmed in 1989. The look and style of the film is the highest in the late seventies. It does not help that it is packaged along with movies from the '70s, because Metamorphosis is part of the chilling classics of 50 entertainment. In principle, there is no difference in the quality of the film. The last five minutes are a pure movie cheese, which, at least for me, saves a movie from a lower grade. Pay attention to computer terminology, such as "cromosonic anomaly". No wonder Piotr's experiment failed. Your computer can not spell! It is worth seeing, and then a trip to the local tavern.
