This film is rightly known as one of the scariest examples of propaganda ever produced. The persistent equation of Jews with illness is simply pathological, and even worse, it becomes credible for a short while <br /> <br /> by repeating itself. The fact that something so primitive works, even <br /> <br /> briefly, is itself a lesson in itself. You must have a strong stomach and a sure grip to go through, and I would not recommend trying unless you have a good reason.
