-SPOILES- Lame south of the border adventure film that has something to do with the blackmail of Rosenlski's great co-president, Unasco Inc., on the beach barbarian David Ziegler who lives the life of Reilly or Ziegler on his beach house in Cancun, Mexico. Having this record, which he gave to his brother James, he has three years of phone calls between Rosenlski and the President of the United States involved in criminal transactions. This record gave David the advantage over international gangsters who are pursuing him. <br /> <br /> The fact that James gets a bit greedy, trying to shake off Rosenlski for 2 million diamonds, not only cost him his life, but also threatened David with a loss. Ropsenlski wants to negotiate with David about the CD, forcing his ex-wife Liz to talk to him about the resignation, Rosnelski has made a deal to pay her debts if she passes. David is later killed by Mexican murderer Rosenli, Tony, with the help of a great white shark who simply does not take part in all these peaceful activities on the part of his boss. <br /> <br /> Tony took a CD that Liz left to his boss in a safe in a local hotel, and now he wants to murder James, as David did, and at the same time keep the CD going beyond Rosenlski. <br /> <br /> David, who secretly hid the diamonds James had with him at the time of his murder, is now the target of Tony and his people to shut him down for good. David also wants to take the diamonds and at the same time give his boss Rosenlski the impression that the CD he had David was lost, but later he will use her, not knowing who is behind her, to blackmail him. <br /> <br /> The movie "Night of the Sharks" has a lot of shark attacks with this huge one-eyed white shark that ends about half a dozen casts, including Tony. David, who strongly believes in gun control, uses Molotov's knives, explosives and cocktails, as well as his fists to eliminate the entire Tony crew. Even the killer shark is finished by Tony, but with a hunting knife, not a gun. When it came time to use firearms to save Paco's friend and midfielder, Juanita's girlfriend and his priest, Mattia's father, were alive with Tony, and his firearm was unbearable with David; he was more like a knife and a spearman than anything else. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie was as predictable as possible for David to think he would be killed by a one-eyed shark who later jumps out of the crowd after Rosenlski was convinced he was dead and leaving the village. David continues his life as a free living and loving sunbather, no one wants to kill him, and two million dollars richer. in honor of David, he told his friend Paco to give Rosenski back the CD, but provided that if anything happens to him, his cousin, whom Rosenlski does not know who and where he is, shot him a huge mouth and get to know the whole world about his dirty and criminal interests.
