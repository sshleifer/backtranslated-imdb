Virgin is chosen to marry a rich guy. The rich guy urinates. A woman on a boat like a sailor. Sailor urinates. Virgin attends a hearty dinner. The man urinates on the table. Boatwoman does not irritate little boys. The man pretends to be a child's urine. There is a basic motif here. Makavejev tries to say that he is in the world. To say that this is a bizarre movie is an understatement. To justify the title, there is a scene in which Laure, who hardly speaks ten lines of the film, bathes in chocolate syrup. This is a really sweet scene, but the rest of the film leaves a bad taste in your mouth, unless it happens to divide the director's fetish.
