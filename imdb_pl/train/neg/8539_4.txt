This engaging (which should not be) Spanish exploitation of low quality (quite right, which I can add) looks good, but what? Let me repeat this "huh?". In fact, the word "huh?" Would come to you a lot. Nothing makes sense or does not try. I just do not know if it is a mysteriously complicated or simply confusing confusion, but you can not deny it, how laconically carelessly, strangely and rightly it feels. <br /> <br /> Unrelated sequences related (like a nasty opening with the participation of a little girl, dead cat and fire) to a rare story with the participation of photographer Mario (played by chest puffing John Caffari, whose mustache is a dead bell to the cult Mario Nintendo, what are the chances?) Who ditches his girlfriend at home and meets a young lady (wonderfully talented Patty Shepard), who asks him to come with him for a photographic order, where in this distant mountain hiding place they come across hooded witches. <br /> <br /> Look around the unbound plot structure and immerse yourself which is simply a moody element of atmospheric mechanisms and growing anxiety. Raul Artigot manages a few unusual visualizations and terrifying fragments, but in most cases he seems to be non-existent and out of focus, just like his writing. Ramon Sempere's striking cinematographic lenses are gracefully full of landscapes as we view the picturesque views and let the time pass peacefully. However, there are some areas where it was too dark to see what is happening. The haunted and exaggerated note of Fernando Garcia Morcillo combines with the compulsively dense atmosphere created. The pencils are capable, but there is also a strong group (the choice is VÃ­ctor Israel) of secondary performances. <br /> <br /> Slow down with little interest, but this sleepy layout (which seems to go on and on) manages to keep you closed.
