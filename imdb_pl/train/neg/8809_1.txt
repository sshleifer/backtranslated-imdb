A group of women who can not sit, talk, smoke a pot. They have another woman in a wheelchair that they hide because it is deformed and sometimes they kill someone who feeds this person with a human body that really looks like a ham bought in a store they dress by gluing several plastic fingers. We do not see anyone killing them, suddenly on the floor is a body covered with a bloodied sheet. For this reason, I can no longer eat the Spam cover through the sheet. Just think about the cover of Spam on the sheet to bring the same fit to narcolepsy that tries to go through this whole movie. Sometimes there are accidentally inserted scenes of a guy who "hunts" on them, torturing a guy he has tied to a chair, is his basement. Why he did not catch this guy and how he is associated with the Sit-On-The-Couch sisters is never explained. There are also scenes of some "superhuman" guy who goes crazy. He lets blood through and hits the wall with his fist, but who he is or what's wrong with him is neither explained nor even related to the story. <br /> <br /> There are no actions, no special effects, no history. If you want to watch boring people who talk about nothing while sitting and eating ham and smoking, here's 90 minutes of it, because apart from the scene where one chick accosts on the street corner and mentions random scenes, absolutely nothing happens. (YAWN) Oh, I almost forgot, you'll see how they move some things, including the deformed sister, when they move into a new apartment. This is one of the few cases when you do not sit on the couch or lie in bed.
