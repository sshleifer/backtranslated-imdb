The only reason I did not pass this is that Sibrel shows that he is proficient in the technical aspects of film making. It is a technically proficient film. <br /> <br /> Having said that, this is a movie based on lies and distortions that can easily be refuted. Most of the documentary is devoted rather to propaganda techniques to hit the space program, not the actual one. And Sibrel's "irrefutable evidence" that the landings were faked can easily be refuted if you know anything about orbital mechanics. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend watching this, but if you do, see it in Google Video for free. Do not let Bart Sibrel use your curiosity.
