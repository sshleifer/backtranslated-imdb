I just found a television program "Mash" banal, proclaiming, so "politically correct", repetitive, pretentious and the greatest sin of all, namely? that he is (was) incredibly boring. The main character is Alan Alda "(star) who is so in love with himself and his cunning, that in fact I felt uncomfortable even trying to sit in one episode. The original series had both McLean Stevson and Wayne Rogers, which I am happy to admit that they had a certain momentum and style in relation to the character's presentation. However, Harry (Henry) Morgan and Mike Farrell, both peculiarly and together, are like eating caviar and fresh oysters with Wonder Bread. Loretta Swit, who I thought was also boring, also without guilt, was not wonderful, and Gary Burghoff, who was good in this movie, was tired of looking and acting, as was the case in the program. Watching one program every year showed it to me. Jamie Farr was just a "short comedy" and it's not worth mentioning. The reason why I did not give it a rating (one), which anyone who reads it now, would be puzzling, is that grades of any kind are not just a subjective call, but a relative one. Television, with the exception of relatively few exceptions, is such impurity. Relatively speaking, Mash had a certain quality of production (according to television standards) of that era and today, and therefore deserves two. Rob Ritter
