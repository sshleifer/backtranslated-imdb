Uninteresting addition to the peduncle cycle, which dominated the genre of horror in the 80s. He was filmed as Pranks, but released as The Dorm That Dripped Blood, which is the obvious theft from the horror anthology of 1970 The House That Dripped Blood. Daphne Zuniga is the only recognizable face in the cast and it was her first horror film (she also appeared in The Initiation and The Fly II).
