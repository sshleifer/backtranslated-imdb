I'm not a big fan of Freddy Krueger, but that does not mean I do not like Robert Englund and his other Nightmare on Elm Street movies. I think Robert is a very good actor. Nobody plays better Freddy Krueger than he does, but without offense Robert, this movie is useless. Acting is terrible, the plot is really poor, and Freddy Krueger is the only part of the cast that is even worth watching. Sometimes the sequels may be better than the first ones, like on the Friday of the 13th series (I thought the remake was the best in the series.) But this is not one of those movies. The original was good, the second in my opinion was better, the third was fine, but I do not have, I saw others. Whatever you do, do not make the same mistake I watched while watching this shit.
