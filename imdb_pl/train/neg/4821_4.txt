The feature film (mentions as a story-based, although it has a "documented" loan) about a group of scientists going to the Wild Canadians to try and find the Great Foot. device). His lot of scientific mumbo jumbo is mixed up in what is really a boring movie of a group of people roaming the desert. There are attempts to create tension and terror, but to be honest, there is nothing worth watching except some great looking shots of wild animals. This is an excellent definition of the exploitation film, it promises you so much, a look at Bigfoot, but in reality it provides very little. Recommended only for sleepless people
