I have not seen anyone from this movie yet and I think I can be the first. <br /> <br /> It was terrible. Actually, I did not watch the end. It was like watching boring soap or really good (all the soaps are shitty). The actors were poor and the plot was bad. The person who rated 10/10 has no idea what he is. The script was horrible. 2 People were in an angry conversation with threats and you expect a good guy to say something really good and beat him, but no. He says, "If you do ... I will hurt you," Hahahahaha. If a comedy is your thing, be careful. Please, do not watch this movie because ... It's CRAP !!! <br /> <br /> Summary: weak acting, bad fights, bad script. <br /> <br /> Do not look! Of course, this is my opinion.
