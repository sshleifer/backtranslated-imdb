My brother is an avid DVD collector. He glanced at the cover (two models in toilets) and had to add it to his collection. I stayed with him to see what turned out to be the scariest movie (I use this term loosely). I felt obliged to sit down. I did not dare make eye contact with my brother, quite sure he had to curse the receipt in his clenched fist. The biggest name in the whole movie is Michael Clark Duncan, who appears in one scene, which "filmmaker" decided to show each shot (about four) throughout the film. In fact, the whole film follows this clothing. The fact that the DVD contained the removed footage was a shock. (However, I went to bed without watching it). No wonder I found this disc without a case behind the TV about a week later.
