Baba - Rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life. This is the movie that caused it to fall. It was released with great popularity, but it broke down badly and suffered serious financial losses for producers and distributors. Rajinikanth had to personally pay it back for the losses he suffered. Soon after the premiere, he tried to set out into politics, but he failed. This is a very bad movie with horrible acting, bad makeup and a pathetic scenario. Throughout the film Rajinikanth looks like a person suffering from a disease. I am one of the unhappy souls who saw Baba, on the first day of the first performance in the theater. The audience was so bored that most of them left the theater before the break. I'm sorry, I do not recommend it to anyone.
