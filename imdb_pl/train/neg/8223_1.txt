By far, by far the worst movie I have ever seen, no questions asked! Contraders of this opinion may argue that this title should not be judged against the same criteria as others, because it is an independent, low-budget film, but come on now? Amateur and modest innovation are terrifying. <br /> <br /> I agree with everything that has been said about this movie, such as disgusting poor acting (when it's so bad, we go one more time to shoot the scene, damn what irritated me the most was the total lack of healthy common sense in the scenario, assuming that something like this existed during production, there was an obvious lack of dialogue with respect for viewers, the girls changed their personality several times and absolutely did not sing any rationality or even brains - five relatively good girls against one light psychopath? na niej, dlaczego nie? <br /> <br /> The only thing that can be considered as conquest of this title, is that the camera does not leave the van in no time, so the viewer sees everything inside - which is, like the rest of the movie a good idea that's made violently. <br /> <br /> oh, and by the way, this movie is NOTHING, like The Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield or any other the title shot with a handheld camera - this is an effect, not a trait! Cleverly used can be breathtaking, but in this case is a pretext for inadequate cinematography.
