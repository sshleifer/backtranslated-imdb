The opening line of Joe Dona tells everything about this movie. It takes place on the island of Malta (an island of pathetic men) and includes Joe Don Baker who is tracking an Italian gangster. The character of Joe Don is called Geronimo (pronounced Heronimo), and everything he does in this film is shooting people and constantly arresting him. Everyone in the film hates him, just like everyone hates Greydon Clark. I liked Greydon's earlier "Revenge of the Angel" because it was shirne for thriteen boys. Avoid this movie at all costs !!
