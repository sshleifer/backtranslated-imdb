The reviews that claim this movie is so bad that its good goes overboard. This movie does not have the bad pleasure that Leonard Part 6, Battlefield Earth and Gigli had. These movies were fun in their horrors, but this pile of dinosaur muck is so bad it's painful. I have not felt such pain watching a bad movie since I watched Baby Geniuses and Superbabies. Before I start a review, I will tell you a story. Theodore Rex is a bust worth 35 million dollars. New Line Cinema refused to be put in cinemas. They cut losses sent directly to the video, which makes it the most expensive film for decades. Whoopi fell into this disaster after the big payday. <br /> <br /> Plot: The millionaire clones dinosaurs so that he can shoot bullets into the sun, which will kill humanity and start another ice age. A female policewoman named Katie Coltrane and an idiot dinosaur named Theodore Rex are reluctant to work together to stop him after the death of a dinosaur buddy. <br /> <br /> The plot was given to you at the beginning of the movie, which robs the film of all its secret. Then you have to deal with the fact that this movie is really awful. Whoopi looks nervous and tries to do it, but to no avail. Theodore Rex is unbearable annoying, and his ineffective behavior weakens after five minutes on the screen. Most of the jokes revolves around him, threatening to bite people and hitting people with his tail (accidentally and deliberately). I thought Burglar was bad, but the place is Theodore Rex: the worst movie about Whoopi. <br /> <br /> Let no one tell you that this monstrosity is bad enough to be pleasant. I did not see it when I watched the movie. All I saw was a train wreck written by people who had to have some delighted admiration for Howard The Duck. Humor is at this level and Theodore Rex looks like Barney's inbred cousin. Completely painful from beginning to end.
