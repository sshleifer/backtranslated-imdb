This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm not exaggerating, I told a guy at Blockbuster that they should take him off the shelves. The only interesting thing about this movie is the box. The box says "from the director of the boogeyman", so I thought ... eh whatever, if you did it recently, I'm sure that directing will not be too bad at all: - but after I saw the movie and looked at what they were saying "boogeyman ", It's some nonsense from the early 80's that he did. A great way to unaware unsuspecting viewers. <br /> <br /> NEVER, I think they liked the name "Zodiak Killer" and did not bother to study any Zodiac crimes or his MO, or even the years in which he was active. All the crimes they talk about have nothing to do with the Zodiac, and the "stories" about the original Zodiac take place a few years after the actual Zodiac crime. They also compare Zodiac to "The Vampire from Dusseldorf" by Fritz Haarman during the whole film and often talk to Fritz's "son". The Zodiac and Haarman were not similar and it makes more sense to compare it to BTK, which also shot people, not to a man who killed people by chewing their necks. None of the facts of Haarmana is correct, just a handful of mixed up nonsense. His son even says: "Do not forget, his name was Fritz Haarman with 2 tons" ... His real name is only one! I think the screenwriter / director simply typed google search engine for serial killers, and the fastest ones were Zodiac Killer and Fritz Haarman. "Oh, these sounds sound like cool names, let's make a movie about them without carrying out external research! Great idea! "<br /> <br /> Perhaps my favorite inconsistency in this film is the way in which the experts and young people Killer describes the suffering of DSM-IV and cure it. "I was also diagnosed with DSM-IV and have recovered since then", etc. For those who do not know, DSM-IV is a psychological textbook for mental disorders. If someone is suffering from the book itself, he must have SERIOUS problems! Haha. <br /> <br /> In any case, I mean, it's the lowest of my five worst films on the list of all time, and it's rare for a movie to ever reach this point. But if you are interested in watching a completely non-factual story of serial killers, which turns out to be boring, full of inexperienced actors and not entirely rational, tell me, check out this movie. <br /> <br /> ... Oh, and I liked how the killer "gassed" a few of his victims with dry ice. Nice touch ...
