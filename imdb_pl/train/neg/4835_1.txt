Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal are already preparing a sequel about a young American corporal in Afghanistan. He is also a highly qualified surgeon and freely roams around Kabul, using wounded NATO soldiers. In a particularly difficult mission he casually takes a sniper rifle and shoots Osama Bin Laden from a distance of about 3,000 yards. In the end, he is promoted to a sergeant, but is unable to make a decision between the career of a sniper and surgeon, so he completely abandons the army. A year later, frustrated by civilian life, he joins the Navy, and the last scene shows him proudly in white uniform.
