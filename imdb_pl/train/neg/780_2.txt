This performance is terrible. How does George want his mother's death to be fun? This performance is terrible. Parents are obviously horrible, and children should be taken to childcare facilities. The daughter is a witch, and the son is just a complete brat. George is not funny, especially when he speaks his loud and disgusting Spanglish brand. Ernie is a loser, but at least I chuckled at him a few times, but above all, how pathetic he is. George's mother, Benny, in a terrible, base character. Sure, her husband left her, but if somebody can laugh at how she treated George as a child, he is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Can anyone explain to me that George's head is big? It is not even that big! I went from the characters because they are too horrible, and writing would take many hours and to be honest I do not care. I take care to tell anyone who looks at it and wonders if they want to watch this show, or this show is a miserable excuse for the show and it is not worth your time. 2 starts, because the wife is extremely attractive.
