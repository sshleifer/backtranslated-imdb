The film starts with the meeting of 3 people in the bar. WELL. They talk about their imaginary life, they lie all the time, for no reason. Still OK. From time to time, they even make you laugh. Interesting. You really like the first 30 minutes! But then ... things get worse ... Nothing happens ... for a long time ... and then, when something happens, all you can see is naked, old "ladies" touching each other! Wrong. Disgusting! By the way, this part should be the pinnacle of the film, but that's all but that! The film does not make sense, it is boring and sick! <br /> <br /> The strangest thing is that here (Belgrade, Serbia) at FEST (film festival), this film was the most popular according to research, of course, before people watched it! I even thought (before watching): "Hay, it may be interesting, although it's a Russian movie"! But, God, no !!!!
