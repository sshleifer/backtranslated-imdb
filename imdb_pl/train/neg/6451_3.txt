"Steve" (Chris Hoffman) collects a group from high school to meet him at the place where his twin brother Wes was missing. When they are there, a reptile being in the shape of a man (she reminded me a lot of GILLMAN'S CREATION FROM BLACK LAGON) is waiting in the desert, choosing the right moment to separate them one by one. Motorcyclist, Ellen Ripley in the type of female ugly ass, Kat (Chase Masterson) has an underground military bunker, in which he trains experiments, and at the same time serves as a place of security before this bloody rage. Kat knows more than she says (she also suffered a loss of a child), but there is another novelty that most of the group has no idea. This creature can be simply more human than they realize ... and its former identity can shed some light on a fraud that only one person hid from the death of Wes. Kat has a key to many secrets that open when the group stays near the cabin. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, a large part of the movie remains away from the creature that jumps in the air, and we see a foggy screen when we look into his eyes. The film has Dawson's Creek melodramas that often interfere with the real tension that needs to be built in a small monstrous movie. The direction is very bland, which leads to a relatively boring experience instead of causing fear. The cast is rather lifeless and uninteresting. Pretty Maggie Grace (THE FOG remake) may be the only draw of this movie.
