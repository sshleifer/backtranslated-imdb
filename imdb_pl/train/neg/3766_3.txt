I went to watch this movie, knowing it would not be great. but what I witnessed was terrible for words. I do not want to be harsh, just the movie was horrible. generally, he was bad, I mean AMAZING special effects, the acting was not so bad, but it was not good either, and the sasquatch itself was like ... well, not sasquatch. in my opinion the best sasquatch movie is Harry and the Hendersons. it is not violent or frightening, but it has the best picture of sasquatch. at least it's a suit, not a creepy slut. see only this movie if you're desperate or you really appreciate someone in the movie. or watch the holy boondocks, it's MUCH better.
