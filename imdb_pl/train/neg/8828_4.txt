Stewart Kane (Gabriel Byrne, VANITY FAIR) goes with his local buddies from Jindabyne, Australia for a weekend of rest, recreation and relaxation. But when Stewart discovers the body of an indigenous woman, floating face down, it seems that everything has gone down the worst. The common sense of the weekend is the common sense of men. They do not leave the ravine and finish their fishing weekend with great fishing. Then they go out and report the body. <br /> <br /> The city and life of men quickly turns into a mess. Local media is infested with them, and local natives accuse them of their original prejudices. Stewart's wife, Claire (Laura Linney, EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE), senses the deeper meaning of what her husband and friends did, but she must fight her through her own mental illness. <br /> <br /> In the midst of this chaos is the life that was this young woman who is now a media spectacle, spread out on the morgue plate. Her murder and subsequent dumping into the water are a symbol of what lay beneath the city of Jindabyne: the division of men and women, black and white, social and outcasts. <br /> <br /> The only other people who seem to understand Some of them are two young children: the son of Stewart and Claire, who is led by a semi-racial Aussie whose mother was also killed a few years earlier. A young girl lives with her grandparents and tries to let her mother go in the best way possible, and the discovery of a new body seems to be? Strange enough ?? the method by which this can be achieved (it is again assumed that the current Jindabyne current). <br /> <br /> Everything and everyone in this town, Jindabyne feel what lurks below the surface, but none of them wants to immerse the dark waters and look around (the symbolism here is visible when it is said that a nearby lake used for recreation and swimming includes the old town of Jindabyne). None, I mean, until Claire makes them do it. <br /> <br /> The movie is interesting if it is a bit too complex. There are too many stories that would require exploration and simply failed; too many loose threads. Acting was fine, but filming was terrible. Shaky cameras, grainy or dark shots and only generalized sloppiness have hurt the overall production. <br /> <br /> I like symbolic films, NORTHFORK is one of my favorites in this field. But Jindabyne had to reach a peak over the murky water to see his own problems that simply did not happen.
