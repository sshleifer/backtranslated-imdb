All noise! Is there a better way to describe a movie about people who are upset because they can not publish their movie through the main distributor? As a consequence, they do it themselves. Otherwise, the noise of the movie does not justify the content of the movie. History is absent and can be short. Acting is weak, but the animation and music are quite good. Otherwise, do not waste time - do not believe in the noise! However, if you have the chance to see the movie for free, do it. Then you will not have to waste your money. Despite this, filmmakers are doing well, pressing their story and creating cliffs with self-priming mini series. Otherwise, they are one miracle that never got hit.
