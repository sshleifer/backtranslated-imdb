It seems that the brilliant band Shonda Rhimes commissioned writing this somewhere at sea, maybe to MediocreLand? "PP" reminds me of one of the many boring, promising at first glance, but predictable in one season movies by David Kelly (Picket Fences, Ally McBeal, and now Boston Legal). Crazy cases are so bizarre that they barely cause compassion or sadness. And that's what makes good medical dramas clear - dramatic situations you're afraid of, "It could be me" sentiment. They are not funny either. <br /> <br /> The actors are pretty good, but the storylines are dead and can not be brought back to life. I am a therapist and let me say - Amy Brennan plays the most incredible incompetent, unethical, untrained therapist. Whoever writes her things failed the ethics and transfer / counter-conversion courses at Stanford. Someone should give them a Code of Ethics to read (an episode with a wife bleeding from the nose and a therapist's involvement in it). No therapists are so bad. <br /> <br /> Women miss the men who moved - they were killed to death, we all finished "Sex in the City". Addison, in his youthful aggression to a man he likes - very unsuitable for age, looks so unnatural to a woman in his forties, and this otherwise talented actress does not believe it herself and does not provide it too well. The only successful / successful achievement is that Addison struggles with his decision to move to LA, and "Voodoo Dr" and his dealing with widowhood. <br /> <br /> This concept can work with the whole new writing team.
