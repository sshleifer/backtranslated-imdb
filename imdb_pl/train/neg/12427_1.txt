I hated this movie. It was absolutely horrible, poor, poor, PITIFUL acting, REAL, REAL, stupid criminals who were not even THE SMALLEST BITIES (as opposed to the first 2 very lonely home movies). all booby traps are weak, pathetic excuses for ideas badly copied from the first two, which meant that the people who wrote this movie were simply lazy, because their payout did not exceed 20 bucks a week. This movie is absolutely bad, it's not worth even renting it. In fact, do not even watch it on t.v.! Use your eyes in a more useful way, seeing the first two! I CAN NOT give this 1 star (out of 10). Just trust me when I say, if you liked the first two, and you're not a complete stupid person, you will not like this movie, do not watch this movie !!!
