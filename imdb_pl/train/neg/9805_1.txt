I have never understood the popularity of the Sabana Power Rangers series, which was just the second class of the ionized version of the Japanese ultra popular super sentai series from the last three decades! What was cool in the Japanese version was completely lost in the American version, characteristics, special effects, etc. <br /> <br /> Of course many children will say that power rangers are the best, but they would be incorrect. /> <br /> I'm sure that if they were speaking Japanese, they would know how much better the sentai is than the American version. <br /> <br /> Power Rangers is totally awful, try Super Sentai instead! Looking for a better presentation, try Voltron The Third Dimension instead!
