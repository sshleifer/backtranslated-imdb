I last saw it on the cable and liked it a bit. I have read the comments here and it seems that everyone likes the other half more than the first half. Personally, I liked the first story (it's a pity that it has not been extended). The second story, I thought, was dressed. And this "California Dreaming" if I hear it again ... Chungking Express is okay, but it's not something that the mainstream audience will see, like "Crouching Tiger."
