Shame! I was there, comfortably in an armchair with a beer and a bag of popcorn, bouyant in the hope of another great night of Muppet entertainment. What did I get? Disappointed! How can the Muppets go from the lofty Carol to this? Humor was horrible, songs were worse than Country and Western (and that says something), and the plot was as confusing and poor as Blind Pew. I think the main problem was that they bounced too hard in the Treasure Island trial. A short story, such as a Christmas carol, is perfect, because you can get tangled up with high Muppet jupiters ... here, the need to drag the plot has stopped all the fun. Where are the next Muppets? Or maybe Muppets Wizard of Oz?
