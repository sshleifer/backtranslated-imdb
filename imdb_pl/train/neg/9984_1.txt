It was a Sunday night and I waited for the advertised movie on TV. They said it was a comedy! The movie started, it was 10 minutes, after 30 minutes and I did not laugh at once. The fact is that the movie is over, and I did not even want to laugh. PLEASE, someone tickled me, I lost 90 minutes for nothing.
