When I first focused on this morning message, I thought, "wow, finally, some entertainment." It was a bit of fun for about a week ... But we have to face it, these reporters (if you can even name them that way) have WAY TOO MUCH "fun time". <br /> <br /> At first, I thought Jillian was breathing fresh air. But seriously, this woman does not have the smallest journalist in it. It is very unprofessional. He constantly interrupts Steve when he starts to inform viewers about a certain report. It really annoys to the point that I can not see it anymore. <br /> <br /> Jillian is NOT a good journalist. Hell, she's more of a celebrity who loves to be a star. From here, it immediately transforms into a celebrity around celebrities with whom it should conduct interviews. He is not very professional and probably sees his relationship with celebrities more important than being a justly insatiable journalist. necessary information about the world, government, the United States or something that will benefit and / or serve the public interest. They are too focused on the sensation that everything they say is falling out as a commercial product. On the other hand, their field reporters are interestingly loyal ... <br /> <br /> I believe that "Good Day LA" is designed for young teenagers and celebrities, and it's definitely not for people who really take care of the news . <br /> <br /> SIDE NOTE: (I would really like to watch KTLA, however, they try hard to be funny at times, but they are a bit boring, well, I will stick to NBC "Today." Good Morning America "ABC is it's fine too ... unless Diane Sawyer gets too serious.)
