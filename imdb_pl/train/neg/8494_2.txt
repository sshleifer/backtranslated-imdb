Expecting a combination of sciFi and a movie about the era of Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, computer history, etc., I was disappointed with these films with a senseless pseudoscience and a mix of true and fabulous history. It gives the impression that his writer (Lynn Hershman-Leeson) does not have a real understanding of the mathematics, technology or history of the film, but instead works on a kind of artistic impression. This is a painful place for me because I have long been nervous about the art of gloaming and overusing scientific terms and ideas to the point of confusion, for example: Emmy Coer: "information waves have a half-life", Ada: "I'm not sure that half life is better than no life at all. " <br /> <br /> This movie is worse than the lack of entertainment - it misinforms. The only salutary value I can imagine is that it can attract the viewer to distort the subject so much. I think it is more likely to promote a superstitious perception of science and technology at any stage as indistinguishable from magic.
