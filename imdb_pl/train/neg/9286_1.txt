OK, first of all, let me say that I'm still amazed at how the storyline sucks, <br /> <br /> but again it's a movie that continues Steven Segal's film only without Steven segala omg !!! <br /> <br /> just random scenes with low-budget scenes really does not make sense, I'm still amazed that I really burned 90 minutes on this shit! and he does not and does not think he has a plot and no plot !!! plz plz plz avoid this !! btw the best actor playing there is Bill Goldberg and that says a lot !! <br /> <br /> and he does not play very well, as I said plz avoid him pfff I still can not believe I wasted 90 min and spent 10 min more writing this !! :)
