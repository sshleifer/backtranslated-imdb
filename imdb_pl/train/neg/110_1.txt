I now have this movie from the library and I did not finish watching it. It's so bad that I'm in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn has completely lost her talent so far, although she ended up with "Robin and Marian". This is the worst thing in this frighteningly stupid movie. It's really just interesting, because it was her last feature film, and because of the appearance of Dorothy Stratten just before her murder. <br /> <br /> There is nothing but the idiocy between Gazza and his buddies. Small signals and small bows and nods to the real comedy of screwdrivers, which is the weakest, pale shade. <br /> <br /> Who would believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan neighborhoods that inhabit Hepburn so magically and even mythically in "Breakfast at Tiffany's" twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of Sinatra's old songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is made is too loud and obvious - you certainly do not have to wait for credits to learn that something has been subtly woven into the cine-musique of this image to know when the songs explode you. <br /> <br /> "Turning to writing" means going back up and going back down, I think. In this case, the chic European lady Audrey Hepburn is everything you see in someone who was once an actress and always a star. Here, she even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent in this period was constantly evolving, such as Ann-Margret, played this role, it would be a bit of a lifetime, even taking into account the incredibly bad materials and situations on the Mongolian level. <br /> <br /> Hepburn was of course a great person, bigger than most movie stars she had ever dreamed of, and was once one of the most charming and beautiful actresses in the film. After this terrible performance, she made a horrible TV movie with Robert Wagner, "Love Among Thieves." In "They all laughed" it was as if she were still playing ingenue in her fifties. Even many vain and, of course, less intelligent actresses who insisted on how Lana Turner was infinitely more effective than Hepburn. Turner treated acting seriously, even when she was angry. Hepburn does not take it seriously, he could not care; even her hair and clothes look sticky. Her last really good work was in "Two for the Road", perhaps her most perfect, if not the best, in many respects. <br /> <br /> And this girl who plays a country singer is simply disgusting. John Ritter is horrible, he just does not recommend this movie, except to see Dorothy Stratten, who was really pretty. Otherwise, David Thomson's often-used criticism of "losing his talent" never made much sense. <br /> <br /> Ben Gazarra lost all the sexiness then, so we have 2 films with Gazarra and Hepburn - who could ask for something less? The last, pathetic movie "Lost" Sandra Dee, two years ago, with a low budget, had more than this. At least Mrs. Dee spoke with her own voice; until 1981 Audrey Hepburn's accent sounded stupid; she continued working in PBS Garden Gardens with Audrey Hepburn, and her somewhat irritating accent works when it comes to English gardens with aristocrats or waxes that "I like it the most when the flowers come back to nature! 'like in naturalized daffodils, but in a real fictional movie it just sounds ridiculous. <br /> <br /> To think that "Tiffany's Breakfast" was such a deep light poetic thing with Audrey Hepburn, one of the most beautiful women in the world - she was certainly one of the most beautiful presence on screen in "My Fair Lady", combining Garbo in several things and Delphine Seyrig in "Last year in Marienbad". And then it! And her last short role as the angel "Hap" in Spielberg's film "Always" was just something like a woman - banal, soulless and stifling. <br /> <br /> I went to her memorial service at the fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, a beautiful service involving a boys' choir singing the Shaker's hymn "Simple Gifts." The only thing not mentioned in the program was the sudden repetition of the Hepburn song "Moon River" while escaping the fire in "Breakfast at Tiffany's", and it brought a lot of excitement and real tears in the church. <br /> <br /> A great lady who was once a great actress (as in "The Nun's Story") and one of the biggest and most beautiful movie stars in many movies of the 1950s and 1960s, which became really bad - not everything is common. Or maybe only a great human being, doing things like trivial movie performances, but he has a huge amount of mind that wants to point mercilessly at the faults - which all her late film works contained in abundance. Most of the conversations about the misbehavior of Hepburn concern "My Fair Lady". The one who should have had the original actress was the movie "Wait Until Dark," starring Lee Remick on Broadway. She was never as celebrated as Hepburn, she was a better actress in many respects (Hepburn was completely unable to play anything really disgusting), although Hepburn was at least enough in this part. Then her whole game got worse.
