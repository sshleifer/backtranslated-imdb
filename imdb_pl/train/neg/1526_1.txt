I could see worse movies than this, but if I have, I do not remember. Or maybe you blocked them. Who knows that if I were to undergo hypnotherapy, I might remember them, perhaps, kidnapped by aliens as a child or other injuries. If so, I would be happy to exchange these memories for the ones I watch in this movie. <br /> <br /> I should give the film some recognition: it triggered an emotional reaction. I began to rage at the scenes that impersonated other films and TV shows that this travesty was contaminating with their associations. I'm terrified that I may not be able to watch movies like Dr Strangelove again, without this movie passing through my mind's eye.
