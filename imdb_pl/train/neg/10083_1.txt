They changed the title of this cruelty to An Unexpected Love. Only the movie is worse. The script contains a dialogue that would be ridiculed from a third-class game recital. At some point, when the wife leaves her husband, the bad cover of All by Myself appears on the soundtrack! No jokes. The actors try, but are defeated by a clumsy, unbelievably terrible scenario. The direction is stunningly bad. No wonder Lifetime has such a bad reputation. How these things arise. Turning off the TV before it's over!
