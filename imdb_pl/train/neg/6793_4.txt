Gritty, the dusty western director Richard Brooks, who seems totally absorbed in this genre, keeping all the usual stereotypes. The beginning of the horse race in the early 1900s attracts a cowboy with a low key (Gene Hackman), a nice gambler (James Coburn), a conceited kid (Jan Michael Vincent), and even a WOMAN (surprising game Candice Bergen). When the elimination will be in the way (with predictable arguments about whether a woman should participate), it becomes quite an engaging entry, though one that does not break the new base (instead it resembles something from the Gary Cooper's era). A nice-looking, though too long, piece has a macho verve and a great cast, but the plot's mechanisms are quickly getting tired. ** with ****
