To compare this misery with an old, low-budget porn movie, it would be an insult to an old, cheap porn movie. Animal scenes do not matter or represent this man and his crimes even in the widest sense of abstraction. The summary on the reverse of the DVD case speaks in part, "a captivating account of the terrorist rule of BTK Killer". This is NOT retelling. Retelling would suggest that you were told the truth about what happened or how and why. None of these things is real. I am an enthusiast of a student serial killers and I have seen some bad movies about them and to be honest, it is NOT one of them. It's not even about the BTK killer. Save some time and a few bucks, and instead hire Dahmer. That serial serial killer is accurate and real. However, if you MUST see this video for yourself, check it out for free in your local library, and even then you will feel cheated.
