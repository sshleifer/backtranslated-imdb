This is not art, it is internal, politically correct propaganda! Jindabyne's political intolerance is unforgivable ... he does not see people as individuals, but rather as members of the category. <br /> <br /> It's the most condescendingly offensive Australian movie I can remember (and it's already quite stiff competition!). There is a movie with news, every tired about the beloved fashionable left: Aborigines are victims; white men are aggressive or alcoholic; white women are not that bad - especially if they are lesbians - but most likely have a depressive nature. <br /> <br /> Four men who leave fishing, find the body of a murdered woman (Aborigine, naturally) and leave it in the river for a few days when they catch trout. This is a strange decision made almost without discussion, as if men were animals. The only person who is offended for a short time is good ... we know that because she lives with a bisexual woman - she likes to keep her child - and eventually moves to a more fashionable seaside location (away from those bestial Bush residents). <br /> <br /> It is a movie created by these trendy urban planners who live in fear of the Australian landscape and the evil red who live in it. This ignorance of life in the countryside is almost as shocking as her contempt. The film is shot from distant views of the bush supported by ominous, mysterious music. At the end, it is clear that the Aborigines are the only ones in the house in this landscape. It ends with an incredibly unbelievable scene of black and white reconciliation. <br /> <br /> In Jindabyne, rural life is reduced to little more than the background for history, which presumably pretends the superiority of the left-wing city's enlightened inhabitants over other Australians. <br /> <br /> This movie was not created by people with real competitions, but financed by the Government Finance Corporation. It is a refined set, this heartless emptiness populated by beautiful people for whom generous government funds support these patronizing offensive projects (which are as detached from real life as possible), in contrast to the creation of popular movies that people want to see. It does not matter if the movie is smelly, it still earns. <br /> <br /> Free yourself from wasting time, avoid it like a plague. More tolerable social commentary than real entertainment, this movie deserves you!
