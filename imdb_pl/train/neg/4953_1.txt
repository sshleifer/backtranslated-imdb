I have never commented on IMDb before, but I feel that I need to watch the Batman animation. His absolute rubbish! Warner Brothers had an excellent cartoon series in Batman in the early 90s, so what the hell are they doing to try and spoil the winning formula? I feel like writing a letter with a complaint to WB. The original animation was dark and thoughtful, just as Batman intended. WB had to spoil some traps Batman of the future. Now they are producing this drivel. The Joker does not look like a Joker from DC comics remotely. DC should sue. I encourage all those who agree with me to send an e-mail or write to WB and use people's strength to regain the original formula
