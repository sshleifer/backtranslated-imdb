I thought this movie was terrible. I'm Chinese, so I thought everything was totally wrong. Many facts were wrong. The only thing right in Chinese history in the film was the situation in which Wendy's mother explained to her husband about the statues guarding ShiHuangDi. I also thought that the battle scenes were very cheesy and false. Many actors and actresses were not very big. Some jokes that were supposedly "funny" were really stupid. I think that this film should receive the worst possible rating. Disney really needs to get more information about Chinese history if he wants to create an extravagant movie. Mulan was quite accurate. Watch this video if you want to lose some time.
