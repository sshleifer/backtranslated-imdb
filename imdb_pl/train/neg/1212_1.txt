In general, this movie is horrible and should never have been realized. One of the problems with this movie is the lack of connection with the audience and characters, for example, if it is to be attacked, you want to feel "Oh my God, no!" But you do not care about this because there is no link let you know the character. In the trailer it seemed that the movie would be great, but there is no tension what really is. There could be some secret, but it is not. "It has only a set of tools." said on a DVD, one would think that this movie was carefully planned and cleverly made, but it is not so, the ending was just awful, very simple and pointless. Acting is either average or below average, maybe even lower. In my opinion, it was a waste of the hour of my life. The "special effects" and sets were also average, nothing special. There is not much blood or bloody violence, little blood is shown. This movie was advertised to sound quite amazing, but in fact, it's not worth looking for it, I do not recommend it to anyone, unless it's easy to satisfy it, through a few fights and a boring story.
