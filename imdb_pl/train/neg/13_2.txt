Poor plot, predictable violence, only half interesting characters. Just like a writer (also one of the stars?), He painted his own tricks and added unbelievable fantasies about drugs and murders to make them "hot." From the predictable soundtrack of rap and house to family conflicts, it is poorly preserved, stereotypical and ultimately terribly boring. Even the title was made earlier - IMDb lists FIVE films of the same name released in 2007-2008 !! <br /> <br /> Note: I saw it on Showtime, which lists a summary of one of the other films. He was halfway there before I realized that no one was a secret policeman. Even in a different stereotype, it would make it interesting if it did.
