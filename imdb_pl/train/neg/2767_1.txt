This movie is probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life - surpassing the most horrible "Spawn of Slithis" movie I saw when I was 10 years old. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, slim and absurd dialogue, incomprehensible plot, terrifying scenes, even the music was irritating. Did I leave something? Well, the special effects were not bad - but CGI does not make a decent movie. <br /> <br /> I can not believe I spent the money to see this movie. If someone has contact information for Hyung-rae Shim (director), please send it to my username "at gmail" and I will contact him to request a refund in person.
