I was also intrigued by the high rating (8.5) for this film and I was very disappointed. I just saw some good foreign films and I could not wait to get three in a row, but it was not. I went with a Spanish-speaking friend who felt the same way. There are few stories, if at all. I do not necessarily need it in the movie, but it must somehow entertain me or bring me. The best thing I can say is that he aspires to be a movie of the Altman genre, though with an extremely small band. Sure, there are moments, but a few moments easily sparse 97 minutes. I do not understand the high rating of this film. I give him 3. <br /> <br />
