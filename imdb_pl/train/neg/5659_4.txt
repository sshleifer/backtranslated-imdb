Disappointing end of the season, which started so well ... <br /> <br /> Part 2 Exodus and other notable episodes were among the best watched on television in each series, where it was rather bad. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm not sure if it was an episode that was a disappointment, but the tacky guitar music accompanying the closing sequence was ridiculous and would be more homely in the original series. <br /> <br /> It's almost as if corporate execs did not like the low-key notes and wanted to speed it up. They failed and rather ruined everything. <br /> <br /> Let's hope this is not a trend for the future. <br /> <br /> We still saw the return of a person, even if a bit strange and trinity done.
