Seriously, I love these old movies and their simplicity, but I just watched it for the first time last night and easily found myself in my five all-time. Was it about a love story or a zombie? This movie was so bad that after merciful ending, all I could do was laugh at how absurd it was. Fortunately, I am too analytical to turn off a movie without seeing the whole thing or I would not be able to show off that throughout the whole meeting! I like to think about something positive in my life, so according to this theory I consider the most positive asset of this film, it was very short for a full-length film.
