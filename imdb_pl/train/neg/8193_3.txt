Well, during this last break of thanksgiving, having the whole family together, everyone decided to watch the movie, and because Fred's clause was voted by a majority, that's what we went and said. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie there were so many holes in the story that it was pathetic. A simple explanation of why the event took place was invalid. example; who the hell is trying to "close" the clause of Santa Claus? Is this a corporation? A small explanation would be beautiful. <br /> <br /> Second: the movie has thrown you frail characters that have not made you feel like their feelings or actions. Example: A small elf named Willie and the only tall girl in the elf village. they see each other twice, and then they are a couple and I could care less because I did not care about this movie. <br /> <br /> Thirdly: I suppose it was supposed to be a family movie? His rating was low at only PG. There were several articles in the family film about suggestive conversation. It did not bother me, but if I was a parent, I saw a problem. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film Paul Giamatti looked extremely bored with his role, but to be honest he was the only one who is worth watching in the film. Vaughn had some fun moments, but he played the same character he had in the last two films. mouth with brother. (nothing against Vaughnow, he was good at other movies) <br /> <br /> so this movie gets 3 out of 10 stars from me, just because someone had to make an effort to produce, make and release this movie. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I will definitely pass this movie or, if you MUST see it, save it for rent on a rainy day.
