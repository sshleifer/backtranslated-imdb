Here we go with another slasher movie, Good looking people and Acting was really good from everyone! <br /> <br /> Few children play joking phones, and parents are killed by a killer before children! 20 years after they are still friends, they go to a huge house, have fun, drugs and sex (without nudity) for at least half an hour! They start talking on the phone again with pranks again! and then the killer comes back killing them one by one, and the killer is in BIG BLACK COAT with an ax, just like the Urban Legend movie, <br /> <br /> The scene of death is really strange, really strange times. <br /> <br /> Nice movie in this part would give 7/10, but the turn at the end of the movie made the whole movie pointless <br /> <br /> The twist killed a movie for me, so I'm going to give it 4 / 10
