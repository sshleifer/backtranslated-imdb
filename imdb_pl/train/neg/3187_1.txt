From the Star of "MITCHELL", from the director of "Joystick" and "Angel's Revenge" !!! These are slogans that normally prevent me from watching this movie. And the worst thing is that all of the above statements are true !!! Ugghhh ... Joe Don Baker eats every five minutes in this movie. It's like a bad remake of "Coogan's Bluff"
