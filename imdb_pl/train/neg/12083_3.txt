Yes! ... I think. Hard to say. It's hard to have emotions associated with a movie that has no emotions. This film is as sterile as a surgeon's scalpel. It has several stone pillars, several stone seats, several stone crosses and several stone actors. They have no emotions! The only thing that saves this movie is that it's Hamlet, and Hamlet is wonderfully written literature. Dubbing really was not so bad. The voices remained faithful to the boring, grim, grim, sucking-life atmosphere that the film gave. I saw this version of Hamlet on the fantastic Mystery Science Theater three times, and each of the three times I was on the brink of turning off the TV, even though it was MST 3K. uplifting production of a drama that deserves to be much better.
