If Fassbinder made a worse movie, I definitely do not want to see it! Anyone who complains that his films are too talkative and claustrophobic should be forced to look to learn to appreciate a more frugal style in which he decided to make great films, such as Petra von Kant's "Bitter Tears." This film shakes with so many artistic, quasi-symbolic images that it looks like a parody of an "artistic film". The scene in the slaughterhouse and the scene where surfing the Elvira prostitute for ten minutes are just two of the most glaring examples of what makes this movie a real test of the spectator's endurance. But what really annoys me is a few scenes where only Elvira and her ex-wife and / or her daughter appear. These are the only moments in which real human emotions appear and prove that the essence of this horrible movie was the perfect movie that he tried to free himself. What a loss.
