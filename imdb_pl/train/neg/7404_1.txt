Initially, I became interested in this film after reading the review saying that the film reminded the reviewer Silent Hill. <br /> <br /> Being a huge fan of Silent Hill and disappointed with his film debut, I thought I would give him this chance. Mind, Fearnet mentions this movie only as "Dark Floors", not his full name. So when I saw the name "Mr. Lordi "in subtitles, I immediately thought about the band (I had a few friends in college who like them), but I did not think it was important and quickly pushed this thought aside. <Br /> <br /> The movie starts strongly. Despite the fact that the "terrible little girl" was made for DEATH, good use of sound and sense of isolation really began to share this story together. The tense atmosphere grew quickly, and every indication indicated that the film was perfect. Because the monsters are real horror movies, I could not wait to see what's lurking in the hospital halls where the main characters were in a trap ... <br /> <br /> And then the first monster showed up, and I found myself very disappointed. Before the second appeared, I was stunned by the fact that it looked like it was just a Megadeth concert, and stupidity completely turned me off. <br /> <br /> During the movie, the atmosphere remained intact, and history left you with a question about what is happening, but fear almost did not exist. However, I was hoping that the end would make everything profitable. Unfortunately, it was not. Before the movie reached its climax, I was in total disbelief and I immediately recognized this great evil in his recent disclosure ... Lead vocalist Lordi? Seriously? <br /> <br /> Was this a movie? A group of poor souls chased in the hospital by members of the Lordi team? The stupid monster design suddenly made sense. If you're going to be so banal, you can also by members of Marilyn Manson and even KISS there too. Not to mention that I am sure that a few years ago I saw the ending of one of Lorda's music videos. They had to leave this whole movie? <br /> <br /> What's the worst, when I found out what was really going on, all I could do was yawn. I'm not going to "ruin" you, but I can confidently say that it's probably a storyline device that you've seen before. Most likely more than once. <br /> <br /> So if you're not a big fan of Lordi, stay away from it. It is not scary, it brings nothing new to the table (although it does a decent job from other horror films, mainly Silent Hill). And I can not stress it, LORDI is an antagonist. LORDI. Talk about buzzkill. <br /> <br /> Really, it would be better if you were scared watching Slipknot videos. In other words, it is simply impossible.
