This continuation is a complete adaptation of the first film. A totally pointless movie. He simply took every single sceanrio of the first film and transformed it into Omen IV, with the exception of the feminine antichrist this time. It ends the same as the first one! The music is too busy and intrusions, and because it is a copy of Omen I, it is extremely predictable. This is not a scary movie, it is not terribly done, there are a lot of worse films, it did not make any sense. The 2006 Omen remake is much worse, even more pointless, so I think it is. If someone pointed a gun at your head and you had to decide to watch this sequel or reamke from 2006, I think I would choose it.
