Angels who have liked each other a little, have been thrown out of the sky and now live in a British forest where they seduce and crush teenagers. Talk about a high concept. On the plus side, the little mother gives us Tom Savini, but because his range of activity is limited to two minutes on the screen, his five-minute presence seems a bit long. Angels run through the woods naked for most of the movie, but although they may have an angel body, their faces look like Joan Rivers on a bad day. Medium-acting and amateur gore effects do not help, and the night scenes are deadly reminiscent of the best-known Paris Hilton movie. It's so bad that it's REALLY wrong.
