I was very excited when this series premiered in 2005. The premise was very simple and attractive: each episode would be an hour long mini movie directed by the famous, notable director of horror films. Then when I finally saw them, it was a bit disappointed. Good episodes emerged from this first season, but in total it was a mixed bag. I attributed this to the learning curve and came to the conclusion that season 2 will be much better. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was shocked. At least one season had some good stories here and there. Season 2 (with the exception of "The Black Cat," in which excellent Jeffrey Combs starred) was a total and total loss to me. The "Sounds Like" episode may be the worst thing I've seen on TV over the last 10 years, and most of the other episodes are not much better. I really hope Season 3 will change next year, but I will not hold my breath.
