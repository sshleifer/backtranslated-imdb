How was Mike Hammer - in the penthouse with a GOLF BAG bag hidden in the corner next to a large format TV with a cathode and a fireplace? No, he threw away a bottle of rye and twenty unfiltered camels on the couch or floor of his office with flies or in the stink of a bad home in downtown Los Angeles, wiping off a dried red shell and oil smearing his face with mud, just like that. Spillane certainly wrote trash in soft covers, but how to make him worse? Give a desperate conspiracy maker a blank check because he thinks that any movie nonsense with the Noir movie will be sold at the box office, add some hot tomatoes on the hill and just turn the plot over some delayed drug writer, just like that!
