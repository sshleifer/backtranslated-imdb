Pier Paolo Pasolini, or Pee-pee-see, as I prefer to name him (because of his love for showing male genitalia), is perhaps the most overrated European Marxist director - and they are fat on the ground. How can someone see the "art" in this chaotic, cheesy mixture of sex-romp beyond me. Some of the "stories" may have come straight from a soft core porn movie, and I do not even refer to nakedness, but to simple and banal, often pointless stories. Anyone who has enjoyed this relatively observable but stupid bizarre should sink their teeth into a German series from the 1970s, Der Schulmaedchenreport, because that's what Decameron looks like to me. <br /> <br /> Besides, the movie is sloppy on almost all levels, from beginning to end: <br /> <br /> 1. Editing. Example: at 1: 15 minutes: 45 seconds is a chase scene, which is quite clearly placed in the wrong place. It was to be placed about a minute later, but I think Pasolini had to hire drunken editors who have little time for "small details" of making movies. Fans of Pee-pee-pee would probably oppose this, saying that he was deliberately placed there - which I doubt very much. Besides, even if it was true, it would be even worse, because this story does not gain anything, making it difficult to track. (This is not exactly "Eraserhead" nor one of the films in the broken Tarantino ...) <br /> <br /> 2. The acting. Vey scruffy. Triple Pee fans (all of them 8) proudly declare how 3P-O uses "real people instead of actors". (Are the actors not human? Or maybe they are Martians? Of course, many actors have a weaker IQ, but does that mean that we should treat them with contempt ...?) Other directors used amateurs and succeeded (eg Alan Parker or De Niro), why are PPP amateurs so horrible in their films? The answer is once again terrifying sloppiness. Pasolini is scruffy in everything that involves trying to get as many toothless amateurs as possible. He is a lazy director, IMperfectionist, if you like. I suppose anti-Kubrick ... The main goal of Pee-pee-pee while casting was to find the largest number of toothless old people (and young men who like him). In the Pasolini world there is a simple formula: no teeth + strange face = realism. It's good to have them toothless, but at least try to get at least some decent performances of these inexperienced neo-thespians, otherwise you are an amateur - an amateur director in the case of Pasolini. Whether 3P-0 was not able to do it, or just did not care about it, does not change anything. (Who knows ... maybe he did not even notice the horrible acting?) <br /> <br /> 3. Audio. Synchronization. If 3P-0 felt that the microphones are too embarrassing during filming, he should at least take a coordinated effort in post-production, i.e., urge all these actors to say their words in the studio so that viewers do not have to watch the lips move while the elusive dialogue floats elsewhere in the movie. <br /> <br /> 4. No concept. We have nearly a dozen stories that are not connected in any meaningful way. Some are anti-church (more on this later), while some are just sexual yarns, i.e. Cheap male fantasies (sometimes gay) designed for excitement and nothing more. Stories and characters are not fun (if any) at the intelligent level, but at the basic level. 10-year-old children can laugh here ... And there is nothing wrong with it, but then do not call it an exalted, intellectual art! <br /> <br /> 5. As a result of point 4, logic is also missing in the order of the story. That goes without saying. Pee-pee-pee could arrange the order in a different way, and we would have exactly the same movie. It also means that you can start freely from the inside, then go back to the beginning, etc. "Decameron" is a bowl of spaghetti in this way: when you start eating it, you can start with any thread you want, it makes no difference. <br /> <br /> 6. The purposelessness of the resolution of stories. Most stories end with a cheap gag / joke, ie. Some damned stupid hole straight from the porn comic, while some stories do not even have a conclusion: they just end. Finito. Stories are, at best, half-anecdotes that are almost irrelevant - unless you find "deep" meanings in "porn". Of course, there is nothing simpler than looking for and finding "meaning" where it is not. That is why even every hardcore porn movie can be philosophized / thought over without end. It's easy and pleasant. Try, oh, 8 PPP fans! <br /> <br /> When it comes to fighting the church ... Some viewers are excited about his attack on Catholicism and not. In fact, it's good and good - after all, I'm an atheist myself - but what people ignore is the simple but important fact that Pasolini was a Marxist. It's as if the pot was called black kettle. Marxist criticizing the church for hypocrisy and stupidity? Where is he nervous? Besides, Pasolini was not an atheist, therefore his high and powerful attitude is not justified. After all, Marxists are believers: they simply replaced the adopted god with the idea of ​​utopia, which is just another supernatural fantasy of wishful thinking. Therefore, I can not be excited about the anti-religious protests of PPP. <br /> <br /> This anthology humpdoramy anthology ends when Pasolini speaks rather pretentiously: "I wonder ... why create a work of art when it is nice to only dream it?" He did not refer to this stupid little film as an art, In case he was - a poor mischievous man - I have to think about why he just did not leave him in dreaming, and NOT do all these bad movies ... <br /> <br /> Want to read my edited subtitles Bergman Movies ?
