<br /> <br /> What remains of the planet Earth is inhabited by several poor and starving survivors of rag-tags. They must eat bugs and insects, or anything else, after the war, poison or something, almost destroyed all human civilization. In these dark times, one of the few people on Earth, still capable of living in comfort, we will call him the Great All-Knowing Head, he has a great task to prevent the release of some secret spores into the air. It seems that the Great Omniscient is the last person on Earth who knows that these spores exist. Spores are far away from any living soul and are highly protected by many layers of deadly defense systems. <br /> <br /> The Great Chief wants secret spores to remain in their secret protected containers. That's why he plans to send a macho team to remove spore containers from all security systems and secret places. Sending people to the place of secret spores does not make them a secret anymore. Sending people to disable all protective systems allows easy release of spores into the air. How about lying a sleeping dog? <br /> <br /> One nice feature of ENCRYPT is the bright and elegant Vivian Wu. When little-known members of the macho team dump mechanically the predictable time, engaging the charm of Vivian Wu makes an acceptable idea of ​​the plot of her former employer who wants her so much. It is the object of love, the object of desire - a very credible concept! <br /> <br /> Fans of Vivian Wu may want to check the unique B movie, in which he has been for several years, called SUPREME KINDER. RANHER DINNER is highly recommended. ENCRYPT is not.
