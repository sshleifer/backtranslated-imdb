I do not understand at all why so many fans of Godzilla think that this is perfect, one of the best Godzilla movies in reality. This movie is awful and is one of the few Gojira movies that I can not watch again (the second is G. vs. Megalon). <br /> <br /> The plot is too big to be included in the Heisei series, the series is an attempt to transform the aging Godzilla series into action movies, revolving around ideas that seemed more valid in 1974 than in 1991 It just sounded absurd, especially with some themes, for example a scene from World War II, with Japanese soldiers praising dying Godzillasaurus, a mournful and serious tone, take the exuberant former commander of the capitalist railway and his death, a serious dream in a film that fans they somehow describe themselves as playing for laughter, as being silly playing with innocent fun, if that is easily one of the most distasteful movies I've seen, but I think that the only thing that was more likely was the talent that filmmakers lacked, and it was the case where the action movie has become bad. It was even worse because the special effects are awful, incomparable, from jetpack to android, from hokey sound effects emitted from everything, you can not take anything seriously, and yet the movie expects that there is no irritation to the camera. <br /> <br /> Like almost all of Godzilla's films, there is a senseless affair, and this is no exception, although one can say something about the fact that this is particularly pointless and inexplicable. There is literally no reason for romance, it just happens, and there are 360 ​​degree commitments. Besides this other horrible aspect of the movie is dialogue, both Japanese and English are awful, clumsy and probably inspiration for Battlefield Earth. <br /> <br /> Tristar DVD combines problems, making everything look grainy blurred, dark and just ugly, the same with sound. For the first time I saw the Japanese version of Region 2, and the differences are day and night, with original vivid colors and texture, a remarkable result, especially scenes of struggle, are actually observable. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the Heisei series is a disappointment, with the exception of Godzilla 1984 (Japanese version), there is not much here, and Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah is an example of this. It does not even come close to earning the reputation and the fans it gets. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
