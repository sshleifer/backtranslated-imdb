I'm writing a comment for the first time on IMDb for the first time. but I had to write it for it. his 3 hours without torture. from the beginning you have the idea that the movie will be bad. acting is pathetic. I am a big fan of Ajay Devgan (I loved him in bhagat singh), but in this movie is the worst. It seems that amitabh worked hard on this, but somehow there is no fear. prashant paradise is not an actor. and the most annoying part of the movie is nisha kothari. I have no idea why the director took her to this film. the background result is repeatable. somehow I felt that the ramura tried to repeat the sarkar, the color theme, the background result, the camera angles, but it did not work. PLEASE DO NOT WATCH
