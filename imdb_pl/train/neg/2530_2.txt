This movie was terrible. and not as some have claimed. First of all, the main character is a very unattractive gingerman. Second - WTF happens with this van. The plot basically reads: the boy wants sex, so he buys a van (which is pretty cool in honesty). Unbelievably, because it looks like a newt, it gains a lot of chicks! And he fails. He then earns points with a really hot chick and realizes that he loves this sloppy bird who played hard. Then he runs the races with the hot boy from the chicks. And he drives his van. At this point, danny devito saves the day. Although he did not have to, because by tipping the van, the ginger kid first crossed the line. I gave it to 2 * because I'm inclined to assume that there is a subculture from the 70's that I do not get, and also because there's a boobage from the '70s.
