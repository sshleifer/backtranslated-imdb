What an absolute pile of pants. After reading Chris Brookmyre's books religiously, since I came across "Quite Ugly ...", I was delighted to find out that this drama had been ordered. <br /> <br /> Of course I had too much faith. <br /> <br /> Nesbitt is probably the best thing in this series - and even it does not really fit. If anyone can read a book and then adapt it to this piece of slag, it's beyond me. <br /> <br /> All the characters are changing, situations are skipped and to see Parlablane's dramatic burglary reduced to a quick chin and the opening of the bay window ... it brought tears to your eyes. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid to think what will happen to the "Country in the dark" if it's a reference point ... <br /> <br /> Please, just avoid ...
