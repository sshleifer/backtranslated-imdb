I do not know what's going on in this movie, which made me react so much against him. Perhaps they were characters that were so unbelievable and were not convincing enough to care. Perhaps it was a disorganized plot. Perhaps the fact that Rob Lowe was wearing a long earring and eyeliner. Perhaps because at some point in the movie, everyone explodes in a song. Perhaps because the '80s were never eighties. Maybe because everything was a bright hyperbole. Perhaps because the character pumps a fist while moving away from the camera during fading. I do not know what hated me so much, but if it means I'll try to see it again, I do not want to find out.
