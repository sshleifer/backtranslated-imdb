I think the majority want to believe that there are extraordinary things, and this movie does not show any limitations, trying to use it fully. The presentation is very interesting, well presented, and the graphics are the most modern, but from a scientific point of view it simply does not work. Hydrogen-filled flying bladders? To be useful, they would have to have the size of a Mack truck. And then there is always the possibility of a catastrophic explosion. I do not have a problem with fantasy, just do not try to pass it on as a fact. Some people will always misunderstand. All in all, the movie is funny, but I still hear that I say "about brother, what a load ...". If you want a FAKE documentary, watch This Is Spinal Tap instead. Or at least turn off the sound.
