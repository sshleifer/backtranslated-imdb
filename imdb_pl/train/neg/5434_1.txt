Wow. What a horrible adaptation of a beautiful novel. Here are some notes. - The screenwriter has eliminated two main characters from the book. - The story has been changed grotesquely. - The voices sound as if they were directly removed from the fragments (which can be read well, but are not the same when they are spoken, especially in the style of Chabon writing). - Acting is more wooden than a log cabin. (Esp. Bechstein) - This is to be set in 1983 ??? I feel more like 2003 ... <br /> <br /> To be honest, I could not bring myself to finish watching this movie, so it's possible that he would compensate ... (sarcasm). I sincerely hope that no one will pay, or at least someone who reads the book with hope for something decent (a la Wonder Boys). I like Chabona as a writer, but he should be ASHAMED of this adaptation. <br /> <br /> No stars.
