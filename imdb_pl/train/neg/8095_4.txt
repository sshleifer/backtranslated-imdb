The essence of Wolfe's original novel - actually the whole story - is that things happen because of a carefully calculated sense of purpose. The goal is to survive in a specific lifestyle. The novel is full of malice. The only relationship that amazes emotionally is the relationship between Sherman and his daughter, Campbell, and it only moved. In addition, everyone is looking for what they can gain on the road to publicity, power, money or gain their own recognition. <br /> <br /> Wolfe was criticized for hitting every character and every social segment in New York over his head. His answer was a denial. In the end, he lived in New York himself and was part of the neighborhood improvement committee and other admirable organizations, exactly what he would like to have in his life story, to deny that he did not like New Yorkers. (Wolfe has an American PhD in Yale and is not a mannequin.) These alleged weaknesses made the novel memorable. Nobody was good. And Sherman McCoy was ruined, professional protesters for social justice. The film rejects everything and imposes a moral framework on a story that simply does not fit. Wolfe did his homework. The novel was rooted in reality. Each event was not only possible, but also completely reliable. Wolfe could be a great anthropologist of culture - he knows how to get into the system and save its details. <br /> <br /> Yes, we could find each other, like Sherman and his lover, stuck in South Bronx, threatened by a pair of black children and fleeing after falling into one of them. This scene is nicely transferred from celluloid printing. <br /> <br /> But after this scene, the movie does not seem to trust its audience and sometimes it becomes crazy in an attempt to spell its message, however vague the message is. <br /> <br /> Sherman may accidentally hit a kid and be arrested for it as he is in the novel, but he will not return to his phenomenally expensive apartment immediately after he is released from prison, start shooting at the ceiling, just like in motion. In what should be a funny scene, the ceiling plaster falls on all the guests and they run away screaming. It just would not happen. The film left inexpressibly detailed reality into dust. Wolfe's sensitivity, the work put into grasping the real, has been lost. Instead, we get a noisy, fantastic and stupid scene that does nothing but raise the audience. There are similar empty scenes that shout for fidelity to Wolfe. <br /> <br /> The movie also fails because it puts a lot of sin and redemption into a funny story about moral nihilism. Here we see "Don Juan in Hell" in the opera. We get lectures on redemption from the poet with AID. We see a lot of guilt in Sherman. A black judge who preaches from the bench and gives one of these last speeches about how we all have to start behaving nicely again. A reporter who regrets Sherman after transforming him into a sacrificial lamb. And a happy ending in which Sherman breaks the law with an idiotic smile. The scene sits in the movie like a jester's hat on the head of a circus elephant. <br /> <br /> The film not only makes points that are trivial and unoriginal, overestimate them, as if the audience was not able to absorb any subtleties. <br /> <br /> This is not acting or a bad direction. The film is not bad in this respect. Photography is also quite good, including two rather spectacular shots - gargoyles in the Chrysler building and the Concorde landing. This is a script that is completely unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie, approximately, is fine in terms of concept and performance. It retains some small details from the novel. Sherman and Judy's dog is Marshall. Who the hell would call a dog Marshall? In the second half, it loses focus almost completely and is barely worth watching. <br /> <br /> Wolfe's cynical right-wing wolf can be offensive to many people, but he has cojones to put his perception. Unfortunately, writers and producers did not have the courage to take them away, and thus they had a chance for a fascinating study of New Yorkers.
