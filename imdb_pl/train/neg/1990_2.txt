This can be a strong candidate for the "Worst Flick Ever". Perhaps without the presence of John Hurt it would be tolerated as a movie for children. However, TRAGEDY of this whole undertaking is that John Hurt, one of the greatest actors on the screen, diminishes in this ... I gave him two points just because Mr. Hurt showed up ... I'm missing 8 points because I have not escaped from him fast enough. As for the rest of the cast, they're just terrible. Janine Turner, as beautiful as she can be, can not act to save her soul. And the main actor is unintentional to everyone. If you can spare yourself this embarrassment, do it. It's so bad that it's almost CURRENT.
