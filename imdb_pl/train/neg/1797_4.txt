This film has a very difficult to digest premise, even according to the standards of this genre. We are asked to accept not only that a backward recording can bring a dead person back to life, but that the record also contains hidden messages directed specifically to one child when the singer had no relationship with the boy while he was alive, and of course no way does not know who will hit the record. Anyway, the movie is funny for a moment, but ultimately stupidity and meaninglessness reign supreme. If they really tried to create a new horror icon similar to Freddy, they were far away: the villain has no personality, no motivation and diversity. (* 1/2)
