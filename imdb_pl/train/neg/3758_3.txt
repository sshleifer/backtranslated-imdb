When I saw this movie for the first time, I thought it would be a good sasquatch movie. Usually, when you have these types of movies, there is generally ONE sasquatch, but is there something like that? 7 or 10? Acting was good, the plot was OK, I liked the scenes in which sasquatch kills the first few victims, very good camera work. I expected it to be a bloody movie, but there were very few. This movie was much better than Sasquatch. The SCI-FI channel really has to create more sasquatch movies, I mean I really liked Sasquatch Mountain, Abominibal was not good, the one I'm reviewing is okay, but the Sasquatch movie was not, but I'm not reviewing it, let me get back on track. This movie is good for a rainy afternoon in Saterday, but for other occasions, no.
