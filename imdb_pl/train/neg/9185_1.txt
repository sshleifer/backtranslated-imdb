WOW! I did not know anyone would make this movie! it's terrible! I wrote 5 things that can tell you why you do not want to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> number 1: "This is the biggest rave party" where is this rave? I only saw a few people dancing around ... <br /> <br /> 2. When they are on the rave, they can only see blood everywhere, no people, two ruined tents and one stage .. and what are they doing !? drink! <br /> <br /> 3. The worst actors I've ever seen! Captain and his crew ... horrible! <br /> <br /> 4. when one of the people shoots an ordinary pistol, shoots almost 30 times without reloading! <br /> <br /> 5. I did not know that every person in the world can fight as a professional! there must be a new thing ... <br /> <br /> I wonder what the producer thought! "It will be a big hit, it will be classic." Certainly not stupid, you do not see this movie any more, it's a belt of time. MY EYES ARE WANDERS!
