This is definitely one of the most boring and terribly descriptions of the early days of Adolf Hitler I have ever seen. Robert Carlyle is a great actor, but casting him as Hitler is just bad. In order to give Liev Schrieber a long-time friend and help from Hitler, Haefengstal had to deliver shouts of despair and anguish from the Center of Simon Wiesenthal. J-W playing Nazi supporter, bad bad bad casting. It was not a nice family movie with a good historical background. It was the best Hollywood trash that gained the strength of a strong (but very poorly used) cast of actors who seemed to have disappeared from operating radar in the last 5 years. <br /> <br /> False German accents (vee vill vin zis var) offend the Germans everywhere. My mother is German and sat mad at the sound of voices that changed from American / English / German to the same sentence. The supporting support creates better cardboard cutouts in the local video store than on the screen. Jenna Malone as a condemned Gela Raubal, however, was wonderful, she captured the innocence and confusion of this tragic young woman who eventually ended her own life to escape what her future would be in the shadow of Hitler. <br /> <br /> If you would like an extremely fantastic and historically accurate description of Hitler's early years leading to the war / holocaust, the act "Inside the Third Reich" 1983 involving Rutger Hauer as Albert Speer and Derek Jacobi as Hitler. It was good and more sensible than this baloney. <br /> <br /> As a historical researcher of the Third Reich, I can honestly say that I reached for books to confirm countless inaccuracies.
