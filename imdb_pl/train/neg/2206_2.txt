The scientist on the island is deeply upset by the loss of a son who died of kidney cancer. So he thinks: why not turn my dead son into a hammer shark. Who would not want to? It is a little difficult to deal with the fact that the hammer shark that kills everyone is constantly called "Paul". Also, William Forsythe's cast as a MacGyver-kick-ass-save-hea-kind hero is unreliable. On the other hand, there are a few hot chicks that really make you look at the screen while the shark Paul bites the other to death. In fact, I think that bad b-movies are quite funny. But for my taste it would be a much better movie if it was produced for less than $ 1,000,000. Then it could be fun.
