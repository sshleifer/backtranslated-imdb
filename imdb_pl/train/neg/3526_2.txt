(Spoiler included, some would say) <br /> <br /> This movie can not be taken seriously. In some parts it's so stupid that I just can not help laughing. Try me in a sequence where Stallone jumps about 20 meters with full climbing equipment or (and this is really my favorite) drags a bad guy into the stalactite. Yes, what unholy strength did he gather to do such feats? I do not know, but he definitely gives a run for money.
