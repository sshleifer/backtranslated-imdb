Good movies are original, some leave a message or touch you in a certain way, but sometimes you do not feel like it. <br /> <br /> I wanted something simple, not just thinking about the usual action, when I watched this one. It started with a good one and it was quite fun, so why a bad review. In the end, the film lost its credibility. The story was not so trashy, the action was not very special, but overall, the action was OK, so more than enough to satisfy my needs. But everything broke down because everything happened and I had a bad feeling. They should put a little more effort into making everything credible and would receive 7 in the "no thinking just plain action" category. In summary, if you know that you will be annoyed because something happens that seems completely illogical: do not look! otherwise I would say that go further ...
