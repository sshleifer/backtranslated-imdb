I never liked Myra's movie, although I appreciate how he pushed the Hollywood envelope. Certainly Miss Welch's costume has become an iconic picture, although I have to wonder if many people who recognize this picture really saw the movie and knew what it was all about - <br /> <br /> For several years I was browsing Myra on FMC this time and I did not think that it is getting older better for years. The comic book about the history of cartoons from Sexploitation Cinema has a passage about the fact that he has the appropriate recognition for placing such big stars in what was then scandalous production. However, IMHO, the movie is too bitter to be charming, too stupid to be excited, and so busy trying to shock that it does not inform, does not engage, OR does not entertain ---
