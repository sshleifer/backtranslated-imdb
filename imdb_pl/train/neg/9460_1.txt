This movie has worried me! When I think about Cat in a hat. I mean cat in books about hats. You know, this one for several years, which parents read to their children. Well, I thought this movie would be very similar! But to my surprise there was nothing like books! It is rather a movie about a young adult humor. In one part the cat talks with a garden tool (hoe). The cat talks to him like a hoe (in an adult's mood). although the name of his car was a bit unpleasant to me for a movie for children. under the assessment you will find: mild humor and a few double whims. I think that in short it means humor for adults. I would like to be able to return this movie! Wal-Mart said no, because the film was opened. If you think about buying, I suggest you rent before buying.
