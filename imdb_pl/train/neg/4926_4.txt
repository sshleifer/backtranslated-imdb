I've seen this movie for two reasons - I like Gerard Butler and Christopher Plummer. Unfortunately, these poor men were forced to wear quite a stupid movie. I liked the idea that Dracula is actually the reincarnation of Judas Iscariot because he explains his contempt for all Christian things, but there was so much of the camp that this idea was not realized as much as it could be. I see this film more as a way for gifted Gerard Butler to pay his contributions before he is really recognized and a way for the legendary Christopher Plummer to remind the audience (myself and the five other people who saw the movie) that he still exists. Indeed, I liked the special features on DVD more than the movie itself.
