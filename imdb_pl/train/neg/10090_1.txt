This movie is a joke. I mean a funny joke "ha ha". Why? Because the only thing that brought tangible benefits was a good laugh that overwhelmed me from the absurdity of a meaningless, senseless plot and terrible acting. Wow! <br /> <br /> There are so many unanswered questions in this video ... for example; why these women become zombies and how? Why are four black women who are zombie "guardians" and what is their purpose? Since when did 6 people form the "nation" of Zombie? And is the smudged mascara under the eyes "frightening" for anyone, anywhere? Even two years old? <br /> <br /> And finally; Why was this movie made at all? Why? why? why? No answer? As I thought. <br /> <br /> On the demand channel they released this comment after the summary of the movie: we apologize for this film in advance "LOL. At least they had the decency to do a lot of it!
