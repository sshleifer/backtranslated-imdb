She was at 21:30 yesterday at my friend's caravan and we were so excited about watching South Park (new episode). The thing is that in my country South Park drives at 22:30 and we decided to kill time watching the screening of the currently broadcast movie "Father of pride." Let me start with the fact that I only watched episodes. The first time I watched him, I thought it was not pleasant and primitive, so I thought, "Holy sh * t, I have a football match tomorrow, so I have to stop watching stupid cartoons". But yesterday I tried to give the Pride Father a second chance. I believe that this is a complete stripping of The Simpsons, instead it replaces yellow human figures with lions. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I wonder why she received the TV-14 rating. I think The Simpsons are much more vulgar, and the only real vulgarity of this series is a few homosexual (unhappy) jokes. The Simpsons is also more brutal (special Halloween) and primitive. I also heard that the creator of the series also directed Shrek 2, well, I have news for him: Shrek 2 was much better and I think he remained too much on the family topic. I must admit, however, that the father of pride made me smile (I even burst out laughing once) three or four times. <br /> <br /> In total, I do not mind my father's pride. I do not hate it, but I do not like it either. I've seen better than 'The Simpsons'. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10
