Wow. This was probably the worst DCOM ever. I watched the first half hour and I laughed. Brenda Song plays Wendy, a popular girl with hot jockey boyfriend, and stuck in her friends who are determined to become Homecoming Queen. She is to save the world as a warrior, and Shin comes to her aid to help her in martial arts. Shin teaches her the skills of a snake, a tiger, etc. And she must learn some techniques to save the world. <br /> <br /> This movie is great for kids who want to learn about martial arts and Chinese culture but acting and casting were awful. <br /> <br /> Brenda Song is a comedian and I do not see her playing a serious role. It was a loud laugh funny watching her cry over Shin. Shin could not act at all, and everything was totally unbelievable. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie and tried to come up with something similar, and what I came up with is Power Rangers. This movie is so fake that the stunts were so powerful that it was just trivial and stupid. The characters were not sympathetic and I just could not stand to watch. Disney really has to take some time to make decent movies. High School Musical is the only movie that deserves to participate in the Disney Channel, along with other films such as Jumping Ship, Color Friendship, Go Figure, Read It and Weep, and Stuck in the Suburbs. you like action adventures and jokes, you'll love this movie.
