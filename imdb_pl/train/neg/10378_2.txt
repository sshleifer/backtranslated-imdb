Although the premise of The House Where Evil Dwells may be intriguing, the execution is downright pathetic. I'm not even sure where to start, because I have a lot of problems with this movie. I suppose that only a few of them: <br /> <br /> 1. The acting game ?? When you see that Edward Albert, Doug McClure and Susan George (and her teeth) are the stars of your movie, do you know you're in trouble? It does not mean that it is very important to me, but they are not names from the list. Susan George may have been in several movies that I like, but I never considered her the best actress I've ever seen. In this film her acting is embarrassing. As for the other two, the less they said, the better. <br /> <br /> 2. Spirits ?? Ghosts or ghosts, or whatever you want to call them, reminded me of ghosts in the haunted house at Disney World. And they are so frightening. And why should they be so obvious? Subtlety is not a characteristic of The House Where Evil Dwells. <br /> <br /> 3. The plot ?? How predictable can one movie be? The result of this movie is painfully obvious when you meet the three main characters. If after about 15 minutes you have not seen where this movie is going, you need to see more movies. <br /> <br /> 4. The Convenient Priest ?? What are the chances that the haunted house you buy is on the other side of the street from a group of Japanese monks? Not to mention that one of them knows the history of your home and comes up, knocks on the door and asks if you need help removing bad spirits. Absurd is a word that comes to mind. <br /> <br /> 5. Everything else ?? It is very difficult for me to think about positive things to write about. I suppose I give him the starting point and the architecture point of the house. Is this a sure sign of the winner? noticing architecture as the main attraction of every movie does not say much about the real movie. <br /> <br /> I will stop. You should be able to get an idea from what I have already mentioned. And I did not even mention the annoying little girl, the Crab Invasion or many other problems. I warn you, this thing is terrible.
