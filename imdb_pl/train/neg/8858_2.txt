Ben is a non-city policeman and is convinced that his sister has been brutally killed and wants to bring the murderer to justice, but Stefan, who believes his sister was a victim of werewolf worship, approaches him. So Ben, his sister's best friend and Stefan, go to Transylvania to put an end to this evil. <br /> <br /> This is an awfully terrible thing of class B and I was wondering how it happened. This makes the original "Howling" look like a masterpiece. What Christopher Lee thought, because it must be his worst performance I've seen. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of wrong with this cheap movie, from really hammy and wooden performances by Annie McEnroe, Reb Brown, Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning (they have not forgotten about Lee), poor fashion (these sunnies), cheap and bad special effects, bad use of lighting, humor ... if there was some kitschy music from the 80's (part of the film focuses on playing an unknown band), werewolf has orgies that you can see and tiring story with a flat and annoying dialogue . I thought if it was so bad, it would be terribly funny, but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Positives is the location and settings of the film looked great, but that's it ... I will actually add Sybil Danning a short demolition scene. <br /> <br /> During the final subtitles the band plays their damn song during a strange editing of scenes from the movie, which evokes the question why? <br /> <br /> A terrible piece of clutter, but at least it is not boring. <br /> <br /> 1/5
