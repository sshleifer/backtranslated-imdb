The only nice thing about this highly mocking movie is the "guess" game in this location. What landmark in Toronto will represent the US / international location. <br /> <br /> who knew that the antichrist would be Russian? of course he can not be an American, because we need jerks to save this day - oh Buck ... tell us the whole truth ... you show us the light ... and the way from the building should have the nasty anti-baptisms have their way. <br /> <br /> Five golden raspberries. Faith is not enough to hope that they will not do it! We do not have to pray.
