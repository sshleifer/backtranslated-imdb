I should never watch this movie. The style of filming may be considered a piece of art for some, but I think it makes me migraine. I think it could have an interesting plot, but because I could not watch it for long episodes, I was missing. Shimmering photos and filming in the movement of the stop marked my brain. I stopped watching in the middle and I will not be back for the second attempt. I suppose if I was alone at home in my own lantern in some dark and stormy evening, it could only be a ticket ... PS I'm not sure if the lantern / movie style can be considered a spoiler, but I do not want to be blacklisted after my first review;)
