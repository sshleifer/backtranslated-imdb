The full title of this movie is "Waqt: Race Against Time". This is a race that no one can win, but you can certainly reduce your lost margin without wasting a valuable "waqt" on this bakvaas. This movie was clumsy and manipulative in a way that made K3G look honest. My credulity has become too tense. It was absurdly stupid in his story and deserves a mockery about it. <br /> <br /> It's not as horrible as Baghban or Black, but this movie has nothing to recommend. Stupid, aimless, with the absurd performance of OTT Amitji. The central "conspiracy" is another nasty example of primitive manipulative propaganda that attacks so many "family" films of BW. If my father, who raised me, and whom I love sincerely, treated me like Big B, then Akshay shot him myself. Not to mention trivializing the deadly disease.
