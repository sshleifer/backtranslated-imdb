***** Warning: May contain SPOILERS ********* My huge problem with this movie is how completely self-centered and self-absorbed is the adulterer's wife !! After one night of playing with a slimy psycho, he is persecuted by him. He constantly calls her and threatens, and even sends video from their nights. It's COURSE crazy and very dangerous. The problem is that she thinks he is dangerous to HIS (and reveals her secret). She did not think for a second about caring for her husband! Did she even think for a moment that she might be in danger because of this psychotic ?? As soon as she realized how much psychic she was, she should have warned her husband, regardless of the consequences. Maybe then there would not be a movie, but there really was not a movie, so what's the difference?
