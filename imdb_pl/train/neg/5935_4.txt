The saddest thing about this "tribute" is that almost all singers (including the incredibly talented Nick Cave) seem to miss the whole point where Cohen's intensity lies: passing his lines in almost no tuning, Cohen transmits to the full extent of his poetry, his irony, versatile humanity, laughter and tears in one. <br /> <br /> To see how some of these beginner singers make intricate faces of suffering, start their pathetic squeaks in the patent effort to shout I'm a singer! "It's a real pain. The same feeling with which many of you probably listened to the terrifying operatic versions of simple songs, such as Lennon's "Imagine". Nothing, nothing comes close to the simplicity and immediacy of the original. If there is a form of art that does not need decorations, it is Cohen's art. Embellishments threw him on the street, looking like a tasteless sex makeup for sale. <br /> <br /> In this tribute to Cohen I suffered and suffered from pathetic tributes and horrible reinterpretations, all of which did not have the original irony of the master and, if truth was said, some of these singers sounded like they were recruited on some talent show. Cohen pays tribute to them, allowing them to sing his material, really, not vice versa: they could be friends or daughters, he could become very sensitive and feel like a gift. It is a pity that he did not stay in the family. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, but only at the end, Cohen made his own majestic "Tower of Song", but even this flower was spoiled by the completely inappropriate background of U2, all bearing the expression of bored children when they visit their poor grandfather in nursing home. <br /> <br /> A sad show, really and sadder, if you really love Cohen like me.
