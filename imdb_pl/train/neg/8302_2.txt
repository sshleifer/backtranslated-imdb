It's funny how the studio thinks it can be a continuation of the classic Christmas story with a completely new cast and expect it to rise. Probably they used different BatmanÃ³w for actors, but in this case Batman was a classic figure before one of the actors founded his cloak. In this case you had a classic figure wearing glasses with horns in blond hair, wearing Ralphy, who wanted a red gun for Christmas ... Somehow we should forget about him and accept another little boy who is not like him If I did not know it was a sequel, I would not have guessed it from the cast ... except that Charles Grodin is trying so hard to imitate Darrin McGavin that they still remind you that the original was much better ... br /> <br /> In the end, it can work if they give the film better. They should look for the appearance or simply ignore the original and do not try to copy its appearance. This one is just a cheap imitation. Ralphy does not evoke compassion, just a desire to let his character flare up or die.
