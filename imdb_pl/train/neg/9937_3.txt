First of all, it is a very outdated film, not focusing on the exposure of the leftist political revolution. Honestly, when someone says that the only way to a real revolution is to stop being an intellectual (which is quite nonsense in itself, because the answer has been obtained by precise being an intellectual), it reduces me to despair; if we all came back to being monkeys in the name of equality - it's just ridiculous. Our intellectuals are just one of many human qualities, but this does not mean that we should not educate ourselves as much as we can. But no doubt this non-educational message is associated with Godard's use of rock music; hence The Rolling Stones. <br /> <br /> The song "Sympathy for the Devil", whose uprising we are witnessing and from which its name originates, is in fact nothing special. The sequence of chords, which is not especially original, was used to a much better effect in "Thankyou" Led Zeppelin (Led Zeppelin II). In addition, "Sir" Mick Jagger declares in his usually foggy way (rather like Bob Dylan) - note how the first melodious phrase repeats unimaginably to create a poem. The Black Panthers depicted in this film do not seem to know what they are fighting for, the most interesting scenes include the equation of fascism with pornography; a message that actually undermines the sexual "liberation" of the 1960s and today (indeed, a message that would have believed the behavior of The Rolling Stones during the making of the film). <br /> <br /> No wonder the DVD was released for free from The Sunday Times! To get to know the truly deep historical sympathy of the left, listen to Luigi Nono's masterpiece "Al Gran Sole carico'd'amore".
