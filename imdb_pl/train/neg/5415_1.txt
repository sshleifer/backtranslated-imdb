Dil was a memorable movie that brings celluloid to a great director like Indra Kumar. The film was accompanied by Beta, Ishq, Raja and Masti, all of whom were wonderful. <br /> <br /> But then every successful director gives you some awful movies along with a few hits. Pyare Mohan is one of those movies. <br /> <br /> Although the comedies are nicely told, the viewer can not laugh. Compared with the type of comedy movies created today, it's stupid. <br /> <br /> If you really want to watch a movie and laugh, do not watch it. Because a pathetic comedy will make you cry. <br /> <br /> In short, the movie is worth the miss.
