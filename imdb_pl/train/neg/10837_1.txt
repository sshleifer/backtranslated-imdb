I can not tell you how angry I was after this movie. Characters are not at all interesting, and the plot does not exist. So after waiting, to see how the life of these characters affects each other, hoping that the last 2 and a half hours have led to some significant ending, what will we get? Storm of frogs. Now, yes, I understand the references to the Bible (Exodus) and the theme, but most of all it was presented without any resolution, and secondly, anyone who did not read the Bible (a significant part of the population) or Charles Fort (even more) would lose it. As a well-read person, I thought this movie was a bad imitation of the Seinfeld episode. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. It would be better to read ... <br /> <br /> ... well, to be honest
