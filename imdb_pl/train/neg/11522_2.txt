First of all, the title character is not even the main character of the movie. He is the helper of the cult leader. The actor who plays the character of Igor, he believed he was screaming loudly, laughing hysterically and a grim smile, while eavesdropping on the eyes would be a great way to scare people. Igor also had an annoying habit of screaming (because he never really spoke) with a high voice. He would also say that it is idiocy. For example, when a cult leader kills one of his followers with a buzzing ball, Igor, after seeing this, screams: "Paul! No, Paul! Why did you do that? In another scene, Igor tells the victim that she will have to "get her own tools for surgery, because now was his time for surgery." Apart from the bad action, the ending did not make sense, because while the story builds some pair, which it has towards the climax, igor gets a shot from the crossbow to the head, and the rest of his lunatic cronies is killed, appears twice more to kill the others " good. " The film does not explain this, only telling the viewer that Igor escaped from the psychiatric hospital. What??? The bottom line is not wasting time watching this movie. I would like to regain the moments I lost by watching this.
