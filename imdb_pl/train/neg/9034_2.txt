The story is a bit slow and a bit stupid. Greta Garbo does not look very good and I could not understand half of the things she said because of her accent, which was exaggerated for this role. Meanwhile, Melvyn Douglas plays his normal, dissimilar role, and Constance Bennett is so, except for a few screams that were funny. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Roland Young had the best part in the movie. I would like him to have more lines because he disappeared in the second half of the story. It was also interesting that Ruth Gordon looked so young. I only saw her in those crazy roles that she played from the late 1960s to the 1980s and the discarded old lady. Storytelling, the best part may be the last few minutes when we see a stuntman doing amazing skiing, pretending to be Douglas falling off the slopes. It was an amazing and humorous material. <br /> <br /> Generally, I see where this movie - the last Garbo - was not a box office success. It just drags too much and takes a scam. It's an annoying story. Garbo knew it too and called him to resign.
