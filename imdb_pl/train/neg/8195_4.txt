Every Christmas Eve, I make my children stand next show It's A Wonderful Life. I also liked Bad Santa very much. So sue me. I admit. I like cheesy films. I also like perfect, intelligent, but as with many other things, diversity is a good thing. What would the holiday season be like without the yearly movie killing of Santa Claus in his disguise, from Edmund Gwenn to Billy Bob Thornton? Fred Claus will make sure that no one will forget Bedford Falls, but I do not believe that the Christmas movie should reach a cult position to succeed. "Fred" is a perfect holiday film, with adult humor and sufficient charm for children. My wife and I laughed a lot, even if most of the humor was obvious and Vince was just Vince. Paul Giamatti was a top-class Santa Claus who helped a lot. This is not a great movie, but rather does not have to be necessary to watch the annual Christmas traditions. But my wife and daughter and I liked what it was, a festive schmaltz with a touch of spice. There's nothing wrong with it.
