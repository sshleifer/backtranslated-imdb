Let me start with how much HILARIOUS is this movie, I just could not refrain from laughter from the sheer stupidity of the movie. Do not get me wrong, it is well preserved especially by Bassinger, but the scenario is simply, well, the mind really is stunned. <br /> <br /> The premise is good until Della is a witness to a murder, which is engaging but it just goes from the hill. In the middle of the movie, the hero pulls out his toolbox and, instead of waving it on the guy's head, he decides to take out a screwdriver, a car jack and finally a flare (like a sinking ship) to kill her victims. <br /> <br /> Then there is the last line I promise, if you are not seated, I will eat my own left foot. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie for those who just want to laugh at some good old scary movie. I can also suggest that you watch out for the scene at the junkyard with a guy falling off a high wooden plank, each time me.
