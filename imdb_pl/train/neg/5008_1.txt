There is no reason to watch this movie. A good idea for the story is treated very badly. In the middle of the movie everything changes, and from there nothing makes much sense. The reason for the killings is not explained. Acting is terrible. Of course, Nick Stahl needs a better director. He was great at In the Bedroom, but here he is terrible. Amber Benson from Buffy, one day he must change his character. Even those of you who like free sex and violence will be disappointed. Although the movie had 80 minutes, which is too short a period for a good movie (but too long for this), there are no deleted scenes on the DVD, which means that they never bothered to fill in the missing parts of the characters. /> <br /> Do not spend time on this.
