Recently, they tried to make this film late in the night in cable television commercials. Do not believe in noise. I was one of the unlucky people who saw this stinking in theaters. This is, in my opinion, the third worst movie of all time, just behind Mac & Me (No. 1 the worst) and Jack Frost (No. 2 the worst), but I must admit that they are all near and terrible! Really, nothing in this movie is funny or disturbing, or anything else that claims to be so, so do not waste your money. All that's good is to give your worst enemy. I'm not lying about it. Someone you would like to kill or torture would be the main candidate for this film. It's so terrible. If you do not believe me, you deserve to suffer through misery watching what I doubt that you can end. Two thumbs enthusiastically down.
