I'd rather have 20 root canals than go through this movie again. The Prince of Annoying, Myles Berkowitz, has wasted almost two hours of my life with this piece of cynical pseudo-cool. The only funny thing about this mess is the unpleasant image of Panama Samaha's panic about tits and butt. Berkowitz takes a great idea and grinds it. He is restless and badly made, in an apparent effort to seem strange or funny. It is not also. I rarely feel that the movie was a waste of film (or tape), but this film qualifies for this distinction. If the date suggests watching this video, run.
