Down to Earth concerns Lance Barton, a black comedian who is hit by a truck. He goes to heaven and gets another body. Lance gets the body of Charles Wellington, a white guy. So Lance does some things in Charles' body. The movie has some laughter, but it's nothing special. It's a good movie if you're a fan of Chris Rock. Madagascar, the animated comedy from 2005, is better. It's a good movie, but Chris Rock did a lot better. It will make you laugh only 4 times more than the entire movie. And it is not really fun. You will laugh at yourself, or maybe you will giggle, but you will certainly not be laughing on the floor.
