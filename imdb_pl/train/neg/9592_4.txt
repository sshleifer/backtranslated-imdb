I saw this film only recently, although it appeared in 2001. I was hoping to see a funny movie, but let me tell you, Princess Blade is nothing compared to Azumi. "Princess" is not very talkative, as you probably noticed ... I was reminded of Jean Claude Van Damme, who was just staring to get attention and then defeated the shit of his opponents. During the whole movie, I waited until I heard a confession about what she liked, why she fought, whom she loved and whom she trusted. I waited in vain. Damn movie. A dirty dialog box. Do not watch it unless you want to be bored! It's so bad that in the end I was wondering how I managed to not scream in frustration 1 and a half hours. Approximately. I give 4/10.
