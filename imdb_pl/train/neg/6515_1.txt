This is not a boring movie, the audience can stay in their chair fascinated by this selfish character, Miles Berkowitz, both the filmmaker and the actor. The plot is simple: after the divorce and ten years of Hollywood non-career, the author plays in search of a camera in front of the camera. The first question is how true is everything: what is written, what happened by accident? Both answers, "yes" or "no", present M.Berkowitz as a low average human being. If you're looking for fiction about love like this, I recommend you read a few independent comics: Chester Brown, Joe Matt ... <br /> <br /> In addition, I felt very disappointed to hear so much against my country, France. I know that Americans usually say that the French are arrogant (this may be true), etc. And certainly the French (and the whole world) have a lot of regret against America, but why so much hatred? Do not think I could not like this movie because of it.
