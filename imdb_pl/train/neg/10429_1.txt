The first half was OK, but the last half was really disappointed. It's funny that the producers even admitted that they had no idea that it was the end, and it really showed. What is really sad, I have to write ten lines of the minimum commentary to be able to publish it. I really did not want to include spoilers to qualify my comments because the show is not really worth the effort. When the first Battlestar galatica appeared, I was really excited about the prospect of a better remake, it did not happen that the first season bordered with being a space porn. In the end, they cleaned up a little and actually had quite a good drama, so I started watching again. But the end of the series, in which the punishment is a cyclone, is a divine angel, the same in the case of the baltar, and six were quite stupid.
