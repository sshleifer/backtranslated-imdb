This movie had the potential to be much more than it was. But he not only fails to achieve it, but at the same time provokes bland righteous teaching. <br /> <br /> John Cusack is even more flattering than in the North of the Garden of Good and Evil. The difference is that this time it has a southern accent, which is noticeably lost several times in each scene. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino is doing his job, but he seems to be walking through this movie and collecting payment. It's good as usual, but it hardly stands out. <br /> <br /> Supporting a feminine romantic interest that added little if any story. Speaking of history, she made the story "who really cares", in which Cusack is the hypocritical mayor who needs to look for the "right thing" to do. <br /> <br /> People do not work this way. Cusack's character loses all credibility at the end, of which the preaching and nausea are not disclosed. The last scene makes the penultimate stupidity seem deep. It is also completely inaccurate, but I will not go right. <br /> <br /> This is wrong, according to the movie numbers. It seems interesting for the first 40 minutes, and then it is a really talkative, hypocritical, hypocritical movie for the last hour. Better with thoughtless nonsense than this pile of rubbish.
