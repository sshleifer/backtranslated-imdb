At first glance it should be a great movie, a great cast, a story with many possibilities and one of the best Hollywood films behind the camera for the first time. <br /> <br /> However, it's clear why it was the next 8 years before I decided to try the movie again. This movie does not work on many levels. In a film where there is not much action, and most of the scenes are shot in several places, it is necessary to provide the director with tension and continuity. Not so, a great cast is terribly underused, no more than a great, dead John Spencer, the story is so extensive and nothing you have not seen in 100 other TV movies. Character development is so small that you do not care about any of the heroes. At least we know that Spacey has many friends and brothers in Hollywood studios to escape the bad movie in this way
