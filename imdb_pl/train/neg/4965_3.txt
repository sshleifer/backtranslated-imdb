For such a great classic tale, scenery (location), Grendel was disappointed. As a writer, I blame the script, which was completely devoid of dramatic tension. The club history section is useful and would provide a new perspective on the literary classic. For some strange reason, the box has been rejected earlier. To know that it was shot in 21 days, he says "hurriedly" to me, and unfortunately it shows. Now we will have to wait for the Hollywood version on the big screen. I've heard about FX, I can tolerate really bad CGI, but the script has rock and it was just too slow, spartan and devoid of drama. I blame the actors, but ... because I know that writing is more than acting, I choose a friend.
