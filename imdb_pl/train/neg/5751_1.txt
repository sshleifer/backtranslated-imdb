The film had to be shot during the day, there are scenes in which you can see the camera reflections and its red indicator, even the green light of the scenery that mixes with the actors !!! The plot and lines are really terrible, even without the slightest inspiration (At least as a movie of the genre of thrillers). Everything that was related to Poe in the film has a shallow and childish approach. The film is full of cliques and without emotion. If you want to watch a funny movie b have a relaxing evening with friends, then go to him to enjoy him (As I Did), but there is no way to treat this movie seriously!
