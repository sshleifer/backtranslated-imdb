It was a horrible movie. Do not be tempted by Christopher Walken or Michael Ironside. They're both great actors, but it just has to be their worst role ever. Even their great game could not realize the funny story of this movie. This film is an American propaganda song from the early nineties. The most pathetic scenes were the Colombian rebels reported their cases of revolution. Maria Conchita Alonso appeared falsely, and her pseudo-love affair with Walken was just a pathetic emotional plugin to the film, which was devoid of any real meaning. I am disappointed that there are such films, ruining an actor, as the good name of Christopher Walken. I could barely sit by it.
