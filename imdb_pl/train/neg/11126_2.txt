Of all the films I have seen, this one is almost at the bottom (Haunted Mansion, Nothing but Trouble and a few others do not let him reach the bottom). It is hasty, history is shaky, and the presented events are poorly preserved. Of course, we have to put it in the writer's door. The book for which the film was made is outrageously heavy and illogical. Oprah gives a tasty look to her mother, Bigger, but she can not use it. Other well-known performers also seem to be in the worst position. A plot focusing on African-Americans who decided to take a job as a chauffeur. Leading a family daughter for a communist dinner, she meets. One thing leads to the other, and the girl gets drunk. Now the family he's working for is not against Black, but he thinks it is. So when he comes home, he puts her into bed, but he starts babbling. The blind mother (yes) hears it, so the Greater tries to silence her, but instead suffocates her. Now, fearing that he is really having trouble killing a white girl, he does what any logical thinking man would do - he pushes it into the coal furnace. So the investigators carry out the missing person's case and check the stove (the idiot did not have the ability to anticipate getting rid of the ashes.) Then he gets arrested and the last hour is the unbearable segments of the courtroom. seriously want to learn about cultural matters in the 40s and 50s or see a good drama, there are many better options.
