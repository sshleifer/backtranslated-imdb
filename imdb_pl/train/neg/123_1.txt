Oh, brother ... after hearing about this absurd film for a dozen or so years I can only think about this old Peggy Lee song ... <br /> <br /> "Is this all?" ... I was just an early teenager when this smoked fish hit the USA. I was too young to get into the theater (although I managed to sneak into "Goodbye Columbus"). Then there was a show at the local movie museum - in the end I could see this movie, except that I was as old as my parents when they tried to see it !! <br /> <br /> The only reason why this movie was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was due to a case of indecency caused by its American release. Millions of people gathered in this smelly, thinking that they would see a sex movie ... Instead, they got a lot of gnarly close-ups, repulsive Swedes, street interviews in bland shopping malls, asina of political grievances ... and the weak takes care of simulating sex scenes with flaccid , pale actors. <br /> <br /> Culture icon, Holy Grail, historic artifact ... Whatever it was, shred it, burn it, and then push the ash in the lead box! <br /> <br /> The elite aesthetics are still scratching to find value in their boring, pseudo-revolutionary political floods ... But if it was not for a censorship scandal, it would be ignored and then forgotten. <br /> <br /> Instead, the rhythmic title "I'm empty, empty" has been repeated endlessly over the years as a title for porn movies (I'm curious, Lavender - for gay movies, I Am Curious, Black - for Blaxploitation movies etc. .) and every ten years something rises from the dead to be watched by a new generation of nerds who want to see this "naughty movie of sex" that "r evolved the film industry" ... <br /> <br /> Hey, avoid like a plague ... or if you MUST see it - rent a movie and quickly send it to the "dirty" parts, in order to finish it. <br /> <br />
