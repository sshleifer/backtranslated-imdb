Jeremy Northam is struggling with the "Total Recall" cloning script and a one-off romantic "by-play" game to give life to a confused character. Lucy Liu ends her game from a wooden start to a worker-like finish. You can not help but laugh at her DVD interviews when she uses the term "Femme fatal" and "Romance". A French film noir actress who is gone and they lack chemistry together. <br /> <br /> This movie fails, not on the plot or in the action sequences, but in the lack of attention to detail in film photography and the ham-fisted portrait of the world of technology surrounding the main characters. There are not many attempts to dress in the scenery to represent a continuous film landscape or period. Cars are very 90's and architecture is barely modern with open plans that suggest a rather limited budget than conscious clothing techniques. <br /> <br /> Technology is positively fun. A huge mainframe "2001: A Space Odyssey" powered by portable CD-ROMs with data collected for some unexplained reason, despite the multiplication of the communication network, which even the most experienced technologist would certainly know. There is an obvious lack of research done here, and given the nature of cyber-communities in the open source code, research would cost little more than the bulletin board and personal time. <br /> <br /> DVD interviews also reveal the original name of the movie sounded "Company Man", but probably abandoned it to earn a Matrix hype. The title "Cypher" has only the smallest connection with the film. Terry Gilliam would do miracles thanks to this concept; and I completely recreated the Decalogue. <br /> <br /> This is the TV quality and extremely disappointing film production. It can be a good subroutine "Alias".
