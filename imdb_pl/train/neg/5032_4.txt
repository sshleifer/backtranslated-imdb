This movie was in a sci-fi 50-pack my friend won me for Christmas. It is very similar to the first Gozilli movie and just like this movie has scenes with American actors for no real reason. An interesting thing about the introduced scenes is that there is tension between Cold War and America between America and Russia. Like in Godzilla, Gamera wakes up an atomic explosion and madness all over the world, paying special attention to Tokyo, because no big movie about monsters is complete, unless Tokyo bites him. All in all, it's a good movie. Some scenes involving Gamers, especially scenes in Toly, are quite spectacular and have quite decent special effects at the time. If you like Japanese giant monster movies, you'll really enjoy it. I give him 4 out of 10. If it was an unedited Japanese version that I watched, she would probably get 5.
