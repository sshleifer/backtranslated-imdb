Oh, it's so bad, it's funny. The only way to explain something like that is a pornographic drug party that led to resolution to make a movie just for fun. I mean, you can see topless porn actresses, having sex and then killed by human mutants. There are a lot of gore, including the classic "something is wrong with her, oh no, it's half the person she once was" and accidental murder caused by panic. But you can also find funny things, such as the intestines caught by someone's butt and the guy running in the woods, and then cut off by a wire tied between two trees (which causes the metallic sound of the doia, as in cartoons). Somehow there is a market for people who go beyond pornography, they really need to know what's in the actress, the genitals themselves are not enough. That is why you can see many summaries of autopsies of killed moonshine. There is no dialog. Jenna and Chasey have really small parts and I really wonder what Richard Grieco wanted, assuming a role here. I think it is a movie that you have to watch quickly using the button and watch only juicy things to remind you of the old C-class horrors.
