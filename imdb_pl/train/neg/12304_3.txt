I watched this movie last week and had the biggest laugh I've had for a long time. The plot of the film is quite stupid and complicated in a badly prepared way. The only plus that can be found anywhere in the movie is the impressive abs Corey Saviera. Alexandra Paul (I think she is called that) is terrifying as a preacher's wife who has a history of depression. Ted McKenzie is disgusting, and his character is everything to everyone. And as if it was not enough that you think that he is having sex with his son, they throw unnecessary saxophone solos at every opportunity! The end and culmination of this film is absolutely grim and funny. I mean, who the hell wants to carry a horse kid who tried to make you think he's your son and that you have an incest relationship with him!
