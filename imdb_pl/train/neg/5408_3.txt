THIS REVIEW THE MOST ALL SPOILERS. IF YOU NEED TO USE THIS FILM, DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW. <br /> <br /> This is a problem with television for children nowadays. It's all condescending and condescending. `Wow, that was fun, right? 'No, it was not. And, unfortunately, it seems that it also penetrated children's films. This is the "reindeer flight". Although I did not see "Flight of the Reindeer" in a few years, I can be foggy in some moments, but I remember that I was not too impressed at that time. <br /> <br /> Essentially the story is the following lecturer who got a book for Christmas. Now the lecturer is a valued scientist about flying habits in some animals. I think they were roaring frogs. In any case, thanks to this book, the lecturer / family member learns that reindeers can fly in exactly the same way as roaring frogs. Apparently this book was written by a scientist hundreds of years ago who disappeared at the North Pole. If I had thrown the book to the nearest window. Flying frogs are a naturally occurring phenomenon, but a flying reindeer is a fantastic and completely unrealistic concept. But, lecturer, I'm not me, so I think it explains why he decides to fly to the North Pole, leaving his wife and child at home, not knowing where he went. Of course, everything goes wrong and before it finds out, the flying reindeer crashed on his private plane and got stuck at the North Pole. <br /> <br /> Are you still following this? Well. <br /> <br /> Of course his family is devastated. I would also, I mean, what a Christmas holiday. Elsewhere, the lecturer is in a hidden city at the north pole, inhabited by dwarfs and one tyrannical figure who dresses only in red and white. Instead of trying to escape immediately, as I would have done, he greets everyone there with open arms. This hidden civilization of dwarfish monsters welcomes them with open arms. Oooo-kayyyy. They feed him with the story that they are Santa's elves and spend the whole year making toys for children that he does not know about. And you lecturer accepts it all. He even admits that Santa Claus is actually a scientist who disappeared two hundred years ago or anything else. There is only one problem - they do not want him to leave. The world can not know about their secret existence. In the end, before they know it, McDonalds and Starbucks will be on every corner. <br /> <br /> Still with me? <br /> <br /> Now the gentleman's family finds a book and assume that he went to the North Pole. Boy, would they not be embarrassed if they found out that he had just gone for a brisk walk? Before the public knows, they set out to spend Christmas in the most authentic winter world in the world. In the meantime, the lecturer suffers from all kind punishments and decides to leave. I do not remember exactly, but I remember how he kept Santa at gunpoint. There is a fight with fire when the dwarfs attack and he manages to escape through Santa's sleigh. With Santa's fever on his heels and with the lust of blood in his eyes, Mr. Whatever, by some miraculous convergence, there is a family flying near the plane who is looking for him. So he jumps into his plane, the planes fly back and everyone lives happily ever after. <br /> <br /> It is a fact that for years there have been shocking films in the name of Christmas, but because they have this Christmas charm they succeed. And this is the charm completely devoid of the "Flight of reindeer". There's nothing wrong with it; nothing that offends intelligence (well, of course, IT IS, but it's a movie for children and that's why it can run away with things like that) or something particularly offensive, but the problem is that there's nothing big about it. It just does not feel Christmassy. And when it comes to the movie about Christmas, it is a serious drawback. But hey, I do not think that "Reindeer's target group's flight thought about it? Why would they? They are all so stuffed with sedatives that they probably can not spell "Bo≈ºe Narodzenie". <br /> <br /> It gives me three to ten. If it was a TV movie, I would add another two stars to it. We all know how bad they can get.
