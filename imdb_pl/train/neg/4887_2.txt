The first movie is quite good. This one is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> It processes a lot of material (including the opening credits and the final title) from Crazy Insanity. The new footage filmed on the video really sticks out as badly done. Scenes are devoid of proper lighting, the sound is sometimes almost inaudible, there are even video defects, such as scrolling the image, etc. <br /> <br /> Like all bad sequels, it simply repeats the story of the first one. Ethel kills everyone who shares her living space, often because of the fact that they interfere with eating. <br /> <br /> At least this is just an addition to the DVD for the first, which also includes the same director's film, Satan's black wedding. It is a pity that this does not include the films of Death Nurse.
