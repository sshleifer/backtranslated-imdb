This miserable film is a remake of the 1927 film. They should let it stay like this. <br /> <br /> What a colossal bomb! Douglas Fairbanks does not show any charisma here. Cesar Romero plays the role of a real moron, and Bette Grable sings the chorus - What will I do to the Hungarian! <br /> <br /> A funny plot depicts a picture of a woman in a castle in 1561 Rome, who saved the day by killing the conqueror. (Fairbanks) Now let's move to 300 years later, where Grable, just married to Count Romero, faces a similar situation when the invasion of Hungarian soldiers takes place on the wedding night. <br /> <br /> Romero acts cowardly and runs away before the army arrives. He dresses up as a Gypsy and stays in the castle when he plays Fairbanks on the violin. The ending is worse than the whole unfortunate movie in which Grable meets Fairbanks to give him good news - enraged Romero canceled the marriage. <br /> <br /> This poor film imitation was created in 1948. As Harry Davenport, a veteran supporting the player who is in it, he died in 1949; it must have been his last movie. What a bomb you can meet after such a great career. <br /> <br /> Walter Abel works with the stars, but not much can do with such a bad writing. Costumes look more like those from the Stone Age. I can not understand what Fairbanks was wearing.
