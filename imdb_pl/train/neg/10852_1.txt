This movie is a very funny movie. Violence is bad, acting is ... Well, Dani, hold on to singing or shouting, or whatever the hell you usually do. Random chicks wearing almost everything are simply caught by sexually frustrated boys ready. Personally, I think this movie really sucks. History and characters can be very good if we say that directors, actors and other small nibbles have been improved. But the movie is just bad, the only reason people like this piece of nonsense is because it has Danni. This movie is probably the worst B-rate movie. And believe me, it's hard to achieve, especially when you compete with Def by Temptation and shitty excuses for "serious" horror movies. I'm not a CoF fan, so I see it as another junk movie ... Really bad. If Dani would do it then comedy, it goes well. Very well done. Also, I rate it as low because it is shit. Watch it when you are in a joyful, happy, joyful, joyful mode, so you can laugh at everything or if you are on many different types of drugs.
