The Radar Men from the Moon is a fairly typical fee for series from the 1950s. Special effects are quite cheap, lunar rovers are, of course, surplus jeeps from World War II with painted plywood above them and the like. Acting is just that. It inspires the imagination of children to whom I think it has been directed. By today's standards it is boring, cheap and bad. In the first 9 episodes of natural disasters there is also a huge amount of footage.
