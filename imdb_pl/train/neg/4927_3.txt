Lois Weber, a self-proclaimed missionary through cinema, wrote, directed and produced other films about controversial topics, but this may be the first movie that will get a wide view thanks to TCM. This film is her act of accusation of abortion, but cleverly mixes the problem by introducing eugenics and birth control, leaving the impression that they are somehow equivalent to abortion. Her writing talent and other film skills are clearly visible here, but you can forgive her that she regrets that she did not use them less didactically. If you've been wondering what Tyrone Power looks like, "famous father" Jr., here's your chance. 1916 fashion and cars are also on display to add to the interest of this piece of the museum. It is pleasant, even if you do not appreciate propaganda.
