This movie was full of endless surprises! Just when you thought it could not be worse, they added more joints and more pink, fuzzy vanes with obscene sexual scenes. As you can guess, I was a victim of the original version. We were deceived to watch it, thinking it was Supervan, the host box that promised Lasary, jail breaks and much more. Who would have thought that the Christmas Dollar Store gift could be fun!
