It's the worst movie I've ever seen. Everyone involved should be ashamed. Each. Ice-T is pathetic, the dialogue is absolutely horrible, and Hokie does not begin to describe the performances of every actor in this film. The action steals hard from the performance decision, but compared to Air Rage, the performance decision is an Oscar material. I have never been so disappointed in watching a movie. The air rage should be burnt, and its ashes closed in the vault, so that it will never see the light of day again. Anyone who has seen this should shower and wash away the stench of the horrible movie. The best part of this movie probably comes from the end, when loans began to appear. It was the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Ice-T should stick to law and order, and other people in this film should retire early or commit suicide. Either way, they should never try again to be in the movie.
