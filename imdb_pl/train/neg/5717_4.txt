Whoa nelly! I've heard a lot of mixed reviews on this topic ... but one of my favorite hardcore reviewers has really disappointed me. The man was right on the nose! This film was made by pure amateurs. They had to take one shot, maybe two on each stage, the movie seemed very hurried. The script was also weak ... they had lines that tried to be unique but failed. Miserably. "Take my meathooks off me!" Oh my, I hate it when the movies try to do it. It happens all the time with comedies ... but with horror and under average actors .... the results are incredibly pathetic. Lines and scenarios were very predictable. But what made me feel so negative about this movie is damn acting again. That was awful. In addition, a small Asian guy who worked at the booth. I thought it was great. <br /> <br /> There are about 5 stupid tourists in the film who are on vacation in Asia. They finished in the wrong place and fell into the hands of mafia sex / slaughterhouse. Sounds like a nice story. But watching someone with bad diarrhea is probably more fun and intense to watch. The only reason it is believed that horror is caused by killing. There was no sign of uncertainty. <br /> <br /> I like many other horror fans who died to get their damned little gloves on it. But unfortunately with the huge capital U, the film was incredibly disappointing. I loved the ankle fracture and blood effects. The fledglings were also like that. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie screams amateurishly. This is the first length of Ryan Nicholson and he usually failed. There is no doubt that he has a sick sense of humor and tastes horror. I am praying that his next movie will not be like another horror film B ... unless he tells us that it will be so. Even after this disappointment, I am ready to give Ryan another shot. From what I've seen, he's a real devoted man in this genre. Good luck next time, because it was bad news.
