There is one good thing in this movie: Lola Glaudini's ass! I'm sorry I'm so dumb, but it's true. It is a pity that she did not do it naked. At least he will make this mess tolerant. We see tits of another chick, but nowhere is Lola around. And man, is Armand Assante old or what? The man looks like shit! "Consequence" is a regular B-Movie movie you can expect. History had potential. It's as if they had good ideas, but they did not know how to do them. The pictures are simply awful. Ugly! The direction is not very inspired, and the end result is a bland thriller with bad twists and wiped actors. Lola Gaudini is as good as a vixen in a cheap, savage way, but she does not even save Consequence from being garbage, not funny junk, just old, smelly junk.
