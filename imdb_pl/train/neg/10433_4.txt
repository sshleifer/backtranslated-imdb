The battle scenes were great. I loved old and new cylindons and how they painted on their side. It was the ending that I hated. I was disappointed that it was land, but 150,000 years ago. But to travel so far to start again? Are you joking? 38 thousand People who fought for their existence and after reaching paradise abandon technology? No way. They probably ate paper and rationed food, but this is the end. They can live like people again. They only have one good doctor. What will they do when someone is suffering from a toothache, without worrying about childbirth ... yes. Nobody would make that choice.
