I respect the fact that it is a very popular program. However, compared to the brilliant, cheerful, cheerful and groundbreaking classic film by Robert Altman from 1970, this program was probably less than average ... even if it worked for 11 years, it does not necessarily have to be good. This performance was too much an integral part of my early childhood (it was a repeat of each evening and guess whose parents watched and laughed), but this is one of the memories I do not miss. And now that I've seen this movie, I can give this series a thorough criticism. By itself is not bad at "2 out of 10". However, the characters of this series do not resemble those from the movie. Some of them are technically the same, but only by name. For example, since when did Alan Alda be someone like Donald Sutherland? His style of humor is completely different, as are his characteristics and perspectives. New characters are not so great; they are only meant to make you miss those they replace. It's the same with new actors (including Jamie Farrem). The only thing that actually moves into the series is the radar, which still (though played by the same actor) is only a pale imitation of the original. What else? Oh yes. With the path of laughter (no matter whether it was used in the surgical scenes or not), it turns out to be frightening because of what is happening in other settings. And because it lasted almost four times longer than the actual Korean War, it takes viewers into this bizarre worldly slit that does not work outside the world of cartoons. I've never liked this program and I will never do it.
