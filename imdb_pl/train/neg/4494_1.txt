*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Continued ... <br /> <br /> From then on, the whole movie collapses itself. First, we meet a fake program with an indication that we'll get ghosts, vampires and werewolves and the like. We get a guy with a delayed accent talking about endless rubbish, two "ghosts" that do not serve any real purpose and have no character like never before and a group of supporters. Someone told me that they are vampires (straight from Blade 2), but they are so undefined that I did not realize. <br /> <br /> A funny accented guy with a funny name suffers from the same problem as Oracle, only much longer and much worse. He has a simple point on the cause and effect, he makes it, and then continues and does it until it becomes confusing and stupid. His last line before leaving is comparable to the line "Do you know what is happening with the toad ..." in the X-men on the level of complete, nondescript anger. Chocolate cake is such a lazy, pathetic film, and Monica Bellucci as a wife does nothing but exactly what we expect when we see her. <br /> <br /> And then we get another kung fu fight !!! WHY? Neo is supposedly The One. He can do anything. It has the highest power and what it is for. Kung bloody fu all the time. And although he can stop 1000 bullets, he is still cut with a sword and still makes a meal of five undocumented henchmen (vampires?). I wanted to see the powers of the mind. I wanted to see how he makes the wildest, craziest s ***, because he can do anything. I was the same as before without "wow". <br /> <br /> The famous car chase. It can not be bad. Well ... no, it's not. This is not what we said it would be. ALL cool shots from this scene are in the trailer. Each. So it's possible that Wow was taken away from us, so now we have a good chase sequence with, guess, kung fu fight !!! OK, it's not Neo, but you would think he would explain to his closest friends about the reality of the Matrix. At least I taught them something. It is not difficult. <br /> <br /> "Hey, Morpheus, do not worry about what's happening to you in the matrix. This is not real. As long as you understand that nothing is real, nothing can really hurt you. " <br /> <br /> Please. Simple. <br /> <br /> OK, so the chase is not bad. It is never boring and does not seem 16 minutes. It's so disappointing. And it's still getting worse. <br /> <br /> The ultimate climax of the movie is probably the worst imaginable. They have this whole complicated plan that includes three crews. Then they show him sporadically only between the long, superficial monologues of Morpheus. What's worse, they never specify clearly what is the plan that needs 3 teams. You know basically, but you do not know who does what when, so when one crew goes down, you just do not care and you do not know how it will affect what's going on. <br /> <br /> I conclude this, it happens, so Trinity can return to the Matrix to set the end. That's the only reason. Which raises the question why they originally had to send 6 people? Trinity enters alone in five minutes! <br /> <br /> The journey of Neo to the center of the Matrix (so to speak) is treated equally lazily. Ooohhh !!! He hits another 100 Smith agents !!! Woooooo !!! It must have required a lot of thought. Only now are they in the corridor, so the fight has no scale and it will end soon. Man, what a great final !!! <br /> <br /> And then the architect !!! <br /> <br /> Remember everything I said was bad about the Oracle and the stranger? Add them to yourself and double, the Architect is really scary. The only reasonable potential is that he is about to begin the culmination of cliffhanging. <br /> <br /> And then he blows! <br /> <br /> Let's look at the options Neo gives. Choose one door and all humanity will die (except 27 !!!). Choose the second one and all humanity will die !!! Considering a choice is something that this movie tries to discover, but it's not really a hero. If he had the choice Save humanity and the miss dies, or Save this virgin and kill mankind, then there is potential for inner torment and tension. Also, when Trinity is halfway through the fall, the potential of a real cliff that would make the third look more important. But no. He did not save anyone or save the missus. <br /> <br /> Now the worst thing in the original Matrix was to die of Neo and return to life at the very end. In the year that it came out, everyone was so annoyed with how foolish Jar Jar was that they did not notice that the end of the Matrix alone made Steven Hawking look at him. "The oracle told me that I would fall in love with Jedny, and I love you" .... Next !!! How the whole world can miss, how terrible it was? <br /> <br /> So what are the Wachowski doing in the sequel? Well, they make the completion of the original look better. How? Well, again, doing exactly the same (just swapping characters) only a lot worse I think my keys fa and r would be worn out if I kept writing before I got worse. <br /> <br /> And cliffhanger is not just a cliff. This is a reminder. <br /> <br /> Essentially, this movie is just bad. I really did not want it to be bad, but it is. Bad in many ways. What's worse, it's not a movie with an inadequate budget. This is not a movie with too short a schedule. This is not a movie that has been fired. This is not a movie in which too much influence came from outside. This is exactly the movie that Wachowski decided to do with Warner's fortune fully. And that makes it so horrible. At least Rancid Aluminum can say that there was not enough time and money. <br /> <br /> Matrix Reloaded. The worst movie ever made? Maybe not really. The most disappointing and defelling movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Undeniably. <br /> <br />
