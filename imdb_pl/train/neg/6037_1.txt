Moron and the girl run some ritual to resurrect the dead, trying to prove that the dead can not be brought back to life. No wonder they will resurrect a dead soul that starts hacking them with an ax, and the next day some school-age people tell the story around the campfire. The guy with the ax appears and begins to hack the idiots telling the story. The group calls the cops, the cop sees spilled blood all over the surface and thinks it's a mountain lion (!?), And shortly thereafter he gets stuck by some deformed killer who may or may not be a ghost. <br /> <br /> A Moron small splashing movie that was filmed in broad daylight, but in which several characters wear a flashlight and speak as if it was the middle of the night, and wanting to send a signal flare to attract attention. One guy has a gun in one hand and bullets in the other, but he does not care about loading it, and after he finally loads it, he has a few opportunities to shoot the killer, but he does not care because it will end the film too soon. Then he throws away the weapon! There are also harmful characters who do not show emotion and do not look worried after their friends are cut into pieces and bad effects (the human heart looks like a piece of chicken meat, the car blasted at the end was clearly a car model) and horrible dialogue and really ugly feminine nudity does not help. And finally he tries to get away from this incoherence, saying that this is the whole invention of the same school-age people telling the story of the outbreak at the beginning of this movie. <br /> <br /> Then the killer appears in the last scene, hacks them to pieces. Again. <br /> <br /> Medium of this kind, good only for some unintentional laughter. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
