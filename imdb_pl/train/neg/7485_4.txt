Of course, it seems like a good idea. Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese in the comedy of Neil Simon. Where can you go wrong? Watch the video and you'll find out. <br /> <br /> In fact Martin, the main character, is poorly manned. He does not make a great slapstick from which he is known, from films such as "The Jerk", but instead he plays a kind of indirect character that does not work. Hawn, with whom no one plays, is terrible. Cleese is the only partly funny member. <br /> <br /> In addition, the plot is quite stupid. I can not say how much of it has been changed, but the heroes seem to lack some common sense. They get lost in New York without doing anything good and unfortunately nothing funny. Not only is the whole thing completely unbelievable, but it seems to convey the message that people who do not live in New York are not very bright, the motif repeated throughout the film. to see this, rent the original "Odd Couple" again.
