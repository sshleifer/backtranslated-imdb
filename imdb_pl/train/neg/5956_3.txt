Another horror in which a teenager fights a madman and his supernatural helper who wants to take power ?! Yes, but the fact that he was from Canada gives him a slightly different character. "The Brain" has a troublesome teenager, Jim Majelewski, who is undergoing treatment, whose leader turns out to be a cult leader supported by a big ugly "brain". Can Jim stop him? I think that since our northern neighbor has achieved everything they have achieved, they have the right to create at least one unreasonable horror. But they will still want to be known for having national healthcare and everyone. <br /> <br /> The bad guy had a brain. Why people who made this movie?
