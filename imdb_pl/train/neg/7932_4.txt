Oh, what a disappointment. For decades I have been watching old Westerns on British television and I did not realize it until yesterday's show - most other Scott Westerns appear every few years and are usually worth seeing again. <br /> <br /> Rich colors and outdoor sets were good, but that's all I can say about this film. I have to agree with most other negative comments already submitted. I wanted to turn him off a few times, and in the end I did, in the middle, something I almost never do. <br /> <br /> Scott seemed extremely oily in the magic of girls, his two helpers were annoying, as did the Mexican bandit boy. And I have the impression that military uniforms were 20-year-old or too modern, which did not bother the creators of many other westerns. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it was better in the second half, but I could not wait and see.
