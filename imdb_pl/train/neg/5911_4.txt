MOZLIWE SPOILERY <br /> <br /> The Spy Who Shagged Me is a much overrated and overgrown continuation. The International Man of Mystery went straight out of the sky. It was a lonely star that few people had heard of. But he was stunningly original, he had sophisticated humor and a lot of humor, always kept in good taste and had a great cast. The Spy Who Shagged Me was much more advertised and advertised. <br /> <br /> OK, I admit that I saw this movie for the first time. or three times that you see all the disadvantages. Acting was fine, but Heather Graham can not act. Her performance did not seem very convincing and she was not as good as Liz Hurley in the first one. Those characters that bloomed in the first one (Scott Evil, Number 2, etc.) are thrown into the background and do not have many independent scenes. The film is simply full of scenes. <br /> <br /> In particular, I hated that they completely disregarded some of the scenes in IMOM. When they killed Vanessa in the beginning and told Basil to sit down, he knew he was a fembot the whole time. What was it for? They killed number 2 in the first, and now they restore it without any explanation. This is supposed to be espionage, I do not think any of the heroes would hold a weapon in the film. It just goes farther, farther and farther away from the point. <br /> <br /> New characters are very undesirable. The entire Mini-Me joke from my size is aging very fast. Fat Bastard is just a bad excuse for disgusting humor. In total, there are about two or three good jokes. The rest is tasteless or processed with IMOM. <br /> <br /> If it was the first movie in the series, I would probably be easier on it. But the series began with notes of dry wit and then dropped to the level of gross humor. So I say, watch this movie only when you have not seen his predecessor, because The Spy Who Shagged Me is one big disappointment.
