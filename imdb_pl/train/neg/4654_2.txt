The female vampire kills young women and paints with blood. He has an assistant who does not want to be a vampire, so he must do what he commands or be turned into a bloodsucker. After a few homicides, the assistant gets remorse and falls in love with a homeless girl. <br /> <br /> What can I say about this film? The fact that his tempo is too slow, has some strange sound effects (it never sounded so strange) and the atmosphere (new jazz here I come in) and that the lights do not seem to be included in the set. It looks like a "proprietary" horror with all self-sufficiency inside. <br /> <br /> The plot is completely stupid and, as you can guess, the vampire explains how to kill her, even if you do not have to do it; Of course, crosses, light, garlic and sticks do not work. <br /> <br /> This is not even a funny bad movie. Perhaps with a few friends and many beers, you can not have fun sides (honestly, it's fun for 10-15 minutes at the end of the movie). Do not be fooled by Troma's sticker, this is one of her bad movies.
