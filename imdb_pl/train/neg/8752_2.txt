I watched the movie really late last night and usually, if it's late, I'm pretty sorry for the movies. Although I tried, I just could not stand the movie, but the movie was getting worse. Although I know it has to be a comedy, but I do not think it's very funny. It was also a particularly unrealistic and glazed image of rural life. In case you think that living in a village is similar, it is definitely not. I have to agree that some guy cast members were cute, but the French guy was really fake. I must agree that he tried to have a good lesson in this story, but in general, I recommend that nobody over 8 years of watching it, it is simply too annoying.
