I made this movie with the intention of getting a bad movie about zombies. But I had no idea what I was getting into. <br /> <br /> I started the movie and I was soon drawn into a world of pain and visual torture. <br /> <br /> I finally know what the hell is. It's this movie. For eternity. This movie has no value. He did not even have a story. There were many things in each scene, but there was no general explanation of why something was happening. <br /> <br /> Instead of watching this movie, I suggest that you level the nearest blender with oil and try and stuff as many bullets as you can. You will see that the result will be much more enjoyable than this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not even watch it. Not even to see how bad it is. I beg you. If you watch it, it means it wins.
