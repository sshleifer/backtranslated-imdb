There are two points that I need to explain at the very beginning. First of all, we all know what this year's Oscars were REALLY this year. It was the way the Academy showed people that they were not racists and they never were. They wanted to remove all preconceived assumptions about themselves. Secondly, there is no point in making comments about the series, because in reality, what's the difference? But it's great to write about it. This is the year when I'm tired of an Oscar! I will never watch this program again. Every year they do something bad. Before Crowe wins for "Gladaitor", when Ralph Fiennes really wins for "Sunshine". If you have not seen this movie yet, have a look and agree. "Eyes wide shut" after the release did not receive the nomination. And as for this year, well, bad choices were everywhere! Baz Lurhmann does not receive the nomination "Best Director"! Are you kidding !! "A Beautiful Mind" is "Best Makeup" ???? "Training day" is nominated? The movie was terrible and it seemed that Washington did not even introduce himself, he only proved that he could use four-letter words! It was for this award that he won h! Take your tongue out and I bet you almost had fun! I liked "Gosford Park", really, but why 7 nominations? And how on earth could not they give her Altman too! I mean, come on, if you just give a reward to people to explain all the bad feelings, what about Altman? The man has been in the eyes of the public for 32 years and there is no Oscar! There were many, many things that bothered me in this year's Oscars, but I will live with it, unless I have to watch another program again! The highlight (and ONLY one) of the program was the fact that Woody Allen appeared for the first time at the exhibition. This will be one of the greatest moments in its history.
