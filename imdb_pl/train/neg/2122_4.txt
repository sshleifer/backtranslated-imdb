Although in some respects Seven Pounds is solid and interesting in some narrative styles, the Gabriele Muccino project is rather mediocre. The film becomes more and more caressing and manipulative when it approaches the end: human and emotional hearts, physical and metaphorical eyes. Seven Pounds is an amateur Amits Perros by Alejandro González Iñárritu and 21 grams, with lots of flashbacks. The problem is that history is quite predictable from VERY easily through the movie. It is a pity, because Seven Pounds could be just as "good" if Ben and Emily were chosen in the right hands.
