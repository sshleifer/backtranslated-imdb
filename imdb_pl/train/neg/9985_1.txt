Have you ever seen a film more shockingly inept? I can think of many that are equal to it, but none of them can outrun it. The cast includes all terrible stereotypes burdened with flat dialogue. I'm ashamed of all the people involved in this. Each of them has the expression of fear, which is not generated by the story, but realizing that this project can easily end the career. Even the many charms of Mrs. Diaz do not give you enough reason to give up. Avoid, this is of course the style of a film that Americans do not really understand. Watch the final result, if you must, and you will see what I am talking about, but I DO NOT say I have not warned you ...
