Funny, like many people who say it is much better than the Romero version, it seems to be very young (judging by other posts). We have a shapely, action-packed, bloody and "Whoopee" filled 2-hour MTV video. Crazy edition, work with pop-video camera, "fajna" muzyka blah blah blah <br /> <br /> Actually, it's not bad compared to other new alterations (massacre mechanical saw was a total disaster) ... quite well acting all round, completely predictable in "who will die next" rates and total cash in Dawn Of The Dead, which will generate a lot of income only by fans of the original who will go and see it out of curiosity ... <br /> <br /> the classics remake does not get into your nerves? Can not REALLY come up with something original? Why is it worth changing Dawn Of The Dead? Things that made the original unique (children from the middle segment think it's so boring, it should be slow to show how, when you get everything you've ever wanted, you're still not happy) completely lacking. It's fast, simple and simple. The sooner the better. If you fancy a movie action (and this 2004 version is well done), it's quite fair, but for anyone who likes a bit of content for their movies ... get ready for the sigh (re) ... <br / > <> Browse cinemas in the next few years, when we get the series The Godfather, whose author is the hottest director of Pop, and the transformation of Star Wars, with all the kids saying how the new version is much better than the old version is slow and boring , and keeps the shot for over 5 seconds ... <br /> <br /> Not bad, but in 10 years will continue to discuss the version of Romero, not this mush
