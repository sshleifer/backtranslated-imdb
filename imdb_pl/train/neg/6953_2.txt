Rating: 4 of 10 <br /> <br /> As this mini-series approaches and we've been aware of it for the last six months, when the Sci-Fi Channel continued to fuck their programs with BG commercials, I admit that I felt a growing anxiety when I learned more. <br /> <br /> As with any work of film art that has stood the test of time, different people visit it to see different things. Therefore, when people think about Battlestar Galactica, they remember different things. For some, they are chrome warriors with a red light oscillating in the viewfinder. For others, it is a passion for special effects that have been quite evolutionary for their time. Many forget about the state of special effects in the late 1970s, especially on television. For some, the memories are solved around the arc of the story. Others still remember the relationship of how the relationships themselves helped to overcome the challenges they faced. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I'm from the second group. The core of Battlestar Galactica were the people who gathered to save each other from the empire of evil. Yes, evil. The Cylons had nothing to gain except the extermination of the human race, but they did it. As the stars swirled around, men and women met to face the enemy with virtually unlimited resources, and somehow managed to survive until the next show. They did not survive because they had better technology or greater firepower. They survived because they cared for each other and trusted each other to go to the next show. <br /> <br /> The performance had its flaws and sometimes it was unhappy, but they were people who could be worried about. <Br /> <br /> The authors of this current edition have never understood this. In some respects, he took the least-significant part of the original show, the names of the characters and the story of the story, and created what they called nothing but the rediscovery of television science fiction. Because this was their goal, they can be judged on how well they have achieved it: failure. It was far from being rediscovered. In fact, it was in many ways one of the most absorbed science fiction ventures for a long time. Borrows freely from ST: TNG, ST: DS9, Babylon 5, and even Battlefield Earth. I find this unfortunate. <br /> <br /> Ronald D. Moore has been a co-creator of popular science fiction for over ten years and contributed to the emergence of one of the most popular Science Fiction TV shows that you can see. One of the difficulties he seemed to have was that the Enterprise D & E bridge crew could not be in conflict. This was the inviolable principle of ST: TNG Roddenberry. Like many who lived according to the principles of others who then use every opportunity to break the rules when they are no longer subject to this authority, Ron Moore seems to forget about some of the lessons he learned from the renowned science fiction master: Gene Roddenberry. Here, instead of writing the best possible story, he created a dysfunctional cast I've ever seen, with the intention of creating as much conflict as he could. Besides being dysfunctional, some of them were not the least reliable. Anyone who has ever been in the military knows that someone unfairly hitting a senior officer will not get a few days "in the hook", they could get an execution and they would never leave the next day. That would not happen, period, especially during the war. <br /> <br /> I remembered that most of the earlier works of Ron Moore consisted in the fact that he wrote the death of Capt. James Kirk. He killed Capt. Kirk and, unfortunately, he killed Battlestar Galactica.
