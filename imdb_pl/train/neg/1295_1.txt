this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I love Japanese movies and I think that another film by the same director, an electric 80,000 v dragon, is a masterpiece. I really wanted to like this movie - asano is a great actor, and the plot was extremely attractive. but I could not find anything interesting. <br /> <br /> the film lasts forever so that nothing will happen. and the effects used by the director - like constant drums and the exaggerated use of slow motion - only added to my growing irritation that the plot was so amazingly slow, and the actors were shamefully worried. much of the boredom was the result of unnecessary additions that were completely unnecessary - like an hour spent on asana walking on the cuts of Buddha statues and proclaiming that she did not honor anything. it added nothing to the story. a friend from a Japanese film and I checked the time together. we could not believe that this movie was as scary as it was. and the finale was terrible. I thought that the director would at least try to reward the viewer for the fact that he managed to sit down, but unfortunately I was wrong.
