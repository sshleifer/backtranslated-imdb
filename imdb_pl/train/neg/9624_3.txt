Given the potential of this movement, the reality was disappointing. Although it's always nice to see Jennifer Aniston in the movie, even that could not change it. Most of the shares were predictable. The jokes were flat and slightly funny. And the characters were not very interesting. I wanted to like this movie, but it never happened. Ben Stiller was funny at "There Something about Mary". It looks like he's just going through movements. If they have to pick up feature points from "Friends" they should know that something is wrong. Humor from the toilet should stay in the closet :-). <br /> <br /> Instead, look at the "50 first dates".
