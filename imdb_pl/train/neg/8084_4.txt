I chose this title from a friend who had it in his exhaustive DVD / Video / Laserdisc collection, so thankfully I did not have to pay for it. I had the feeling that it would be a bad movie, but I KNOW what a bad movie really is after watching devotees like Children should not play with dead things and incredibly weird creatures that stopped life and became mixed zombies, and now there's nothing what would disturb me, unless it's amazingly wrong. <br /> <br /> The solar crisis is bad, but it does not reach this sweet point of absolute pain in which there are some films. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the general plot is that the sun is going to release a huge solar flare towards the earth that will essentially destroy it. In order to counteract such a threat, humanity has assembled a spaceship and a crew whose task is to launch an antimatter bomb (which it describes as the "largest explosive in history") into the sun, which through some intricate sci-fi logic will cause the flare to shoot at a different angle , leaving the land unharmed. <br /> <br /> It does not matter that what I just described sounds like a bad episode of the original Star Trek. Even with team casts (Charlton Heston, Peter Boyle and Jack Palance), Solar Crisis barely copes with the level of mediocrity, thanks to the storyline that begins straight and yet becomes increasingly nonsense when time is worn. <br /> <br /> The crowning achievement of this film is the addition of a villain (played by Boyle), who insists on sabotaging the mission. Thanks to the means that will never be explained, he sends the evil servant with embarrassingly bad haircut to perform some vague electronic mind control over the genetically modified scientist of the space crew, played by the woman leading Annabel Schofield. Why is sabotaging the mission? Because, according to his croaky point of view, he believes that the flame will not happen, and that when it does not happen, it will become fabulously rich because it has dug its evil talons in the stock market. As a result, you have a villain with the most absurdly stupid motivation you can imagine. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film becomes extremely intricate and develops very slowly, with time using characters that have only vague or useless short roles in the story. I could sit here and explain exactly what is happening to show the scriptwriter's inability to make a conspiracy that actually clicks or attracts your attention, but I'm sitting here writing this review on Microsoft Word and I know it would take three pages, and I managed I just want to lose your interest. But on the other hand, you would probably see the same effect while watching the movie. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film is miserably bogged down because of the extremely poor dialogue. Imagine that everything that happened on the Star Trek Enterprise was that the characters spat out science fiction jargon. Yes, I know they are already doing it, but imagine that it's EVERYTHING they did and that they used this jargon to create vague and almost meaningless scenes that do not evoke excitement, tension or interest in the viewer. > <br /> This is best illustrated by the moment the character in the Zero-G environment screws the bolt back into the metal box before he starts crying in pain for a few minutes before suddenly exploding. The script previously refers to a character who risks an explosion, but he did not bother to give any solid answer to the question why this is happening, or why he can not escape. In general, you have an unpleasant chasm between the bizarre and the funny. <br /> <br /> Then we have a few scenes in which dramatic accumulation leads to nothing. Jack Palance's performance is wasted on a character who only serves to guide the boy (do not ask) in the desert before being cheated and killed by several suits. On his deathbed, Palance finally tells our hero, the hero, his name (while wearing a terrible bruised make-up that makes him look like someone has put a balloon under his eyeball), which he had previously said nothing about. Colonel Travis J. Richards. The boy repeats it calmly after the expiration, giving viewers the impression that the name has some meaning later in the film. Perhaps the gray-haired Admiral Charlton Heston knows him, and the conspiracy will move forward as his name repeats itself. Something. Everything. <br /> <br /> No. Excuse me. Any hopes that you have will be cut short when this moment is just another of many pathetic unsuccessful attempts to create a drama for a figure so flat and hacked that it will always remain a stain on Palance's career, just like the rest of the cast is similar massacred. <br /> <br /> Completing the film is a painfully sudden ending in which Schofield pilotes a bomb in the center of the sun, trying to redeem his actions under the influence of the villain, culmination which contains another well-made sequence of visual effects in the film, which, even for clearly sophisticated care, it always makes the film look the same as it really is. The saddest part of the film is, of course, a big budget, tragically wasted on the death of the script and cast behind Boyle, Heston and Palance, who manage to nail the coffin with pure action. <br /> <br /> Class: D-
