I've rented End Game, I've never heard of it, but I like political thrillers, so I thought I'd give him a chance. After researching the film, I discovered that it was initially intended for theatrical distribution, but instead went on a DVD. After watching this, I think "nothing strange". The film is shocking in its non-obviousness. The story and characters are cursory. I realized he was halfway, but the end was a curve ball. I must say that I did not expect it to end as it happened, but that does not make sense. A more predictable ending would be better than one that is so bad. Perhaps the creators of the film saw how predictable the film is, so they decided to take a look - even the one that made the movie even worse. <br /> <br /> Stay away. I want $ 5.98 and my 107 minutes.
