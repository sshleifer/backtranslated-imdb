***** THIS REVIEW CAN HAVE SPOILERS - but this determination would be negligible in such a classic and well-known history ***** <br /> <br /> CINDERELLA's story is my favorite story. The world will never have enough of this wonderful story. <br /> <br /> The problem is that everyone wants to tell their own version of the story. This can not work if the story goes away or tries to throw some interesting ideas along with magical photography and delicious production projects with poor direction and editing. <br /> <br /> This story about Cinderella is more like an ugly duckling that never hatch or rather never transforms into a swan. <br /> <br /> The whole value of the production you can buy with money can not buy a good movie time and dramatic development - or good acting. <br /> <br /> Cinderella's entrance on the ball was so badly made, there was no drama of anticipation or excitement about discovering. <br /> <br /> Writing also made me very nervous. The Charming Prince was the most undesirable memory. Why would a girl want to marry a vulgar, self-absorbed prince who does not like women? <br /> <br /> Turner in the role of Stepmother was an embarrassingly painful show, which showed that the one-liner was more than the acting nuances. <br /> <br /> Even a part of Cinderella was not very interested or sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Perhaps only one sentence will describe this attempt: so cheap "90s, <br /> <br /> What needs to be mentioned and replaced in a shameful excess, is a glorious photo, dull work and production project. It was a pleasure to see landscapes, sets and settings as the story progressed. <br /> <br /> For some narratives about Cinderella, go to two jewels: <br /> <br /> 1) Musical Cinderella Rodgers and Hammerstein from Lesley Ann Warren. Even with the obvious stage design of televisions - sets from the 1960s, this is the best version on celluloid - no bar. All stars try to provide the best entertainment. Addictive, engaging and unforgettable writing and music. This is classic. <br /> <br /> 2) Ever After - this jewel Drew Barrymore keeps a historical perspective, changes the story, but not enough to derail the effective development of the most important elements of this classic story. Characters of directors and all supporting roles were written intelligently and worked well.
