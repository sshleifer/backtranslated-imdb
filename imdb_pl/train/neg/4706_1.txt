That's right, you heard that this movie is a stunning ABOMINATION. First of all, the hell band that will go to see or listen to the band "THE NAKED BROTHERS BAND"?!?! The name is not only scary, but musicians can not even play! Also the singer sounds more girly than Geddy Lee, and even more his voice is horrible! Not only are they terrible musicians, but they are terrible actors. Run by a poor director and a thin storyline, it must be the stupidest movie in history. I would like this site to allow you to use the voice of ZERO OR BELOW of 10, because the application of this 1 / 10th dirt is too generous. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure you can call it a comedy movie. If you're looking for a comedy with music, go to "Weird Al" Yankovic because it does so much better than these unreasonable teens.
