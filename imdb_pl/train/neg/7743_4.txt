This movie was one of the worst I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> It's a combination of a police drama and a comedy about two Hollywood detectives Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett investigating the shooting at the hip hop club. <br /> <br /> The plot is made up and there are far too many problems. Ford is on the real estate side (Martin Landau is one of his clients), Hartnett runs a yoga school in which he deals with chicks in his free time, both are investigated by Internal Affairs, Ford is screwing in a former girl (Lena Olin) of IA investigating officer, and she is a medium that has a radio program, the man who killed in the club is a dirty ex-cop who shot Hartnett's father many years ago. <br /> <br /> Throwing in mandatory car chases and a few bad trials of humor, and this is the heart of this turkey.
