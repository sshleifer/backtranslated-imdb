In the field of Science Fiction, two specific topics constantly arouse interest, were initially explored in the literature of the era in front of the cinema, and have since been regularly reviewed by filmmakers and writers, with varying degrees of success. The first theme, devoted to travel in time, aroused the invariable fascination for both film fans and the written word, recently on the screen with the next version of the classic H.G. Wells, "Time Machine". The second topic, which manages to keep the audience in captivity, is invisibility, which evokes imagination with seemingly endless and countless possibilities. Also this theme has again become the basis of the film adapted from another classic by HG Wells, "The Invisible Man", which is directed here by "Hollow Man" directed by Paul Verhoeven, with the participation of Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue. <br /> <br /> Sebastian Caine (Bacon) and his colleagues have been conducting experiments for the US government for some time, exploring the possibility and practicality of invisibility, which they finally achieved in the number of primates on which they tested their method. In fact, they went to the point where invisibility was ensured; their only problem is now to restore the theme to the original "visual" state of being. The problem, however, is that after a careful effort and too many hours in the laboratory, Cain has solved - or at least thinks so. And when the application of his theory to the topic live is successful, he decides to present the results to the board, thus trying to maintain the financing necessary to continue the project. <br /> <br /> However, at the last moment Caine fears, fearing that control over the project will be taken away from him before they can go to the next level - testing the man. And he takes it upon himself to become the subject, providing himself with the help of his research team, telling them that they have received the council's consent to do so. But something goes wrong and Cain is trapped in his cloak of invisibility; and because he and his team are trying to find a solution to his serious dilemma before it's too late, it all has a negative effect on Caine's mind. And suddenly, his fear of losing funds and control becomes irrelevant because he is facing the imminent danger of losing much more. Now is a very real chance that he can lose everything - including himself. <br /> <br /> Verhoeven has created a movie that is initially exciting and even stimulating to think; sets a good pace and uses F / X at its disposal to get a great effect, although it tends to allow for striking visual effects to overwhelm the character's development. Anyone who is familiar with the "Invisible Man," or actually anyone who can logically follow the development of the story, will know early that Caine is not meant for happier times. Still, Verhoeven has a style of storytelling that will surely attract attention and engage the public. It seems, however, that it aims to culminate, and on the way it abandons all the nuances that made his movie so far successful, deciding on the last sequence, which is nothing but mindless blood and gore fest, which betrays the audience and everything what he previously worked in the film. Instead of seeking an intelligent solution for Kain's suffering and using some ingenuity and imagination to bring the movie to an inevitable conclusion, Verhoeven follows a low path and although it can succeed on a purely internal level, any meaning that could be gained from this story dissolves like a lot of ashes in the wind, along with everything that would make this film unforgettable. It's a pity, because Verhoeven has it at a higher level than most of what is offered in this genre, and allows it to unnecessarily sink at a much lower level. <br /> <br /> Kevin Bacon is good at creating a character that is reliable, even on a surface that perfectly serves Verhoeven's goals. Bacon's image is not very deep, but has more in common with the director's plan than with his own acting abilities. Verhoeven simply does not allow Bacon to develop Cain to any extent; the character is above all a vessel around which Verhoeven can build his story, and works in this respect. The film would be better served if Verhoeven and Bacon collaborated closely, at least developing a bond between Caine and the audience, which would cause the emotional involvement of some viewer, something that would attract them a bit, instead of leaving them at the gate, as it was, as ordinary observers extravagant F / X. <br /> <br /> Elisabeth Shue is doing well in the role of Linda McKay, willing partner of Kain in a sick fated experiment, but it's basically a thankless part that offers a little challenge, especially for the Shue caliber actor. The same can be said about Kim Dickensie (so wonderful in the 2001 movie "Things Behind the Sun"). Her character, Sarah Kennedy, does little more than support action and F / X. Both actors are capable of much more and deserve better than what they have to do here. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Josh Brolin (Matthew), Greg Grunberg (Carter), Joey Slotnick (Frank), Mary Randle (Janice) and William Devane (Dr. Kramer). Playful to some extent, and even successful at a certain (low) level, "Hollow Man" is one of those movies that leave you thinking. Just like annual fireworks, they'll give you a momentary emotion, but after a while they'll start mixing with all the others you've seen without special mention. It's a pity, because considering the talent and skills of those involved in the project, there could have been much more. I rate this 4/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
