If you read my review of "Dinoshark" SyFy, you know that I can appreciate the low-budget rag that these TV films can provide. They are stupid ... they are stupid ... but they are still pretty cool in "so bad, good". So, still feeling guilty for liking (and recommending) undeniably the "Dinoshark" hokey, I sat down to watch "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy", the original SIF movie about a half-human, half-hammer monster terrorizing the people on the island. With the recipe for the fire of SyFy Channel to create the features of the B movie creatures and the cast including William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo, how could it go wrong? Well, to my surprise, in fact he longs for a sign ... not too much, but enough not to recommend it. Why? Well, first of all, his titular monster, a terrifying hammer-and-human hybrid, takes the back seat to a band of fake military bandits who really become the main villain of the movie. Although the hammer accumulates the number of the body, he (or whatever you call it) only arrives just before someone gets absorbed and immediately after him. The rest of the movie is a filler that penetrates our heroes against the aforementioned soldiers. For me, it's not as convincing as watching a walking hammer eat people! <br /> <br /> Read the full review on my blog: www.horrormoviejournal.blogspot.com
