This beautifully filmed and written episode script has been suspended for two reasons. 1) Perhaps the morality of the 1950s was saying, but no man left alone on the asteroid for many years would react so hysterical negativity to the gift of a female android. 2) It was not an android at all, but a woman, beautiful Jean Marsh. <br /> <br /> The popularity of the sex dolls industry in the coming decades could have traced the beginning of this episode if I did it correctly. In fact, as I say, the modernization of sexual bots is in the news. <br /> <br /> Robots were not new in movies and on television when this episode was created, so they could at least have it as one. Her fleshiness would then add a terrifying element. Instead, it becomes a nice little love story about two people on a distant star. <br /> <br /> The Twilight Zone has always stretched imagination and credulity. Usually, nobody cared about that. But this episode seemed to be hindered by Calvinistic morality, avoiding what would mean masturbation with the machine or even carelessness.
