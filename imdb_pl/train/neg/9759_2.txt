I rarely write a review on this site, but this film is very well deserved because of how poorly it was created and how biased its product was. <br /> <br /> I felt a clear attempt by some filmmakers to show the Palestinian family as a prostitute and unworthy of trust. We hear how they discuss the sadness they feel in oppression, and yet the film is shot and arranged in such a way that we think that the politically oppressed population is the Jewish population of Israel. We do not see any evidence that would correspond to the position of a Palestinian teenager. We only hear from other Palestinians in prison. I understand that there are limitations, but the political nature of the restrictions is to prevent peace. <br /> <br /> I left the movie, that the mother of the victim was selfish in mourning and completely closed because of her fence side, so to speak. She still did not want to see the pain of the bomber's parents, and her angry and closed words made the last meeting slip out of control. In my opinion, it is more realistic to perceive Israel's way of thinking as the source of the problem; he ignored requests for understanding and freedom, ignored requests for recognition for the process in which the Jewish population acquired the land. <br /> <br /> I gave it two because of my mother's selfish weaknesses that would normally be admirable in a documentary, but in the light of the lack of impartiality, everything seems to be exploitative. Also due to bad changes, lack of background in reality, and finally lack of proper representation of the Palestinian side. Ultimately, this is a bad document and a bad movie. I acknowledge that this is partly the result of the political situation, but I am obliged to note the flaws in the direction, regardless of the moving heart and sad topic.
