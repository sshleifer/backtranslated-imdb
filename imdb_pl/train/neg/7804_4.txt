THE TEMP (1993) did not take care of the theater, but there is no question of direct video rip off anyway! Ellen Bradford (Mel Harris) is a new woman at Millennium Investments, a large-scale brokerage company that begins to receive helpful tips from Deidre (Sheila Kelley), a widely open secretary. Deidre turns out to be the girl of an ambitious daddy who will not stop at anything to move up the corporate ladder, including bribing the best broker whom he can not stand and murder anyone who stands on her wrong side. He digs up skeletons in Ellen's closet, tries to cause problems with his husband (Barry Bostwick), kills her, makes her responsible, kidnaps her daughter and tries to force her to misdirect the company. <br /> <br /> Harris and Kelley deliver competent performances, supporting cast is fine and is quite well connected, but it does not fully compensate for the scenario that travels along the damaged path and offers a few surprises.
