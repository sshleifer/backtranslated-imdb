If you want to check out a good movie by Jason Scott Lee, I recommend the following: <br /> <br /> Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story <br /> <br /> Rapa Nui <br /> <br /> "Timecop 2: The Berlin Decision "is a terrible movie. Terrible production values. Awful acting. A horrible script. I would not recommend watching this movie by someone who seriously believes that such tripe is good entertainment or develops Asian American consciousness in Hollywood (this movie does not do it either.). <br /> <br /> at least let's say that this movie is a bearable entertainment on a rainy day if you come across it while surfing the canals. If you're curious, maybe Netflix rental, but this movie is definitely not forever. <br /> <br /> If you are one of the few people who watched the movie as a way to raise awareness of the Asian movie and went away disappointed, so I recommend the following videos for personal viewing. These are well-written films with high production values, in which there is a talented cast of Asian actors: <br /> <br /> Better Luck Tomorrow <br /> <br /> Mulan
