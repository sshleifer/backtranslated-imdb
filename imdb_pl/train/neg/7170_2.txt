Yikes did this movie blow. The characters were weak, the story was weaker. I thought it could not be so bad because it has Christopher Walken, oops. He had to do it because he was bored and needed money. The characters were supposed to be Irish, but no one had an Irish accent. I'm desperately trying to find something nice about it, I can not, except that Walken did a great job with a wooden character. Find something to read or watch the discovery, never see this movie.
