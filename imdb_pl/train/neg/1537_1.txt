A really bad shot on the movie "film" made by not one, not two, but three amateur video creators. <br /> <br /> If you're going to make a bad horror, at least take some blood, gore and nudity. There is a certain amount of blood supplied by latex props from the arm purchased at the Halloween store. There are lesbians and whores, but there is no nudity or sex. Lesbians spend a lot of time in bed, but they just talk. <br /> <br /> It seems that there are no editing effects - it fades, wipes, etc. Every once in a while some black appears to separate the scenes. > <br /> Horrible music of bad heavy metal bands, whose websites occupy most of the final credits. Werewolves are represented by rubber masks that are attached only to the faces of the "actors". They did not even bother putting on the neck, arms or wrists for brown make-up. <br /> <br /> I guarantee that a 10-year-old with a video camera can create a better movie. Rent or watch this movie, except for how not to make a low-budget movie.
