When someone modifies a classic movie, the remake is always unfavorable compared to the original. There is also a chance that the remake is so radically different that it is too foreign to the public. <br /> <br /> Well, the television version of "Double Damage" from 1973. It has almost identical scenes and dialogues as the original from 1944. The main difference is that the remake does not seem to have any energy. Fred MacMurray was a great insurance agent, Walter Neff, in the original; Richard Crenna seems weary and tired of the world. Edward G. Robinson brought great maniacal energy to his role as MacMurray's boss, Barton Keys; Lee J. Cobb, a great actor, seems almost bored with the proceedings. Samantha Eggar is wrong, like Phyllis Dietrichson; while Barbara Stanwyck was simply great in this nefarious role, Eggar is too kind and raised and seems to be out of place. <br /> <br /> Robert Webber, in the old role of Richard Gaines as the head of Robinson Norton and John Fiedler taking the role of Porter Hall as a key witness, bring some life to the film. In particular, Webber plays the role of Norton in the context of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> However, after the beginning of the film, the whole thing simply lies there, without life and electricity. This is one movie that should never have been reworked.
