It was a popular movie probably because of humor, fast-moving story, weaker character that closes all the speakers, etc. It's funny that you probably can not make a movie with that title if someone replaces someone but "white" because anything else will be considered racist by PC police. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Woody Harrleson as a white guy who turns out to be just as good, if not better than any of the black basketball players, is interesting, just like his main counterpart Wesley Snipes. <br /> <br /> Snipes had many funny, broken lines that provided a lot of humor. The bad part of the movie - which does not bother many people - is extreme vulgarity and the dislike of all characters. This includes Woody's girlfriend, played by Rosie Perez. There are not really clean, nice people in this film. For this reason, I can honestly recommend a movie, at least not to friends or those who offend profanity
