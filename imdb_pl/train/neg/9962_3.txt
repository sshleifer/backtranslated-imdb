"Respect for Acting" Uty Hagen is a standard textbook in many theater courses. In the book, Hagen presents two fundamentally different approaches to developing characters as an actor: a presentation approach and a representative approach. In the presentation approach, the actor concentrates on realizing the hero as honestly as possible, introducing emotional elements from the actor's own life. In the Representative approach, the actor tries to present the effect of emotions, through a high degree of motion and sound control. <br /> <br /> A representative approach to acting was still in fashion when Hamlet was born. The British theater has a long history of this style of play, and Olivier can be considered the ultimate king of the official school. <br /> <br /> Time was not kind to this acting school or for this movie. Almost every acting actor uses a presentation approach. Olivier's modern eye is very expressive, stylized for delivery, stiff and stiff. Instead of creating an inwardly conflicted Hamlet, Olivier made of a melancholy Dane declaring himself an important megaphone - an actor's style that would do well with larger London theaters, but is too starchy to run a modern Hamlet. <br /> <br /> And this movie creaks today awkwardly. Olivier's tendency to e-mailing makes some of Hamlet's lines involuntarily amusing: "Instead, you have to ask yourself a question and get the cleanliness that can give him ... Smoothness!" Instead of crying at a meeting with his father's spirit (how could to do every right actor), the bright light filling Olivier's students gives us such an impression. <br /> <br /> Eileen Herlie is the only other actor in this Hamlet who puts a good essay at the Queen despite the painfully obvious age differences (he was 41 years old, she was 26 years old). The other actors in this film have no chance of doing anything else about the meaning, given Olivier's tendency to be willing to behave! The camera! on him! at all! times! <br /> <br /> Sixty years later you feel the uncertainty of Shakespeare's stage actor who lacked confidence to introduce the fragile, flawed Hamlet, and instead decided to play something like an Elizabethan megaphone. The final analysis: "I would have a guy who would be beaten for what the Gradient does; this is Herod: Herod: pray, avoid him. "
