I've read all of Love Come Softly's books. Knowing well that movies can not use all aspects of the book, but generally have at least the main point of the book. I was very disappointed with this film. All they have in this film, which is in the book, is the fact that Missy's father visits (although both parents come in the book). That's all. The plot was so twisted and far-reaching and so sad, from this book, that I just could not enjoy it. Even if I did not read the book, it was too sad. I know that Pioneer's life was hard, but the whole movie was lower. The assessment concerns the same orientation of a family movie that makes them great.
