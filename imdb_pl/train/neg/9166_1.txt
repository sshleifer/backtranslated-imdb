Recherche is a good word to describe this movie. <br /> <br /> Let's say that every movie has a selling point, a trick. Transformers' tricks are amazing effects, as well as the nostalgia of the boys from the fans. Insomnia in the Seattle trick is situational in their marker: "And if someone you've never met, someone you've never seen, someone you never knew, was the only person for you?" Many romances are largely based on these tricks, and some on the drawing of big names. Leap Years uses both Irish folklore as a circumstance and well-known names in the country. <br /> <br /> So now, when the audience is in the cinema, in addition to all the usual elements of character, conflict or consequences, crisis, determination and resolution, they also expect a stimulating dialogue, more absorbing situations as a result of leap years, interesting subdivisions and be maybe to some extent a good twist in the middle or towards the end a story that favors the circumstances of the character. <br /> <br /> Jean Yeo is trying not to achieve it. If they tried, their goal was apparently on the second pitch, at the second stadium, at the other end of the planet. She and her writer, Alain Layrac, were completely unable to provide a stimulating dialogue. Most of the lines were invented. It looks like they have a bag filled with lines that they would like to use in their movie: "Okay, these are the lines and quotes I've heard or read from the movies I've seen or the books I've read before and they all sound good to me. If they sound good to me, they will sound good to the audience, that's why all I have to do is put them together. The result is cleansing. I can not say that the lines were unnecessary and have nothing to do with the plot or the plot, but they seem to jump out of nowhere, catching you stunned by these quotes. <br /> <br /> On a personal level, I know people who quote quotes based on most situations in our dialog, trying to make them meaningful to themselves, while nodding. I'm not leaving them anymore because the urge to hit them is overwhelming. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the portrayed characters are stupid and one-dimensional. With the exception of unnatural dialogue, which implies their motivation (necessary to keep the plot), there was no conviction in them. I have no idea who they are. They are all simple, gushing lines from the female magazine's advice column. <br /> <br /> The trick in leap years is not enough to tell a story because the circumstances are too shallow. On the other hand, there are fewer films, but they came out better than it does not. They did it with my first and second point. What's more, partial threads are irrelevant (this is not bad for movies) and thin (bad). <br /> <br /> Jean Yeo and the producers are trying to dump the terrible plot with fanciful locations and passive photography. This is because they probably understand that it is possible and easier to get approval from some viewers than others because of the good use of cinematography, soundtrack and location of filming. These inexperienced viewers. <br /> <br /> It's not even a movie that's so bad it's good. It's just bad. Do not watch this.
