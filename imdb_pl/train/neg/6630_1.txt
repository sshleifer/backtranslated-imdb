This so-called remake is terrible. I went to see it tonight ... on the first day because the expectation and hum was too hard for me. But in the first half hour we knew it was a disaster. Not only does it not match the noise created, it also offends the original hit. The script had gaps, the edition was untidy several times. Mohanlal, who is a great actor, did a good job. Amitabh was okay ... the director wanted to illustrate how bad his character is, but he went a bit overboard, which made him strong. Ajay, who is particularly fit in this type of role, was also disappointed. We can not even start talking about a new Prashant guy ... it would not be proud to start a career with something like that. Rajpal Yadav, who was thrown into a few laughter, could not even smile because of his strong humor and penetrating voice. Nisha Kothari has proven that she is one of the worst actresses we have today. In conclusion, RGV, which I considered to be one of the most talented and talented directors of India, failed. He took on such a great challenge and responsibility to convert what is known as Hindi's best film in history and made a mess of it.
