Please, feel my mood, if you will, for a moment when I read to you the back of the ALLEY CAT VHS box. He says that: <br /> <br /> In this part of the city every street is a dead end - on every corner to buy something - in each alley different way to death - To survive, you have to be the best - just like Alley Cat. Alley Cat, that lady is the owner of the night. In the streets where even predators become victims, they know how to survive. Come over and you're lucky. Alley Cat- This animal is aroused. <br /> <br /> Is not this one of the most pathetic jams you've ever heard in your life? Whoever wrote it must be crazy if he thought that such a horrible description could tempt us to watch the movie. Unfortunately, however, no matter who was a face-less person and was responsible for this tragic use of English, he did his job too well .. the film contained in a small plastic case is just as bad as it seems, and then a bit. <br /> <br /> Karin Mani plays the title role, and the script basically tells her in every scene: a) Pout like a goldfish b) Kick male butt or c) Show off her feminine "attributes". No complaints about the latter, but when it comes to the other two ... let's say that she is not very much an actress and even less convincing as a martial arts expert. But even Meryl Streep with the body of Cynthia Rothrock (what a horrifying thought) would not be able to save this movie. Developing the plot is boring and unbelievable, because we get one ineffectively directed sequence of fighting, stopping only for hysterical shenanigans√≥w court and from time to time calling the gags love scene with an interesting name Robert Torti. Camera work also has a similar path of shame because too many unnecessary close ups and continuity errors abound. <br /> <br /> I think it really sums up the scum from the movie, where our heroine is sexually assaulted and testifies in front of a corrupt judge, while her rich kid rapes her from the box. Not only does he not get mad, despite the overwhelming evidence against him, but she herself is imprisoned for daring to protest against his verdict against his Honor. Behind the bars he has a group shower, a lesbian depression, a couple of fights with cats and a nice, sweaty volleyball game before he is released on bail to continue the fight. This ten-minute section has nothing to do with the rest of the movie, and the scenario stops to embrace it. I can only imagine that the producers wanted to add a bit more T & A to the mix and invented this unnecessary sub-thread as a means to achieve this. <br /> <br /> Which kinds of people are asking for a question about whether it's an exploitation movie or a serious drama? My reaction to it is not ... it's not dingy enough to appeal to fans of the cinema in the style of Troma, and it certainly does not mean that the evaluation is exploring the struggle of one woman with the system ... just because it's it's so scary. So who on earth would like to see it? Sleepwalkers, probably ... or IMDb reviewers who stay until 15 o'clock and watch the old garbage on the box trying to get to sleep. Unfortunately, with this occasional defeat, and the horrors will remain with me for some time. Do not make the same mistake as me. You have hot milk or something like that. 1/10
