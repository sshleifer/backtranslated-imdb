About halfway through, I realized that I do not care about these characters at all; however, I saw a little more anyway. Unfortunately, I came back the next day and finished. I should not care. <br /> <br /> If you know * something * about the movie before, you know that the main character will be a person who survived the plane crash - and the title gives you a pretty good idea of ​​what will happen later - will call and call people ! It was almost as bad as "Snakes on a Plane" (another movie about a plane crash). <br /> <br /> I realize that this is an old movie, and the style of the game in those days was much less naturalistic than today. But even by these standards, the action was embarrassing. They were not figures, they were stereotypes. I suspect that this movie was, more than anything, a try by Bette Davis to help her husband's career (Gary Merrill). But unsuccessfully - I saw oaks showing more authentic emotions than he did. <br /> <br /> Davis played a happy cripple (ie Role of non-glamor) probably looked like an annoyed and bold career move. There was no. It was just boring. She was a kind of tiny Tim in the film, making Trask (the character of Merrill) see the truth about love and forgiveness (although she was less attractive than Tiny Tim), quietly separating the wisdom about life and relationships without a trace that her beloved husband had just died. <br /> <br /> The last scene in which Trask calls his wife back to Iowa to be reconciled, was so overwhelmed and overstated at both ends of the telephone line that I almost cringed. I had to remind myself that these people really got paid for what they were doing in this movie. <br /> <br /> I noticed that many people liked this movie. If you think it's uplifting, that's great. But to be honest, I just found it wrong. There are many old movies from the Golden Hollywood Age that were much better written and worked.
