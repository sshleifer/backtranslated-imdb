In this whole movie there is not a bit of entertainment. In this film there is not one terrifying, funny or even interesting scene. It's advertised as a horror movie, and then it's called comedy. He does not even try humor. He does not try to be frightening either. <br /> <br /> In order not to be bored with this movie, you would have to be one of the easiest people in the world. If you like this movie, even SMALL BIT, then you have no standard for what you watch. I have a very hard time trying to understand what the filmmakers tried to achieve thanks to this. It is not funny, scary, shocking or intriguing. Was it supposed to be a drama? Because it was not dramatic either. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and do not watch this movie. Life is too valuable to waste 90 minutes watching this.
