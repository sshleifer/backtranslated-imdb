I will say so much - this director is entirely associated with RAW images ... things that most of us are not ready to confront. Images of sex, suicide, murder and people "relaxing" constantly bombard the viewer, which makes me wonder if the director tried to convey the concept of release or release. Although I do not think I can ever see this movie, I will say that the director has a good eye. There were some really cool shots and "moments of pictures" (fans, wire fish in the hair) in the film, but the story left me, needing more (strictly because we were asking ourselves "what the hell did we just see?"). <br /> <br /> Note: If you have a tendency to easily vomit or vomit ... do not watch this movie.
