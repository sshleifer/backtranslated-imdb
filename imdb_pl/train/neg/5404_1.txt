Do you ever want to kill an hour or two doing homework and watching a movie so bad that it escapes your mind? Well, renting movies in one weekend, I see box art for this movie and see T-Rex. Knowing perfectly that the dinosaur on the pack was T-Rex from Jurassic Park, I knew I had to rent it just because I was in the mood for a bad movie. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed at least. <br /> <br /> Crazy scientists, secret formulas, a company more caring about their property and shareholders than life, and of course a large, poorly animated T-Rex puppet. Was it me, our film, scenes clearly connected with other films? Not to mention that hungry Rex is never happy ... never. The way he is hungry is beyond me because he really has no throat (Really, if you look down his mouth when he roars, he's solid ... like a toy or something). Now, from time to time, I like to watch incredibly bad B movies because it reminds me of how much better the blockbuster movies are. This one was funny. I'm not even sure if it was going to be a thriller or a comedy because there are scenes where you should make no mistake, you'll laugh. <br /> <br /> Do I blame the film's budget ... yes, but acting did not help either. OK, Tony Todd was pretty good for some female roles ... when you cry, you should not go out? Meh, I will not be angry at this film, I knew what I was getting into, and if you're looking for a bad movie to watch with your friends, here's what I recommend: Watch this movie, then immediately view the Jurassic Park and then Lost World back. You will write to Mr. Spielberg, thank you letters the next day.
