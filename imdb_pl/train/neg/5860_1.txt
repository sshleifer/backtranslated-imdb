It is difficult to accurately express the validity of the horrors of this film. A completely new vocabulary will have to be invented to describe the total absence of anything that would even be recognized as "humor" and even "entertainment" in the "Rabbit Test". As a small contribution to this future effort, I would like to suggest this word: <br /> <br /> "Hubiriffic" (adj.) A combination of "hubristic" and "terrific"; used to describe overly ambitious debates, such as the "Rabbit Test" movie. <br /> <br /> Joan Rivers and producer "Hollywood Squares" Jay Redack has seriously exceeded his modest abilities to play this 82-minute festival of misery. I'm trying to connect the plane! comedy style with a moldy collection of gags (Note to Joan: German doctors were not funny from Vaudeville) torn from the graves at Catskills - that's bad enough. But the complication of this film crime is the River's style of director, which can best be described as "ugly", and the cast of once-and-future-minded people who are so eager to please pat even the weakest rejecting gags. <br /> <br /> Adrift in the Sargasso Sea is the unfortunate Billy Crystal in his debut film role as the unfortunate hero of the movie Lionel. Watching Crystal in this picture is like watching a blind walk through a minefield; in the end, spherical reflexes become semi-permanent state when a cheap joke after cheesy joking awakens in his face. <br /> <br /> I can only speculate on an audience that can really like the Rabbit Test. Probably the candidates are cabbages, mollusks and slightly delayed lizards. But for self-aware, thinking people - I would be enthusiastic to pour bleach into your eyes before recommending the "Rabbit Test".
