I admit that I liked the first one and I really could not wait to continue. <br /> <br /> I'm disappointed. Of course, the special effects were amazing technically - but they were not reliable. It looked more like a cartoon. All right, I admit I like 80% of the chase scene - but fight with all Mr. Smiths? It was too obvious animated. <br /> <br /> I can accept everything. I can not agree that parts without shares were nonsense. Each time Morpheus opened his mouth, I knew that I was taking part in a speech which lasted forever and meant nothing. <br /> <br /> I was also disappointed with the small story that existed. This film told us that in the first movie there was no truth (except for the matrix). This movie was a bit like watching the DALLAS episode, where you find out that the whole previous season was a dream. <br /> <br /> Ugh! I want to recover my $ 7.00!
