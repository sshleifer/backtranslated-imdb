The nutcracker has always been a bit of a problematic ballet. It does not look much like the original story of ETA Hoffman on which it is based. <br /> <br /> In the ballet the story is essentially completed in the second half, when Clara (or Marie in this version) travels to the Kingdom of Sweets to watch a series of character dances. <br /> <br /> There is an infinite variety of stage productions that reinterpret history in innumerable ways (not always successfully) to compensate for the poor ballet libretto. <br /> <br /> The Balanchine version has no sense of drama or history at all (despite the fact that there is a lot of drama and mystery in the wonderful music of Tchaikovsky's first performance). The result is a completely forgotten first half of the Christmas event, where almost nothing happens, and even the dance (the little one that is) is not particularly memorable. <br /> <br /> Excessive action of the pantomime, especially Drosselmeier, who may look passable on the stage, looks just stupidly shot on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is nothing better when we reach the Kingdom of Sweets (Act II on the stage version). Although there are a few choreographic touches, most choreography is bland and uninspiring. Certainly not the Balanchine yearbook. <br /> <br /> Balanchine is widely regarded as a master of abstract dance, but I have always felt that he was less effective as the creator of narrative ballets. Watching this film version of his production of The Nutcracker's stage production only confirmed this view.
