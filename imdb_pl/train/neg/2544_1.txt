Gung Ho was a good idea, but much must be done for Americans to understand the dynamics of American jobs and foreign competition. In this movie, the main character Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) goes to Japan and persuades a Japanese car company to America and help his dying city Pennslyvania. Two things come to you. First of all, why does a Japanese company come to America to produce cars when they do it, and good? Second, can anyone understand that American companies of all kinds are going to third world countries to let their products escape US labor costs? This makes the premise that the number one car manufacturer in the world would go to one of the best competitors (outside of Germany) and put the factory there as unrealistic. Keaton was still in comedy mode at the time. But he gives credible results, just as he can prove that he can go from comedy to drama in a few seconds and still not be ashamed, but director Ron Howard can not stop it from becoming a TV movie that ends because they have to give unbelievable story of a happy end to the policy and problems of Japanese and American relations that are not immune. Gung Ho has Happy Days, and Laverne and Shirley feel it when the producers of both TV programs made a movie, and then they made a television version of the movie, which gives the film its "light character". The Japanese manager loves his American workers and feel that he and other Japanese can learn from the Americans. He is Saito's # 2 man, who apparently does not like Americans so much, he does not think so. characters from which the Japanese did. It would make the movie more interesting.
