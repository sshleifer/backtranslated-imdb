Well, I saw it in the end. I did not go when it first came out, because, to be honest, I was afraid. I'm afraid of how bad it can be or how disappointing it is. Although not as bad as Menace and better than Clones, he was not particularly memorable or rewarding. <br /> <br /> I was 11 when I saw Star Wars. I still remember sitting in the theater. From the initial crawling to the final credits, it was a movie experience that I will never forget. A timeless story of a bored boy farmer who simply knows that he was destined for more, saving the princess and the Galaxy from the evil threat, while being a mentor by a wise wizard, dishonest pirate and various comical reliefs - everything in space - an attitude setting. <br /> <br /> And not to scold Lucas for using the old formula. It's an old formula because it works. And in his favor he gave him new expressions that made him unique. <br /> <br /> Then the Empire came and history became more than just a fairy tale. Darkness has entered the stage and we have learned one of the great twists and turns of all time. The great scoundrel, Vader, was Luke's father. Wow, nobody has seen it. Of course, I'm not convinced, nor Lucas until it appears in the script. Go back and watch Star Wars again. Knowing what you know now, especially in the light of the first three episodes, see if it truly overlaps. <br /> <br /> Which leads me to the problem I have. Revenge is a funny movie - huge effects, lots of action, some good fight scenes. But the movie is still alive or dying on the story - the story it tells. Oh, for sure a really good game can save a weak story, but a weak story combined with bad acting - a burden that no director can overcome, certainly not as bad as I am forced to realize that George Lucas is (managed lead some of the worst appearances in the career of several outstanding actors - Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, Samuel Jackson). <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS AHEAD ******* * Story. Oh my. Look, he's already hampered by what happened in the first two movies, so it's an unbelievable burden. One too many to overcome. <br /> <br /> First, we have pure background absurdities. We have Anakin found as a child on Tatooine, a product of a virgin, miraculous birth - "chosen". This detail will never be remotely explained. Indeed, the next explanation is Yoda's observation that maybe they were wrong. Oh, good, good. Our mistake. <br /> <br /> Now the same miracle worker turns out to be the creator of C3PO. Hey, what a coincidence. And he will come back to Tatooine and he will never know that he is from there? Wow! What do you think. Testing there an old, willing suspension of disbelief, what, George? In any case, we have this ugly kid, a moody, irritated, groaning young adult who must somehow become one of the greatest villains in film history - the great tragedy of Darth Vador - a good guy who falls from grace, just to Finally, achieve redemption in the end. <br /> <br /> How, pray, is this happening? He has a dream that his wife will die during childbirth. Of course, he lives in a civilization stretched into a star that treats gravity as we treat gasoline, but does it seem like a "dimmer" that he can check the cause for a doctor, maybe this futuristic society can do something about this problem? Why, no, all he can think of is to kill some children, because the evil man at the root of all the evil that they are chasing after two films tells him that he has the secret of immortality. <br /> <br /> Well, of course, yes. <br /> <br /> Sheesh. <br /> <br /> How can Lucas expect us to observe such stupidities and be moved by it? How can anyone expect us to care? Shit, why would anyone want this brat to be saved or redeemed first. I wanted Kenobi to kill him, not because he was angry, but because he was pitifully stupid. <br /> <br /> And by the way, Amidala finally dies. During delivery. Why? Well, they do not know. A doctor who is a droid and himself points to the incredibly high technology that society has developed into, offers only the conclusion "she lost her will to live". Okay, of course he has. Maybe she finally got to her, what's sleeping with her. <br /> <br /> But here we are. We have Kenobi on this topic. He knows about the birth of ≈Åukasz and Leia. He knows who their father is and knows what is happening to them. He also knows the role of R2 and C3PO. And yet, in a few years, when Luke approaches masculinity and comes up with 3PO and R2 (interestingly, the 3PO mind is erased, but not R2 - why ????) stating: "I think these droids belong to you "Kenobi, who knows that the protocol droid was constructed by the one he thought was" chosen "and the student of the emperor himself, and who just built himself on the same planet, says" strange, I do not recall being the owner of a droid. " <br /> <br /> Oh, good sadness. <br /> <br /> Lucas just came up with it. When he introduced Vader as Luke's father, unfortunately the story started to get out of control because I DO NOT KNOW WHAT WAS HISTORY: The plot of episodes 1-3 is simply unintelligible, nothing Palpatine had any rational sense at all, and none of this connects with the story he originally said in Star Wars. <br /> <br /> This is a reflection i looks like it. <br /> <br /> I can not give this fil I'm saying high marks. It reminds me of Triple X. A funny movie to watch, but completely forgotten. Star wars will always be in my memory. Fortunately, this and the previous two will soon disappear.
