I really can not believe that this movie is not the worst in IMDB 250, it is absolutely horrible. When I saw this, I remember that I talked about it in my college class, and two others also saw it. We were all telling other class members not to see it, because it was terrible. Before we finished, some people wanted to see it only because they could not believe that everything was as bad as we said. Do not be like them, just pass it on. I'm sure everyone involved in this movie would prefer you never see them in this movie.
