I saw this movie as a very young girl (I'm 27 now) and it has frightened me for years. I had nightmares about every aspect of this movie from the way it attracted to music (of course) violence. My parents are still arguing over who let me watch it, and both say they will never let me watch such a movie. I think they only say that knowing that I have such strong feelings for it; 0) I am currently reading a book (due to morbid curiosity and the fact that it is a classic) and this is a really great story. However, I do not think it will become a cartoon. Always. Well, maybe today's children will find it quaint, but it has given me nightmares for weeks and weeks, and I still can not see rabbits drawn in a similar way. It gives me a little palpitation every time. Yes, I am a buddy, but I strongly suggest that any parent who wants to show this movie to their children, instead, read a book or watch it to make sure they agree with the content. Not everyone considers it as disturbing as I am, but we are there; 0)
