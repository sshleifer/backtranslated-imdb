A lot of promise and nothing more. Star cast certainly by HK standards, but man is the smelly one. There is no history? All right, the action will catch up like most HK action movies. What? The action is terrible, banal and rare? Until now, the Dragon Dynasty publishing houses are basically excellent and widely regarded as classics in the Asian cinema. This is a plague. They managed to talk to several actors from Infernal Affairs, but they can not bring the chaotic scenario to life. There are dialogue scenes in which two or three lines are spoken with a gap between them and a lack of continuity in what the heroes say. You almost feel that each of them runs an expert monologue and ignores other characters. Michael Biehn is really made of wood? Sammo Hung uses a double stuntman? No way. Yes Yes. Stay away.
