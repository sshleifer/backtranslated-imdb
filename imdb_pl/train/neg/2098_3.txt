I was hoping for some detailed information about the Apollo 11 mission and got some decent material for an interview with Buzz Aldrina Gene Krantz and other people involved in the mission, combined with excessive hyper-prediction of sensational sensation - in the worst tradition of television production. <br /> <br /> If you could cut the voice and change the program spin to a positive test on how people can overcome failure to reach the goal beyond the usual it could be great - but I feel that I've wasted about 45 minutes of my life watching 60 minute program. I want these minutes back.
