I've seen over 1,000 movies and this movie stands out as one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is a pity that they had to associate this rubbish with the song The Angels 1963 "My Boyfriend's Back". If you have to choose between watching this movie and doing dental work, I would suggest a dental job.
