Let me first say that I watched this movie around midnight and there is usually only trash around this hour, but this movie broke the record <br /> <br /> above all the main character is an old, not attractive, scary guy, anyway he gets f * ck all the girls who come to his path, for example he goes to the store, talks to a girl, and then you see them f * ck <br /> <br /> secondly there are lots of sex scenes, in many of them in no nakedness at all, I would not be surprised if one of the characters in the movie said: "put on your clothes quickly so we can f * ck! <br /> <br /> thirdly, this movie should show what sexual addiction can do to a man or a family, this movie only shows a mild, sinister eroticism that makes me wonder why these actors agreed play in such trash
