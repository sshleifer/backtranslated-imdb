Another film Priyadarshan / Vohra threw another film that was seen for TP, not a real desire. The only reason I saw this movie was because there were no regulars in this movie (Akshay Paresh and many others), but needless to say that he had low expectations for the movie. <br /> <br /> I was happy with the cast in general, with the exception of Rajpal Yadav, who once again gets upset without restrictions, but gives off some laughter, but these were standard slapstick non-original jokes, in fact the whole movie is like playing dhol, it means that there is almost no talent for loud noise, or even playing a strange, good rhythm for a short time? These are only those who can move different beats in a pleasant, sequential way, for a long time, who are considered great. <br /> <br /> That takes us to another instrument, Dumroo almost does not require talent, there are no varieties and it can be nice to dance a monkey for a while (hmm sounds like Rajpal Yadav, good analogy), but it is not an instrument, who will entertain you for a long time and even make you dance like Dhol. <br /> <br /> This movie was like dhol and playing dumroo, sometimes Dhol sometimes played dumroo, sometimes both together, but mainly Dumroo played alone, and the monkey danced. And like every 24-year-old, sooner than later I was bored. <br /> <br /> There are good moments in the movie Dhol (good), but after a while all I heard was annoying Dumroo (initially funny, then bearable and annoying), large ordinary parts really ensure that this movie is mainly good for some funny clips on "MERE BHAINS KO ANDA KYUN MARA" (if you have not watched him see in Movies, he comes in the evenings and is really funny). <br /> <br /> This movie had its moments, the actors did a great job, with the exception of Rajpal Yadav (who can act, I saw him in Main Meri Patnia ??) who annoys more than he entertains, I said it many times and I will say it's one more time. I really think that Sharman Joshi and Tushar Kapoor have a great career in their comedies. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes were really funny, such as unsuccessful attempts to impress the girl's father, Zany tries to attack the girl and take it away from each other. <br /> <br /> But when it's over, an unsuccessful attempt to turn the film into something more with a mystery added, it means that when the girl has already appeared, another 45-60 minutes were more and more tortured, the culmination was "SO BAD ITS A REAL GOOD CATEGORY "I mean what they were, wondering if you must have a tense ending, at least try to make it tasty. <br /> <br /> The film is also very predictable, there is no scene that you can not foresee, and you will not fall into laughter here, more like it comes and almost begins to laugh at the gag. <br /> <br /> The film follows a gradual decline throughout the film, except for a strange blow, up or down, and then drops sharply once and down, befriended the girl. <br /> <br /> Most of the really bad scenes are over, one movie is trying to be more than just a mill comedy, many jokes were very outdated and smelly with repetitions, LAST 10-15 WERE ESPECIALLY SEPARATED AND COMPLETELY EXTRACTED THIS FILM. <br /> <br /> I did not find Tanushree Datta, who was quite a mermaid she was supposed to play, and her acting talent is a serious question, especially because of her unattractive look, if you can not be HOT and I can not tell you how much You can survive time. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, this movie was weak, with a constant feminine look and shoddy lighting and camera work. <br /> <br /> The song, with the exception of the title track, was not good either, when the songs played in the second half could feel the collective sigh of the audience. <br /> <br /> In the whole movie, which is ordinary only because of the cast and very low expectations. <br /> <br /> Avoiding this will not be a bad idea. <br /> <br /> And if you want to watch it on TV for free or for a very cheap matin√©e or something is necessary, if you pay the full rate for multiplex, you will feel disappointed. <br /> <br /> - there are lots of old jokes, RAJPAL YADAV, LAST 45 MINUTES AND LAST 15 MINUTES ESPECIALLY, bad technically bad songs. <br /> <br /> +/- s trying to be more than it was, not just a cast (I'm happier), Tanushree Datta. <br /> <br /> + some good scenes in the beginning, the title song, good acting and casting except RY. <br /> <br /> a total of 4.5 / 10 (I try to be objective here, I do not like Rajpal Yadav or Tanushree Datta, and this movie has met my very low expectations, so I give him the benefit of all doubts, the absolute terms this movie was not greater than 4)
