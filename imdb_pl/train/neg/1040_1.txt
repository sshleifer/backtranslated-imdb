I can not believe that this movie received such a high score of 6! It's barely audible and incredibly boring, certainly one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> The episode I and II Star Wars just reminded me of the fact that you are watching the total wreck of a creative train. <br /> <br /> This movie should be avoided at all costs. This is one of those "festival movies" that only the pseudo-intellectuals like because they are so bad that these people think that it makes it "different", that's why it's good. <br /> <br /> Bad movie making is not "different" is just a bad movie.
