I do not recall having to leave the cinema except one. Not only that, but I was with 7 friends and we all wanted to go. Uninteresting plot, figures made of clay, violence without sense. I did not care when good people died; I did not care when the villains got it. Fantasy and magic lay on a thick liver pudding and there was no consistency. In short, great entertainment if you spend eternity in hell.
