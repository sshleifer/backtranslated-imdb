It's a very bad movie. The plot is sentimental mush. I suppose production values ​​are fine, decent photography, discreet direction, and so on. Mark Hamill was terrible. I never cared for him, and this movie confirms this perception. No wonder he never had a career outside of Star Wars films. I will just say "Buh-bye, Mark" when it falls into deserved forgetfulness. On the other hand, a very young Annie Potts stole the program. She showed charm, beauty and acting chops in one performance. I remember last time I saw her in Texasville and I noticed her beauty. It's interesting to see her from ten years ago. In any case, if you're not interested in Miss Potts, run away from this movie by shouting for a hill.
