This movie is awful if you pay attention to it. It's the perfect movie if you just watch colorful pictures dancing on the screen - everyone without visible connection to the next. I rented this movie because I'm a fan of David Bowie and I really appreciate musicals. As a last resort, Bowie was in the movie for ten minutes, and the songs and dance sequences were rare and left much to be desired. The moral of the story was really stunning. I could not say whether it was racial issues in London in the 1950s or for non-selling. In the first half of the movie, I giggled as it was bad, but I liked the abundance of the "no sales" message. When the blacks began to be murdered, I thought my tape was broken. Maybe I've rented half of two different films? No, there was the song and dance sequence of 'Keep Britain White'. I'm sorry, but World War II is not something you can write a musical about. At least this is not a musical that could be described as "camp", as several times in this review. Generally, I would say that this film could have done a lot better if it made a decision and threw better actors. (And put David Bowie in it for longer!) My rating: C-
