This movie never came to the cinemas in our region, so when it became available on DVD, I was one of the first to rent it. For the first time, I should listen to critics and pass it on. <br /> <br /> Despite the excellent cast of the actors, the film was very disappointing. I can see why it went straight to the video. <br /> <br /> I thought it might have some value with Bloom, Ledger and Rush. Everyone has done a great job in the past. <br /> <br /> The movie was slow and never drew me. I did not manage to develop empathy for the character and I had to fight the urge to quickly move forward to reach the end. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie, even if you think about borrowing it only for "sweetness" purposes. He will not even satisfy this.
