What is * bliep * in this video? Could not they create a better scenario? All in all a "nice" movie, but ... it was done more than once ... Until the end I thought it was all right, but ... returning to the previous part ... * barf * So banal ... I waited for the mother god of the fairy to appear ... but wow, it did not happen ... which is good. <br /> <br /> I loved Big with Tom Hanks, but to see such a movie in a new form with another kid who would like him to be older / bigger; it just pas√© <br /> <br /> Just watch until it appears on TV. Do not get me wrong, but that's not all
