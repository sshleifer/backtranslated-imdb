This "adaptation" of King's great book is a bad joke and nothing more. Of course, there are many fans of Kubrick and Nickson on this site, as a result of which this film mysteriously finds its way into the top-250. <br /> <br /> Jack Nicholson is funny like Torrance, just like Shelley Duvall. A story that has nothing to do with the book is an inconsistent mess and the characters of Jack and Wendy Torrance are complete jokes. <br /> <br /> My advice to anyone who has not read the book and wants to understand the characters in this story: stick to the TV series .... <br /> <br /> Oh, and people who say that Kubrick he had every right to destroy the King's story, because King is ... not a good writer should stick to a review of "masterpieces" such as "eyes wide shut."
