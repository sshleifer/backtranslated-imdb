Someone might say that something like "Baby Geniuses" with his gigantic robots or "Dumbo" with a psychedelic, drug-addicted nightmare sequence will win the award for the most disturbing movie ever made for children. You can say that too, but you would be wrong. Here I am, for I bring you: Santa, the most helplessly damaged family movie from ... well, always. <br /> <br /> From the opening scenes showing children from different parts of the world singing their bland theme songs (seriously, this segment is almost 20 minutes of bizarre minutes and has nothing to do with the plot!) to the captivating conclusion in which Merlin appears is nowhere and does not save the day (do not worry, he's from Barcelona), it's the worst childhood trauma. And no matter how hard I try, no matter how many different therapists I visit, I just ... I can not ... get ... those ... reindeers ... laughter ... outside. .. my head! <br /> <br /> Avoid this crumpled piece of rubbish, as if you were avoiding a whale's fawn during the mating season. Still, if burning gay demons with a serious case of hyperactive flu are something for you, I think you should try. But really this movie is not worth your time and mental health.
