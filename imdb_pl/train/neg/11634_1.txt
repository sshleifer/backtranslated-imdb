I saw this movie at the Edmonton International Film Festival, attended by the great doctor Uwe Boll. <br /> <br /> The movie is just very, very bad. And no, not in the ordinary Uwe Boll "so bad it's really fun", but just bad. The story is about a man who runs a horrible life (apparently because of past criminal history), can not get a job and has a terrible wife worth Â£ 900. This man turns to his uncle the worship leader to steal a toy truck containing a bird flu virus. Al-Qaeda is also going to steal toys, and hence, has almost two hours of completely incomprehensible sex and violence. <br /> <br /> Acting is awful (except for Dave Foley, who's really trying, after all), the jokes never rise above the children shot in the chest in slow motion and the people taking the pile. This is to be satire, but I'm not sure what. <br /> <br /> Think about the "airplane!", but made by the creators of South Park and no jokes.
