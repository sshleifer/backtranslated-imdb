The story starts slowly and for a while nothing happens. The whole action is finally, but you will not have to laugh because the movie is funny, but because the story is pathetic. <br /> <br /> The funniest thing is that Harvey "I'm not Paranoia" Keitel really loses and the referee starts the massacre. Oscars for this guy!
