When I look back on my student days at Ohio University, there will always be one event in which I will remember with pleasant memories. Channel 23 is a local OU access channel and has played almost everything that has been sent to the last few years. This included a lot of DIY videos, from a guy with a Peeps microwave, and then scanning their photos online, to the Macbeth version with eighth peers who apparently just learned to make flip flops. <br /> <br /> However, the king, in my opinion, in Channel 23 was Midnight Skater. The first time I watched him around 2 am. I should have been learning. Or sleeping. Or watching TV. But no, that's all for pussies. My roommate and I watched Midnight Skater, and when it was completely, I do not think any of us believed that any of the films had just happened. But it was definitely a few days later and we had to deal with the fact that this movie really exists. <br /> <br /> I could talk about how terrible it is, but it's a kind of horrible life that makes life worth living. The conspiracy is chaotic, acting terribly, everything that is the scar of the soul, but for God, if others look at you, it is impossible not to look good. It's like you've heard Chuck Pahalniuk's "Guts" for the first time. You hear it, you are disgusted and shocked, but five minutes later, all you want and want is to make someone else experience the horrible horror you just survived. <br /> <br /> In short, Midnight Skater, because all his epic flaws make it fun very late at night. Besides, I desperately want a motto for Midnight Skater. Recognition for who wrote it and sang it. Sweet God, I love this song.
