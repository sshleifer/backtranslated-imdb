My 10-year-old daughter, Alexandra, writes: <br /> <br /> I thought it was very boring, and I thought it was just a repetition of things from "101 Dalmatians". I could not wait for the film to end. The best loans were initially - they were sweet and well done. The rest of the movie is not worth watching. Thank you.
