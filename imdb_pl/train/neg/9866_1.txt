Want to see the movie "THE Gamers" by Dead Gentlemen Productions. This is not the movie. This movie is not funny. It's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> All good comments here are written by (poorly hidden) fake third parties. The people who created this movie seem to try to synthesize false interests. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a well done mockumentary. Comparisons with "Spinal Tap" or Christopher Guest are offensive. <br /> <br /> The movie is so vile that I can not imagine anyone who would be familiar with this subject. Being able to laugh at yourself is an important feature, but if you are the ones who are persecuted in this way, you would have to hate yourself to enjoy them. <br /> <br /> The movie is not offensive because of the great satire of taboo themes, but because of its constant pathetic banality.
