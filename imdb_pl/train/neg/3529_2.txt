I heard that this film was much more stylistic than the director of the movies Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch), the problem is that it is too stylistic. Essentially, Jake Green (Jason Statham) is released from prison after seven years of solitude, and in two years risking a lot of his money. He is ready to take revenge on the vulnerable casino owner who sent Jake to prison, Dorothy 'Mr. D 'Mach (Ray Liotta). During this time, doctors tell Jake that he has three days of life, because he dies for a rare blood disease, oh, and Macha puts the wounded on him. Zach (Vincent Pastore) and Avi (Andr√© Benjamin) loan borrowers demand that Jake pay back their money and do some strange work for them. The film is filled with Jake telling about some flashbacks, and for the last three days, before he came to the great revelation about Zach, Avi and Mach, I assume that's the way it was. They also performed as Terence Maynard as the French Paul, Andrew Howard as Billy, Mark Strong as Sorter, Francesca Annis as Lily Walker, Anjela Lauren Smith as Doreen and Elana Binysh as Rachel. These are sequences containing some animations, repeating two times in different perspectives and changing the speed for a moment, and all of them are annoying to the point of confusion and boredom, making them a stupid crime drama. Pretty poor!
