Most often chosen by Chinese critics the biggest film in China, as well as Chinese outdoor enthusiasts, and to be honest, I do not understand it at all. What I saw was one of the most general melodramas imaginable, mindlessly directed and acting, with complete malice for the hero. Wei Wei (do not laugh) is the shrew, a young married woman who suffered with her tuberculous husband (Yu Shi) for the last few years. It is after the Second World War and they live with a teenage sister of a husband (Hongmei Zhang) in a ruined house with little money (a man was well off after marriage). Here comes the old friend's best friend (Wei Li), who was also a wife's boyfriend when they were teenagers. She thinks she is running away from her husband with this man, while her husband basically remains unconscious, thinking that he can involve his younger sister to a friend. This is a configuration and it does not go where you would not expect it. I've seen a remake directed by the director of Blue Kite Zhuangzhuang Tian. It lasts half an hour longer and is also a bit boring, but at least it was pretty. This supposed classic is quite unbearable.
