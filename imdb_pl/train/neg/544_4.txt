PROS: Performance by Akshay Kumar (is it just me, is this guy always able to beat AB in his movies?). Some touching scenes in the second half. <br /> <br /> KONS: All first hour (jokes were at least flat). Each scene with the participation of Rajpal Yadava. Serious stupidity in making decisions by AB. Let me understand this, he believes that violent insults to his son's soul in every possible way (which will probably ruin their irreparable relationship) is a better way for him to make Akshay take on some responsibility and then tell the truth? WTF? He thinks Akshaye is too soft to bear the fact that his OLD father will soon die of cancer, but he thinks insulting him will make him stronger? Am I the only one who can not see logic here? Easily the biggest flaw in the film. <br /> <br /> - Akshay becomes a stuntman. LMAO !! We were told that every year he graduated first and graduated from MBA. But when the time comes to support oneself and a pregnant wife, he becomes a stuntman. LOL !! How to properly apply for a normal job in the field of births? Or Heck, anywhere else where your life is not threatened? This is an incredibly stupid magazine. <br /> <br /> - Finish. I hate this kind of melodramatic nonsense. Everything is pushed down to our throats to regret the form of AB that I could not. All this stuff reminded me a bit of Srk in KHNH (which I hate). It's "please sympathize with the guy with the disease." I felt more like vomit than compassion for an OLD man. For this reason, I could not watch the last 20 minutes, so I had to go quickly to the next one. whole. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Waqt is just too stupid to call him a good movie. His obvious director, Vipul Shah, focused on emotionally fragile array and old people who do not care about history that makes sense. Give them some decent pictures of the songs, fancy dresses, lots of scenes filled with glycerine and some of the power of the stars, and they will enjoy such nonsense with joy.
