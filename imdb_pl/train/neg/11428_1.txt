OH MY GOD ... THE MOST SH * T EVER SEE - this is the main thought that came to my mind right after watching the movie. And I really do not understand anyone with an opposite myth. Although maybe the idea was good, but the effect was unhappy. I especially mean the role of H. Graham. What was that??? In my opinion, this destroyed all the positive intentions of producers. The character was played in an afflicted and irritating way. Each time it appears, it reminds you that you are watching a movie and destroying the spirit of the moment, and then the whole movie, because most of the time you can see is her stupid faces with more stupid attempts to create emotions. TERRIBLE, do not waste your time.
