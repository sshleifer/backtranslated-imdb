Honestly, I do not understand why this movie works so well, or why Bakshi thought it was his best movie. I am a big fan of Bakshi's earlier works - especially "Heavy Traffic" and "Wizards", but honestly, "Wizards" (1977) was the last good film he made. Then he turned to the mainstream, starting with the diabolical "Lord of the Rings," and then slapping the sword and heavy weight spells of Frank Frazetta on "Fire and Ice." <br /> <br /> What can I say? The story is childish, animation is TV quality - I insist that it is much worse than things from the 70's - and while the "Wizards" had a real imagination, quirkiness, wonderful art of background and underground sensitivity for adults, "Fire and Ice" is designed only for 14-year-old boys and has the intellectual strength of Robinson Crusoe on Mars. <br /> <br /> Yes, if you liked books from Gor, you can like it. In my opinion, however, it was another blip on the slide in the quality after "Wizards", which Bakshi never shook off (although lately he did some decent things on TV) <br /> <br /> 4,5 out of 10
