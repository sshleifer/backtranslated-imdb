I have not seen this and I am not planning to watch this movie or any other one that would include Lindsay ...... unless the "poor little rich girl" straightens her life for a period of 2 years, starting with her most recent arrest in July 2007. < br /> <br /> Actually, I do not know anyone who would go to see EVERY of Lindsay's latest movies. I rather imagine that 2007 will be the hallmark of her film career until she cleans up her act. All this last commercial only interrupted her career in film, if she has any further aspirations to create more films. <br /> <br /> Until then film producers were actively looking for Lindsay for roles in the upcoming production. Now Lindsay will probably have to go to auditions and actually compete for ANY role. Her reputation is now a "poison" and it is quite possible that it may have a negative effect on the sales of cash register tickets in every movie she is in. <br /> <br /> Yeah ... now Lindsay will have to deal with "not be sought after" ..... will she be able to deal with it? <br /> <br /> I wonder if even Jay Leno will want Lindsay to return to his television program? <br /> <br /> All this is just my OPINION. I do not have any internal information.
