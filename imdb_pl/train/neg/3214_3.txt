First of all, I would like to say that I deal with comics, anime, animation and such things. It's true that everyone has their own preferences, but you can trust me in this movie. I will be objective. For starters, the story is OK. He follows the story of comics, as far as I know. But the animation ... Well, it is not terrible, but definitely cheap and mediocre. It would be much better if they did not try to imitate the anime style and stick to the original comic-style drawings. If we pretend that we do not see rare, sloppy effects, such as fire and lightning, we can say that the film was made about 10 years ago, and even more. It looks a bit like the original Vampire Hunter D from 1985. Look at the example of Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 - 4 years ago they made a movie that looks much better! In addition, voice talents do nothing extraordinary, music is nothing special. So in total he lacks atmosphere. I watched it, but I can not say I really liked it. It just will not catch you. There is a lot of blood and violence, but it does not impress me. Maybe it will be shocking for someone who has never watched more mature animations and sees animated blood for the first time (is there anyone around?), But I do not think that this is the audience of this movie. So they could add some nudity and spice. The chicks around Lucifer were pretty tasty, and hell, we've got Lady Death herself! There are a few sexy looks, but that's not enough. Instead of using Bill Brown's music, I think she would look better on a hard rock / heavy metal soundtrack. In total - the movie is not so bad, but if you want something better, take the original Heavy Metal, Heavy Metal FAKK 2000, maybe Fire and Ice Ralph Bakshi or Wizards. And of course - Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust
