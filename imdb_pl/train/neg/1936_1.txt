Spoiler warning. <br /> <br /> When the main character's sister is pushed down the stairs, the killer breaks a glass of vodka next to her to make it look like she's drinking. But just before he dies, he tells her business partner (Teri Garr) on the phone that she has not been drinking for 4 days. However, the police never mention the results of a toxicological report! The characters say she was drunk when she fell down the stairs. What? A really bad mistake in this movie, which is generally horrible. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly bad, considering the great cast. Some faults: writing is not very good, music is created badly for TV and there is no tension, because we already know the answer to the mystery of the first scene in the movie.
