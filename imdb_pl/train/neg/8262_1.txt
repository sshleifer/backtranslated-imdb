This is really terrible: painfully annoying stylized performers screech and mock the grotesquely incoherent dialogues that take place in scenes that seem to have no purpose, have no beginning, middle or end, cut together without any visible narrative or even cognitive intentions completely uninteresting and almost undetectable "history". To make matters worse, the film's claim to "style": suddenly a remote crane spirals down, and for no apparent reason there are sudden whips or shaky sections: all this "style" only serves to enlarge the almost unbelievably great misunderstanding of the design and almost offensive material emptiness . Definitely the candidate for the worst film ever made.
