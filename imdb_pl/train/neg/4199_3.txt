A very bad effort that does not offer anything to anyone except a hardcore Stanley Tucci fan who tries but can not save the poor structure, dialogue, direction or talent of our leading man. <br /> <br /> The only trick that this extravagant tale of a naive new seller for an alarm company has bizarre figures from the side. But without a realistic background such figures are pointless. <br /> <br /> You can not see anything here, move ... <br /> <br />
