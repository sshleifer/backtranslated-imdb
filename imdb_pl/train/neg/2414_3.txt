I was able to notice this movement on the shelf under the "new releases" and discovered that the idea of ​​a hip-hop zombie is too interesting to ignore. And so it was put on a box and I thought, "What a great idea!" In addition to the cover is the sign "Welcome to Oakland." How could I resist? Unfortunately, the hip-hop part lasted only as long as the opening theme. Neither hip-hop music nor hip-hop culture played a significant role in the film. Living in Oakland myself, I know that there are many aspiring hip-hop artists, so the low budget of this movie was not an excuse not to have a proper soundtrack. Any number of fighting artists would take the opportunity to contribute to this film. Why the Quiroz brothers did not take advantage of this is beyond me. <br /> <br /> When the movie rolled, it was a very typical zombie movie with a cast that turned out to be completely black and Latin. One would think that this would cause an unusual slope of the film ... but it did not happen. Somehow, the vision of the "urban culture" Quiroz Brothers boils down to shooting and throwing the F bomb in every line of the film. The quick use of the word "fuck" is probably the most distinguishing feature of this movie; there were single lines containing the word three or four times, and no line contained it at least once. I do not like cursing in the film at all, but the feeling here was that it resulted from the lack of ideas of writers (including the Quiroz brothers), and the script was generally very weak. <br /> <br /> The film was generally a disappointment. It would be interesting to see the truly "urban culture" of zombies, but "Hood of the Living Dead" is not enough. The characters in the film could well be white, Eskimo or anything else. The film did not have a distinct taste. It's just another typical low-budget movie with bad acting, bad writing, amateur directing, bland cinematography, cheap soundtracks and nothing else to recommend it.
