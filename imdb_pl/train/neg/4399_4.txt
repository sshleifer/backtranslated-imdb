"Tapeheads", an unpleasant, sporadically funny parody of the music video, could be the perfect comedy shortcut, and the stars John Cusack and Tim Robbins effortlessly follow the nonsensical chaos. In Los Angeles, they play two experienced bodyguards who start their own company, Video Aces, making fun videos for groups, events and one death star. It is a pity that the filmmakers had to come up with a weak plot to conquer time (shenanigans engaging the dishonest politician and his supporters who does nothing but receive the main force of the film, sending out the musical culture of the late 1980s). Still, Cusack and Robbins make a few originals here: nerdy, but loose, smart, not being hipstami or poses, these guys have the same note of length and never abandon. They're real in comedies. * 1/2 of ****
