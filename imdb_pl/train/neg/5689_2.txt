Over the last year Uwe Boll showed a marginal improvement as a filmmaker, turning the competent "In the name of the king" (clone of the "Lord of the Rings") and proudly vulgar satire "September 11". "But then came the" Seed ", and the counter was reset to Zero, maintaining its pursuit of legality and respecting it much further out of reach. And I'm a fan of this guy? His films show a unique vision of bowling and they are never boring. <br /> <br /> Devastated by the frustration of wildness, notes his early films received, "Seed" is a colossally flawed attempt at social commentary and an even worse blow when creating iconic Slasher mythology (Boll often seems to be making a party with a successful Rob Zombie restart in "Halloween"). The antagonist is Maxwell Seed (Will Sanderson), a dumb, powerful brutal who killed 666 people and sits on death row waiting for execution; after unsuccessfully frying the beast, he gets up from the grave to take revenge on those who put him there ... and this is how the unselfish chaos begins. <br /> <br /> Trying to create a new millennium, the principle of Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees, Max Seed is too bland and boring to impress, eventually reminiscent of a wasted professional wrestler doing "The Toolbox Murders" on other equally boring victims. What's more, Seed's character and Bolel's "message" are contradictory: the death penalty is bad, of course, but are we really expected to feel compassion for a soulless killer who left a few hundred corpses behind? I think not. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Michael Pare acts as an apathetic, long-lost brother of the character James Remar in the movie "Dexter": a policeman who often sits at a desk, looks through newspaper clippings and watching senseless scenes with decaying animals and people trapped in Seed's lair. By the time he and a group of cardboard cops storm Seed's hideout, the sequence is so stretched out, ill-conceived (the lighting is almost non-existent) and unexpected (despite the healthy dose of gore) that it almost put me to sleep. <br /> <br /> The dancing film is not limited to this sequence: "Seed" seems to be shot by a drunken operator, because the camera is endlessly spinning and weaving, a technique that is more of a stomach turning than the blood itself; these chronic shots are very rare, but they pay attention to the meandering, almost non-existent narrative. After 90 minutes the film is so distended that it can be considered a form of torture, which could have been the intention of Bolla all the time. <br /> <br /> Pure genius ... I'm guessing a joke on me.
