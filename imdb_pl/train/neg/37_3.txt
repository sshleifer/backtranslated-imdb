Devil Hunter became famous because he is on the DPP "Video Nasty" list, but it does not really have to be. Many films on the list, where there are only known reasons for God (and DPP), and although this is not the stupidest group; there is not much here that justifies the ban ... which is a shame, because I would never sit down in this place, because it is not the fact that it is on the shopping list. The story really gives the film a decent base - or at least more decent base than most cannibal movies - and it's accompanied by an actress who is kidnapped and dragged into the Amazon jungle. Next, the hunter is hired to find her, but on the way he has to dare to the natives, led by a man who calls himself "the Devil" (hence the title). The movie just lasts for eighty-five minutes and there are not really many interesting scenes. It is a pity that Jess Franco finished making films in this way because the man clearly has talent; in movies like Diabolic Dr. Z, Venus in Furs, Faceless and She Kills in Ecstasy, but unfortunately his good films are just jewels among the stacks of nonsense, and Devil Hunter is very much a part of shit. I saw this movie only because I want to be able to say that I have seen everything on the DPP list (only two more!) And I guess it was seen by most other people who saw it. But if you are not looking for Nasties; there really is no reason to care about it.
