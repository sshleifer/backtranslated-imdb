I really could not wait for this show, given the quality of the actors and the fact that the Scott brothers were involved. Unfortunately, my hopes have been broken! Once again, we are convinced that the KGB is a group of inept morons who have no idea what they are doing. At some point there is a funny scene in which four KGB agents can not handle one CIA agent. I am tired of these partial, unilateral and completely inaccurate portraits of the Spy game that lasted during the Cold War. It is ridiculous that the US is unable to make objective films about their involvement in WW2 and later. Like the pathetic U-571, in which we are convinced that the US obtained the Enigma machine, again completely false. <br /> <br /> In its favor, the "Company" is very well filmed and works. The locations are also exceptionally well implemented. Alfred Molina has a great performance, just like Keaton (the conflict between them is very well done). I really wanted to like this concert and I will no doubt end up watching the other two episodes, but I really want the US productions to stop showing them to Spies, soldiers, etc. As supermen who are much better intellectually and physically than others on the planet. Aging quickly and seriously harms the credibility of what could have been 10/10. <br /> <br /> S
