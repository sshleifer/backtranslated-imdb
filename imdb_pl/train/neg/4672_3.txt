This movie has some beautiful sets, and Albert Finney does a great job as a ruthless father. The film ends in failure, because Jennifer Jason Leigh is too lively as a daughter and does not fit into the more mature, mature shot of Olivia De Havilland in "Heiress" (1949). The feminist conclusion of the film also contradicts the harsh conclusion of the novel, Washington Square, whose author, Henry James, brutally parodied feminism in some other novels. As a fan of old Hollywood and great literature, I find this film very disappointing.
