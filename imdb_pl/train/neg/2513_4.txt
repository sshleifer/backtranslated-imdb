When I saw this movie for the first time, I thought it should come from a children's section - it's very funny and sometimes humorous, and it's actually quite a good story, but it's seriously lacking "romantic chemistry" that actors like Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins are able to deliver. I must note that Walter Matthau is perfect for the part of Albert Einstein, and his performance is extraordinary, but that's the only exception. This movie seems a bit forced, the director lacks content and oh so ... music is absurdly horrible, did not put me in a very good mood. But if you do not expect a clever, well-prepared comedy / romance story, it can certainly be fun, as I said ... it should be in the children's section. Einstein and his friends are a good relief in Tim Robbins' boring, almost strained pursuit of stealing the heart of Meg Ryan. A very colliding movie, but as long as it is not taken seriously, it can be a good movie.
