This movie is so bad it's funny. Scott Backula plays the role of trainer, but it is not important, the big black guy who plays the first base is important. First, he must be at least 75 years old, and yet continue to play baseball league, and secondly he starts the film in the field, even though he is unable to walk, let alone running. Backula coach moves him greatly, citing the fact that when he tries to run away, he stays in the same place for too long. Backula shows a more brilliant coaching strategy at the end of the movie, (SPOILER), tells his star player "downtown" to get home, clearly "in the center" he considered it a good move. He hit the home run and won the game for his team, a secondary league team playing Twins, which were the main movie class in the movie. If only Tony Muser, manager of Royals, would be as wise a coach as Backula and would tell his players to just hit the home run in every whip, Royals will never finish the inning, let alone lose.
