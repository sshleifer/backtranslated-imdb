Knights were just the beginning of the series, a pilot, you could say. The plot (I really should not call it that, there was no story) was not logical at all and there were a lot of mistakes like [warning, I summarize the plot]: <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie someone said there are only a few cyborgs (bad guys), but after the climax of Nea, she learned that there were many more left. And it was said that cyborgs are difficult to kill, but after a month's training Nea can kill them with one blow. <br /> <br /> The movie was just a clean kick. I was not surprised when I learned that the main star was a kick-boxer. <br /> <br /> There was something positive about the whole movie: it really made a lot of laughter while watching and talking about it with my friends. I recommend watching it if you need laughter.
