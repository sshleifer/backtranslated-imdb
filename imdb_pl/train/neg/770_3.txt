The Stranger Jack (Matthew Lillard) arrives at the studio of the anti-collectibles collector Max (Vincent D'Onofrio) and tells his ambitious comrade and poison specialist Jamie (Valeria Golino) that he is Jack's brother. Jamie does not buy his story, dominates over Jack and attaches it to the chair. When Max arrives, Jack proposes $ 100,000 for each to protect him in the negotiations of antiques "Spanish Judges" with a rich and dangerous collector. Max invites his stupid acquaintance Piece (Mark Boone Junior), who comes with his underdeveloped girlfriend who believes he is from Mars to form an auxiliary team. But Jack cuts through the collector and then intrigues Jack, Jamie and Piece. <br /> <br /> Low budget "Spanish Judges" is a movie with a reasonable script with a horrible conclusion that wastes a good cast. Valeria Golino is amazingly beautiful, but together with a good actor Vincent D'Onofrio they can not save a stupid story. In addition, the scenes that are supposed to be fun, unfortunately, do not work, they are actually stupid and not fun. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Tudo Por Dinheiro" ("All For Money")
