I recently watched the movie and it is very similar to a book. I blame it for a poor script and direction. Some parts have been forcefully introduced (gay rape scene) for no apparent reason. I read the book after watching the movie and about 20 years after reading it for the first time. It was hard for me to read it and it was a bit clumsy. Too many different ideas introduced without any benefit ... other than sensational parts at this time. Because it includes things that have been considered "sensitive", to put it mildly, during the communist era, I see the fascination that it caused at the time. However, this is not an accident, and maybe now I see things differently or a bit of both. The film tries to cover many aspects of the book, which results in a mixture of scenes that can make sense for someone who reads the book. Even so, it's a difficult movie to watch and maybe it should never have been made.
