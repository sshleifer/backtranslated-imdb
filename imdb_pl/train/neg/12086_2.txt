... this Verson does not turn Bard so badly. It's still a terrible minimalist production, Dutch Hamlet's uncle is inexplicably called by the Spaniard (whether it's Ricardo Montalban or not, it's a debate), and Maximilian Schell is going through like never before. Most dialogues do it unscathed, and the fact that the MST3K version feels obliged to repeatedly emphasize that the speeches are long * duh *, does not seem to me incredibly humorous. Mainly it's just bad acting.
