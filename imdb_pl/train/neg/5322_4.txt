There are two types of musicals from the 1950s. First you have MGM shiny productions with big names and great music. And then you have a smaller league with a lesser-known cast, less known music and second-degree directors. "The girl can not help" belongs to the latter category. Neither Tom Ewell nor Edmond O'Brien became famous, and Jayne Mansfield was famous for her ... well, it does not matter. It seems that every decade has its share in Bo Dereks or Pamela Andersons. The thread itself is thin like a razor blade and you can not suspect that it is mainly an attempt to sell records for Fats Domino, Little Richard or other 50's rock songs that appear in the film. If this music appeals to you, it's worth watching. If not, do not worry.
