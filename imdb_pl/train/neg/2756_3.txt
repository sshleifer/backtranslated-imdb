{rant start} At first, I did not want to believe them, but I think people are talking about it when they say that cinema in South Korea has reached its peak, and maybe even falls. After a surprisingly funny and moving movie with the monster "Gwoemul" (aka "The Host") from 2006 - which actually managed to create a sharp satire from the movie genre B - successive Korean hits have become more general, even though their budgets (mainly for special effects) are becoming more and more fantastic. Do South Korean film makers really want to squander the entire audience and the kindness of investors, what their industry has built since the film "Shiri / Swiri" from 1999, creating a whole series of big, bad films such as Mainland China? {rant end} <br /> <br /> The only "reason" I can imagine for making this movie is to trick investors into financing the most detailed and fluid digital animation of a Korean / East Asian dragon that I have seen so far final scenes. Now, if they introduced the dragon at the beginning and gave it a greater personality and purpose, as in the Dragon's Heart from 1996, the film could have several other advantages, in addition to having many digitally animated dragons. Do you remember "Dungeons & Dragons" in 2000? Has anyone learned that the trick is not how many special effects you use, but how well do you use it? I hope there are more (and better) Korean legends that they can use because they have just killed many international interests of the Korean dragon legends from the way they filmed this one. <br /> <br /> In short, I agree with all the negative reviews before and I wonder how the Koreans felt that their national anthem "Arirang" is played at the very end. As a creature, I would give him at least 5 stars out of 10 if special effects or action sequences were worth it, but I've seen many video games with better camera work and scripting (only fewer dragons).
