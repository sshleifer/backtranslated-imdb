Jack Black can usually make me start giggling just by breathing, but in this movie ... <br /> <br /> Beyond the direction, writing, lack of plot, constant assault (assisted and instigated by fixed camera shots), and average batting 0.050 jokes, it was still a waste of time. The idea sounds promising, but what potential was wasted along with the total lack of comedy and the worst direction I saw on this side of you-tube. <br /> <br /> I heard that this movie is portrayed by Mexicans very negatively. Although this is undoubtedly true, I really do not think that this film is to be racist. I think it's more the effect of a "creative" band desperately trying to find something funny in this mess. You can almost hear them shouting from behind the camera: "Hey, this is an ugly Mexican! Laugh, people! Please, out of love for everything that is permanent, ÅšMIECH! "<br /> <br /> But put racism aside. When you get to it, everyone who has got good money and time to watch this pile of leftovers of fried beans that should be offended, IMO.
