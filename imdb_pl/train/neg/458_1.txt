What is this shit? My little cousin chose it, of course, because of the over-girly art of DVD and the title ... I decided to watch it with her so that she would not be bored, and I was certainly terrified at this horrible quality. <br /> <br /> First of all, acting was awful. They look like amateur actresses reading memory cards. The delivery is lower and very formal. The cuts were awful ... it looks like they took them straight from the board, if they were. <br /> <br /> Secondly, jokes and stereotypes were not original or well played at all, very formulaic. I can not count the times when I was able to predict the next joke. I got a few chuckles from grossly "subtle" sexual innuendos. The Cat, The Beaver Patch, Hung Wong? .. come! Just ... stay away from this movie. It's not cute, it's not funny, it's not stupid, it's funny. It's just stupid-stupid. It's like a movie for children with unnecessary sexual insinuations, vulgarity and violence to raise the MPAA score. STOP. <br /> <br /> "Do you want to ride my yacht?" <br /> <br /> "Is that what they call now?" <br /> <br /> "You can ride my ding. "<br /> <br />" Oh! I think I have blood on a stool! "<br /> <br /> I played bad, sir.
