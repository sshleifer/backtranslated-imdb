It's a really awful movie. The plot (as it is) is completely unreadable. (I think it has something to do with blackmail, but I'm not sure.) Half of the dialogue consists of useless platitudes. The other half is said by various actors in such incomprehensible imitations of "southern" accents that (fortunately) words can not be recognized. <br /> <br /> But the only real tragedy of the movie is that such historical talent as Mary Tyler Moore was apparently in such a dramatic financial or personal situation that she appeared in it. <br /> <br />
