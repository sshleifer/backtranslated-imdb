This movie should not be classified as a cinema. Even though he's been over 10 years old, he should never receive funds and is the misery of the Australian film industry, who currently produces such great films as "The Dish" <br /> <br /> Actors can not work, music is ... to be dull, not music, the plot is completely non-existent and it is difficult to sit down. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. It is a complete waste of time.
