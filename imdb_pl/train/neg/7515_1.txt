Sucks. That's all I have to say about this apologetic excuse for the movie. Sucks. Sucks. Sucks. I mean, what the hell did they think? Committed idiots should never be allowed to make more films. Acting was so bad that you did not even have fun on the wrong level. The attempt to "lesbian scene" was sad. I felt so bad for the involved ladies. This movie sucks! Sucks! Sucks! <br /> <br /> I heard rumors about the sequel. <br /> <br /> God <br /> <br /> Help <br /> <br /> Nas <br /> <br /> Everything
