I'm not sure how connected they are, but I'm pretty sure that Lost and Delirious is a remake of this movie (or the story it's based on). A very similar plot, and even some scenes and sets seem to be very, very similar. Lost & Delirious is actually a much better movie, so look at it instead. <br /> <br /> This movie is moving very slowly, but being a French movie from the late 1960s, you should expect style. I told in retrospection from the perspective of one of the girls returning to school. Editing flashbacks with current scenes is initially a bit misleading, especially since the sound from each of them overlaps (i.e., hears flashbacks when watching the present and vice versa). In addition, the "girls" are a little old to think they are in a boarding school. Finally, not much character development to even attach to the movie.
