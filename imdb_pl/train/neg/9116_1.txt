There is not one decent scene. <br /> <br /> Amy Adams gives one of the worst performances of all time. Proof that you can start anywhere. Guy playing Sebastian sucks too. It does not even look like Ryan Phillipe. More like Joshua Jackson. Two other girls are terrible too. <br /> <br /> Then the dialogue is also nonsense. <br /> <br /> Sebastian (Having three): If you can not beat them ... <br /> <br /> Virgin Girl: Who says you can not beat them? <br /> <br /> Lame. <br /> <br /> The ending is contradictive to the entire plot of the original. In the first film it was clearly stated that Kathryn and Sebastian never had sex. One of the reasons why Sebastian really wanted Kathryn, apart from the fact that Sarah Michelle Gellar played her, was that she was "the only girl he could not have and killed him." She was irritating, who liked to play with him. The fact that she never gave her, increased his desire. Then, including P.S. he suggests that he CAN have it, along with the girl on the side. What? And we do not even see sex. This suggests that it is not only stupid, aimless and contradictory, but also worthless. <br /> <br /> In the first Kathryn rejects Sebastian because he fell in love, making him loser. Although he won the bet, it reduced his chances. Then, in these feces, he loses and falls in love. So she does not screw up "losers", only complete losses? Another thing: it's said that Sebastian has never been in love, so what do you call a Virgin Girl thing? <br /> <br /> In the end, the virgin suddenly turns out to be a bad lesbian Kathryn (dun dun dun) and, as I said, fall into a lame three. Stupid. <br /> <br /> There are several other contradictions. Did the writer even see the first film? The 5-year-old can show his things. <br /> <br /> After the threesome Sebastian has sex with a blonde virgin, destroying her innocent mind on the back of the limousine, while Kathryn and Virgin Girl have turned the evil lesbian. A sudden thread. Turn in the front, listen and smile maliciously at the camera. <br /> <br /> Koniec ... <br /> <br /> Seeing that Sebastian became a hole in the ass, in which he was in the first, he could make an interesting movie. I think everything you need for little Sebastian to be angry is a triangle with two hot girls. Interesting.
