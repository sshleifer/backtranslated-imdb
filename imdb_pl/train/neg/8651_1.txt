I watched the first 15 minutes thinking that it was a real documentary (with an annoying overly dramatic producer "on the camera"). <br /> <br /> When I realized that everything was staged, I thought: "why would I want to waste my time watching this junk? "So I turned it off and turned it on online to warn others. Characters do not work in a reliable way. too many immature emotions. for a man who traveled halfway through the world to a country torn by war, he behaved like a child. and I do not believe that it's because "his character was so nervous about the attacks in the mall." <br /> <br /> very banal and stupid. <br /> <br /> did you see the "city of missing children" - a French dark fantasy film about a guy who kidnaps children and steals their dreams ... I liked it!
