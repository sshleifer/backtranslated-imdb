After the brilliant performance of George from the jungle of Disney, I had high hopes for this film. Big disappointment. Thread naked, bad acting, bad visual effects. This movie was based on bad lines, idiotic (and pointless) placement of products and the worst annoying side view in this gadget car. I took two small children to see it, and they got bored with their mind. The only laugh we received from this movie was a bad readiness when the need to laugh shows a guy who has it in his groin!
