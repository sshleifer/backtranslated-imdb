Somewhere between Food Court and Zip's shopping center in this movie <br /> <br /> has a store with explosives. This is the only place where the title hero <br /> <br /> can buy a bomb that he plants in a shopping mall in a boring finale. <br /> <br /> A fictitious city has a new shopping center, built on some land, it was <br /> <br /> condemned. Cute Girl (I did not catch her name) gets a job as a <br /> <br /> waitress. She lost the boy in the fire in the place where the shopping center is standing. <br /> <br /> The bad owner of the shopping center rents an arsonist <br /> <br /> responsible for the fire as a guard after his first security <br /> <br /> the guard ends his life. Rob Estes, eony before "Silk Stalkings", to <br /> <br /> photographer / reporter trying to find a story. She associates with Cute Girl, <br /> <br /> and their common "funny" friend Pauly Shore, and tries to find out if Eric <br /> <br /> is still alive. He is living in a basement in a shopping center (?) I travels through the air channels and takes away people who annoy his ex-girlfriend, <br /> <br />, including an arsonist. Finally, he grabs it <br /> <br />, and the finale covers the bomb and all those running from the stage <br /> <br /> before the big kabelooey. Morgan Fairchild is on a drive <br /> <br /> as mayor ... yes, he is the mayor. <br /> <br /> Of course, you probably do not need a plot sketch, because the whole <br /> <br /> story is in the title. Somebody named Eric got revenge on people as the ghost of a shopping mall. <br /> <br /> It also means no voltage <br /> <br />. We know that Eric is behind it, but we still have to see <br /> <br /> Estes and Cute Girl are going through the moves of a stupid investigation. <br /> <br /> Watch out how Fairchild, whom we know, have been in cahoots with <br /> <br /> the owner of the mall, pull the weapon to our heroic duo in the middle of <br /> <br /> crowded parties, but nobody says a word as she leads to her office <br /> <br /> and her possible death. A fictitious city is huge, but nary a <br /> <br /> a policeman is ever called, everyone relies on the security of the shopping center. <br /> <br /> Eric has been hiding since the construction of the mall, but I'm not sure <br /> <br /> where. It seems that he lives in the basement, but you would think that a construction worker would find him. <br /> <br /> He also has <br /> <br /> quite good equipment for his love pad and found a few stores, because <br /> <br /> has electricity. It can be nicer than your own apartment! <br /> <br /> Fans of Pauly Shore, both, notice. WykrÄ™ca ochroniarza <br /> <br /> from his booth, turning the camera. Yes, stop scanning <br /> <br /> The skin of the stars and Playgirl, here you can see the grainy <br /> <br /> black and white photo of the southern shore of Paula, although there is no weezil. <Br /> <br /> It's just junk and proof that I'm forced to rent just <br /> <br /> about anything in the video store to stay in the horror department. This <br /> <br /> movie is not Eric's revenge, it's the revenge of the creator of the movie for me <br /> <br /> stupid to watch it. Here's my revenge: no <br /> <br /> recommend. That will show them! <br /> <br /> This is rated (R) for physical violence, some violence on weapons, gore, <br /> <br /> some vulgarity, some nakedness of women, short man's nakedness, and some <br /> <br /> sexual content.
