Well, I tried to put aside the fact that selling EVP as a real movie basically lied to me from the very beginning. I understood that the hell, I do not believe in vampires, but I still liked Dracula, so I could live with it. <br /> <br /> However, even with such a reception the film is not very good. It's competently made and works, but it does not really catch you. There are several moments of "jump", and I just looked at them and thought "yes, I did not expect it" without actually jumping in the slightest. <br /> <br /> Also the resolution does not make sense. If the standing force behind this is capable of doing things that seem to be, then why the hell must he use a proxy? In addition, the signature was absurd. Of course, they put it there as part of "give credibility to the film, claiming that it's all true," but to make it work, it really has to be in the beginning. But they can not put it in the beginning, because then they give the plot ... sticking it in the end, they simply stick out like a sore thumb.
