Hearing so much about the 1990's Cracker series, not seeing any of them, I was looking forward to it. Certainly the combination of Jimmy McGovern and Robbie Coltrane could not go wrong. How wrong I was! <br /> <br /> The polemics, supported by frequent, repetitive and violent flashbacks, were overwhelming. Production tried to be super modern, but irritating were the flashing fields, and even the childish font. Robbie Coltrane slept for two hours, inventing unexplained and unlikely "insights", and the police were portrayed as one-dimensional, inept idiots. As a result, the tension never increased, and the next scene to the finale (no details for fear of spoilers) was such a ridiculously bad piece of television drama, as I have seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> No, I do not want to watch them anymore, but I'll go back to the 1990s DVD series to see if they match their reputation.
