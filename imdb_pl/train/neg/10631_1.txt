The views of the Earth that have been falsified by NASA in this film have recently been compared to the historical weather data of the Apollo 11 times and show a good match of cloud patterns in the video sequence and actual rainfall records of the day. <br /> <br /> It seems that this undermines the whole argument put forward in the film that the image of "the whole Earth" is really a small part of the planet surrounded by the window of a space ship. <br /> <br /> I am waiting for Bart Sibrel, who now claims that historical weather data has been faked by NASA, although it would undoubtedly require them to replace every archived copy of the newspaper with a weather map, and these in private hands still be a problem . <br /> <br /> Ah, the answer: "Trying to discredit this movie by referring to NASA's weather data, which I would say, is a charming but weak and credible argument. And what about the rest of the film material and evidence in the film? A wise man once said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels. Do you somehow feel that it can apply to what you are trying to do here? :-) This film is full of solid evidence that the US government has argued that lunar missions have been successful, and this man is the true master of the universe. Things are almost never what they seem. Just watch the movie, and I say you'll see things a bit different than before. <br /> <br /> First of all, weather data does not come from NASA Secondly, weather data undermines the main claim in the film, and thirdly, they are not "packed with irrefutable evidence", the remaining claims in the film have been completely disproven. previously a secret piece of the film, so he edited it and added his own interpretation, unfortunately for him his source film is public property, and the fragments which were edited by Sibrel, contradict his claims.
