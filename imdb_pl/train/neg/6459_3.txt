Such big disappointment of such great actors. Marlon Brando plays and a horrible character, the film is not funny, the subconscious message can be seen "THIS IS A DAMN CRAP !!!", "THIS IS A MINI !!", "EYE YOUR TV OUT BY THE WINDOW" and soon. It is simply disgusting and annoying. In addition to a stupid story, there is something more humor. The way the rooms are decorated, colors. It makes me ill, everything is so colorful that it can cause epilepsy. I usually do not care about the decoration in the movie, but it was "Free Money" that made me angry. Avoid at all costs! "Free money" - probably for Charlie Sheen, Sutherland and Brando, but the viewer gets nothing! It is observed at the expense of reason.
