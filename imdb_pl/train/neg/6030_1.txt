Okay, now I know there are millions of Americans who believe in Rapture: the moment when all those born again in Christ will be raptured to meet God and all the rest of humanity will stay on earth to die in plagues and fire and the profession of psoriasis, when Antichrist fights Jesus (in an uncharacteristic mode). And I know that books were bestsellers. . in any case, believers. And I do not mean disrespect for all this. <br /> <br /> But I have to say that they pushed the film into the bag and beat it Suck Stick. <br /> <br /> I am sure the books are much better. Really. <br /> <br /> The plot does not require a revelation. If you've watched this movie, you're probably reading a book. I can be one of the few people on earth who actually watched only because of pure bad movement, and I was not disappointed. Especially Kirk Cameron, the terrifying little gremlin "Growing Pains" who reached the age of majority in this performance, found Christ and decided that the SHOW should reflect his Christian values. Well, Kirk, your career has gone in the footsteps of dogs, but now you can be happy that you spread the word of God so badly in movies that they even fail to reach the cinema premiere. Well, this is not entirely true: I think it was the only movie ever made, which was released on DVD FIRST, with a coupon for free watching a movie when it was released in cinemas for a short time! I still have a coupon! How many people have appeared? I do not know about you, but it never came to my city. Of course I live in New York, where we impious liberals are sitting around, tearing pages from the Bible and using them to roll up the joints. So you go. In fact, I bet on three million people in Manhattan, no one would be thrilled. <br /> <br /> Familiarize yourself with additional material on DVD, where you'll learn the terrible details behind the scenes of these movies. . . CAST and CREW must have the same religious way of thinking. They do not go out and do not say that, but they listen carefully to what the filmmakers say. It's as if a group of Under People has gathered to make a film, How's That Creepy? Honestly, these things only speak to converts, right? Can you imagine someone who does NOT subscribe to this whole apocalypse by watching it, slapping one's forehead and saying, "HOLY HOOVER DAM! I'd better be saved by PRONTO! "In any case, I'm addicted. I need to see the rest of these Christian fiasco films, especially with Gary Busey, who I think is TRIBULATIONS. At least Busey has an excuse to take part .... He broke his head on some sidewalk when he crashed his motorcycle. <br /> <br /> Oy. <br /> <br /> Oh, and one more thing. What about all the arrows of poor, innocent whining dogs, their leashes are useless on the ground because their owners have been called to heaven? What is going on? Should we feel bad towards dogs, and if so, what should we do with God? Does not it bother people that there is no place for the best human friend in heaven? Foo. <br /> <br /> This is another reason why I am agnostic. Good night and good luck.
