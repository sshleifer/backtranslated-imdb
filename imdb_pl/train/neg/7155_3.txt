I'm sorry, but I did not like this document. I can come up with a million ways that could be better. The people who did it apparently do not have much imagination. Interviews are not very interesting and offer no real insight. The film material is also not assembled in a very informative way. It's a pity, because it's a movie that really deserves special features. I will only say that Isabella Rosselini is more beautiful, the older she is. Considering everything, you only get "4".
