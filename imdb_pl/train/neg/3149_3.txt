Being an independent filmmaker and a huge fan of Edward D. Wood Jr. I bought this documentary, believing it would eventually set a record of how talented and genius Ed Wood was. <br /> <br /> What I got was a disappointing, self-centered, contradictory, contradictory compilation of bitter, self-loving beats. <br /> <br /> Where do people remember Ed Wood, do people really remember the second cousin of a guy with a sticky tape who knew someone who was in Plan 9 from space? <br /> <br /> It seems that with the rediscovery of Edem Wood, these people are coming out of "Wood"! Just to think of a thrilling swipe at someone who actually gave them a chance when nobody else would! After 50 years, I would suggest that many of these people should abandon the fact that they did not get the $ 75 that they were promised! In fact, this is the EVERYTHING for which he lived. You can giggle when you see Ed's movies, but you somehow realize that you are laughing at him and not at him. <br /> <br /> But digress ... I'm going back to the movie. If you expect the movie About Edward D. Woodie Jr., you will not get it here. If you want a movie about bizarre bitter old actors, this is a movie for you!
