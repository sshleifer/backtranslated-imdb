Once again, the classic film has been rendered nonsense with predictably catastrophic results. The title is fake, like everything in this movie. This period is not convincingly rendered, and the trail seems too young and too oppressive to even be criminals. Arthur Penn's film had a style, humor, point of view and was created by talented people. Even if the 1967 version did not exist, it would still be an unnecessary movie. Version from 1967. It deviated from facts, presented an effective version of Bonnie and Clyde, but it was exciting and innovative in 1967. And it had some great achievements that allowed you to care. This remake from 1992 seems to be broken from the original movie, not from the known truth, and the actors in this version are disgusting, unattractive and not the least interesting. At all costs, skip this and hope that the 2010 version will be better. Can it get worse?
