Do not get me wrong, I love the action and revenge movies, I've seen them a lot since my childhood, including Dolph Lundgren's latest mechanic, which is pretty good. And Tony Scott certainly knows how to use the camera, and can even be a brilliant film for filming and editing. <br /> <br /> But with "Man on Fire" (and even more than with "Domino"), Scott shows that instead of intelligently using "genius" film skills, he uses it without anything to show off and compensate for the lack of a substance that its material does not offer him. "Man of Fire" is close to 2 hours and a half, when it should be at least an hour less. <br /> <br /> The way Scott shot and edited this movie makes you wonder if he really wants you (audience) to sit in his movie because his constant camera movements and flashes are really torturing eye and make you want to leave the theater or turn it off after 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Sometimes where MPAA and studies have suspicious attitudes about ratings, violence and film making PG-13. I also think that the $ 70 million film consists of a B movie screenplay with a figure who cuts fingers, puts a bomb in the man's butt and blows the man with a rifle, all to avenge the death of a little girl who is NOT even dead! Go to the figure, why the studio will go through a better script because of language or violence ... So he said ...
