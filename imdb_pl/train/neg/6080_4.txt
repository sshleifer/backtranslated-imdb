"Maladolescenza" has a dark tale with children's heroes, the surroundings of the forest and the discovery of castle ruins. However, in essence, the film is basically an extraordinary psychosexual study of youth. Opening the sequence of dreams using the not so subtle Fabrizia metaphor, struggling with a dangerous hound, the film depicts his psychological persecution of Laura, the girl who gave him her love, and possible romance with equally malicious Sylvia. The psychological intricacies of the film give the film advantages, but there is no doubt about how unnecessarily the film is used in the presentation of nudity and sex. The movie's appearance is based more on great locations than on special cinematographic skills. There is no doubt that the greatest asset of the film is the terrifying soundtrack enriched by the children's choir. With a strange quality of sleep, the movie is at best interesting, but pale next to the surrealistic and brilliant "Black Moon" by Louis Malle from the same era. It certainly deserves a debate about art and pornography, because unlike many forbidden films, such as Pasolini's Salo or Ken Park by Larry Clark, the film is rather unattractive from an artistic point of view. Cinema seems to gradually lose its ability to shock, so perhaps Maladolescenza should be admired for the preservation of this power thirty years after its release. However, the shock value is the only reason why the film is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> The film has defenders. However, just like Nazism.
