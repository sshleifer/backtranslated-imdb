A cast of TV movies and guest series from the 80s (Misty Rowe, Pamela Hemsley, Clevon Little, Seymour Cassel among many others) in the history of a photographer who dreams of killing his models. Of course, models and other people are beginning to be worried, causing various complications. <br /> <br /> An over-do not-so-good thriller has enough nudity and violence to get an R grade, but not enough material to create real interest. This is best described as the type of film that gave the Cinemax cable channel an alternative name Skinamax. I really do not see the point of watching it unless you have to see every dingy thriller. (I must also comment that this movie is full of smoking, to the extent that it becomes funny when someone lights up)
