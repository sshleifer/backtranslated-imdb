After watching and worshiping Postal (yes, I really loved Postal), I decided to try another movie Uwe Bolla and chose Seed because I came across it at a local DVD store and it has to be one of his better movies. <br /> <br /> While the first 10-15 minutes of the film was very promising and it seemed that it is the beginning of not very mainstream psychological thriller, it soon fell from it and eventually it was demoted to one of the largest general films, which until now I have seen, including a huge number of feature holes, unrealistic emotional reactions and activities below the norm. It seems that Boll did his best to come up with a decent story, but after a while he just gave up. Maybe he should stick to comedy ?! The advantage of this movie is that it manages to create a general frightening atmosphere, that the special effects are better than I expected, and the soundtrack fits well with the general atmosphere, but the unbalanced pace of this film combined with its overall character makes you watch for half an hour, it was quite laborious, which completely ruined my experience. The shocking scenes are very well done, but it seems that they are there only for the value of shock. And let's not forget about the work of the camera, which sometimes was quite bland. <br /> <br /> I hope that Uwe Boll one day will learn what a good movie is doing, because it seems like making a decent movie from time to time. The seed is simply not one of them.
