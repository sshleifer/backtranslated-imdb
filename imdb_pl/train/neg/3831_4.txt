I will have to disagree with the previous commentary and Maltin's side. This is the second degree, too vicious western who creaks and moans, trying to traverse his main theme of the Wild West, tamed and pushed aside by the constant march of time. He would like to be in the "Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid" tradition, but he lacks the thrill and charm of this film. Andrew McLaglen's direction is inert, and the last 30 minutes are a real treat, with the incomprehensible strategy of the characters Charlton Heston and Chris Mitchum. (Someone gave me a shout, if you can explain to me why they set the hill on fire). There was something soulless in the whole treatment of the rape scene, and the woman's reaction certainly did not ring. Coburn is very nasty, because half-breed escaped convicted to revenge, but all his escort companions are underdeveloped (they are like bowling pins that can be knocked down one by one when history moves). Michael Parks presents one of his typical, sluggish, sluggish, muttering performances, but in this case it was appropriate because his modern style of sheriff symbolizes the complacency that technological progress can bring.
