It was a landmark event in my life watching movie. I went to see it in the theater when it came out. I was completely surprised how bad it was. Films like this make you wonder who earned money and who is entitled to a favor - a very, very big favor. The special effects are absolutely on the first level, just as in any first year student could do them. Take the rubber bats on the strings, do not try to hide the strings, the arrows that appear to be drawn on the film and look like the shape of an arrow that you find on the street sign and a funny storyline. Ed Wood created masterpieces compared to "Conquest." Every student of the film should see this thing to know the very definition of the bad movie.
