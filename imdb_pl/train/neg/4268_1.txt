I remembered the program when I was a child. I do not remember too much about it, just a few small things about characters. for some reason I remembered that it was very intense. it was also really very early in the morning in PA. Finally, after long browsing the internet, I found an episode. the first episode is not smaller. Criminey! This show was so horrible. apparently, this was done only to show children playing in a lazer and have a great time. The show opens bhodi li, telling my mother "my names are not Christopher, I'm bhodi li-PHOTON WARRIOR !!!!!" we are then forced to watch kids playing Lazer for the song "foot loose". not just a quick piece, but the whole song. ahhhhhhhhh my brain hurts just thinking about it. oh yes, and if I could not get worse, you can not even see laser beams from their guns. it's like they just ran around the song "loosefoot". Later, after bhodi goes into space or wherever, they have a painful fight with laser guns for Phil Collins' song su-su-sudio. ah, trust me, you do not want to know the rest. What can I say ...... LIGHTNING LIGHT !!!!!!!!!!!
