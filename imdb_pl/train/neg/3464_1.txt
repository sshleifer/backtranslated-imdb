It seems that a few people who reviewed the movie only watched it first because it was filmed near their place of residence. How is it with calling support? If this movie was filmed near the place where I lived, I would not mention it in my review. It's terrible! Several reviews state that this movie is a tricky or insolent horror film, it is not. The sad thing is that this movie is being reviewed as a comedy that makes it not only a bad horror attempt, but also a comedy. I did, however, laugh at how unbelievably bad this movie was. <br /> <br /> This film has two good things: a mask and a selected weapon, unfortunately it would be interesting to watch the time and half of the mask and the weapon lying on the table, and then watching the trash. The social commentary behind the film is also funny, juvenile and stupid. Do not worry about this movie, you've already wasted time reading this review, do not waste this movie anymore. Arrggghhh! It's annoying that such movies are even made. I expected that the entire cast of the crew will be attributed to Alan Smithee, the name used when the person, usually the director, does not want to be awarded a film because it is so bad. <br /> <br /> There's nothing happening in this movie, I spent $ 1.19 on rent and I felt that I was cheated. Avoid. 1 out of 10
