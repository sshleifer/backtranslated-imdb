I read some spurting reviews here at IMDb and thought that I gave this film a look. Disappointed. On the plus side, men are good, and a few interesting photos, but as a whole this movie is not convincing. It seems that he is full of his own indulgent weight in an attempt to say something meaningful, but he falls short and in total the picture is an unconvincing mess. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films classified as noir, which can be defined as follows: <br /> <br /> "Film noir is marked by the mood of pessimism, fatalism, threat and cynical figures." <br /> <br /> Well, here's the story. : 3 losers came across each other with their collective problems, which include mental illness, alcoholism, laziness, indebtedness, etc. And they are plotting together to kidnap and outsmart each other. <br /> <br /> It would be a much better movie if history is limited to kidnapping and not to the hijackers' failure. I thought that the female advantage was far beyond its depth and turned out to be an amateur actress. <br /> <br /> During good moments, I finished feeling that I had wasted my time. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
