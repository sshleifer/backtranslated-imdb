Of course, many talented crew members have been working on this film, so do not even look at credits at the end, just keep them in front of them. No one was interested in watching this movie, only 3 were in the theater; two fainted after 10 minutes and were lucky. "Monsters" is an unemployed Star Trek 2 worm, "Khan's Wrath" and rejected projects of cosmic creatures in "Alien". The creators of the film apparently did not want to overshadow the monsters from the third-level film, so they hired more actors who apparently did not learn to memorize their lines, and in some cases learned to pronounce words before filming. Some scenes are incredibly inept in transmitting what is about to happen if there is something. If you are so unhappy that you are in the theater where the movie is being screened, and you do not pass out, you will laugh at what is to be the frightening or tense moments of the movie. The improbability of a few scenes will simply stun you, and the regular spitting out of Stephen Dorff's words "Queen of Maria curses" evokes the feeling of anyone paying to see. If you need to see this movie, do yourself a favor and wait for it to be in a container for bargains in the video store. If there is any justice in the film industry, one of the main actors will be there to borrow it.
