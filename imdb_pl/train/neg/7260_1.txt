"A Town Called Hell" (aka "A Town Called Bastard"), a British-Spanish co-production, was created after the success of Clint Eastwood in the Italian trilogy "Man With No Name". The template used in most of these films was the recruitment of recognized American actors whose careers were largely in decline and dubbed their voices. This film is no exception, except for the fact that they also used British actors. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to summarize the story, but here. The story begins with rebels or anything else, led by Robert Shaw and Marina Landau invading the church and killing everyone inside, including the priest. Quickly go to the theme of the city a few years later, where the character Shaw pretends to be a priest. The mayor of the city (Telly Savalas) is a brutal leader who does not think about administering justice with his pistol. <br /> <br /> Put in a mourning widow of Alvira (Stella Stevens), who is looking for a killer's husband. Let us add to this the fact that he drives a caravan lying dead as in a coffin so that God knows why. After murdering the mayor through his follower La Bomba (Al Lettieri), the city is attacked by a federal colonel (Landau) in search of a rebel leader (sorry, but my name escapes). The colonel takes over the city and begins to conscientiously kill the city's inhabitants to force them to reveal the identity of the leader. <br /> <br /> Even if they opened the film side by side, it is difficult to say from the dialog box that the characters Landau and Shaw know each other. A blind man (Fernando Rey) claims he can identify the rebel leader by touching his face. It does this and .............................................. < br /> <br /> I am sure that the directors regretted this film. It's just terrible and deserving of my terrifying '1' rating. Shaw spends most of the film repairing his characteristic look at anyone who is handy. Even Landau can not save this movie. Beautiful Mrs. Stevens is also completely wasted here. Just last year I made "The Ballad of Cable Hogue" by Peckinpah, considering it strange that it will appear in this mess of the movie. Savalas made a few of these photos ("Pancho Villa" and "Horror Express" come to mind) during the period before the Kojak. Michael Craig is also in this form as "Paco". <br /> <br /> Fernando Rey appeared in many of these "westerns", although he appeared to play the villain in two films "French Connection". Al Lettieri would also appear as the Godfather (1972) and move on to other memorable roles before his untimely death in 1975. <br /> <br /> Certainly the version I watched lasted only 88 minutes instead of longer working times of 95 or 97 minutes on IMDb, but I do not see where an additional 7 or 8 minutes would make a significant difference. <br /> <br /> Avoid this.
