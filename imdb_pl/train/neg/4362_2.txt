A group of people who look like aliens who are going to Earth to eat the earth on the planet of prehistoric beasts, instead all eat corns and behave delays. Filled with materials from "Planet of the Dinosuars" and terrible jokes is definitely indispensable. Acting is terrible too, and although it's not as bad as a "Chickboxer" (what movie can it be?), It's still a terrible hideous thing. 90-minute working time seems like an eternity and you probably curse your life, so do yourself a big favor and just keep going, skip this bad movie, there's nothing to see. <br /> <br /> The creators of the movie try to sell this turd as the MST3K style, making fun of the film they made a decade earlier, and it works to some extent, it's still not worth a look, Ariauna Albright is hot, but Lilith Stabs has a rather unattractive talking voice. /> <br /> My class: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: joke commentary, 17 Behind the scenes featured; 7 minutes In the black scene; Reporting by Jessica Mills; Art Gallery; and the original trailer
