A creepy and voluptuous wolf. The young "Red" is wearing full makeup and extremely short shorts and robes. About 20 minutes passed and I realized that the pedophile's dreams came true. "Up-beat" music sounds like something I hear in a strip club. I think this movie is a sick joke - it's not a family movie. Gross, I'm glad I watched it with my daughter, I do not want her to think it's normal that families are watching quasi-child porn together. Very badly, very sad that it is sold as a family movie, Joey Fatone will probably be ashamed that he was in it. And what about advertising this as "spectacular special effects"? The effects look low, terrible.
