Well, I'm going with another B industry movie. It's pretty sad to see badly made films, but I do not care if Industry B or Industry C produces this movie. Show some effort in your work. The characters are really bad. Acting is not questioned in this (surprise), but the plot is. How tight a squad can testify that two of their soldiers have been killed and then act as if nothing happened. What upset me was that the writer even threw the other members of the scene in which they joked about how nice it is in the doctor's ass. Give me a break.
