I really wanted to see this movie and wait for months to get it through our Blockbuster Total Access account. When he appeared in our mailbox, I threw him straight into the DVD player. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed, which in turn drove me crazy. I'll give a chance to every movie, even if I want to get out of the theater / press "stop". I watched it all the way, but I did not get any of it, but frustration. <br /> <br /> Acting was very, very good, but that was it. Nothing is explained; while we understand that Mathieu falls into depression and lands in a psychiatric ward, we never get an insight into his "fall". We understand that he and Cedric are falling apart, again, we do not see it happen or WHY this happened. During an interview with a physician, Mathieu Cedric reveals that he has betrayed him once, but it is not a big deal. I expected to see it in flashbacks, but no - nothing. We also get directions that Cedric was the one who brought Mat to the hospital - but AGAIN, we do not see this. <br /> <br /> I know that some movies are the basis of "take what is", but this movie honestly took me away. When Pierre, ex Cedric, appears in the club and begins to worry, we do not see him or her hair until the end, and it took me a long time to think that Pierre was an ex. His personality in the club and when Mat discovers him they are completely different. Maybe I'm even wrong to say that, it was so confusing. <br /> <br /> The movie expects you to learn everything and move with its chaotic, out of place and confusing pace. I can keep up with films such as "Pi", "Citizen Kane" and other movies that have flashbacks / left and right, but CU did not capture and did not retain the style. At the end of "Citizen Kane" you know what is happening and you discover the answer to the main secrets. CU leaves you. It has a grudge in his "we will not tell you a damn thing, make it up for yourself". It's like reading a book with included chapters and missing pages. <br /> <br /> Good game, as I said. I liked the characters, but the whole story was too disappointing.
