This movie was simple and simple. Okay, it's basically about a girl who gets raped, and to get revenge, she gets another guy who rapes a rapist. The rapist is an asshole, but the victim is partly guilty. I mean, they're both in the mood and they start kissing and so on, but when a rapist tries to have sex with her, he does not let the rapist rape her. The point is that the rape scene for a girl is very short and does not reveal anything or show anything, but when it comes to a rapist, it's a fairly long rape scene. There is nothing worth seeing in history. <br /> <br /> 3.2 / 10
