This is terribly bad and terribly embarrassing for a Canadian. We grow good wine. Our writers and poets are among the best in the world. National Ballet is counted among the top five companies in the world. BUT WE DO DANGEROUS FILMS! This one is not particularly bad. This is particularly typical and usually bad, shot in two-star hotels and public parks with a thin direction, high school level action and "gee whiz ... lets see what this button does on the camera?" Photo. If Michael Moriarity wanted to personalize Jack Nicholson so much, could not he at least have done the GOOD personification of Jack Nicholson? And if the film was shot in Vancouver, really one of the most beautiful cities in the world, as well as the yacht construction center (part of the "story"), why do we allow this endemic Canadian inferiority complex to dictate that it is a disguised Seattle? Not only am I crazy about this movie, I'm embarrassed and more than a little embarrassed. Australians do great things. We make a pretentious second-rate puff. Gawd !!!!!
