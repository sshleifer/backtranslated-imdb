This is a movie about tired but strangely children's stereotypes. Is the Nazi master of witches performing experiments related to sf in the basement? Oh, please! <br /> <br /> Striving for a creeping sense of horror and fear, the overall impression of the film is a very immature concept of fear. With no previous expectations, I remain with the old Xander with Buffy and the heroine with a monkey face who does not seem to know how to behave. He said that Adrienne Barbeau only met before in the much more pleasant "Cannibal Women in Avocado Jungle of Death". <br /> <br /> Camera and editing add a general impression of the crag.
