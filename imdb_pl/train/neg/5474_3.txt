To be honest, they did as well as they could, with a budget of five shillings and sixpence, but the dialogue was more tacky than the 9 kg emmental, and CGI was now a small old hat. maybe if some of the actors were not so perfectly sculpted from granite, the movie would be a little better too. To say that it was awful, to do this movie badly, if you want to see something that is completely upset, you have to sit and waste a few hours of your life looking at the "sickle" which is terribly horrible, but is actually good (some large alcoholic beverages are a bit bizarre.) Every way up, I liked the movie and it must be worth seeing if you have not seen it yet, just do not expect anything like "Jurassic park, lost world" or "apocalypto".
