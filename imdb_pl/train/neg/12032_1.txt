This movie was terrible. It was very hard for me to watch it. I did not understand the meaning of the film. What was the meaning of this movie? The soundtrack was bad, the acting was bad, and the story was uninspiring. The two main characters of the film were very boring, and their dialogue was uninteresting. There was no chemistry among any of the cast members. I do not know for sure, but I suspect that most of the actors are the first. The film could easily be reduced to about an hour and a half without losing the plot. This indicates how many useless scenes there were in the movie. I would rather have an ha channel within two hours of the movie. I want these two hours back! If you want to watch a good, fun movie that is family friendly and created by several Mormons, watch Napoleon Dynamite.
