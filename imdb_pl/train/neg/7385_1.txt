The movie is boring, characters and scenarios are unreal, unbelievable, the action is fun. This movie is a big mess. It seems that when the action music comes in, the most impressive stunt starts. Either the voice is called by Mr. McGregor, or the steven sang too much and that changed his voice. In this film there are far too many dialogues, and very badly acting on behalf of everyone. The film is a great sleep therapy. The fight is funny. The effect of changing the shape of the eyes in drug-dependent females was poor. The main villain was a joke, and his character was poorly developed. The main villain was used to explain the story through interrogation, he just cast random threads in such as (spoiler) "CTX (his drug designer) will be in the supply of water," which has never been touched in the conclusion or even mentioned again in the film. This movie is highly recommended.
