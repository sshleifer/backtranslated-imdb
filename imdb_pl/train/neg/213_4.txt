Yes, indeed, it could have been a good movie. Honey, sorry for the poetic license, but it's not a triangle! An interesting story, unfortunately badly told. The image is sometimes weird, sometimes OK, the picture looks crowded and narrow. Sound requires more attention (usually in the case of Romanian films), light and color filters are sometimes badly chosen. The soundtrack is short and does not help in the action. About acting ... sorry, but the best actress is the housekeeper. Others behave immaturely and can not convince the viewer. Acting is poetic when it should be realistic and realistic when it should be poetic. It's a picture for adults, told by children. Just bother if you're very curious.
