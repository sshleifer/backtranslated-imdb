The Comeback begins to look promising, with a brutal death scene through a mask bearing the killer. The mask itself is also pretty cool and looks almost identical to the one used in the slasher movie from the 90s "Grandma". Since then, the film is mostly boring. We get a few more deaths that are good again, but they're gone. The reason why death is so good is that they are crazy and bloody. The story of the film is actually quite interesting and it would work very well if it was not so boring in the majority. <br /> <br /> I would avoid this unless you're a die-hard collector - there is not enough here to make him an average slass.
