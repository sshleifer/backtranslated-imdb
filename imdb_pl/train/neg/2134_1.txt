You'll expect more with this cast and budget. <br /> <br /> John Cusack made a number that borders on this strange but still works. Neither he nor his sister nor Sir Ben could do anything to save this parody of trivial, badly written trash. <br /> <br /> The film is nothing but a series of sight and the poor. The plot goes nowhere, the letter is invented, senseless, and paper characters. If you think a movie is three-dimensional, in which story and characters bring depth to images, this smelly becomes as flat as a steamship steamer. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Dan Akroyd in this has brought back memories of another really awful movie, 1991 Nothing but Trouble. Honestly, this movie is a project that kills careers and releases agents.
