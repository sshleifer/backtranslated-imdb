I tried to sit through all this annoying mess, but I could not do it. Brad Dourif was absolutely sucked out of the lead role, and the cast was only slightly worse. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is simply absurd, from a terrible game to a ridiculous phrase to a stupid storyline. <br /> <br /> Total waste of time; do not worry. Canal therapy would be more pleasant. Bamboo pieces under the nails would be much nicer. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie Uwe Bolla would only be a little worse. You have an idea?
