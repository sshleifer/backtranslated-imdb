Seriously bad movie. <br /> <br /> First, the movie starts with a policeman and his partner parked in front of the warehouse / furniture store. The "bad" policeman takes the girl they have been arrested to the attic of the warehouse while the novice sits outside and wonders what's going on. The "bad" policeman eventually returns with a heavy sack, and the novice does not think there are any problems, but he still wonders what was in the bag, so he asks, gets a nonsense answer, and then everything is OK (for now). <br /> <br /> "Bad" policeman repeats this process, and even once with the scene tits (a little better). But in the end people start to catch up, which took some time, considering how obvious it was. One girl gets a voodoo curse on her in case she's dead, just like you. Now the "bad" policeman finally kills this magically protected bitch, and then gets rid of the body in the sailor's bag. <br /> <br /> If she put oogey-boogey magic on her, she has lots of eye shadow to show that she can be a zombie ... also a magic curse that makes all other girls become "monsters". Some girls meet with a guy who apparently is a currency specialist and offers them a ride (they look normal to him). But when girls see other people, such as the husband of one girl, he goes crazy because he is hideous (some people go crazy, but others do not even notice it) .... a huge plot hole. <br /> <br /> So to finish, shadow monsters kill an "evil" cop who in turn becomes a zombie in the last scene. It was as if they were trying to prepare us for the sequel! As everyone would like to see the second part of this cow.
