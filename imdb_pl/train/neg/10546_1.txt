<br /> <br /> Recently I watched this cruelty in my film program and I thought it was awful, as I said in my slogan, it was pretentious, trivial, petty and phenomenally important. <br /> <br /> I consider myself a film fan and all the things that the movie has to offer. If I want to watch a documentary at the Cannes festival, I will watch A & E .... and probably would be much more objective. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend it, period. <br /> <br />
