Wow! I am shocked when I learned that this is a small world and that we are all connected to each other. What a waste of 88 minutes. John Dunne put it much better in one sentence. "No man is an island." Acting was not bad. The kids were doing their best, but sometimes the story became so thin that I could not follow him, and the only real "hero" in the movie goes to jail after the maid is tormenting him. I do not know. I just do not understand it. Well.
