There was a lot of love in Wes Anderson's "Fantastic Mr. Fox", but all love is for him. Of course, a lot of time and effort was put into creating this extremely conscious, bizarre universe, but if only the same time and effort was put into the script to try to make it fun. Disturbing is that I think it was and it's the best that Wes Anderson could come up with. <br /> <br /> Animation is good in close-ups of animals, but when the camera is on, everything becomes really sharp on the eyes and to be honest it looks a little mess. There was nothing special about acting, and Wes decided to pick his buddies and big names for more specialized voice actors who could probably improve the movie. I am sure that George Clooney's CV in the form of an acting voice game consists of two episodic performances in South Park, one of them in which he played the dog. <br /> <br /> The film is too happy and too hard to be wise and different and typical, despite the fact that the film takes place in England, all good animals are typical Americans playing baseball, while bad guys are stereotypical Englishmen with the most insulting English accents. I can not stress how much a waste of time this movie is. I did not laugh at once.
