The review of this cheap STV foywonder goes straight to the head. Make sure you read it. In case you do not do it, a group of scientists goes deep into the forests of the Pacific Northwest to bury the band of bones in the animal cemetery. The Big Foot family does not approach it with courtesy and chooses the team one by one, largely off screen. Big Foot itself has a clearly monkey-like face, but it's less frightening than Harry from HARRY AND HENDERSON. Most of the film has wooden, general actors pretending to be scientists who roam the forest and escape. It's a movie without a budget that does not have much to do, at least on the screen. We watch the sexiest woman taking a shower while one of her male comrades is watching, but nothing comes of it.
