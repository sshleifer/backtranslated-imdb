Every now and then a group of friends, with a minimal budget, but with enthusiasm and talent, will create a low-budget masterpiece that destroys the world of horror. Raimi and what. he did it with The Evil Dead, Jackson and his friends managed Bad Taste; and Myrick and Sanchez have partnered with The Blair Witch Project. <br /> <br /> However, director Todd Sheets and his colleagues are destined to sink into relative oblivion, if Zombie Bloodbath is something that you can go through. Lesson on how not to make a cheap horror, this unfortunate effort (about the zombie plague with meat eating) reminds you that although many people now have access to a video camera, most should not give them a hint to try their hand at creating a full-length movie. <br /> <br /> It's not that the Sheets do not want a nicely framed shot (some of its angles and movements are really pretty good), but rather that a) has a bad script b) has a poor cast c) he does not realize that he has a bad script and a cast. This means that the final movie is extremely amateur and unlikely to be viewed entirely by anyone else, like full-fledged zombie filmmakers (like me) or cast members and crew (like those who gave the film positive comments). <br /> <br /> Zombie Bloodbath is of course directed at unbridled dogs-gore, and Sheets (who currently has 34 titles under his direction as a director) certainly does everything to please, with buckets of offal and blood thrown at every opportunity . But while these moments are undeniably strange, they are not very convincing and will soon become quite tedious. <br /> <br /> In summary, this is a really bad movie, almost without the possibility of redemption. With the exception of two: <br /> <br /> First of all, it contains one of the largest ciboros in the history of the film, written by Jerry Angell, who plays Larry (and several zombies). The splendor of his barnet (combined with the attractive mustache) is the reason why you can watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Second, it has "pathetic zombie stealth": carnal corpses that await unhappy victims to wander, before jumping out of their hiding place, to carry out a weak attack that requires almost no effort to escape. Most known for the fact that for many hours lurking outside the door, waiting for someone to open it, "pathetic zombies from hiding" sometimes hide behind low walls or sit in churches posing as members of the congregation. <br /> <br /> Usually this film will get 1/10 for me, but on the occasion of Jerry Angell's flowing logs, I will generously increase my rating to 2/10.
