This film does not really promote children to be kinder and have a better attitude, how a family movie should be, and it would not be considered family, because it has some things in it that children should not watch. Not the best ABC movie if you ask me about it. If there were fewer sexual themes in the film, maybe it would be better. Hollywood does nothing to make the film better by adding it in sexual situations. There is really no reason for them. At least this is a TV movie. I would not want to waste money on this rubbish by renting it. If you have other things to do than watching this movie, go to them.
