Man, what the hell were the people who shot this movie? And more importantly, where can I get them? The opening scene sets the tone of the film: a woman wriggling naked in a circle of fire, transforming into a werewolf. And this is not the transformation of the "American werewolf" Rick Baker, people. We're talking about the worst make-up ever made on film. I can only imagine a stoned Italian glue on the naked Annika Borel (who plays Daniela, the heroine of the movie (is that a word?)) And asking her to throw herself in a fur coat. That's wrong. <br /> <br /> From here you do not do much better. Minutes are wasted when the scenery chews male actors about Daniela and her condition or something (I do not remember, but the dialogue is so bad if you do not laugh at it, cry). <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that Daniela is not even a werewolf, he's a psycho that's mental every time a man is around (understandable because he's been raped as a child), so he thinks he's a werewolf like her ancestor (initial scene). He can not resist breaking the throat of every man he meets, and she wants to be loved! Things start looking for Daniela, who meets with a stunter in love who does not release her "episodes". Check the assembly here, one of the most cordial you will ever see (laughing and squeezing after diving through the window). <br /> <br /> Daniela's happiness can not stand, because the film takes a brutal turn, it is suddenly brutally beaten and raped by a group of thugs who kill the stuntman. Recalling "I spit on your grave," Daniel draws a bloody revenge on the rapists. <br /> <br /> This is 100 minutes of my life I will never come back. But hey, it's a game you play when you're a movie geek.
