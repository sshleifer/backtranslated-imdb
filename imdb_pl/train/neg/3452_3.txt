I decided to watch the film at the recent Dubai Film Festival because it was chosen to the prestigious competition section of the Cannes film festival. I was surprised that Cannes could be so out of place in quality assessment. <br /> <br /> The movie, as some reviewers have pointed out, does not have many shots - but the innate violence is repulsive. Imagine you are killing an enemy / competitor in front of your young son ... or forcing someone to eat a porcelain spoon to prove loyalty. In Copolla's Godfather, there are some hints about the contrasting sons of Corleone, which seem to come back here in this Chinese / Hong Kong film, but their quality is just as different as chalk and cheese. <br /> <br /> This video is recommended only for drug-related junkies. There is no big cinema here. At best, it can be considered better than the usual Run Run Shaw production for production values.
