Do not be fooled by the name of this movie. In fact, Jake Speed ​​is probably the most lazy hero in the action that has ever been filmed. When Jake Speed ​​does not save virgin girls from evil madmen who are often absent, he is seriously relaxed. Perhaps this gives him charm, but in my opinion, the hero of the action should not "loose" whenever he has a chance. Also, unlike other bold heroes who usually have an impressive list of talents, this man does not have any, unless of course you call a sleeping talent. In any case, this movie is basically worthless, the letter is below the norm, and the action, when it is, is very bad. (The machine guns in the jeep were not bad, but that's all) So if you're in the mood to watch a movie that is a remedy for insomnia, this piece is perfect for you - the hero not only goes to sleep, but also his audience.
