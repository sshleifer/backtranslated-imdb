A wanderer lives on the outskirts of French society, in life with no sense, purpose and direction. <br /> <br /> I watched it because of all the stellar reviews, but I'm afraid I missed something. Mony's character has little or no personality, while drifting through life being rude to people, becoming high and contributing nothing to anyone's life. It is not interesting or exciting. It is simply useless. <br /> <br /> I saw and knew enough of such people: there is no secret to what they do. It's just lazy bums. I would not want Mona to be close to me because she has a tendency to steal anything that is not nailed, and leave friends on the ice. Sure, she's mysterious - because she has nothing. Many of the junkies, vines and tramps I have seen are enigmatic; I would also not like to see a movie about them. <br /> <br /> Maybe there is something that I missed completely. Otherwise, I assume that all reviews come from people who assume that everything the French director has done is high.
