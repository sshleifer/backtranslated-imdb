I could not say if "The Screaming Skull" tried to be a rip off of Hitchcock or a modernized homage to Edgar Allen Poe. Nowadays somebody could chop it up and present it as one of those episodes of the TV anthology from the old "Tales From The Dark Side" ... but only after extensive rewriting. <br /> <br /> It is sad that it seems like a cool, nasty little story trying to get out from under the rubble of this movie, and the actors apparently do everything in their power, both thanks to talent and material, with which they must work. But the director just did not know how to make a dramatic scene; special effects simply did not work; the scenario so clearly telegraphically described the threads that the spouse could see them; The soundtrack continued to play the German music "oompah band" when it was meant to try to scare the audience. <br /> <br /> They tried; They tried very hard. But this is interesting only as a piece from the era. I suppose that a very young person who has not seen too much uncertainty or horror can get a payoff for the "Screaming Skull", but someone who is young probably will not get most of the subtext or fiction motivation. ("Mom, why is this nice man trying to scare a wriggling, terrified kitten?")
