It's hard to call The Grudge horror. At best, it made me jump a bit in a few moments. <br /> <br /> If someone forgets (unsuccessful) scary dimension and looks at other parts of the movie, he is disappointed again. Acting is fine, but not great. The story can be a bit interesting at first, while someone is trying to get what's going on. But to the end it is understood that there is not much to understand. "Horrible" items sometimes seem to be added to the script for no reason ... <br /> <br /> So ... (yawning) See this movie if you have nothing more interesting to do, like cutting a carrot or looking at clouds.
