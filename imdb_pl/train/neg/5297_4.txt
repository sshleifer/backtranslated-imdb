It really annoys my mind when someone encounters such a movie and claims that it is one of the worst slasher movies. This is definitely not one of the worst, but it is not a good movie, but not the worst. Go see something like Death Nurse or Bloody Lake, then come back to me and tell me if you think that Night brings Charlie is the worst. The film has a decent work with the camera and editing, which is much more than I can say about many more unknown Slasher films. <br /> <br /> The film does not bring death on the screen, there is one death you see, as it saw trimming the neck, but all other deaths are not interesting. But the lack of violence on the graphic screen does not mean that it is not a more modest movie, only bad. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film was not to be taken too seriously. The film appeared at the end of the second slasher cycle, so it certainly was a reflection on the traditional elements of the slass, made in a tongue on the cheek. For example, after killing, Charlie approaches the "welcome" sign of the city and means a smaller population. This is something that can only laugh. <br /> <br /> If you like slasher movies, definitely give this movie a watch. It's a bit different than your regular movie with the possibility of two killers, but not too much. The movie's comedy tells the audience to relax and not take the movie, so ugly sick. You can forget about the movie, you can remember it. I remember it because I love this name.
