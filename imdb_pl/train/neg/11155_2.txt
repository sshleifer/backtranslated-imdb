The only reason I even saw it was because I found it in my local library (and I would ruthlessly criticize them for wasting public money), and despite lots of tits and ass, you did not have to wait long to realize the fast scroll button was my friend. Horrible direction, working with a camera for pedestrians, sporadically malfunctioning, poor effects and one of the worst scenarios that caused dissatisfaction with watching (as it was, horribly maimed and maimed) long long time. The best laughs actually come from the movie "Making of ..." in which the poor sapi involved in this mess of HDV try to justify their poor efforts, as if they were working on something special, instead of something that will not be completely forgotten next week. Wait! Except for the fact that someone somehow lured Tippi "The Birds" Hedren, all the people to do parts, along with Kane "Friday the 13th" Hodder! How did it happen, I'll never know and honestly, I do not care. Watch at your own risk and do not say that you have not been warned. This is filming in his pretentious, cowardly worst. He gets only 2 from me for having handsome, nude women, and even then, barely.
