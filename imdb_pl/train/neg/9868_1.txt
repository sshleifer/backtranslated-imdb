I almost never comment on the movies, but I've seen 5 great reviews of this "movie" and decided that I have to think about my own review. My instructor received this video in the mail, mixed up with his dorms (AMPAS, aka guys who vote for Oscars), and was so impressed with how horribly constructed this movie was that he introduced it to our class show us how to NOT make a movie . <br /> <br /> This movie has no plot, the scenes are horribly edited (often using faux "24" picture-in-picture styles) and performances (especially the one who does not even behave like a bad actress) they are mostly unbearable. Someone really did not understand the meaning of the introduction, namely the establishment of a story. There is no configuration! Halfway through the movie, neither me nor the rest of the class knew what the movie should be about. The opening shot of the crane, which sets up some kind of murder, is never addressed, and now, when I think about it, it was probably supposed to be flash-forward, and the rest of the movie was a flashback, but it takes the scene directly to the next without any indication as such . <br /> <br /> Bah, I could really continue and continue. At least this movie gives me new confidence in my own filming ability.
