No, this is not about this fairy tale with the pumpkin trainer, the godfather and glass slippers, but if I had to work out, I would have to mess it up for you, which I will not do. But do not let curiosity overwhelm you because this movie is not fantastic. This is one of those films that are beginning to promise before they betray the audience with cheap tactics and incoherent plot. And this is a real horror story. <br /> <br /> Yoon-hee (To Ji-Won) and Hyun-soo (Shin Se-kyeong) are your perfect mother and daughter. One of them is a successful plastic surgeon and the other is your obedient, obedient and beautiful teenage daughter. Their relationship is like a gloved hand, so close that one could think of them more as siblings than about a parental child. But things are starting to fail (not always) when the friends of Hyun-soo, on whom Yoon-hee operated, start to go berserk. <br /> <br /> Maybe this is a warning for the public and for those Korean ladies who do not stick their eyelids when they fall under the knife, if you believe the news. The only really frightening moments are those scenes in plastic surgery, though somehow I thought Kim Ki-duk's time was more gore when he presented and described what was happening during the operation itself. <br /> <br /> This is a story about two halves, the fist is an attempt to shake viewers with the standard fear tactics, which, I admit, has reached me from time to time. However, the other half turned the film into mindless mumbo-jumbo melodramatics, and was quite invented to force its ideas on it. Some things are starting to make no sense, and although attempts are always made to explain, you probably will not buy it, not because the horrors are logical at first. <br /> <br /> They are all beautiful and there is a clear lack of male presence in addition to the negligible role of the cop. But hey, I'm not complaining, though the story could be greatly improved. I recommend you watch it, only if you are a fan of the average Korean horror movie on VCD. Watch out for those moments without a face!
