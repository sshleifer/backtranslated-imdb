What's up with Robert's "Pretentious" Altman? Did he save on lighting? In this boring movie, everything was so dark it was ridiculous. I mean, have you ever seen a law office where everyone works by candlelight? <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. In fact, do not waste time on everything that Altman does: it's all pretentiously wasting a movie.
