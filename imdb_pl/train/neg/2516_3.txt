Unfortunately, I do not remember this book anymore, but I remember that I was charmed by the story of Edgar Wallace. This film represents typical German production of low quality. It does not attract my attention - although the story itself is good, it is simply badly adopted. In the center of misery there are characters that are too simple and exaggerated - they have no nuances in their performances. Even well-known and popular German actors Joachim Fuchsberger and Eddy Aren can not save this poor performance. However, there is hope ... I was told that the films following this are getting better. In conclusion, I must say that this movie does not deserve a movie screen, but it may be enough for a lazy afternoon.
