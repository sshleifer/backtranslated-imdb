This movie was so bad! That was awful! That was awful! I can not stress it enough! Acting, directing, history, characters and everything about it were bad! It was so trivial and trivial. Do not be fooled by the cover or the "Massacre in Texas" tag line, nothing to laugh about. Are you kidding me! It was funny. <br /> <br /> The first 2 minutes of the movie are good until it reaches the main character of Brendan, OK, now turn it off. What I got from the film is: The ugly, annoying and immature population goes to the cabin in the middle of the forest, and the clown who sings nursery rhymes kills them in an unoriginal and false manner. <br /> <br /> This movie was a waste of my time and money, and it would be a waste of money and time! I'm scrolling forward most of the movie because it was so scary, I just wanted to see how every bad actor died, and it still was not worth it! Looking at the cover is a waste of time. This is really the worst movie EVER! Rating: does not deserve one.
