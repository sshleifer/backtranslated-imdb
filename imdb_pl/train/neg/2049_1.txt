At least I could enjoy the ridiculousness of the movie, which is surprising because I could barely sit by it. Honestly, I suppose the DVD cover costs more than the entire movie. And saying that it is the same director as The Boogeyman, when a new version appeared ... nice guys, it was so misleading to get me involved. The only thing that frustrated me more than the unbearable game of imitator was his hair style. Usually you only see hair on a ten-year-old boy, and the character behaved like that. The film looks like it was filmed by a student from D + from a film school, excited about the possibility of using any film technique that he learned during the lesson .... sometimes, less is more of a buddy. Because of this, I would get lost due to accidental twists of action that did not lead to nowhere or were unexplained. All this makes the movie bad, but when the ending is not even close to breaking it, it is an extremely bad movie. This is undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen, including the French final movie of my friends for the last year of high school, but hey, maybe I'm a bit biased, that means I've managed to play extra. P.S. I do not even think it deserves a star ... even half. NO FOR YOU !!
