I read Rice's novel with interest and began to admire its characters and poignant story based on historical truths. <br /> <br /> However, after this catastrophic adaptation, I was simply GOOD. The cast was based only on physical appearance, not on the actor's talent (with the obvious exception of Peter Gallagher, who was neither fair-haired nor able to get out of a wet paper bag). Embarrassingly clumsy and inconsistent attempts to influence the French accent were fun, but not fun. I turned on this vague and melodramatic flak and was surprised that I had reached the end. <br /> <br /> A warning to novel fans - stay away from it.
