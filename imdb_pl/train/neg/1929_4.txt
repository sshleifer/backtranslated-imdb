Some praise -Atlantis: -The Lost Empire- as Disney's adventure for adults. I do not think - at least not for adult adults. <br /> <br /> This scenario suggests the beginning of a movie in action that hit someone as a type of shit that can no longer be sold to adults. "Crack staff" of many older adventure movies has been done well before (think The Dirty Dozen), but -Atlantis - represents one of the worse films in this theme. Characters are weak. Even the background from which each member comes from seems to be awkward at best. MD / Medicine Man, a mechanic dealing with the tombs, whose father always wanted to have sons, if we did not see them at least before, we've seen mix-and-match quarrels before. The story of how one companion, Vinny played by Don Novello (father Guido Sarducci), went completely unconvincing from the florist to demolition. <br /> <br /> Only the main character, Milo Thatch, a young scientist obsessed with Atlantis by Michael J. Fox, has any depth for him. The search for Atlantis by Milo is continued by his grandfather, who brought him up. The opening scene shows much younger Milo, who is ashamed sitting on his knee when his grandfather puts his helmet on his head. <br /> <br /> And although the heroes were slim at best, the best thing about Atlantis was the voice talent. Commander Rourke does not lose anything when James Garner preached. Although Rourke is quite a typical military type, Garner shows his ability to inhale life in the form simply by providing it. Garner's vocals are the most important. I'm sorry to say, Dying King Leonard Nimoy is nothing more than an obligatory one. In addition, Don Novello as a demolition expert, Vinny Santorini, was also known for one or two well-made, fun lines - but I always liked Father Guido Sarducci. <br /> <br /> Computer animation was also well done. BACKGROUND animation. The character's animation does nothing if it does not make the flat characters seem even flatter. In addition to landscapes, buildings and vehicles, there is not much to impress. <br /> <br /> The plot was the worst. Some say hackneyed or trite. I'm not so sure. Any useful plot can be transformed into something new with proper treatment. Shakespeare often began with a known story and story and was famous only for applying new paint. So treatment is a thing. And - Atlantis - of course it is not. <br /> <br /> I can not start entering all the logical gaps without the spoiler section. The plot was bad. The plot bridges latch like a string, and the end does not make sense. To add to this, the script and animation are filled with annoying sloppiness. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> In the beginning, when Milo reveals that the rune or Celtic symbols have been mis-translated, and the "Irish coast" should read "Coast Iceland ", we begin to have problems. The authors of the scenario would have to know the British as Eire or Eireann as "Ireland" and completely ignore the older, Latin term Hibernia. What's more, they must know about the Vikings' plot to name the more green island of Iceland and the island of ice Greenland. <br /> <br /> By making this a badly translated "letter", writers are doomed to require a runic version of English and post-Roman date on the script. Because it lasts long after Atlantis was about to sink in its undersea cave. And without any visible tips and less technology than Milo made the lettering much less credible. <br /> <br /> Shepherd's Journal could not have been written before the sinking of Atlantis, otherwise he would know nothing about the cave or the crystal lying "in the eye of the king." It must have been written after the sinking, but even without the technology that the Milo expedition had, what the hell someone had fallen into Lewiatan's hands. So how could he learn more about it? And why would it be written in Atlantian? <br /> <br /> Automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain these things. However, clairvoyance and astral travel do not require writing in Atlantian. So it must be some kind of automatic writing. Because no one in Atlantis can read, the spirits of crystal, radiant messages must be on the surface. It would make more sense. But it could be explained in the film: Milo could have a shepherd discovered that this power called him all his life - appeared in dreams etc. She had to be examined in the film. <br /> <br /> Atlantists should not just understand modern languages. No one expects that the original Indo-Europeans would be able to talk in Europe, just as the Romans would not understand that the hard "c" or their day became the French "ch" (pronounced as "sh" s, nie mniej!) <Br / > <br /> The present Atlantis lived before the cataclysm - when apparently * they could * read *, but now they are unable to read what they once did, or operate similar machines. <br /> <br /> Mass Illiteracy points to the key drawback of the film. NOTHING has happened in this culture. It seems to be suspended in the air until Milo can save him. Even if it seems that life is not a constant struggle for survival, no one wants to compose poetry or write novels and maybe it is a combination of Atlantic school systems that go down in the end and lack of good fiction that caused Atlantis to fall into illiteracy. <br /> <br /> Kida can be justified for not knowing how to read or operate a machine if she was so young when the Catastrophe of Stupidity started - but EVERY ** HARD ** only qualifies her father for Deification! ! Kashakima's stupidity almost wiped his people out of existence. They killed the group in a cataclysm, they were stuck in a dead end (not much died here, but they supervised mass slippage in culture and progress) until someone could take the crystal to kill everyone if they were not cooked in a lava because the Giant Robots were not there there to protect them. <br /> <br /> The screw of blue electricity should break the similarity of Kashakim when Kida tried to combine her father's image with the GREAT King of Atlantis! <br /> <br /> Although Milo was the only one who could read Atlantis, Rourke and others knew enough to look through the book of gibberish and find a page on the crystal - which he knew was crystal, not some stylized astrological or "phase" diagram of the sun. <br /> <br /> If Grandpa Milo told Rourke about it, he still does not explain how Rourke would suffer from Milo reading it as part of the book. Throwing the page - which was ridiculed in Rourke's hands, although Milo had apparently not found any torn pages in the book - was only to show the viewer that "something was wrong." Until the word "crystal" does not trigger an alarm in Milo's head that someone will try to steal it, Milo would not suspect anything. It's just thick announcements. <br /> <br /> The "double cross" of the team was not a change of form. We learned that Vinny, Sweet, Audrey and Cookie had been together with Rourke since the very beginning. However, the "change of heart" falls. It was a change and it had to be better motivated. Difficult to do with characters who were not given anything at the beginning. <br /> <br /> Irritating somewhat that the lava flows over the dome, instead of filling the rest of the area we are watching from the sequence. It's liquid; it will not flow through the protective dome until it fills all lower areas. <br /> <br /> Final SANDING! - and it makes no sense except to calm down political correctness. When the power source is restored, Atlantis is no longer a weak power, requiring coddling. Giant robot guards and aerial cycles firing blue lightning suggest that they have less to fear than they can. The technology is better than ours, and certainly to the beginning of the 20th century. In the end, Milo must teach Atlantis, why read? The whole idea is to leave your quiet, purified culture alone, and not send it to the hyperdrive. <br /> <br /> ** FINAL SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Maybe the thread of the Lost World and the setting of the turn of the century should give me a hint that this is more a tribute to clubs. The mistakes that I found in the film agree with this idea. But I do not understand why I should pay to see thin characters and create holes, because many of the dime novels also had them. Anyway, tales about pulp are part of "shit they can not sell to adults anymore." We have become a bit more sophisticated, and our pulp must also grow. The seekers of the lost Ark have not lost anything of their pulp and have avoided so much anger. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 - the movie is nice, but as I think about the story, it's getting smaller.
