"Iedereen Beroemd" has everything we can expect from a movie straight to the movie. It's a story about a man who believes that his daughter can be a star. All she needs is to take her to the stage, surrounded by cameras and reporters. A simple plan that must take away and do blackmail. The problem with the film is not the main story, but the way it is made. Everything is to be fun, but it is not. It is trivial and clumsy, the characters are shallow, and the final sequence is completely devoid of climax or emotion. The last sequence is probably the only scene in which you want to laugh, but only how pathetic the whole setting is.
