After watching this movie, I felt the irresistible need to unleash my frustration. Selma Blair is a fantastic, currently unappreciated actress, and Max Beesley was rather charming in "Kill Me Later". History, though not entirely original, certainly promised. Nothing of it mattered ... at all. <br /> <br /> I do not know what her arrangement is, but director Dan Lustig has virtually no talent as a director. She slowed down the recordings, recorded the recordings, turned the recordings, used the uncomfortable camera angles, used annoying color filters, made zillion rapid cuts, jumped back and forth on the timeline, and completed her with a repulsive "modern" soundtrack of blinding garbage. I do not remember when I last saw such incompetent work of film directing. Her ego must be huge in order to shed acting and telling the story, and direct its direction to the front and the middle so that members of the audience can see it. Their throats are crowded. <br /> <br /> There are some good scenes in "Kill Me Later" that show what could and should be. Unfortunately, when things started to promise, Mrs. Lustig would get into her bag with school movie tricks and start to spin again. Too bad, because Blair and Beesley had a good chemistry and you could say that the movie really had a good heart. 3/10
