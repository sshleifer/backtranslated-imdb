I do not know why, but despite all the noise on the NDP, I thought it was a new movie ..... the best material was used for BBC docs and NatGeo projects that you saw, if you are interested in natural programs ... he was repackaged with juicy narration and dramatic music for Disney to take advantage of the Earth Day - there are great moments and it's always nice to listen to Darth Vader ....... oops, ... ......... James Earl Jones says, but I was hoping for a breakthrough video, taking into account the new camera technology used to create this movie ...... has been cleaned for the children's audience, so you can see better material for free on youtube .... feel that we are behind something as critical as Koyannisquatsi (sic ), and this movie is definitely not that
