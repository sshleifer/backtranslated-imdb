It happened on a copy of this. Not mine, and if I spent my own money on it, I would find those responsible and demanding it! I can only say that it would be a terrible student movie. There is no understanding of the medium of the film. The action is ugly, the story would be rejected from the original Twilight Zone series as unoriginal and lame, and changing the tone of the main character's reaction to the "ghost" is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I can only agree that the "glowing" reviews of this film come from friends and family. I'm afraid it's not even bad fun. <br /> <br /> Amateurs in extreme conditions! <br /> <br /> Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!
