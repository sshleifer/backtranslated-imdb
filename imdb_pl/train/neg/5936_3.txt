This movie was a disaster from beginning to end. Interwoven with the performances of the "next generation of beautiful losers" are interviews with Bono and The Edge and the performers themselves. This leaves little time for the clips of Leonard Cohen himself, who dominates all others in the film with his commanding, but delicate presence, wisdom and humor. The rest are too busy trying to canonize him as Saint. Leonard or as an Old Testament prophet. Many performances are forgotten interpretations (especially Rufus and Martha Wainright) or nondescript achievements. Only Beth Orton and Anthony found themselves at a striking distance from their own versions of Leonard, applying some restraint. Annoying, small pseudo-avant-garde gestures are sprinkled by a film-like, out-of-focus red overlap on a lot of concert and interview footage, trembling camera vague, using the digital delay in some of Leonard Cohen's comments (making it harder to hear what he says) and scary , pretentious low drone under many parts of interviews (attempt to add gravity?). Really see the documentary "Songs of Life" produced by the BBC in 1988.
