I suppose this movie depicts the times in which it was made. Which is really sad, because at the deeper level the title "Vanishing Point", the original, is so ironic. I'm sure it was not like that, but the original was filmed in 1970 and released in 1971. A REAL "POLLUTION POINT" was the end of an era that almost ended in the early 1970s. <br /> <br / > In this remake, all counter-cultural elements have been removed and recreated more on the PC to reach a wider audience. "Sanitized for your Protection" <br /> <br /> Inserting scenes of American Indians was unjustified, and the idea of ​​the "noble purpose" of the journey was subtraction by adding. I am glad, however, that I looked at it, but I appreciate its originality much more. The original is iconic and golden. This remake is terrible.
