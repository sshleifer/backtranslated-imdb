This movie was made and devoted from my hometown. I remember the confusion on this subject and all the hullaoo about the fact that Molly Ringwald was in the city ... <br /> <br /> The story ... <br /> <br /> In principle, 20 years after the film was "Completed rest" without finishing, a group of film students decided to complete it - with tragic consequences. It would seem that someone does not want the film to end. <br /> <br /> The plot is weak. You have to remember that it is a comedy and therefore you have to treat it a bit like a slap, but it was not a real event. Characters are usually transperant, and the little information you receive about them just does not care about you, it seems irrelevant. It is strange that the accent Kylie as an Australian is again nice and nice to see the child with whom I went to school in the lead role. But that does not allow the film to be made. God knows why the creators thought they would get to Molly Ringwald. Perhaps because of the nature of the movie (in a way, it's a tribute to movies from the 80s / bad horror movies), but actually an Aussie actor would do it well. <br /> <br /> When it comes to casting, a lot of acting seemed hardened. Some of these kids (especially the two main chics - they played "director" and "producer") looked like they were trying to act. This is never a good look. What's more, the shots were rough about them. Perhaps illuminated? Just not as smooth as it used to be. <br /> <br /> Killer. Lord. Could it be less frightening? However, there are some shock factors and some serious scenes. I liked the film, but it was not great. It lasted 90 minutes, but it could go for less. Perhaps if they sharpened the script, it would be better. They had to kill many characters - but you could not kill them. Maybe if they killed fewer people and concentrated on a terrifying atmosphere, it would be better. <br /> <br /> Now I know it's a comedy, and the elements were fun. Or so unbelievable that they were fun. But I'm not convinced. <br /> <br /> LM.
