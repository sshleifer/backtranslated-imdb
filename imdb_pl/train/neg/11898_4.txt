Police officer (Robert Forster) in the city where the crime was committed, attacked his wife, and the young son killed after she dared to stand in front of the bandit at the gas station. After the murderers get away unscathed thanks to the corrupt judge, and he himself is imprisoned for 30 days for insulting the court, he decides to take matters into his own hands by joining a group of guards led by the gray-haired Fred Williamson. These types of Robin Hood sort every criminal whose law does not want to race, and with their help he tries to track down those who hurt him. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a great bag o'clich√©s. The only amazing thing is killing a two-year-old boy on the screen who was sick enough. Otherwise it is as usual in this genre, eg. Many car chases, beating and shooting with a lot of male attitude. However, I could do without a prison fight in the shower with all those naked prisoners. Have they run out of money before filming the last scenes? I mention this because it ends very violently with a small closure. If anyone knows, give me the bell ... actually, do not worry. <br /> <br /> In summary: File in "Forgettable Nonsense". Next..
