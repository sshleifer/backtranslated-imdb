I saw the 7.5 IMDb rating on this film and on this basis I decided to watch the movie, which my roommate rented. She said she had seen it before. "It's funny and sad! I cried for the first time when I saw it, "she gushed. Maybe, compared to other films, Bollywood deserves 7.5 out of 10, but compared to all the other films I've seen in my life, it deserves more than 3. Every movie where I can forever guess what will happen next it's good for me. Characters are unbelievable, how the act is not realistic, and their motives are invented. It's over dramatic, and the songs are not that great. My biggest problem with Bollywood films is the lack of subtlety. All emotions are too exaggerated and therefore not realistic at all. Any emotions or ties between characters that are least subtle must be enlarged with an unnecessary song. I think I understood that the relationship between father and son was more like a relationship between friends than a parent and child, without having to transmit it through a five-minute song. Stupid comic relief with a song of laughter was neither funny nor necessary (we understand, Laxman is not the sharpest tool in the shed). If the film tries to bring tears to the most hacked, it means that it is impossible, just a bit embarrassing. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ***** <br /> <br /> In general, if someone has terminal lung cancer, his son who lives with them would know something it is wrong, without having to receive information. Too many holes to count. Initially, the movie was fun and sweet in the way Bollywood movies are for people who do not watch them eagerly, but they just get boring. Making a movie that is fun and provocative of the heart requires a lot of skill, and the best way to do it is usually not having all the fun parts in the first half of the movie and all parts of the heart at the end. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER OVER ***** Perhaps he had a bit more depth than the other Bollywood movies I've seen, but not much. I spent more time laughing at the film's stupidity than with parts that were supposed to be funny. I did not shed a single tear, I did not feel like it, I was rather overcome with a sense of disgust towards a dramatic ending. I do not recommend this movie, if you want to watch something good, I recommend it if you want to watch a Bollywood movie that is a bit sad.
