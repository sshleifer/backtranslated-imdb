Do not get me wrong, Dan Jansen was a great speed skater. If there was one guy who deserved his gold medal at the Olympics, it was Dan. <br /> <br /> But how is it possible that Bill Corcoran made such a bad film about the amazing story of Dan Jansen, because the true Story of Dan Jansen is really amazing! Especially when you look at this movie through the eyes of an athlete, everything is wrong, like Matt Keeslar and other actors skating, their technique, dimensions of the high-speed oval, everything is wrong! <br /> <br /> Shame yourself, Bill Corcoran, Dan Jansen deserves something better, much better! <br /> <br /> 1 in 10
