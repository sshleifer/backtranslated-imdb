Feeding the Masses is just one of many recent zombie movies that you can find after hard-earned dollars. Suggestion? Keep your hard-earned dollars and let's say that a good old TheaterX took one for the band on it. Guess what are the threads about? Zombies take over. This time, however, because of the originality (?), This movie takes place on Rhode Island and to be honest, I'm not sure if I've ever seen a zombie movie from Rhode Island. A TV station controlled by the government allegedly maintains "normal" transmissions, so that all other citizens do not think that there is any problem in the world, that is, those that never look or go outside. I will say, however, that some of the commercials broadcast by this station were probably the most fun part of the movie. There is a bit of history in it, but I do not care because after a while you either do not care or you fall asleep. In any case, it has a lot of horrible actions to throw away all the things "I've seen it all before" that are detected in front of the camera. Trust me, you can find many other things to do with your time than to watch it. 3 out of 10.
