Wow ... where to start ... I raised it in Big Lots for just $ 2.99. It's three dollars I will never see again ... ever ... and what for? I will tell you an hour and fifteen minutes of boring, boring, boring chat and student anger, which seemed more suitable for a Lifetime movie than a horror advertised on a box. (May the marketing droids that designed them burn in hell for all eternity). Follow her with a bit of a cheap gore (not even a nice mind ...) and a turn of action at the end that appears out of nowhere and makes no sense. Awful, horrible, horrible ... <br /> <br /> Were there any redeeming qualities? Well, on Joe Bob Briggs scale, there were six involved breasts, but it's not worth my long loss of three bucks. Without them, it could be in Sci-Fi, say, two or three o'clock ... <br /> <br /> Bmoviefreak
