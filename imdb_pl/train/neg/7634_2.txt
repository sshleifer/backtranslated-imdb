It is a kind of film that shows the shortage of French cinema when it comes to creating thrillers. The director's desire to "delve into the American" is so blatant that we will not be fooled by the minute, unless you have not seen the movie of the serial killer from "Peeping Tom". <br /> <br /> Two cops (or one and a half, more like you'll see), horrible murders, more complicated plot than complicated. Charles Berling has no luck with this genre (see the amazingly stupid "l'inconnu de Strasbourg" a few years ago). Scenes with his pregnant wife - which are supposed to be the equivalent otherwise atmosphere of the noir plot - belong to the worst in history filmed. Add a steam love scene between them and a bloody autopsy to get PG 12, and thus attract huge youth. Public and absurd ending, followed by a silent epilogue that could make a nice advertisement on the azure coast, it's really the lame silence.
