This movie is really bad. Acting is awful, with the exception of Michael Ironside. I do not understand history. Richard Grieco is the only survivor after the fight between the two McGangs. He comes to the city and suddenly is chosen to fight against evil people who want Indian land. The cover says that he was an Indian himself who returned to his hometown, I did not hear it in the film, if it was, it was not clear. <br /> <br /> Richard Grieco was one hell of a bad actor. Stiff and ugly. He said his lines are also liked. And we would not talk about Sean Young, she was not one of my favorite actors, but in this movie she plays a Hindu woman who falls in love with Bolcie (Grieco). It's terrible. <br /> <br /> When I rented it, I chose between this and Subterfuge with Amanda Pays. I chose this because Michael Ironside was in the cast. Maybe I should have taken Subterfuge. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this unless you think Richard Grieco looks hard on a motorcycle with sunglasses. <br /> <br /> I will soon resurface the list because I have it at home. I wrote this after watching the movie.
