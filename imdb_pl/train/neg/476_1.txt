When converting a book into a movie, it is a good idea to preserve at least some of the intended tone or ideas conveyed by the author, rather than completely ignoring the author. It is obvious that the director had access to the advice of the children of Elinore Stewart and followed them, but it should be remembered that the children believed that their mother is a complete liar in relation to good, enriching, strengthening experiences related to the development of her land. The book describes her life on the adjoining houses of her and her husband on the vast border with Wyoming; chroniclers of everyday adventures with their numerous friends and acquaintances, though they lived several dozen miles apart. The film, however, takes a standard position for the time when it was created, showing the experience of this woman as raw, merciless and almost pointless. Perhaps the director brought with him some of his experiences from the Vietnam War (as some movie lovers said), but it seems a bad excuse to take away all the joy and beauty of the book and turn it into a gloomy, hideous landscape devoid of friends and hopes. Do not waste time on this movie; instead, read the book.
