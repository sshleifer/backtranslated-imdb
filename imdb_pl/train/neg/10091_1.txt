I can not believe that this movie has ever been made. I think that at some moments the director tries to make it an artistic work, but it only makes it worse. Zombies look like they used too much eye makeup. Zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes. In the end, there are maybe five or six, certainly not a nation. The best part of the movie, if it exists, is definitely credits, because the painful experience was finally ended. Again, to repeat other user comments, voodoo priestesses are strange and do not make much sense throughout the movie. There is also a scene with a snake and a Romanian girl who just does not make sense. This is never explained.
