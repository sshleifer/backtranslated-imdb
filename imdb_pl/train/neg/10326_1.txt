Once again, Canadian television is getting ahead and creating another program that will not be used after the episode premiere. <br /> <br /> Last time I remember that sitcoms were to trigger a reaction in laughter from business talks. How amusing is the stereotype of all white people thinking that all Muslims are terrorists? OK, maybe one joke to stick it to the masses. But not 30 minutes. It's called beating a dead horse. Even SNL would know that he would give up after a commercial break. <br /> <br /> Also in these scripts we will deal with a bit of conflict. Will she be able to serve cucumber sandwiches to break the fast in Ramadan? When will Ramadan begin? Ohhhhh, this is Emma rewarding here. <br /> <br /> And characters! What characters ?! They are all cardboard cutouts without anything interesting, which makes us want to follow them from one situation to another. That is the sense of a situation comedy. We must have strong, interesting, dynamic characters so that we can attract TV sets every week. We must take care of these characters to worry about what troubles will happen next week. If I never see these characters, it will be too soon. Fortunately, I do not remember any of their names (note to CBC - this is not a good sign). <br /> <br /> And acting is so bland. It's more a problem with casting than with actors. None of these people embody the characters in which he plays. They just seem to play their part, as if they were working on the movie of the week. Sitcoms require actors who live and breathe this figure - make us fall in love with them - where they become inseparable from the character they portray. Watch any American sitcom and you'll see how easily you can identify characters. Part of the problem is that actors seem to treat the project as if it could be a platform for bigger and better things, instead of being one big figure of life for which they will spend the next 8 years in portraits. Shows this level of disinterest in heroes and the project. But to be honest, given the poor concept and horrible writing, there is not much to do for the actors, but to speak out and try not to bump into any furniture. As another commentator recalls, it seems to be a TV movie, not a sitcom. <br /> <br /> And no directing! What can I say, Canada has so many talents, look at what Comedy Channel does with Puppets Who Kill and Punched Up. Look at Trailer Park Boys (this is not a movie because it is a dog with a large helium). Look at every American show to see the potential of our talent, because there many of our stars are looking for a decent job. <br /> <br /> Give credit to CBC, they really know how to build an ad for a non-event. Do you remember "The One"? No - well, do not even try to learn any character names in this concert, because it will certainly follow the path of dodo. <br /> <br /> Let's hope for a full hit of ACTRA so that nothing like that will emerge from Ceeb for a long time.
