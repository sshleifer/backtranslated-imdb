In the old days, as a janitor of "Private lessons" I played on the 4-plexus in which I worked. It was a sleepy hit that sold off Friday and Saturday evenings for several weeks. I never looked at him, but I saw that he was in the cable last weekend, so I decided to give it a try. What I've witnessed for the next 90 minutes was one of the worst movies I've ever seen and that made watching awful uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> The basic story is a teenage boy lusting for his sexy maid Kristel). She also seems to be attracted to the boy, but for more sinister reasons. So we get scenes with a boy watching her undressing and inviting him to watch. And from there. <br /> <br /> Eric Brown, as a teenager, must be one of the worst actors I've ever seen. His "terrified" reactions every time Sylvia takes off her clothes or when she touches them is terrible. I did not laugh at this piece of rubbish. <br /> <br /> And let's not start from the thread of a maid and chauffeur planning to extort money from the kid. Let's say it involves falsification of death, burying the body .... I could continue and continue, but it becomes more ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Sex scenes are the worst I've ever seen. Even though Eric Brown was older than he looked, the fact is he looks like a child. It looks like she has no idea how to kiss a woman (if it worked, maybe I should rethink my criticism of Brown) and it was too close to bordering child pornography to be erotic. I have never been so discouraged about the sex scene, although Miss Kristel is quite beautiful with clothes and without. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER'S WARNING ** I need to mention the last scene. For me it's just sick, but I remember the audience cheering when the film froze in the frame and disintegrated into credits. Our hero returns to school and begins to flirt with one of the teachers. He asks her for dinner, and she looks like Tom Cruise has just asked her for it. He confirms with a nod and he walks away, smiling triumphantly at the camera. GIVE ME A BREAK! Yes, I am convinced that teachers would risk everything for a simple teenager. <br /> <br /> I will never understand the appeal that this film had in 1982. Surely, it was more than just nudity, because there were plenty of comedies about teen sex with nudity that bombed the money. And to think that the same teenagers who supported the movie 22 years ago are now working in corporate ladders and are probably helping to run this country. It's a terrible thought.
