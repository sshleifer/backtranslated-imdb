1940. - A visit to the Łódź ghetto in Nazi-occupied Poland, recorded by German cameramen with the naive collaboration of the Jewish community, is combined with archival footage, clips from international film chronicles and fragments of related cultural films to portray the Jews of the world as cheaters and parasites. This "document" interprets Jewish life from the point of view of traditional anti-Semitism and Nazi ideology. A sincere, unique film of racial hatred. Personally, I think this movie is frightening and highly offensive. You can only hope that such photos will never reach the screen again.
