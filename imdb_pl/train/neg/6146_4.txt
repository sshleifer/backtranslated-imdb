How this movie escaped anger MST3K I will never know. "Gymkata" is a funny action movie, full (or maybe empty?) Paper threads, stupid characters and ridiculous situations. But take it from me, if you like watching bad and silly movies, you'll like "Gymkata". <br /> <br /> The action is focused around a gymnast chosen by government agents (at least I think they were government agents to become a spy.) You see that his father was another quasi-government agent who was lost in this game called eloquently So the gymnast (played gently by Kurt Thomas) trains to compete in this game and find out what happened to his lost father. <br /> <br /> Sounds promising, right? Ok, so it's not There is, but still, this naked theme of sypnopsis does not begin to describe the joy of the film, it can be found in the strange details of the movie Like a mysterious gymnast girl who does not speak for the first half hour of the movie, she suddenly starts talking and does not close for the rest of the time ! Or a really tough, shirtless guy who likes to create and break non-existent rules of the game whenever he wants. And of course this is a great performance from our hero in "Village o f The Crazies "(apparently the real name of this place!). Nice place to visit, but I would not live there. <br /> <br /> But where this movie really shines, there are action scenes. Because our hero is a gymnast, the director thought that it is good to put gymnastic equipment in the alleys and squares of cities in the Middle East, so that our master Gymkata could better use his gymnastic skills to fight the evil plague parallel bars and horses. You have to see it to believe it. <br /> <br /> An interesting thing. Many, I would say that by half the cast, he dies from shooting with arrows. Interesting, because arrows are the only credible effects or action in the whole movie. If it were really effects, my one important memo note for anyone who invented these very realistic shot wounds. It was more likely that the film did not pay any extras. Nevertheless, "Gymkata" deserves a look if you can see them without paying and you are looking for stupidity, which is an easy target for riffing. <br /> <br />
