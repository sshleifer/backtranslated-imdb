I watched this movie when I was a young boy full of crazy hormones and it was a movie as sexy as I've ever seen or ever seen. It may not have been a great movie. I guess it was not like that. I really do not remember much about it, telling the truth. I only remember sex chemistry between Crosby and Biehn. No woman in ANY film ever did it for me, like the incredibly sexy Cathy made in this movie. I have not seen him since I first caught him on TV in the '70s and I do not think I want to see him again because I'm sure it would be a disappointment - my hormones are not so crazy and I've become more tired for years . Still, when I think back to the shower scene, I still remember how wonderful it was when I came back. <br /> <br /> Added later: After watching the movie again, I discovered that returning home is dangerous. What once was erotic is now quite tame. The case of an older woman, a younger man, still works for me, not as much as it used to be, probably because I'm no longer a 12-year-old. This older woman is now younger than me. Also, my amateur personality was not perceived by my twelve-year-old mind. <br /> <br /> Moral: Sometimes it's better not to go back to the past.
