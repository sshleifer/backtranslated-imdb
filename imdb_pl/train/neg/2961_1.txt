For one night I took care of a family of three young children, and their mother gave me to show them that they just caught her at Wal-Mart at the beginning of the week. All three children actually had physical illness while watching. I'm pretty sure it's the pizza they ate, or something everyone chose from school, but it could actually be the movie. Absolutely disgusting. If someone can produce this caliber, it's outside of me. Fortunately, I turned off the movie when I noticed that the children do not react and behave strangely. I advise all parents to refrain from watching this film by young children.
