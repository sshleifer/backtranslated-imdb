<br /> <br /> The worst. Movie. Always. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of filming this remake (except turning it into a 90-minute video ad for the movie)? Zombies that * work * ??? It seems to me that the director has never seen the original "dead" films that show rigorous (from rigor mortis) creatures shuffling towards the living victim. <br /> <br /> And exactly how those who survived knew the boat in the marina belonged to the recently abandoned Steve? <br /> <br /> 1/10
