I do not watch a lot of television and I came across this program. Reality show? I hope it is not real. If I was a man and had such nakedness and was married to someone so snotty, it would be the basis for divorce. I think it is a bad example of how a person should treat the person he loves. This is one thing that is wrong with our world, so many people in bad relationships, selfish and do not know the meaning of what it means to truly love another. This is a sacrifice, not something that should be happy. It does not give you a good feeling to observe what should be in private counseling. If his personality in the series is true, he deserves someone much better that would show true love and care for him and appreciate him for who he is. Is this a reality or a censored assessment ???? I really would like to know. Yours sincerely, GB
