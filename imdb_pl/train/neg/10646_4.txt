The last of Tarzan's films by Johnny Weissmuller and a good thing, because it is the worst of the 12 films that he made in 16 years. There are no sirens here, because a beautiful woman from the island tries to escape from the clutches of her people who worship God and try to force her to be his bride. He finds Tarzan and Jane, who are trying to protect her. George Zucco is present as a potentially vile High Priest, but he is not fully utilized. Also at hand and worth mentioning is a very annoying guitarist / singer who every now and then enters the song. Even the "great" Robert Florey can not help it. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of four)
