there are three types of bad movies - cheap, boring and tasteless. the only really bad movies are boring and tasteless. <br /> <br /> boring movies are simply boring - if you do not go away quickly enough, you fall asleep. <br /> <br /> tasteless films have their defenders; but the fact is that they are masturbation aids for very sick people. <br /> <br /> only cheap bad movies are really fun because the filmmakers wanted to make their films so desperate that they exceeded their skills and available resources. <br /> <br /> Because Derek is naturally boring and tasteless; Fortunately, the fate and lack of funds and skills redeem it, making it seem cheap too. this movie is fun and it can be the last really funny movie ever made. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the theater for the first time, God forgive me; I laughed so much that I withdrew from the place and also with the rest of the audience. <br /> <br /> it's clear that Derek and her husband-promoter have thought about this movie partly, satire; unfortunately, the lack clearly lacked all necessary resources to distract it; consequently, the satirical element breaks away from the impression of a school girl with the impression of a gay youth with an honest gorshina impression that the mysterious batman tries to pretend to be a robin - he does not fly over our heads, he has no idea where any human head can be. <br /> <br /> on the other hand, in the movie there are probably serious moments - this is supposed to be an action movie, remember - they are so amazingly bad, you may wonder if someone sprayed the broken milk in the eye. <br /> <br /> as in Derek's infamous tendency to reveal her breasts - I can not imagine a less erotic nude photo show, she is so strange looking with these wide arms, I can "Imagine what anyone saw in her. <br /> <br /> as to the story - as it is - well, it is not; Derek chases in Africa, and God knows why. then her father - Harris - pretends to play some manic puppet show, and then of course is hunk'o'Tarzan, who seems to be wondering about the commercial, not knowing that the subject has changed - probably because he did not see the script - apparently nobody has. <br /> <br /> negligent work with the camera, cheesy edition - if it were not for 3-way chimpanzee, the movie would be unbearable - <br /> <br /> as it is, it's a real hoot.
