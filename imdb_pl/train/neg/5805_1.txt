Anyone who has seen the original would have to go out and destroy this terrifying remake. Alex Baldwin is trying to imitate the late Steve McQueen with the word for the word, the remake just does not work. While Baldwin has done some admirable job, it's a flop from beginning to end. McQueen had charisma, he never tried to compete with the star. As to Kim in the role of Ali McGraw, he said enough. McQueen looked threatening, dangerous and credible as Doc, the movie was excited and uncertain, Baldwin and the company made a comedy of it, I laughed once and once I saw this unfortunate movie. And this horrible haircut for Michael Madsen, who is one of the most exciting and credible actors! Did the make-up people have for Michael what they thought. If you want to see the filming as it was under the direction of Sam Peckinpah, get the original!
