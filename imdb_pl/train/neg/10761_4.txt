This movie was a mess. He had the absolutely worst editing I've ever seen. It was almost like the end of the scene the writer wanted to go to the commercial, and the filmmaker added a second black screen to fulfill the dream of writers. <br /> <br /> In a sloppy direction and editing, there was a glimpse of something good. A good idea, an irresistible spark. But somewhere went wrong. <br /> <br /> The story is about a quasi-psychic priest who is trying to solve a series of murders. The first thing that is difficult to bite is Richard Grieco as a priest. Well, this part does not call him to be a good priest and he's succeeding rather well. The second problem is Dennis Hopper as a crazy bad guy. He always plays a crazy evil guy. Very ho hum. <br /> <br /> Oh, it occurred to me that maybe all this lively, horrible edition and disconnected intrigue tried to add to it the confusion that the character experienced (Grieco). And just to prove that it was invented, they wrote loans. This is not a good sign for any movie. <br /> <br />
