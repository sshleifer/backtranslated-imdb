The acronym "F.P.1" means "Floating Platform # 1". The film heralds the construction of "F.P.1" in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, which is to serve as an "air station" for transatlantic flights. Based on the contemporary Curt Siodmark novel; was filmed in German as "F.P.1 antwortet nicht" (1932), in French as "I.F.1 ne r√©pond plus" (1933) and in English as "F.P.1" (1933). Soon, technology has made non-stop oceanic journeys much more beneficial. Atlantic platform. Karl Hartl directed. Mr. Veidt is the funniest one to watch; but he is not convincing in the "love triangle" with Mrs. Esmond and Mr. Fenton. The younger co-workers were the spouses of Laurence Olivier and Ann Dvorak. Both the concept and the movie did not age well. <br /> <br /> **** F.P.1 (4/3/33) Karl Hartl ~ Conrad Veidt, Jill Esmond, Leslie Fenton
