Some of my old friends offered to watch this movie, but recently I had the chance. I had high hopes that I would see something interesting from Kamal Hans, but I could see some angles of a garbage camera mixed at high speed. I could not understand what the message was, save degrading Hinduism. I am more similar to many types of religions, but I have felt that Kamal Hasan is a man of low character who has arranged this type of thought. He could create a horror movie than this shit. He tried to add a Hollywood genre of viruses and God forbid that he did not turn this guy into a mutant and ultimately go global. It is a very suitable film for a film school and an ordinary audience. He is ashamed that he does not stick to the talent he has. The beginning of the story tried Chaos to borrow ideas from the Butterfly effect, and then between the small religious harmony at the expense of offensive Hinduism (once more I offend Hinduism, but this film is second to none, and my insult is the same for religion in general that could make this film intellectual.)
