Leave it to Paul "sex in the brain" Verhoeven to come up with a senselessly seedy and youthful version of the story "The Invisible Man." If he directed the Pokemon movie, I'm sure he would turn it into a massive orgy. I do not mind sex, or even disgrace (check out my other reviews) about the film, but to be honest, it's obvious that the director has one song and did not see interesting aspects about the invisible history of man than about the perverse implications associated with it. It is a pity, because it would be good if the film did not spend so much time on invisible women Kevin Bacon. <br /> <br /> The actors cast does what they can, thanks to the cheap script, but I felt bad for some of them, including William Devane, who is totally wasted here. <br /> <br /> But what could I expect from the director SHOWGIRLS, which is much more fun than this broken and bad movie.
