Haunted Boat sells as "The Fog" meets with "Open Water". In many ways it is accurate. They are terrified and strange looking people who interest you. <br /> <br /> However, the acting ability is weak at best. Clear signs that it's just a group of friends making a horror movie. Which of all the points they do best, how they can. When you accept a low budget, it's very difficult for special effects, and ghosts look almost like men with rubber masks. <br /> <br /> Many aspects of the film are frightening and strange. But he suffers from using too many twists in a short time that just bores and confuses you. When it comes to maintaining consciousness, the film does it very well. Ignoring irrelevant twisting every 5 seconds at the end, you really want to know what's going on. And they are ready to wait 1 hour 35 minutes for the culmination. <br /> <br /> This is not a ghost ship, but it will definitely be the evening before T.V.
