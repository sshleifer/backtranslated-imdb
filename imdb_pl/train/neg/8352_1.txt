I rented this movie because it is in the genres of "romance" and "western" in which the Grand Canyon scenery is blended. However, if you expect a typical, healthy romantic western, forget about it. This movie is pure trash! Romance is between YOUNG GIRL GIRL who even did not survive adolescence and a middle-aged man! The child is also coveted by other fancy men. It's disgusting. <br /> <br /> Peter Fonda is portrayed as virtuous, trying to resist his train to Brooke Shields, and her character is mainly the one who realizes this relationship. He tries to expel her first, but ultimately surrenders and departs as a happy, loving couple. It's revolting. <br /> <br /> I do not see how this film could appeal to anyone but pedophiles.
