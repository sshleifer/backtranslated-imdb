Killer Tomatoes have this particular kind of humor - either you love him or you hate him. Personally, I like it, but in this fourth film the feeling disappeared. Tomatoes are not the same, jokes are bad, even the actors are not so funny. Because this is the only thing that should be the kind of movies - funny. <br /> <br /> So now tracking the plot of laughter is annoying. They really should not have done the fourth part of the Killer Tomatoes trilogy.
