The only reason I watched this movie was because I recently read less than the excellent, but interesting, fictionalized report from Robert Hough about the life of Big Cat coach Mabel Stark. Beaty appears as a figure in the book, in less than flattering light. <br /> <br /> I did not realize until I checked the movie later on IMDb, that it was originally a serial. Whoever wrote the original time of 233 minutes to the 68-minute version available on DVD did a great job. The short version plays just as well as any movie from this period, despite many "duh-what?" Moments. For example, is it really expected that we will believe our hero, who this morning has dug this twenty-foot tiger trap without even getting his breeches dirty? Looking at the title of the chapters, I see that the number five is entitled "Gorilla Warfare", and the eleventh number is "The Gorilla". There were no gorillas in the film. I think that some pieces were made there. <br /> <br /> Historically interesting.
