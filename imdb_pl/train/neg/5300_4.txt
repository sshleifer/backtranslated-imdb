I'm one of millions of Columbo addicts around the world and I just watched the episode that started it all on the British Channel 5. It's fascinating to think what has grown out of the film so much and I can only wonder who saw the enormous potential of "Columbo" and he added all the little touches that make it so wonderful and classic. Having said that, this particular movie is not as good as the rest (except for the embarrassing final section and the condescending British episode). If Columbo was made according to the original "pilot", it certainly would NOT last too long or be watched and loved all over the world. In this movie, Lt Columbo is elegantly dressed, drives a normal car, has a partner, does not talk about his alleged relatives and is quite aggressive. There is also chemistry of cats and mice between Columbo and "villain". Visible, but only for news, how to see how Columbo began.
