"Algie, the Miner" is one evil and inconspicuous quiet comedy. The slapstick time is completely turned off. It's a kind of humor with some sequences that make you wonder if they're going to be funny or not. However, the actual quality of the film is irrelevant. It is a must see for cinema lovers mainly because it is one of the earliest examples of gay cinema. The main character, Algie, is an effeminate guy, behaving like a stereotypical "pansy" often appearing in many early movies. The film has a homophobic attitude typical of those times. "Algie, the Miner" is quite awful, but fascinating from a historical point of view. (3/10)
