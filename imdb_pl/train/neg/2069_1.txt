I went to see it at the Esquire Theater in Cincy, OH, and - I hate my life now. <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeves would be a more reliable boxer. <br /> <br /> How the movie was painful, but seeing Bret Carra personally saw desperation at its top. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie was seeing BC hit in the face with something that seemed to be a "C" battery. The jury is still not ending. He was out of the vibrator and he was in slow motion. Yes. <br /> <br /> "Shoot only the left side of the face ... people become famous, demanding things!" - Bret Carr B. Carr founded the Chicken Suit for a bit of reverse psychology, wandering the streets of Clifton banging his own movie. He should. It's true that I made this film. <br /> <br /> My soul felt irritated after the movie. <br /> <br /> Bret Carr is not charismatic enough to be a cult leader or intelligent enough that's important. This is the feeling you get from what is bleeding the trick of neo-yuppies, the brainwashed, sensitive people who came to see this song Bret Carr. <br /> <br /> It's emotional exhausting thinking about writing about this film, so goodbye. <br /> <br /> - Anonymous
