I had unconsciously had this film on my shelf for some time in the Mill Creek collection and one evening I decided to watch it; although I did not expect much. With the initial subtitles I am surprised by the discovery that this film was made at Filmirage. Filmirage brought the world such an amazing stink as "Troll 2", "Ator the Invincible" and "Quest for the Mighty Sword", so I was forced to watch. <br /> <br /> When the movie began to have the potential to be quite decent, even though it was unoriginal. Gore scenes could be improved if they were elongated and more frequent. But after a while, the pace in the film began to drag and I thought, "Okay, someone better to kill soon" or "Someone will be better." At the beginning of this oppression, when I had these thoughts, although someone could have been killed or mutated, however noted, the gore and effects were not very good. Worse, the transitions between scenes were misleading; example: first Dr. Houseman would be at the zoo, and then he would have a flash backwards about the possible killing of someone, he would finally wake up in cold sweat in bed - asking the audience to ask "Did he dream that he was at the zoo?" Like the pace of the movie, the transitions between the scenes were getting worse. <br /> <br /> I could try to say that the development of Dr. Houseman's character was quite good, but towards the end of the movie, I mean, when I saw what the Doctor had changed, hopefully, that you'll laugh - which is really the only reason to see this movie at least once, this movie is unintentionally acting like a long-drawn joke. <br /> <br /> The um dress, which becomes Dr. Houseman, can also be seen in "Quest for the Mighty Sword "Joe D 'Amato, who was created in the same year, you must love Filmirage, always use the same things!
