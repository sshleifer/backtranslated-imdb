Yes, he is! ... No, not because Pintilie likes to undress his actors and publicly show his secrets. Pintilie IS a naked "emperor" - so to speak ... <br /> <br /> It's a great time for someone to tell the truth. This cheater is a voyeur, a brat locked in the body of an old man. His abundance of naked scenes has no artistic legitimacy. It is 100% visual perversion: it gets kicked, making the actors undress in the buff and look at their willows. And if he does it in front of the audience, he can break down! Did you know that on the set of "Niki Ardelean" he used to embarrass the poor Coca Bloss, saying to her: "Oh, Coca, how do I want you ***!"? She is a wonderful lady, very decent and sensitive, and she has become unspeakably embarrassed - to his petite satisfaction! And as a disturbing alarm signal about the degree of vulgarity and lack of education in Romanian viewers, so many people are still so stupid to announce these visual obscene "works of art"! Will anyone ever have the decency to reveal the truth about all this?
