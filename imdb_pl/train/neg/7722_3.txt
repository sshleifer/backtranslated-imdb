Extremely weak action film with the participation of wooden Dolph Lundgren and Brandon Lee imprisoned as a helper who never seems to gag. The action is mediocre at best, a bit of nudity and Tia Carrera uses a double body! <br /> <br /> Configuration is an ordinary renegade policeman forced to break into a new partner in a big case, the creators at least try to give the formula a twist, so that Lundgren is a policeman about oriental values, and Lee - a modern city, but there is no character development, which makes him almost comical, the oriental costume of the warrior Lundgrens to the great game must be considered a believer. Action sequences are based on numbers, and Lee (who would make a great crow) can never show any particular glow of martial arts. But given his excellent origins, he had to be under great pressure and was much better if he did not have to face his father, taking a completely different role in Crow, which showed how exceptional actor could have been if not for his tragic and early death . <br /> <br /> Unless you're a fan of hardcore Lundgrens or a fan of 80s action movies (I think Cobra etc.), then avoid. <br /> <br /> Poor 3/10
