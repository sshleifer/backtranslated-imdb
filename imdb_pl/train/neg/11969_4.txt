If you like to have fun, do not go see this movie. If you like watching war heroism, do not go see this movie. If you like a good acting game and a great scenario, do not go see this movie. If you like typical Hollywood war movies that end just in time to give a politically charged appeal to the public for the grandeur and glory of war, Go see this movie. Otherwise, do not waste time. I'm always interested in war movies because I think that if they are well made, they can teach us something about the paradoxical and worthless traits of war. This movie shows a group of guys running around, talking terrible phrases, doing the most predictable things and defending the oppressed with the same exact force and brutality given to the oppressed. This film is a disgrace to the film and the United States! Can you imagine that you are a person from Europe, Africa or any other country and are watching this, saying that's how the Americans are? No wonder everyone hates us! Please, please, please, do not waste time on this piece of rubbish; if you must, wait and borrow it. 4/10
