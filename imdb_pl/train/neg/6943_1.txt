This movie is deeply idiotic. The man wants revenge for the crime - but when he evades revenge - the video camera is directed at him all the time. What man with a brain cell in his head would sit there and do it for a long time in front of a video camera? <br /> <br /> The fact that this script could never have happened had it not been for someone who would not be able to wear it, I destroyed it for me - but it got stupid !!! <br /> <br /> I think the writers have some serious habits that cook their brain cells and make them miss holes in the storyline that can lead a tank battalion through. <br /> <br /> PLOT: the man is looking for revenge for the death of relatives, but in the middle of the story something goes wrong, and then unexpectedly develops. <br /> <br /> If only those people writing this story were not so stupid to write totally unrealistic twists of action that could never have happened in this way. I tell writers - look for help in a serious mental problem.
