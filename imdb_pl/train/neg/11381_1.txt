Now I like science fiction cartoons. But when "Robotboy" appeared in Canada at the end of 2006, I watched the premiere and was inevitably terrified. The heroes are typical and stereotypical (do you REALLY have to make a man from Afghanistan wear a tiger belt clothing and speak with a Jamac accent? WHY all Asian characters are alive and squinting eyes and chest and constantly complain?) To the extent that things become unrealistic, predictable, disgusting and sometimes disturbing. In Astro Boy there are big similarities and even stabs. Let me explain (dub names for young people): Robotboy / Astro, Kamikaze / Tenma, Constantine / Shadow, Gus / Abercrombie, Tommy / Alejo, Lola / Zoran + Kennedy, Moshimo / O'Shay and so on. Short similarities to "My life as a teen robot", "Star Wars", "Teenage ninja turtles", "Kamen Riders", "Sailor Moon" and what. I walked. Not to mention the abundant racial / gender stereotypes. Do not even start with innuendos. I will only say that they are hidden and quite dirty. But seriously. Do not even try to watch it. Especially if you like Astro Boy.
