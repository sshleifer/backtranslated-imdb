The story certainly seemed interesting enough. How can a brutal real-life murder be turned into a really boring movie? Well, you can watch "Wonderland" and find out. <br /> <br /> I heard about the murders in Wonderland before the film was released and I found that this is an interesting real story of some really sadistic people. Unfortunately, there is no character development, so we never have a chance to understand why something has been done, nor do we have a good sense of connection between characters. The pace of this direction was very onerous. All this leads to an extremely boring movie. <br /> <br /> Given that Dawn Schiller - the central character as Holmes' girlfriend - was a collaborating producer and that Holmes's wife was a consultant in the film, we should have the opportunity to get a real insight into the characters.
