The biggest thing that viewers will remember is the bad headache the movie gave them because of the camera's too brilliant, shaky action and fast, misleading cut. I am not against such stylistic devices, if they are made like Oliver Stone and Steven Soderbergh prove the majority of their films, but in this case it was too much. It seems that the jumps and light flashes that accompanied every flight over the city of Mexico and every important scene, distracted you from the awareness that the story is quite thin, and the whole was very predictable. The biggest disappointment is that you can easily find out how the whole thing will end. In the case of a film that pretends to be aggressive, ruthless and morally wrong, it is inexcusable that his story has been told so many times, with much greater depth and development of the character. This is another disappointing aspect of the film. If I want to watch a quick action movie, I do not need any excuse, but this movie tried to justify the deadly madness of Denzel Washington and hardly gave any credible results. For the first half hour nothing happens except that stupid archetypes and stereotypes are presented, and when the action machine begins to roll, it is cut so fast that you do not know what is really going on. So the movie does not work either at the level of a credible drama / thriller, or as an action movie. Of course, the movie is not as bad as some of the completely crazed hits of recent years, but I absolutely can not understand why so many people say that this movie is something fresh and so cool. In the case of a video clip it is too long, and in the case of a movie it has too little substance.
