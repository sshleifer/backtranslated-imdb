not your typical story about vampires, no stoker gates or anne rice here. a truly original story of vampires. these vampires are genetic mutants that are not disturbed by sunlight. they are pure evil. <br /> <br /> the movie is not perfect. many actors are clearly amateurs. The two leaders who play van Helsing and Rally the Vampyre chick are quite good. the film is very violent, which may disturb some people. it is also filled with scientific details that many will not be able to understand and can be bored. I was sold on a smart plot and good performances of the couple. it is not known how successful this film would be if they had a larger budget and received mass distribution
