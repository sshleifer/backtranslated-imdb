A must have a funny movie version of the literary classic "Moby Dick". John Barrymore is captain Ahab, who falls in love with the daughter of the pastor, Joan Bennett. His brother Derek is a rival to Mrs. Bennett's feelings. When Mr Barrymore loses his leg in a whaling accident, Bennett rejects him. He must kill the whale and regain Bennett ... <br /> <br /> There are several scenes that could delight the viewers of 1930; especially scenes involving Barrymore, who loses his leg. The film, however, did not grow old well; there are much better films from that time, both from the 20's and from the 30's. Two attraction names, John Barrymore and Joan Bennett, are not the best. <br /> <br /> **** Moby Dick (8/14/30) Lloyd Bacon ~ John Barrymore, Joan Bennett, Lloyd Hughes
