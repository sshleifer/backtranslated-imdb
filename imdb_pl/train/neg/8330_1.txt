I saw "Shiner" on DVD. When I watched this, I thought, "This is a really bad porn movie without pornography." I also thought, "Whoever wrote it has some real problems." Then I watched the director / writer Carlson explain his process as a special function. Yes, it was really special. <br /> <br /> The film emphasizes two losing alcoholics who hit each other to get off. They are marginally attractive. Nudity is frontal and full. These factors probably explain that the film is seen at all. <br /> <br /> The most annoying element of the movie is the fight against gays and another further gay beating of the same victim who is trying inappropriately to take revenge on his attackers, two drunk losers. The subject is not only ridiculously and badly treated from a technical point of view, but acting is terribly bad. <br /> <br /> Then the boxer's theme appears. It's really crazy, not just absurd. This clumsy boxer is somehow offended by the persistent attention of a fleshy mother who works in the parking lot of his gym. This is in LA, you remember. The boxer is so stressed that he appears in the house of the persecutor, he runs away from him and gets excited. <br /> <br /> Well, I can only say why the boxer who is the exhibitionist in his heart was so offended by the attention of the persecutor? It just does not make sense. I am afraid that some psycho-dynamics make sense if you take the time to read them. However, bad scenarios rarely make sense. <br /> <br /> It seems that the director / writer thought that this film is a significant minority in the gay community. Well, he's probably right. Perhaps we will never know, because this minority would be so dysfunctional that they would not be able to organize themselves enough to ever get into a vague gay movie festival or DVD store, the only two places where they could find this turkey. Thank God for that.
