Many people see it as classic, but of course I had to overlook something. Living in Anarene, Texas in the early 1950s is pretty boring - which means that a movie about living in Anarene, Texas in the early 1950s will be quite boring too! What do so many people see? When the last Anarene show will be closed, there's really nothing to do in the city. Duane (Jeff Bridges) does it at the end of the movie. But even before its closing, there is not much to do, so basically everything revolves around sex. High school students plan how to lose their virginity - sometimes with themselves and sometimes with some equally bored adults in the city. You see, there is not much to do for them - except to have sex (sometimes with each other and sometimes with bored teenagers) or whimper about a local football team. Three times something happened that I thought would add some spark of drama to the movie. Sam (Ben Johnson) dies unexpectedly, but because of this nothing happens, Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Jacy (Cybill Shepherd) run away, but because of this nothing happens, Joe Bob (Barc Doyle) kidnaps a little girl, but nothing really happens. The only thing that added something dramatic to the movie was Billy's death (Sam Bottoms), which really points to the emptiness of life in this pathetic little town, while men stand around looking at the body discussing where to go for breakfast. <br /> <br /> Peter Bogdanovic filmed it in black and white, which, I suppose, is supposed to indicate how gray this city is, but the only thing that interested me was an early look at actors like Bottoms, Shepherd, Bridges and Randy Quaid. (It was frightening, by the way, to see how much Quaid - in 1971 - looks like his cousin Eddie in National Lampoon Vacation.) Classic? I do not think so! 3/10
