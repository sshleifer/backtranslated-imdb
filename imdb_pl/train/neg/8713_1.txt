Everything in this movie is bad, history, acting, effects, but it's fun, fun, funny! Scott Valentine, with a military uniform that is ten sizes too large, is so bad because of a constant threat to the face, as the leader of the special ops group is funny! "Terrorists" are as frightening and realistic as "raptors", it's so cunning and evil in everything that tries to laugh. The part in which the huge T-REX, which somehow sneaked into the ship and then somehow got under the ground and you will see that the metal post protrudes where his head is perfect. If you're in bad movies, it's a pot of gold, mona lisa bb-bad !!!
