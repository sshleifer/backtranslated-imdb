They should probably call this film "The Map", because most of the whole stupid film is connected to the map of the cemetery. Not to mention how many the same boring shots on the map are. The only thing that shows more than the map itself are small drops of sweat that constantly accumulate on the forehead of our main character. This is, of course, the way filmmakers showed us how incredibly tense things appear at the Immortal Hills Cemetery. Come on, did not they just show us one of the death scenes? We hear a lot about the fact that everyone who is mentioned on the map falls like flies, but we do not see anything. Some people wonder how I buried the living to get my attention, so I was quite generous with the rating I gave, but I do not recommend it to anyone. If you do not have a deep fascination with the maps and then, I recommend hiring a better movie, such as I Spit On Your Grave or I Drink Your Blood.
