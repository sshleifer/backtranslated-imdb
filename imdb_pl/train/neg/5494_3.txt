<br /> <br /> This cheap and ugly movie did not seem to even entertain children in the audience, except for one rather funny joke from the toilet. Christopher Lloyd is much too late and really torments himself in this role, although the unpleasant excuse for the jokes of writers does not help. Elizabeth Hurley is embarrassingly amateurish in a supposedly comic role. Jeff Daniels and Darryl Hannah avoid humiliation. There is really no reason to make this film, the more so because you can not avoid comparing it with the clever improvisations of Robin Williams in Mork and Mindy. <br /> <br />
