I saw this movie last year in the Media class and I have to say that I really hated it. I was 10 (and 15 years old) so maybe it has something to do with it. But for English this year, in year 11, we had to read the Animal Farm, including George Orwell. Apart from the fact that the book is based on a revolution, in my opinion it is a terrible book, and I also hated it. <br /> <br /> But I think in 1984 it was the most disturbing movie I've ever seen, and I think George Orwell is one of the most insane people ever to live on this planet. I am sorry for everyone who loved his work, but unfortunately not. The themes in the film were well illustrated, but the way in which the entire movie and events that took place in it were not in line with my standards. This is just my opinion and I am sure that many people liked this movie.
