In many of the films I saw Warren Oates, I came to the final conclusion, here is one talented person. I saw Mr. Oates for the first time in a 1960 television series entitled Stoney Burke. From then on, I followed his career closely and felt that it was designed for great roles. It happened in 1974, when Sam Peckinpah gave him the best bills in the movie "Bring me the head of Alfredo Garcia". Of course, his greatest pretext for fame was his wonderful role in "The Wild Circle." I always thought he could bring any character to any character until I saw him in this flop. The film is called "Chandler", a homage paid to the fists of 50s detectives created by Raymond Chandler. Because in the abstract it was written that it was a private private eye, it immediately interested me. However, I sat patiently throughout the movie and found it a boring, uninteresting, slow, twisted, tangled saga, which, if it had a theme or a storyline, had to stay in a dark background. Along with some of the best supporting stars in Hollywood, such as Alex Dreier, Mitch Ryan, Gordon Pinsent, Charles McGraw, Richard Loo and Scatman Crothers, this movie had enough power to reach Mach 5, but it went out of the way and did not go anywhere. As a result, one of my favorite actors got stuck in a bad vehicle that never left the earth. **
