The only reason this movie is rated 1 is that zero is not one of the options. With a weaker story than a depression-based cabbage soup, horrific acting and special effects that look as if they came out of the television series "Thunderbirds", it's amazing that Widmark did not kill the director for putting this black mark on his resume. Even according to the standards of the 1950s, special effects are awful, with the exception of a few underwater sequences. I can only assume that he was nominated for the best special effects, because out of 20,000 Liga Podmorskich and THEM! There was no one else to do the effects. It certainly was not a Disney contest this year, if it was their only competition. I would not recommend the movie, even for hard-core underwater film enthusiasts, because the most realistic scene on the submarine was limited to one photo in which you can see sea water drifting up a raised periscope. There are other, much better, sub-films that you can admire from this era, like the aforementioned 20,000 leagues or Torpedo Run.
