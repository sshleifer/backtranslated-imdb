When I saw the preview of it on television, I thought: "ok, it will be a good movie for a werewolf", but it was not. it was not terrifying at all! the acting was good, the plot was terrible, the military offer was simply stupid. I think that the SCI-FI channel could do better than this bit of nonsense. The film made it sound like Arron turned into a werewolf, instead he turned away from the psyche and picked out a doctor's throat. If you've read some of my other reviews about other movies, all of them are positive, but it's not simply because the story was terrible. One in 10 max. I'm sure everyone was expecting a werewolf, but I bet you did not expect it. Beyond Loch Nes, it was a lot better than the movie, damn it, every sci-fi movie is better than the movie.
