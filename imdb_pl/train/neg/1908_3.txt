One more insult and slapping gay everywhere. This lame comedy attempt has nothing to recommend. Once again, we have an attractive "simple" hero who supposedly can not get any woman interested in him. Yes, sure! We also have a "nice, attractive" gay friend who is actually a fat, balding, ugly old man whose conduct is to be attractive. Even I did not consider him attractive, and I'm fat, ugly old gay (but fortunately not balding)! Any talent for acting can be here, it has been rejected for a bad script and really a terrible direction. Mr. Sneedeker should be thrown out of the movie, but then he is no different from the countless other hooks working at Hollyweed.
