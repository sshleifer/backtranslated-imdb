I am expecting the same excitement as I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, but I was disappointed by the trash, as you can even call it a movie (its kind of mini porn). It made me sick when the guy was forced to eat his own company. There is no line of story in this that quickly jumps from every murder. If you like watching naked women and even male parts, then there are places in the movie, and there's even a place for masturbation in the movie that makes it porn, not a movie. I've seen some stupid movies in my time, but it's number 1. I want to watch it at all. Actors are even bored during the movie, so they probably had to make bad money to make this movie.
