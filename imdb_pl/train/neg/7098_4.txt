An interesting idea for a film, showing both the last dragon on earth and showing the fight that he and someone angry have together. When he was younger, Einon was stabbed into the heart, so Bowen (Dennis Quaid) took him to the dark master who gave him half a heart. Now an adult Einon (David Thewlis) is now a selfish and evil king. In the meantime, Bowen uses his new friend Draco Dragon (whose voice was taken by Sir Sean Connery) to receive rewards for "killing" dragons. But because Einon has half of Draco's hearing, they both feel that one of them is hurt or killed. They also starred Pete Postlethwaite as Gilbert of Glockenspur, Jason Isaacs as Lord Felton, Julie Christie as Queen Aislinn and John Gielgud as King Arthur. He was nominated for an Oscar for the best visual effects. Worth watching!
