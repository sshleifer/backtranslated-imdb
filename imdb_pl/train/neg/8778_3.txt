"White Noise" had the potential to become one of the most-discussed films since "The Exorcist". Seeing that EVP is supposedly true, it was really easy to be afraid of it. There are not many movies that would really arouse fear in the minds of people. As I said, this movie could have, but it did not. The film degraded to the low-class film of the terrible PG-13. Nothing compared to "The Ring" or "The Sixth Sense" in any way. Someone really has to take control of the horror industry and just make a movie that not only makes us think, but also makes us jump, we scream, everything that a horror should do. I am honestly ill with the genre of PG-13 horror, because it has become a genre of its own. We need old times, days of blood and blood, days of Freddy Kruger, Jason, Mike Myers. Few films can think that this mentality is not so terrible. So why try to pull it out? Some good jumps in this movie are nothing like one of the stupidest endings in film history without any resolution ... do not waste your money on this movie.
