After the success of the (terrible) repetitions of the Gilligan's Island television movie, in the 1980s many television films from classic shows were reconstructed. Most of these movies completely overlooked the boat when it comes to regaining the humor that made the shows so special. THE MUNSTERS REVENGE is one of the most disappointing because it relates to the comedy style of Laurel and Hardy, which was not really in the original series. Yvonne De Carlo, a wonderful comedian and important for the series, is completely wasted - she has less time in this 90-minute film than in any single 30-minute episode. And because the roles of "Eddie" and "Marilyn" in this film are nothing more than a camouflage, what sense did it make to make them younger and transform? With a little rewrite they could use Butch Patrick and Pat Priest. Although the sight of some of the dreadful relatives of the Munsters was a nice touch, I did not like Sid Caesar as a crazy mad scientist, mainly because there is too much of it and not enough of the Munsters used (ironically, in the same year, 1981, old partner Caesar in the comedy Imogene Coca was also improperly cast in the television reenion of RETURN OF THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES). Another strange, inexplicable element at the beginning of the film is the Munster family represented as wax figurines in the local wax museum of horrors. Why should they be there if they are to be "typical" (if weird) American families, not famous monsters? It was the last project of Munsters with the original cast in their roles. In the late 1980s, the series was horribly revived with a completely new cast and television film from 1990, starring DeCarlo, Lewis, Priest and Patrick as an episodic family meal.
