We all know what a bad day in the office looks like, right? Well, this comedy by Neil Simon looks how it is when you have the worst days when you're trying to get into the office. Sometimes it's just not worth it, do you know what I mean? Sometimes it's just not worth doing something that was done before, in 1970, with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis ... and much better. <br /> <br /> It's not like Steve Martin is a bad comedian or inappropriate for the role of a crazy and stressed advertising performer; on the contrary, in both cases. And it's not that Goldie Hawn is equally inept; her work was consistently good, if not great, since I first saw her on Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In in the 60s. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is that it's not about the unfortunate couple in general: it really is about New York and why should everyone come to New York to live and love their lives in marriage? though? in the largest city in the world. If you're a New Yorker ... <br /> <br /> Look, the 1970 movie is still a great comedy that has realistically explored all the things that can go wrong when you set out on a journey somewhere, and contain most gagging of the situation and sight, which you can imagine what can happen in a strange environment. This version from 1999 unfortunately goes into unreasonable tangents especially for the public who is currently expecting or wanting to see the excess. For example, dissatisfied with the attractiveness of the major players' stars, there is an episode (relatively long) from Rudy Giuliani, the then mayor of New York, as we all know. What ?? Even then, Giuliani is fighting for the president? Worse? pedestrian advertising for a better face of New York. <br /> <br /> And then we have John Cleese, who returns as Basil Fawlty ?? but this time also as a prosaic cross-dresser? once again looking at the hotel staff, praising the wealthy customers and generally making him look like the idiot he is in this role. And by the way, doing great damage in the memory of Fawlty Towers, probably the best British comedy series, bar none ... <br /> <br /> Why was this movie from 1999 created? In the 1970s, New York City was in many respects a dying city. It almost literally went bankrupt. So, when it was established in 1970, it was a city you saw: dark, dark, moody, disturbing, not a place that the harassed couple finally chose for a new life together in the Great Smoke (as then, contaminated and all). In 1999, things got better: the glitz came back, New York prospered, it was a big apple, ready to play if you had moksy ... <br /> <br /> So, of course, the pair in this second encounter find in I'm wearing this moksy and finally joining a fabulous fight to continue the American dream of life, freedom and pursuit of happiness. Therefore, this movie is really comical, but not for reasons that producers could have foreseen. Just like I like Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn in comedy, this movie is a much better parody of this amazing Jack Lemmon. If you saw the other one, definitely do not worry about it.
