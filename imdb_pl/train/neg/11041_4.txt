The show is medium. Especially, it does not make me laugh. But I think that Courtney really brings it back. It does not look natural. He has three ways of speaking, all robots. He speaks quietly (without intonation), speaks normally (without intonation), or does what he starts to speak normally, and begins to gradually scream. However, her scream is like "pretend to scream, because I should not be too loud on set". <br /> <br /> She is still aware that she is this charming actress doing this funny thing. That's annoying. You really can not get her personality because it really does not produce emotions and it does not get upset. She has this husband who does all these stupid things and has no reaction from her. Very dry and smooth operation.
