I watched the movie that Gregory's girlfriend loved a lot of years ago. It was nonsense. The plot was a bit distasteful with the teacher and his friend who survived over 14-15-year-old girls in very short skirts. The previous commentators seem to think that it does not matter, but I found it quite nasty. If you have children at school, the last thing you want is to think that every young teacher craves his students. We were surprised that the censorship had let it go. Besides, the movie was just a waste of time. The script was bad, and John Gordon Sinclair tried too hard to recreate his pupil's picture, a bit crazy and devoid of a wall. Why would anyone want to covet him in this spectacle is amazing. This movie has failed in every respect. Horrible. Do not waste time watching. Life is too short
