I was blessed with this film because it had such a great premise, friendship of three women who fell in love with a younger man in love. <br /> <br /> Intriguing. <br /> <br /> NO! I'm hurrying to add. All these women are drawn in an extreme caricature, not very supportive of each other and conspiring and seeking to bring each other away. <br /> <br /> Anna Chancellor and Imelda Staunton could not do anything wrong in my book before I see it, but here they get a grim script and are told to balance the action between slapstick and screwball, which does not work very well when women are well-known professionals in a very small town. <br /> <br /> And for intelligent women spend a whole pile of time complaining about the lack of men / sex / desire in their lives. I felt that much more could be done, given the decent scenario and the greater tension, the lesbian sub-thread never went anywhere, and those women smoking / drinking (all three in their forties ???) were very unreal - even on stage Childish - Fuck a child, give me a cigarette! Right. <br /> <br /> As I said, it is a waste of waste. 4 out of 10.
