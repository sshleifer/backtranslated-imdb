I recently saw the documentary "The revolution will not be broadcast on television", also known as "Chávez: inside the coup". At first I thought it showed a real picture of events during the coup d'état in Venezuela in April 2002. However, it disturbed me that the tone of the narrative and the accompanying music were suggestive and that no criticism of Hugo Chávez was expressed at any time. This is strange because if a documentary presents a biased description of what happened, it should be something like that. After all, Chávez is certainly not a saint. Fortunately, because the document is several years old, a lot of additional information is available on the internet today and it was not difficult to find, for example, "An urgent investigation into Chavez's attempt by 5 European TV corporations that funded a film that shows glaring lies about Venezuela . "Contains many errors and intentional or unintentional falsifications in the document. (Just use the title as a Google search string, you'll find it). Another interesting document was the registration of video presentation of the results of many errors in this document, "X-ray of a lie". For me, this is a good counterweight to "Chávez: inside the coup". It's available on video.google. I strongly advise you to look at "Chávez: inside the coup" to look at "overeating the lies" and then formulate your opinion. My conclusion is that Kim Bartley and Donnach O'Brian were (consciously or not) part of Chavez's propaganda.
