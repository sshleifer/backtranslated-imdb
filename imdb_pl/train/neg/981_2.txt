As a great admirer of Marlene Dietrich, I had to (finally) watch this very, very boring picture. This is the first colorful Miss Dietrich movie, and the most beautiful blonde in the world is red! Bad start. The story is an amazing boredom, with a theme that bored me as a rigid religious blame. (Who needs it ???) Suffice it to say that of all Dietrich's films (and I have seen the most, including Pittsburgh), it is the only movie in which even her performance is barely worth watching. Color photography is fine (it's a very early version of Technicolor), but without a purpose. Funny castings: C. Aubrey Smith, Basil Rathbone (enough to say?). The only thing that can interest you at all is the bizarre caricature of John Carradine, appearing as "The Sand Diviner", which foretells everything that will happen. The alleged "happy ending" is one of the most depressing in history. Another example of David O. Selznick's highly inflated reputation (has he ever made a really good movie? - other than That One?) And, for the last time annoying, the soundtrack on DVD MGM is a mess with seemingly randomized volume. I do not recommend it very much.
