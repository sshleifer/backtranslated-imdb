Skażone spojrzenie na życie kibucu <br /> <br /> This film is a less cultural story about the life of a boy in a kibbutz, but aware of demonizing the life of a kibbutz in general. In the first two minutes of the film, a milkman responsible for cows rape one of his calves. And it's all down when it comes to characters representing typical "kibbutzniks". In addition to the two main heroes, women with clinical depression and her young son, everyone else in the kibbutz is a great caricature of evil. <br /> <br /> The story focuses on how a kibbutz, like a cult, slowly draws mother and son into despair and which inevitably follows. There is no happiness, joy or laughter in this kibbutz. Each character / situation represents another terrifying human flaw, such as misogyny, hypocrisy, violence, worship, repression, etc. For example, while the hero is a strikingly handsome 12-year-old boy from Europe? his older brother is a typical kibbutz youth with his "Jewish" physical appearance and brutal personality. It cares more about driving foreign volunteers than about the health of a dying mother. He treats these volunteers like trash. After his younger brother begs him to visit his dying mother, whom he has not seen for a long time due to military service, orders, Quote? "Linda, take a shower and let go in two minutes." <br /> <br /> There is one more "good" character in this film ?? a European foreigner who plays the mother's boyfriend. When an animal rapist tries to hit his mother's son, the boy defends him, breaking the arm of the rapist. He is then thrown out of the kibbutz for "violent" behavior against one of the kibbutz members. More hypocrisy: the indescribably annoying French woman who plays the teacher says that sex can not happen before the age of 18, or without love, and talks about a current act that is supposed to be fun to the audience, but it is really stupid. She, of course, spins the kibbutz's head on the fields, which in turn turns the boy's mother when her mental health changes for the worse. <br /> <br /> The movie presents a kibbutz like a cult. Children are torn out of bed in the middle of the night and ritual, where they swear allegiance to the fields supervised by older kibbutzim. The mother apparently can not "escape" from the kibbutz, although in reality everyone was / is always free to come and go as they please. It's a secret, how the boy's father died, but you can be sure that the kibbutz "brought him to this" and that his other parents are another pair of soulless, unfortunate figures that burden their mother and her son. <br /> <br /> This is the crux of this movie. One-dimensional characters, over dramatization, dry performances and insidious news that tries to stick to the audience's head? the life of the kibbutz was humiliating, miserable and even deadly for those who "did not fit". I feel sorry for the guy who made the film? apparently had bad experiences growing up in a kibbutz. But I feel as if he took a few grains of truth about the life of the kibbutz and turned them into huge atomic stereotypical bombs.
