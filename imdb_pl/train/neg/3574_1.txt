I just could not finish this movie. I focused on what I would say is my nomination for the most unfortunate attempt of the sexual suggestion: the scene where Pia Zadora at the picnic stands between the two boys who want her. One (good boy) begs her to see the error of his ways. The second (bad boy) just asks if she would like to have a hot dog, which she then holds for her. At the crotch level. I hope I'm not spoiling anything to say she's turning around and taking a hot dog with a smile. Just pathetic.
