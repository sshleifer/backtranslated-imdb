If you really need to watch this movie because your girlfriend is in a romantic mood, let him be a boy. But get ready, bringing the hp if it's equipped with a radio. <br /> <br /> After watching such a good movie as Arisan (2003), it's awful to see what they came up with in Indonesia. It seems that the only idea is to earn money, but no one seems to seriously work on the image of Indonesia in the world of entertainment. The fact that it is a "global" world does not seem to appear in the minds of those who make films in Indonesia. And because the Indonesian audience swallows everything that is presented to them as "Made in Indonesia" with the taste of the West, they avoid it. <br /> <br /> OK, the story is nice at first. And it could have turned into a nice movie. But did not the director ever think about the fact that music first and foremost requires live music OR at least good reproduction and secondly good choreography? In this movie, the playback is so BAD that it makes you want to cry in the cinema. Every word you hear is tracked for a second later by the actor or anybody who sings, and it's very annoying when watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Choreography is as if they planned to make a film about morning gymnastics but in the end I thought it would be nice to turn it into a musical ... They just forgot to change the choreography. You almost do not dance, you see, they jump here and there, they throw their legs into the air, that's all. <br /> <br /> Well, at least there is a happy ending ... But if you can convince your girlfriend that a nice candlelight dinner is much more romantic.
