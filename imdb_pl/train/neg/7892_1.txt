It started with an interesting assumption. I always like things from civil war and ancient secret societies. The more the movie unfolds, the more I realized it was B movie at best. In the second half it quickly became C, followed by D, then F, then "I wish it was not a rental so that I could place it in the microwave! I can not say that acting in all cases was terrible, simply the most. However, writing ... I have never read a book. Maybe the book is well written. The script wrote a ten-year-old. It was absurdly shallow, colorless and uninteresting dialogue, characters as interesting as a five-pound sack of fertilizer. I really hated the movie, as did my wife. I am a Christian and I have no problem with films promoting or supporting Christianity. This film did a great harm to the cause. Terrible, terrible, worthless. If you liked it, I highly recommend Superman 4.
