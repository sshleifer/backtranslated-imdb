"Do not Drink the Water" is an incredibly bad movie. It is based on the play Woody Allen from 1966 on Broadway. It features Jackie Gleason, the comical genius behind "The Honeymooners". The director, Howard Morris, appeared in several comedies Mel Brooks (Life Stinks, High Anxiety, Silent Movie) and made a character in the animation (the character he spoke was Gopher from "Pooh", Jughead (Archie) and Beetle Bailey) What went not so? <br /> <br /> I think the problem is that the premise is too serious to be effective. Allen's original game was brazen, which is why she acted on Broadway and the remake of Allen from 1994. Screenplay: R.S. Allen and Harvey Bullock beat the premise of death and make too many changes to the original game. Making Gleason's wife a pilot in this version, when she was a stubborn woman in the original, is just one example of why it does not work. <br /> <br /> Acting is not much better. Gleason does everything in his power, but he can not save it. Gleason was a comic genius, but also a great actor, as he showed in The Hustler and Soldier in the Rain. His rough personality could work here, but a bad script does not even give him a chance. Detriment. Estelle Parsons's wife will drive you crazy after 20 minutes. See how soon you'll have to strangle her. It is also a shame because she is also a great actress who has appeared in two exceptional performances in "Bonnie and Clyde" and "Rachel, Rachel". None of the other actors are doing particularly well. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen hated the movie so much that he reworked it in 1994 with himself and Julie Kavner (Marge Simpson) in the lead role. They manage to hit all the right notes, and the film itself is a comic masterpiece. He is finally on the video after a long fight for rights. Exit and find this version. The original from 1969 is good for removing unwanted guests who exceed expectations. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * out of 4 stars
