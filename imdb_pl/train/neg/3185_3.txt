This movie was simply trumped by MST3K and for good reason. First of all because it's a "cop" movie with Joe Don Baker, in which we all know he's just as good a cop actor as Michael Jackson is a country western singer. <br /> <br /> The whole typical movie plot of the device is pulling out their ugly heads, bar fights, hostages of children in shooting, bad acting, bad police chiefs, bad acting, revenge / justice, endless scoundrels and of course bad behavior. Do not watch it without people with the MST3K filter.
