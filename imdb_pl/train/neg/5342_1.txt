Rachel, Jo, Hannah, Tina, Bradley and John are all here. They deserve Oscar nominations for their performances. I am also a big fan of the television program. Their music revolves and everyone is so talented! I am also a great exponent of SARCASM !!!!!! <br /> <br /> IF YOU ARE A CLUB FAN, DO NOT READ THIS !!!!! <br /> <br /> The shows are terribly weak, the dialogue is horrible, and the jokes are not even done properly (I feel sorry for the director). The jokes are so unbelievably bad that 8 small, passionate S Club fans did not laugh. They thought they could do better. And they did it. They conquered the world. They became S Club Juniors. Paul "fat, ugly who founded the mosh band" must thank his lucky stars he left when he did. One of the worst movies ever. WATCH THIS FILM! DO NOT GO AND DO NOT SEE! DO NOT EAT YOU! YOU WILL BE PAYING! 0/10 RJT
