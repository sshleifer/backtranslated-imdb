Like other people who reviewed this movie, I also missed him nostalgically ... before I had the misfortune that I could see him. Unfortunately, my childhood memories of this movie were completely unbelievable, and The Perils of Pauline are now a troublesome exercise in banal, racist and simple filming. Even the presence of old professionals Edward Everett Horton and Terry-Thomas is unable to overcome the rancid scenario, the horrible theme song and some unfortunate "special effects". In addition, stereotypical representations of African and Arab characters make watching painful, especially considering that this was in direct relation to the civil rights movement. The original Psychotronic Encyclopedia by Michael Weldon reports that The Perils of Pauline was originally produced for television, but inexplicably it ended with a cinematic release. Judging by the results, this is a completely credible (and surprising) scenario.
