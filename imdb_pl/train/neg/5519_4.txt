Okay, so the announcement of this movie only says that the rebellious young girl lives with her grandmother for the summer to straighten up. In fact, it is not! It's about a young, rebellious 17-year-old girl who reveals the secret and her mother must believe if she tells the truth or not. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I really liked the concept of this movie. They had a really good story and really good subject of love / hatred between mother and daughter. I did not like watching Lindsay Lohan's acting. In fact, this movie would be GREAT if they had someone else, maybe a better actress. Character Rachel (Lohan) is a very sexually aggressive person and reminds us of a real Lindsay, so she takes a lot from the movie. <br /> <br /> However, I think if you put Apart Lindsay, you'll like this movie. The ending is pretty great (and sad).
