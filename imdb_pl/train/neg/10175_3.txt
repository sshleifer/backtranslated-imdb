I could not go to sleep the night before. So I got up, turned on the lamp and this movie was on. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers have gone more than they could. Just as ambitious as "Forrest Gump" was. But Gump read like a fairy tale in which an unusually happy man leads us through the era. TGMB relies on tired clich√©s to tell a story. Almost like a musical on Broadway, in which the actors have to pin him up. The goal of each character was to fill up the archetype of stupid 60s. <br /> <br /> See how we got acquainted with Finnegan: Hugging his black maid and getting a picture of the MLK in the frame. Criminey, talk about heavy hands. Why not just give him a T-shirt with the words "I Heart Black People"? <br /> <br /> Sunshine: "Is not groovay free love, man? Oh no, I did not have my period. " <br /> <br /> Mary Beth: "I want to go to Berkeley, not UCLA." Excuse me? In the 1960s there was nothing in LA. Instead of taking the time to demonstrate what made Berkeley special, we just hear how the brat moans that he will not go there. <br /> <br /> I do not even remember the name of a black kid. He was just a prop, which showed how racial tolerance there are other children. <br /> <br /> The thing is, songs from the era do not have to be that bad. Take "Dazed & Confused". See how we present the football hero Randall Floyd. We do not see him for the first time on the pitch. In fact, we never see him playing football. We were presented to him during classes, inviting his nerd players to the party. <br /> <br /> In "Dazed" feminism is not an accidental by-product of a chick that is knocked down. It is much more organic, more serious than this. It was refined in the ladies' room as a result of discussions on the island of Gilligan. Serious ideas can grow in the most mundane conditions. But real life is like that. <br /> <br /> Some warm comments here note that the topics in this video are still valid. I agree! That's why I feel so disappointed with this Baby-Boomer pornography.
