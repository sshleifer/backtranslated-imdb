I think that Jack's great empathic ability makes him a powerful performer like he is, but empathy has a price like all other things - when surrounded by mediocrity, he instinctively lowers the standard and becomes one with it. He is a joke as a mafia man (also because this part does not fit him, because he is so extrovert), and just grazing avoids making a fool of himself. Kathleen Turner had too much career in being tall and blonde, because her acting skills are limited to what she does with her eyes when she opens them wide, which she believes is sooooo damn sexy, and Anjelica Huston is absolutely the same ( granted interesting) in everything, just like Robert Loggia. <br /> <br /> The movie is a bad sketch (and this will be the only mention of the cloth they call the script) of a gangster movie, with a cast that was probably only interested in getting to the after-party quicker (they certainly gathered including the elite). What, they did in one day? - because that would be the only explanation.
