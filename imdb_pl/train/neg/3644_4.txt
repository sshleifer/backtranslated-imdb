This movie is pretty bad. Acting is terrible and completely forced. What's more, filming as a docudrama does not necessarily make it more credible, you can not leave Mr. Dir easily. Do not let my comments mislead you, because I would recommend watching this video because it sheds light on psychology or non-existent psychology for the perpetrators of such crimes. However, the culmination of the film is absolutely mushy! There is no other way to put it! It's clean and it just did not capture any sense of atmosphere! What is happening does not translate to a feeling of despair, panic, fear or anxiety that you would certainly experience in such terrifying circumstances. No, instead, he leaves you with his jaw "Was it ?!" pouring out of your tongue and you are not haunted by these boys. Rather, you just feel embarrassed by the next movie, which began with the potential, but at the most important moment he fell flat on his face. Indeed Zero Day .... zzzzzzzzzzzzz
