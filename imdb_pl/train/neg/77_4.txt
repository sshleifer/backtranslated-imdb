I saw this weekend opening movie in Australia, expecting a great cast of Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts and Rush, which will definitely tell the story of Ned Kelly. Unfortunately, despite the outstanding performance of Heath Ledger in the lead role, the plot was paper thin .... which does not inspire me to read "Our Sunshine". There were a few other pluses, in particular Edgerton's support, a guaranteed direction from Jordan (confirming his talent at the Buffalo Soldiers exhibition), and a production project that gave the Australian bush a sense of austerity, just like the Irish immigrants of the early 19th century had to see. But I can not help feeling that another opportunity was missed to tell the true story of an Australian folk hero (or maybe?) .... in what I suspect is a concession to Hollywood and the sale of a painting in the USA. Well, at least Jordan and the producers did not agree to lose their beards just to satisfy the Universalist ... <br /> <br /> I guess I will have to settle for the excellent "Secret story of Kelly" by Peter Carey Banda " 4/10
