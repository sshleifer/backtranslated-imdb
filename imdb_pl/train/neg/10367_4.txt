This film was poorly written, malfunctioning and very predictable. It was a very low budget and I can understand why it was never released and went straight to the video. It was not even fun, it was just a complete disaster and I would like to be able to come back for 1-1 / 2 hours! The colors were terrible with a plot in which the holes are so large that you can drive them through a truck. <br /> <br /> The very plot made the young lady do things that she absolutely could not do physically - what a stretch! Skip this movie and watch something better in the genre of horror movies. I am reminded of any movie that is better than this one. <br /> <br /> ejames6342
