Perhaps I missed the meeting when the meaning of "B movie" was explained, but what I just saw was ridiculous. Do you want a good summary of this movie? Take Aliens, replace Xenomorphy with vampires, and then remove everything that was good, and almost everything. <br /> <br /> 5 minutes to the movie, "V-SAN Squad" (this is the stupid acronym I heard once) checks the "base", which was massacred by vampires, and then they go down (DOWN? Co?) The ladder, of course, attached to a billboard with an obvious contemporary train in the background. When is this supposed to happen? 2210. Okay ... (wait, I'll come back to this) <br /> <br /> Yes. form. Wow, well, there's this symbolic lesbian, Asian chick, fairy with a cowboy dick, weathered captain, a gothic vampire / hot part-time cashier, and the other in the pussy head. They are all played by their actors with the same lack of ambition. It almost hurts me when I saw Michael Ironside in this move. Does he not have enough money to be Sam Fisher's voice at Splinter Cell? The only thing that says Vampire Wars originally is how bad it is. <br /> <br /> Watching it after the birth of the film, the only entertainment I got was poor film rehearsals. Since when recording PCI computer cards on the wall counts as a ready space on a spaceship? The money needed to make this movie could have been used much better.
