Want to watch a horrifying horror? Then avoid this. There is not enough beer in the world to make this movie enjoyable. <br /> <br /> However, it is quite Scottish. Single-malt, if you can do it. <br /> <br /> If your previous comments were not enough to stop you from watching this video, let me help you. NASA sends one man and two unpaid additions to outer space into Saturn's orbit. A really big solar flare makes Colonel Steve West bleed from the nose. From there everything goes down and crazy appears. <br /> <br /> Actually, I read the adaptation of the book, which was published and published only in Great Britain. MILES better than a movie, and the book was terrible. At least a little goes to the tension, and the author explains some explanations of events (rhymes with "gas"). <br /> <br /> Not saying that the movie is completely worthless. Rick Baker learned that he really should read the contract before signing up for the movie, and Jonathan Demme found that he really is better suited to directing. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is an episode of MST3K with this movie, but it is of course quite edited. Without a mandatory flash of the breast, even the healing Scottish power can not save you. <br /> <br /> Please, just take a look at the Finders of the Lost Ark, if you want to see a guy melt. See Space Cowboys if you feel the need to see astronauts. I can not recommend this movie to a sober movie audience with a clear conscience.
