This movie is not worth your time. His dependence on New Age mysticism is the only semi-interesting pastime. The plot is repeated countless times. <br /> <br /> I was even asked to take the time to post a comment when I noticed that some people tried to reinforce the reputation of this bullshit. Their motivation and objectivity are questionable, because they encourage you not to look at the mistakes of the films, but their good intentions about New Age awareness. <br /> <br /> Would it be okay for around twenty to thirty evangelical Christians, or Islamic fundamentalists, to put positive ratings about movies / TV that support their views? Despite the bad qualities of production or the lack of truth in any alleged historical basis? I hope not. <br /> <br /> I am sure that the supporters will come right behind me to tell the truth about this film, despite the truth.
