I do not remember when I last reacted to the performance as emotionally as in the case of "Edison" Justin Timberlake. I became so emotional that I wanted to scream in pain, destroy the screen, easily accept the hopeless cries of nihilism. Timberlake is terribly unsuccessful; in fact, it is like casting Andy Dick to star in "Patton" or Nathan Lane to play Jesus. But it almost does not make sense. <br /> <br /> Timberlake is just a bad actor and he would be equally horrible in every role. I had problems with Ben Affleck's acting talent, but Timberlake makes Affleck look like Sir Ian McKellen or Dame Judi Dench. Thanks to his metrosexual lisping (read lithp), his boyish looks and emotional expressions that come from something like "25 Clich√© Expressions for Actors", he poisons the screen on which he is ruthlessly asked, and no matter how you cut him, I will not and will not buy my role as an amateur journalist who has become a crusader-justice. It simply will not fly. <br /> <br /> However, Timberlake himself is not guilty of his failure. Director David J. Burke puts him not only in (essentially) the main role, but also places him on the side of Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, John Heard, Dylan McDermott, Cary Elwes and (I'm surprised he was just as good) LL Cool J. I can imagine that one almost suffers physically, watching how part of this cast interacts with Timberlake. <br /> <br /> Of course there is something positive about it: when one of these actors interacts with Justin, it feels like a double relief. Pleasure if you want. Freeman and Spacey may not have more than 10 minutes of time together on the screen, but ten minutes is blissful, unlike their scenes with our so-called hero. Dylan McDermott is also a breath of fresh air. <br /> <br /> But enough Timberlake hits - words are not enough in this particular case to do it. "Edison" is a very, very popular story of corruption. His plot varies from banal to simply ridiculous. I admire, however, the motivation to do it, which I interpret as a tribute to films such as "Serpico", "Donnie Brasco", and maybe even "Chinatown". Do not get me wrong - "Edison" is not even in the same place as these movies, but I can extend my suspension of disbelief to admire his reason for existence, perhaps to justify my sitting. <br /> <br /> The script itself has a surprisingly bad writing. Yes, he has a few decent changes, but any conversation between Piper Perabo (who is wasting here) and Timberlake looks like she was raised straight from the Dawson's Creek episode. It's your typical, too-glib-for-reality, let-be-impressed-the-audience-of-the-well-we-speak (and fails) dialogue. This dialogue is interrupted by great music at inappropriate times - sometimes it seems that Edison wants to turn into a music video in which the emotions of this scene are not transmitted by acting, but because of ill-chosen music and different film speeds (slow-motion reading) ). <br /> <br /> Thinking about it, "Edison" is curiosity. He will definitely get a cast to kill, but the performances are destroyed by Timberlake, which just does not work. In the film, as in most arts, if one is off, the whole thing does not seem to make sense. Directors must make difficult choices. David J. Burke did not get here. Some scenes play well in their own right, but as a whole they do not seem to fit into puzzles from various puzzles forced in one incoherent picture. At the beginning it is not a particularly exciting puzzle.
