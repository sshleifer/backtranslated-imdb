It's a scary little movie - and unfortunately the company that created this short movie created a few others. Short is basically an idea for one joke, which at first was not funny and can offend you. It certainly made me feel uncomfortable watching very young children (most seemed to be about 2 years old), playing and pretending to be adults - in this case, a dancehall girl and a bar lady. It's kind of humor that you can be forced to laugh with your own kids if they pretend to be adults, but I do not see anyone wanting to see it - especially when a very young Shirley Temple is dressed in a pretty slinky outfit and acts like a vampire !! And then other children behave like adults in some rather adult situations. At the time I am sure that they did not try to appeal to pedophiles, but looking at it today, it comes to mind immediately! For this reason, this boring movie has also frightened me and I hope that I will never see it again !! Quite strange and terrible.
