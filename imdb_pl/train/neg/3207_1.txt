Oh my God, it was so bad! The story was poor - at best - and the animation was flat and lifeless - even childish. This movie is too serious ... unless of course it was supposed to be funny. I saw it last week at the London Sci-Fi Festival, and the whole audience laughed at each scene. I think my favorite was "you should not study medicine in Oopsalof"! I also think that they have tried to see how many times they could have pressed into the only line of Nicalo's form: "we will be together ... it's our destiny." I am sorry, but for the first time the words have lost their importance. <br /> <br /> And what was with the apple? <br /> <br /> I recommend this as a lesson for Americans: You can not animate, so do not try. You're just embarrassed.
