I discovered that this movie is rented based on the packaging. Zombie in the front of the DVD looks cool and terrible. then you come to the movie, and the women with the shed masks. zero special effects ... and even battle scenes you can see how they miss holes 2 feet. The funny thing is that Lommel alone in the film works short and is worse than the rest of the actors in the film. the only thing I can think of is that Lommel is just trying to make such a bad movie that people call him an "iconic classic" ... but I can not imagine anyone thinking it's anything other than one of the worst films in history made. the real horror in this movie is how bad. I am embarrassed that I rented it and I swear that I will never see another Lommel movie again!
