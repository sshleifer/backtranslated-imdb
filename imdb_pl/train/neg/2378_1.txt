Why did any legal actor who read the script participate in this shit? My God, it's really embarrassing to even watch. I can not imagine the shame that these people must feel that they are part of it. There is also some controversy as to whether River Phoenix has an episode in the film. He was invaluable, but his list of roles here (IMDB) gives him credit. BTW ... Rain is his sister for those who have asked before. This movie is proof that regardless of how many great names you have. Ears sows do not make silk bags. I love Lorraine Bracco, but it was just sad, sad, sad ... Maybe someone can explain the reason for this kind of film someday. There are no endearing, fun and even comedic properties in comparison with others.
