It was a painful example of a cheap, boring and non-original program produced by Australian television stations to meet local content limits. Writing was really terrible and I'm not surprised that the writers are responsible for the worst Australian movie in the last memory of Honerable Wally Norman. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this series was fun - never - even mildly fun. It was just tired and BAD and the worst of it was really fun. Watching was simply embarrassing. <br /> <br /> There is something very worrying about this program, which gets 10 out of 10 in IMDb. Try to find a (real) review of the (real) Australian viewer of the series (there were not many of them) and it is impossible. Or crazy. There are loaves of bread that are more fun than this show. <br /> <br /> Avoid the show at all costs, and if it appears on DVD, remember that the laughter it deserves was unintentional.
