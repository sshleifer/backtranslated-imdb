What a fantastic premise: a film about Berlin air transport. It should have it all. Tragedy. Uncertainty. Companionship. Rivals. Berlin Frauleini and difficult American pilots. love and tears. We have a movie without any of the above. Heino Ferch tries to impersonate John Wayne, but he fails. It behaves so wooden that it should break at any moment. Trying to play on a hard guy instead of being a hard guy! Why does the character Bettina Zimmermann fall in love with him? Because they threw stones at the lake? Because he brings her carbon bricks? SFX are very, very well done. Too much. Hundreds of aircraft over Berlin are more like a fighter-attack squadron than organized air transport? as it was in reality. Interestingly, the White House, the Kremlin and the office of General Lucius D. Clays seem to be one and the same dark and dusty set. Pay attention to the same curtains, hanging deep in the windows, like a protective shield against nuclear fallout. Why is almost every scene dark and dusty inside? By the way, GENERAL LUCIUS D. CLAY, he turns out to be a small time, an uncertain, looser general who honestly believes in his own noble idea of ​​air transport. He was very much against it. So you combine all these individual errors and create a movie that does not build passion, no tension and historical accuracy. Sad, it started so promising?
