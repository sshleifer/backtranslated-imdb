The story is similar to ET: extraterrestrial runs on the ground and tries to get back home. While staying on our planet, it will create a friendly relationship with people. <br /> <br /> But unlike ET, which exudes drama, comedy, poetry, this movie is just fun. This is actually the pure production of Dysney: her main audience are children, and the film is more visual than in the message. <br /> <br /> In this way you will find some funny scenes (first observation of the city, a "cosmic" storied toaster) and casting is experimented, with special mention "Doc", which rejuvenates the character "Mac Fly" and Hurley, who seems open to self-mockery. /> Ice on the cake: the main title is judged by Danny Elfman, and like every great composer, you recognize his "voice" before he is credited.
