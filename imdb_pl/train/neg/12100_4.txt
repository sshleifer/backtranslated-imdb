Do not get me wrong. If you need a careful summary of everything that was wrong with the history of human civilization, as well as a faultless path to the brighter future of humanity, who better to turn to a comedian and the practice of pop culture? If you need a healthy dose of all the solid, healthy reasons for which religion has survived its usefulness, turn to Sagan or Dawkins, not BILL MAHER for God (?)! It's a good point in itself. Maher rejects our religious past as a neurological disorder, conveniently ignoring the way its entire society, art and science are rooted in it. <br /> <br /> In this movie, he relies heavily on his sophisticated set of irony and cynicism to make his point, trying to be erudite and wise. Unfortunately, his intellect can not cope with the task. <br /> <br /> Maher makes us laugh, but apparently it's not the brightest bulb in the box. As an example, he answers the interview (and I use this term loosely, because it was clearly all "ambushees") that Jesus' existence is a historical fact with a deadly "No, it is not" followed by a long look to convey the contempt of naivety entity (device nauseously abused in this movie). The problem is that the person was right, and Maher was wrong, claiming that Jesus is only mentioned in what he considers to be historically suspicious gospels. I think Mr. Maher never read the contemporary historian Josephus. <br /> <br /> But the masses will come to this pseudo-document, because they are doing fictitious works of other intellectual giants like Michael Moore, and they will loudly beat and guffaw (they certainly did it with my show). <br /> <br /> However, it is a double confession that the loudest and most mulish braying occurred during about 70% of the time, which the film devoted to anti-Christian tirade, while the audience was completely mute during the 10% token dedicated to the criticism described by of the Religion of Peace. Hmmm. Either criticism of Islam is unavailable to a hyper and liberal target group, or they just feared laughing. Very eloquent, anyway ..
