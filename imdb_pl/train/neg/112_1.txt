This movie is simply awful. John Ritter is doing pratt, 75% of actors deliver their lines as if they were reading them from memory cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is difficult to capture in places over background noise), and a plot that really does not go anywhere. I did not think I would ever say that, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this movie. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen fulfills the passion of Ben Stein. I began to wonder if she was dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's children are terrible (the oldest definitely reads his poems from the memory card). This movie is really awful. There is a reason why Bogdanovich could not get another project until 4 years later. Do not watch this. If you see it on your TV list, cancel your cable. If a friend offers you, consider your friendship again. If your spouse wants to see him, it's better to find another soul mate. I prefer to pick my eyes with the arrows from the lawn, then sit down at the piece of rubbish again. If I could summarize this movie in one word, it would be: Suckotrocity
