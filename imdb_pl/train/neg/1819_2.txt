I was looking for this movie for one reason - Al Adamson. He is one of the worst directors of all time - just with Ed Wood, Jr. and Ray Dennis Steckler and the pantheon of horrors. However, I was a bit disappointed because even though the movie was really bad, he never came close to the horror level of some of his earlier Schlocky movies. For this reason, watching this movie was not particularly fun for fans. <br /> <br /> Now I was wary of watching this movie because the title "Naughty Stewardesses" makes the movie sound like a pornographic movie - something I would not look at in IMDb. However, this movie sometimes seemed so - especially the first 10 minutes. But you can say that the script has undergone many changes, because for the majority of the film there is no excitement at all, and at the end of the movie there is a conspiracy that comes out of what is violent and certainly NOT sexy! The result of all this is total confusion. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, none of the many parts is even good. For example, as a porn movie, it shows surprisingly little And it is incomprehensible why they put a 71-year-old guy in some love scenes. Sure, Mr. Livingston, 71, looked pretty good - but he was still an old man and no one would like to see him with a young nymph! Then, when the last 20 minutes become very violent, Livingston became a guy like Rambo! Talk about strange and inappropriate. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, this sad movie is not recommended. It's not bad enough or sexy enough to worry about it, and the movie is boring, even with such a crazy title as "Naughty Stewardesses."
