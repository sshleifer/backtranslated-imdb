I will give the author / director William Gove recognition for finding someone who will finance this ill-conceived "thriller". A good argument not to waste money on an HBO subscription, let alone buy DVDs based on covers and blur. Pedestrian Dennis Hopper and Richard Grieco do not add anything significant to their biographies, although the direction of art is not half bad. Dialogue will make you wounded in amazement over his conceit; this is the worst story. No tension, no tension, no fear, no fear, no empathy, no catharsis, nothing. A few attractive and often naked women add variety to boredom, but this is definitely the movie best seen as a trailer. I'm sorry about the guy who smoked this thing. Good to watch only at night, without zones. You have been warned.
