CQ was the worst movie I saw this year. Almost every movie I choose in the theater is at least funny or has something to say. This movie looked like it was directed by a film student for his Intro. to the Film class. His father makes great films. His sister did a good job. But Roman's brother? NO! One of the critics had the courage to compare this movie to Godard's Le MÃ©pris (Contempt). While Coppola Jr. he came up with the same idea, the film about the film, he tried too hard to make it look European, artistic and witty, when it's really kitschy. The main actor wears the same expression throughout the movie, as if he was in awe or shocked about the movie around him. Schwartzman somehow manages to play the role of an extravagant director. Depardieu is fine. The only scene that has something of a real movie humor is, surprisingly, not the B movie scene, but the one that takes place in Italy; assembly of shots of several different characters in a very small car, driving around and tossing random people. It was the only thing that reminded me of the cinema, which I think she tried to counterfeit. Or rip off. Or both. A documentary was created with a guide talking with the camera and filming various objects, the ending was marked because of the "turnaround" or artistic value ... The funniest movie in this movie was not the way it intended. It is not surprising that this film was sent back after the festival screening, to be re-edited or re-made, or anything else that interested me, how bad it was before. I can not believe it could be worse than that. If you want to see a good movie parody, check out Austin Powers. Any of them. Opening to the third is more fun and more brilliant than the whole movie. Lil 'Romy, for the benefit of the cinema, I PLEASE go back to directing my cousin's music videos. Leave the Godfather to Daddy.
