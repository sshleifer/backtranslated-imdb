CARRY ON MATRON was released in 1972 and it becomes clear that the series reached the natural end with the best works, such as CLEO, UP THE KYBER and SCREAMING, from the mid to late 1960's. <br /> <br /> MATRON is in It's not bad at all, we just saw it all with a thin plot (a group of spywa trying to break into the hospital to steal the contraceptive pills that they intend to sell to third world countries) surrounded by gags a bit funny, though uncomplicated. I think that's the problem - the gags are not that funny with the uncomplicated nature that begins to show its age. Did we need another film that uses a man dressed as a woman to make a story? Perhaps the worst criticism I can make is that I saw CARRY ON MATRON this afternoon, less than twelve hours ago and have a problem remembering a very funny line. This is a serious problem for comedy
