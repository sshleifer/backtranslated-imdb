This show is painful to watch ... <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the creators had no idea what to do with this show, with constantly changing "professions", boys and cast. Looks like they wanted to throw Amanda Bynes in something ... but they had no idea what, and they came up with this shitty program. They cast her as a teenager, surrounded by twenty and thirty people, and placed her in most adult cases during unsuccessful comedies. They soon realize that they need a "clique" and throw people around the age of 20 to try to pass as teenagers. <br /> <br /> How this program lasted 4 seasons is beyond me. In some way, ABC decided that it was a "family" program and threw it into the afternoon composition of the ABC family.
