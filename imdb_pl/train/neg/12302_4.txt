Italian-American co-production with Linda Blair and David "The Hoff" Hasselhoff: how can any fan of cheesy horror resist such an approach? and completely absurd, the first forty minutes, I would say "very easily"; Fortunately, thanks to the introduction of some ingenious death scenes, things become a bit more fun, and for those who are lucky to find an uncut copy, there is also a little nudity (unfortunately, my copy has been optically edited to remove such offensive material). <br /> <br /> Hoff plays Gary, a photographer who accompanies his beautiful girlfriend Leslie (Leslie Cumming) in a dilapidated hotel on a seemingly abandoned island to take pictures of her latest project, a book on witches; while there, frustrated, Gary also hopes he will try to heal a bad case of blue balls, freeing Leslie from her virginity. <br /> <br /> His plans for nookie are however limited by the unexpected arrival of the developers Freddie and Rose Brooks (Robert Champagne and Annie Ross), their pregnant daughter Jane (Blair), son Tommy (Michael Manchester), pretty architect nymphomaniac Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland) and real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth) who came to check the hotel on the island. <br /> <br /> After explaining their unexpected presence on the island, Gary and Leslie are welcomed by new property owners, and when a violent storm suddenly rises, making a dangerous return to land, everyone agrees to spend the night in an old building. Unfortunately, without the knowledge of new hotel guests, this place is also home to the evil witch's ghost (Hildegard Knef), which requires human sacrifices to bring to life. In turn, the victims are drawn into a whirling red whirl (which guarantees unintentional laughter) before they encounter a terrible fate. <br /> <br /> Nothing makes sense, and acting is terrible (Manchester because Tommy is particularly angry, while Hasselhoff turns out to be one of the better performers, which testifies to others), but those viewers who will survive the grim the first half is rewarded with quite decent moments of gore: Rose has her mouth sewn together before being baked alive in the fireplace; Jerry is crucified and burnt alive; Linda is tortured by the witches and pierced swordfish (!!); Freddie's veins pulsate and explode in the geysers of blood; and Gary is stabbed in the back. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Leslie is raped by a guy without lips, and Blair is possessed (again).
