I know that cheap cheap shots, but this movie is a perfect example of how a collection of significant "depths" (political turmoil, love / desire) can be combined accidentally with great critical acclaim (see also "American beauty"). Kaufman's film revolves around unproductive sex scenes intertwined with often painful dialogue sequences (in one scene I counted three different "general" European accents influenced by actors), and state shows can be amokowe, but do not combine them into a coherent kundera meditation offered. in more than three hours it almost shines over franz, the missing fourth song in the love triangle, which lies at the heart of the plot, and thus devotes a central mechanism of the novel showing the spectrum of emotions and power relations that are obtained in romances. it does not even contain a symbolic screen time for Tomas's son, used in the novel, to illustrate some of the political points that Kundera created in the novel. in combination with a horrifying soundtrack, these disadvantages mean that three hours of film are unbearably heavy and at the same time light in the content.
