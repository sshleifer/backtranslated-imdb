The film is bad. There is no other way to say it. The story is weak and outdated, especially for this country. I do not think most people know what a "stroller" is. I felt like watching a movie from the 70's. The topic was not credible in 2007, even in DC. I think it worked the same for everyone else who watched it too, because the applause was low and fast at the end. Most also did not stay on Q & A. <br /> <br /> I do not think Schrader really thought about the film in advance. Many of the scenes seemed to be shortened as if they were never completed or simply did not know how to finish them. He jumped from one scene to another and you had to try to find out what was going on. I really did not get a private life or Woody's boyfriend (Carter). What was it about "artistic" male images of men and torture (from prisoners in Iraq)? What was he thinking? I think it was his very poor attempt to create a dark private life subculture for Woody's character (Car). It did not work. It did not even seem to make sense. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie was Woody Harrelson. He played his character (car) unmistakably. You really understood what a "walker" might look like (say twenty years ago). He was great and he will probably never be recognized for it. <br /> <br /> What about Lauren, Lily and Kristin ... Boring. <br /> <br /> Do not look! It is painful! Unless you're a real Harrelson fan.
