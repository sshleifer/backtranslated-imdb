I just watched this movie in high definition on TV. I am in a wheelchair because of neuromuscular disorders and I like watching a few films about people with physical disabilities. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, I considered the main character to be a bit noble and captivating. His message about people with disabilities and the time he spent fighting for the recognition and integration of people with disabilities in the mainstream labor market is great. And my problem is not about the real person who did it. He was a great man. But this film is completely hypocritical and diametrically opposed to the very message that claims to have been offensive. <br /> <br /> First of all, they did not cast anyone in the title role with real physical disability. Sure, they were competent actors, but it seems completely untrue to proclaim the employment of people with disabilities and then not employ disabled people in the film. What's more, in one scene in the middle of the film you can see a man walking on a podium with crutches, which seems to have only one leg. But CGI on this stage is so obvious that he is shy. What? They could not find actual amputation anywhere in the movie? In the case of a 5-second shot, it was better to get CGI effects than simply HIRE CURRENT amputated? At this point in the film, I found it unfair and completely contrary to the message I was trying to convey that I had come here to jump out and moan, like a pathetic cripple.
