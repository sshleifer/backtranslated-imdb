Yes, I'm sure it can really be a nation. . . if four of them were on the four corners of the world, and the other two cloned several billion times. Man, I'm REALLY glad I saw this movie on FEAR.net instead of borrowing it. I'm a huge fan of George Romero's films and I'm pretty sure that if he saw this movie, he would probably have thrown himself laughing too much. I mean, what was with the sheds that posed as zombies and walk like Charlie's devils? It also really helped that the music composer chose poor music from fashion shows, when the zombies approached their killer, especially the part in which they go to the warehouse, giving up the store with furniture / komisariat / flat / any room, in which was with the gong in the background, and the living woman was arguing about a closed furniture store. I could not even say what nationality the killer was, as well as the fact that his accent indicated that many nations did not help either. Well, what can you expect from a movie in which they cast a random battle scene for no reason in a warehouse where they apparently send air boxes around the world. So for all those who worship the Mystery Science Theater 3000 or just like reaming on bad C (C for Craptastic) movies, this is a movie for you. . . or not.
