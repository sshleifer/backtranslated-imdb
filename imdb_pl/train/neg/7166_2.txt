This movie could have been very good, but it is short. Tricky special effects and so on. I could look into the past if this story was not so bad. If there were more stories, it would be better. The story focuses on the evil druid who is associated with the woman who gets migraines. The film stretches and pulls and never explains anything, it just keeps turning. Christopher Walken has a role, but it is completely pointless, like most of the movie. This movie had potential, but it looks like some of them are really bad for a TV movie. I would like to avoid this movie.
