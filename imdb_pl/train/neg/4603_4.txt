I was surprised when I could not see when he was screened at the Philly Film Fest last year, so when I saw that there would be a cable today, I reminded him whenever he could. Was it worth the wait? Let's go back a little bit, as I have to give you the story. Sean Crawley is a young man who does not know his way of life. Enter Duke (George Wendt) who introduces him to his boss Ray (Danny Baldwin). One night, Ray, completely confused, asks Sean to lead the guy they followed Sean. And from there it goes. Which brings me back to my question. Was it worth the wait? Yes and no, the accumulation was quite good, and George Wendt stole my film. He just took the ball and ran with it. But it is not as brutal as I believed, and somewhere during the film the ball is not only dropped, but buried in a different direction. I know where exactly this point occurred, but I can not say without spoiling the movie. But needless to say it happened. The ending does not save the movie either. Poor Stuart Gordon nothing can be good like "Re-animator" or "Castle Freak". <br /> <br /> My degree: C <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Extreme <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kari Wuhrer shows his ta-tas in one fantasy and then in the next tares and turns down ... ABOVE MY GOD MY EYES MY EYES !!!!!
