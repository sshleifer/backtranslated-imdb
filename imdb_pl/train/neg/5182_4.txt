Like most entries at festivals, Hamiltons creates an interesting watch that contains all the ideas and few performances. Although impressive due to the obvious low budget, the film fails in its final turn and becomes extremely long during its drawing and obvious conclusions. The film is about a family of murderous outcasts who try to survive after the death of their parents. They kidnapped people, sucked blood from them and fed something locked in the basement. There are some nice, darkly humorous performances by Mckellhar and Firgens, and the rest are so-so. The film is never realistic or disturbing. But in the first half there is a strangely funny and dark mix, which is a surprising achievement. The next half is not so successful, because it falls into a film oblivion with unrealistic twists in an absurdly conceited finale, which turns the whole movie into complete nonsense. It is a pity, though there is no doubt that some talent was involved in this production and although it is very flawed, it remains original and creative. It is a pity that when it comes to delivery, it completely fails at every level. <br /> <br /> ** / 5
