I saw this movie in 1979, I was 17 or 18 when it was released. The theater was maybe 1/4 full. Ten minutes to the film, me and a friend who went with me to see the movie were the only two people in the theater. The movie was really strange and it had no plot or reason for the script, and people demanded a refund. We decided to stay on the whole film .... why endure such torture? ... here's why. We wanted to be real film critics ... to have a standard on which all other films would be based, it is difficult to justify the statement that you have seen the best movie (10) that they have always come up with something better. But it's easy to base all other movies on the worst film ever made (and this is ... best 1). There may be other videos that really qualify as 1, but I have not seen them yet. Now I base all the films I see on a scale based on the worst ... I AM THE TRUE CRITICISM OF THE FILM ... he on.
