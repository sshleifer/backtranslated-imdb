If Bob Ludlum was to see this mini-series, he would cry. It was a total waste of time and money. I have read the book and although the films are not exactly what the book may be, CBS wasted this time and money, and the embarrassing claim that it was Ludlum's work. <br /> <br /> Maybe the creator check out Bourne's identity with Richard Chamberlain and see how good this TV series was. <br /> <br /> Poor Mir, Blair, Anjelica and Colm, why have they signed up to bend so low? <br /> <br /> Horrible !!
