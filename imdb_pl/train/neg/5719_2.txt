This film is very similar to a movie hostel, with the exception of * BAD * acting and not very much tension. Elements of gore are there, but you really do not feel anything for heroes, making violence not very effective. Some parts are just weird ... like forcing a snake to the throat. What is going on? Is it supposed to be frightening or bloody? It's just stupid. As for torture, there really are not any (except that in the beginning the guy is set on fire, which does not show anyway). The main bad guy always repeats that "dying slowly", but the butcher kills them all very quickly. All deaths are relatively quick. Yes, I watched the "no evaluation" version. So, overall, it's not the worst gore movie I've seen, but it's not good at all. You will not miss anything if you skip this one.
