Please do not rent or even think about buying this movie. They do not even have it in a red box for rent, which would cost $ 1 and I think it's worth less than that. The main reason why I rented this movie is because Jenna Jameson is in the movie lol between 2-5 min. And he admits that the movie had hot chicks and a lot of nudity, but otherwise you can also buy another horror d, which the same with Ginger Lynn has more time to appear in this movie than Jenna and does not even have it on the cover of the movie or her name. I recommend people to watch zombie strippers because you see Jenna almost throughout the movie and naked most of this movie is a huge disappointment and a huge waste of time.
