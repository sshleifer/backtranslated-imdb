It's a really awful movie. What they did was a television program that was never aimed at young children and was subjected to the treatment of George Lucas (ie He ruined it, kidnapping him to speak to a younger audience). <br /> <br /> OK, so the Thunderbirds TV show was not the smartest show, in fact it was quite formal, but watching was always enjoyable (especially when the models were blown up), and the voice cast was not too bad. <br /> <br /> Suffer from bad casts and bad acting (with notable exceptions by Sophia Myles as Lady Penelope and Ron Cook as Parker, who seem to be the only cast members who have an idea of ​​how their characters should be played) and after this parody I would not let Frakes direct the movement. <br /> <br /> The whole point of the Thunderbirds was that it was all about Tracy's family and how they worked as a team, preventing disasters or coming to the rescue of people involved in disasters. <br /> <br /> Avoid this garbage like a plague. <br /> <br /> I only give 1 in 10, because the zero rating is not supported.
