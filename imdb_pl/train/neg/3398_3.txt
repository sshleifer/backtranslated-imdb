It seems that the intent of the film was to show the aggressive (maffian) character of the Russians, or at least those Russians who are able to travel outside their large country; that it is too easy to rob a bank in England; and that the British police are so ineffective that they can not find the person who robbed the bank, even if they are leaving the country by air. In addition, Nicole Kidman and fake Russian colleagues spoke a language that has not yet been identified, probably used by aliens in the Ural Mountains, but far from Russian. So, Nicole, if you really want to speak in Russian, go to Moscow or St. Petersburg and be busy learning the grammar of the Russian language and its pronunciation.
