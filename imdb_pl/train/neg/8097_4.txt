Considered by many critics to be one of the greatest stinks of all time (certainly the biggest smelly career of director Brian De Palma). <br /> <br /> Sherman McCoy (Tom Hanks) is a happy, rich boy whose life goes to pieces when he and his lover Maria Ruskin (Melanie Griffith) are involved in the hit-and-run. His story is described by another satisfied guy, reporter Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis). <br /> <br /> Well, as I said in the summary ... <br /> <br /> What kind of movie to be? It seems to combine comedy, drama and satire, but it certainly does not add up too much. It is undermined by unimaginably disgusting, one-dimensional figures that you would never want to be dissatisfied with in a real life encounter. <br /> <br /> I am not a big fan of the novel (I started to read it once, but I could not finish it because I did not like it), but it is obvious to me that those who liked the novel consider this film to be complete parody. <br /> <br /> I have never seen so many talented actors who are trying hard to give a film below average a certain level of quality and defeat. What a loss. <br /> <br /> The problems start with throwing a nice guy Tom Hanks in a role that apparently has to be non-coping. And the role of Peter Fallow in the novel was the role of the Briton. Bruce Willis is wrong, BADLY wrong in this role. What was there? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, even Morgan Freeman can not escape the movie with intact dignity, being obliged to deliver a lame, hard lecture on "decency" after the climax. /> <br /> This movie turns into an absurd farce. <br /> <br /> I liked the gathering of talents; I will give him four out of ten, but I am sure that some people will say that a better movie could be made out of the source material.
