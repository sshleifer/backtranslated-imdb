(aka: BLOOD CASTLE or SCREAM OF THE DEMON) <br /> <br /> * spoiler * <br /> <br /> It was a drive-in function, co-occurring with THE VELVET VAMPIRE. A Spanish-Italian co-production, in which a series of women were murdered in the village at the same time, when the local count Yanos Dalmar is seen on a horse, leaves with his "man eating" a dog behind him. <br /> <br /> Residents of the city already suspect that he is behind all this and wants his castle to burn. The murders began for the first time in a time when Count Yanos' older brother, Count Igor Dalmar, was terribly burned and killed in a laboratory accident. <br /> <br /> Then the woman Ivanna (Erna Schuer) whom Igor hired before his death to help him appear in his experiments. Yanos agrees to employ her in the place of her brother and together they look for formulas for regenerating dead cells. Yanos wants to bring Igor's charred body back to life. <br /> <br /> But of course, Igor is still alive (though terribly burnt) and persecutes and kills women in the village. We can see his ghastly face appearing at different points in the movie, so we know he's still alive, which makes the whole thing seem a bit too obvious. <br /> <br /> Igor meets with another fiery end to fight Yanos for Ivanna, with burning candles falling on the same bed, which Igor encounters, meeting another, the final end of the roasted meat. <br /> <br /> DVD Retromedia comes from a VHS source and looks quite grainy and bad. In addition to the trailer even scratching, no other extras are included. Although it has a nice, scary Spanish castle and a good atmosphere, it turned out to be quite boring and predictable, with no emotions or secrets. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
