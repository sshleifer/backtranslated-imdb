Ever since Europe began to fight World War II until the end of the war, Hollywood (with considerable pressure from the government) has produced a lot of movies that were intended to get young men to join the army, and the serviceman's life looks like "cool ". This is definitely the worst, suggesting that the soldier's life is deprived of work, you get the best food and you can lie all day listening to Radio Ann Miller. I am too young to participate in the Second World War, but I think there was more to it. It is the rarest feline mustache and several musical numbers with some of the main acts of the day. <br /> <br /> I think that by 1943 even the most naive civilians knew that there was more abroad than the crazy hyijins presented in this film. Although I am sure that this was to be an escapist entertainment, I can not help but wonder whether the family and relatives of those fighting in the war were amused or rejected by this trivialization of their loved ones.
