The black guy becomes a rich white guy, and the rich white guy seems to accept the hip-hop culture, and most of the "funny" moments of the movie play this. I have a problem with it that it does not work and hardly ever works. <br /> <br /> OK, so no one would expect Lance to catch such a body and suddenly start acting like Charles Wellington. That would be too much to ask. I will give it. But at the same time it goes too far in a different direction. Should I imagine a rich white guy singing rap and a totally insistent, hip hop-like bastion of culture, and people just * accept him? And what about Sontee, who falls in love with him * as a rich white guy *, though he does not care for his money or power? It's so unbelievable that it's not even funny. <br /> <br /> I just could not suspend disbelief and could not finish the movie. I added one more star because it made me laugh a few times. But I just could not miss the whole "white hip-hop guy" that was never well done in any movie I've ever seen. This was not an exception.
