This program pisses me off! He has no humor and is too serious to call him "fun"! This is too educational, as I like it! Characters are very stereotypical and unattractive. Plots are superfluous and morality is repeated over and over again. Where is the fun? It seems to me that it was too long in the BBC and there is too much broadcast. Do you really need to have a slot for T.V every 2 or 3 months, when the completely new program will run out of episodes? I think the time has come for the BBC to start restoring some of its older programs, such as: Inspector Gadget, Bananaman, The Smurfs, Snorks, Moomin, Szopy and Count Duckula, other than constantly contracting with newer programs! I thought the BBC was bringing Danger Mouse, so what's happening ?! 3/10
