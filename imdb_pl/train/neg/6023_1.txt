It reminds me of when I was a born-again believer who was to become a minister. I never really thought I would be a minister or even a high school graduate, because I was pretty sure that I would be kidnapped to Heaven before it happened. That was before I discovered that Christianity is nonsense. I am now an atheist, and this only proves that a doctorate "once saved, always saved", which Christians tell us about, is no more real than the elves. If that was true, then why after many years of being a born-again pious I left? Yes, I was really saved. I prayed to stupid sinners with all my heart. <br /> <br /> If Christians were to read the Bible, they would discover that their god thinks like rape, genocide, abortion and many other cruelties according to him. They may be surprised to find out that there is no word "delight" there.
