This youthful, bland flutter is designed exclusively for teenagers in old men's bodies, desperate to survive their hormonally challenged teenagers. How ? By burning gas and identifying a fast, reckless car (or plane) with ease. <br /> <br /> The plot borrows heavily from Mr. Rogers' neighborhood (if it was run by my oil conglomerate) and Logan's Run (if he was calm down and lacking a clear style). <br /> <br /> Performed by Lee Majors and Burgess Meredith, this movie takes place in a world after a gas crisis in which the omnipotent government does not want you (* ahem *) to drive your car and burn gas. This is the opposite of today's governments of Enron and Bush, seizing oil, pushing the SUV. <br /> <br /> This combination makes the movie fun. But wait ... there is more. Although the film is set in the future, we do not show any signs of future technology, beyond the return to bicycles, golf carts and horses. You will believe that the future looks ... exactly like today. The same clothes, the same suburban homes, the same green lawns as today and when the film was filmed. There are no solar panels, no windmills, no concessions for alternative energy. <br /> <br /> Acting is flat and tasteless. Even scenes that could be sharp or moving, buddy, honor, romance, horror ... everything falls flatter than a paper doll under a briefcase. <br /> <br /> There is no continuity - the plane flew away. Character Burgess Meredith changes color and configuration from moment to moment, when filmmakers offend our intelligence with unparalleled film materials. <br /> <br /> The plot is so moronic and half as exciting as the episode of Dukes of Hazzard. <br /> <br /> Even hardcore car and SF fans should avoid this movie like a monthly roadkill, unless you like insulting Exxon executives trying to make a movie as empty as the hero's fuel tank.
