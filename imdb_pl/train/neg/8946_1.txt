I think the photos and lighting were very poor. When I watched it for the first time, I thought it was an old version (1956). When I really discovered the real year of the film, I was shocked. I did not know that a bad movie could be created so recently. It's really all I wanted to say. However, this movie had a good story, nothing to be missed, if you just read the novel George Orwelll wrote. Everything I really want to say has already been said, except this: I can not believe that this movie could have received so many awards and nominations. made. Well, that's all. So long
