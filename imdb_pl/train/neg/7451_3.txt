I'm sorry, not good. <br /> <br /> It starts interesting, but loses a few minutes in the movie. <br /> <br /> It does not help much that none of the usually great actors (Quaid, Glover, Ermey, Leto, etc.) provide really good performance. <br /> <br /> It may have been due to the fact that I saw the dubbed version (German), but the character of Dennis Quaid was particularly wooden and irritating, and Danny Glover is not really a credible villain. What's more, the character of Jared Leto does not really make any contribution to the story (except saving the life of one main character at some point, but this scene is necessary as a windshield wiper on a submarine ;-) <br /> <br /> Speaking about unnecessary scenes - the main complaint is really tangled and banal tale: detective (of course!) Must settle a personal matter with a villain and is (of course!) Suspended in official duties his personal entanglement. Killer (of course!) * Wants to be tracked and for years playing cat and mouse with his opponent ... I do not know how many movies were built on a similar story - most of them are better, <br /> <br /> a lot of holes and a lot of completely unbelievable and unnecessary scenes that do not contribute to the story at all or work well with it (eg a truck stopping scene or a car on the edge of a cliff, etc.) <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the ending is trying to be original and exciting, but in this respect it fails. We have seen * much * better finals with a similar type of configuration: "the final battle on a train in an abandoned-winter-landscape". Finally, the supposedly moving meeting of the parent and child ... hokey, at least.
