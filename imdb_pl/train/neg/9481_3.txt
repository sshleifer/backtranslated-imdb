James Bishop (Matt Stasi) goes to a "mental illness facility" to assign a doctor to Dr. McCort (Bruce Paynes). There he realizes that many Interns are killed by the "Ripper" who takes their souls to the devil in a cult promoted by Dr. McCort. This story is so absurd and immoral that it is impossible to write a summary. Dialogues are so absurd, especially when Helen's figure, James Bishop's blond fiancé comes to asylum, that it's unbelievable that the writer had the courage to include them in the script. And what about James back to the hospital to get the files of the dead patients? And the cast, made up of actors of ham and actresses? Honestly, I do not know what or who is the worst in this movie: script, director or cast. The correct answer is for sure all of this. I saw this movement on cable TV and I am amazed how a producer can spend money on such garbage. This horror becomes very funny considering the absurdity of the story. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Demônio" ("The Devil")
