Summary: The full moon. The creature, a great werewolf, is on the hunt. Not for the body, not for the blood (though I do not think it bites on the way), but for the partner. He's looking for a girl. Not any girl. Girl. A girl who is clean (and also a werewolf, although she does not know it yet). Thirdly, check whether the two cops (after the first scene) and the old lady of the handbag are all that can stop her, and even know that the thing killing and eating many people with the full moon is a werewolf. This powerful werewolf, Darkwolf, is approaching the girl. If it is obtained, humanity is doomed. Now the cops have to find a girl, convince her not only that there is someone a werewolf who wants to rape her and maybe kill her, but she is a werewolf herself. And then they had to stop him ... <br /> <br /> Comments: This is one for boys, teenage boys. Many scenes with half-naked girls are more or less important for the story. Mainly less. Well, I think you need something to fill some time because the plot is (probably) thin. And unfortunately there are not many girls who could help break the conspiracy. Usually, we go to two main topics. Nudity. Check. And then special effects. Hmm ... There are things you can call effects. However, they are not special. In fact, to be honest, they are very bad. The film seems to suffer from a lack of funds. They could not afford clothes for some girls;), and the effects are cheap. Some of the transformations between a werewolf and a human form, of course made by a computer, are really bad. You can overlook such things. But Darkwolf himself is very primitive and you will never see any homicides. Later a few mutilated corpses. And in this movie, which should be sincerely flooded with blood, there is surprisingly little blood. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what to say about actors and characters. Most of the time they are doing well, but unfortunately there are mistakes when the characters (or actors) just lose it. Some of these errors may be related to the above-mentioned problems. How weak or poor budget (?). This may explain why there are not many valuable shootings, even if the characters are armed like a small army, and the target is in sight (and does not move). But hey, when you are in real danger, there is nothing that would save your life, like a good one-piece ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this can not explain the moments in which the cop, Steve, the only one who he knows how to deal with it, a werewolf who escapes when the only thing that can be sure is that the werewolf comes to get a girl who is right next to him and can not let her. But it certainly allowed the creators to stretch the end a bit more ... <br /> <br /> But I would not mind if any of the main actors / actresses tried the next movie. <br /> <br /> Well. To sum up: not a movie that I recommend. <br /> <br /> 3/10
