Here are some of the most glaring problems with this film: 1) Cliches abound. Seriously, horrible "corners" are everywhere. <br /> <br /> 2) The narrative jumps over time, which would be okay if it was okay, but it is not. <br /> <br /> 3) Lame characters that do not develop so much, either remain completely static or drastically change without a good reason. <br /> <br /> 4) Great: DANGEROUS ACTION. Over the top of almost every person. <br /> <br /> Here are some of the best points in the movie: 1) Lead is damn good looking. <br /> <br /> As you can see, there are only two kinds of people in this movie: a) People who can sit for 90 minutes of guts simply because the lead is attractive. <br /> <br /> b) People who often think to themselves "I like Hollywood thrill, full of clich√©s and abuse, but if only I could see it in Korean ..." There is a lot of good Korean cinema, so why waste time for rubbish?
