Like last year, WWE New Years Revolution 2006 was announced the Elimination Chamber match. However, the difference between last years and this year was an entertainment value. In fact, only three people had the chance to get out of the Pepsi Arena in Albany, New York with the WWE Championship. They were current masters John Cena, Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels. There was no way for Vinnie Mac to put on a belt for one of the debutants; Carlito or Chris Masters. And Kane? Kane recently held the WWE Championship in June 1998, and that's only for one night. It was obvious that he would not be this either. The last year's match was an exciting event with six of the best in WWE's offer. 2006 was a predictable and disappointing event, but it was definitely a match of the night. <br /> <br /> The only surprise of the evening was that there was a bell in the main event. Vince McMahon himself came out and demanded that they raise the chamber. Then it was announced that Edge earned money in a bank championship match just then. Having no time to prepare and just after winning the Elimination Chamber match, John Cena had no chance and dropped the spear title on one of the most entertaining heels in WWE. It was the only entertainment action that took place all night. <br /> <br /> This card, like last year, was really terrible. Triple H and The Big Show staged a snorkel fest that forced me to fight. HHH raised his winnings, but there was no doubt that it was like that? Any pay-per-view, in which both Jerry Lawler and Viscer wrestling on the same card will never have a chance of success, really does. The king pinned Helms (who reserves this material?), And Big Vis tried to lose with the wasted Shelton Benjamin with little help from his mother. <br /> <br /> Women from WWE also had a hard night. There was Diva's plain nonsense with the Bra and Panties Gauntlet match, which Ashley won, and the Women's Championships were also on the line. In the match, I thought I would stay in WrestleMania for a decent 22 Mickie James challenged Trish Stratus in a good match. Trish won the competition, but it was obvious that it would continue in the foreseeable future. <br /> <br /> The opening competition at night was soon to be WWE Champion Edge against the Intercontinental Champion, Ric Flair. It could have been better, but it was a battered and bloody Flair who survived the disqualification. Edge apparently had bigger fish to fry. <br /> <br /> So the New Year's Revolution started the 2006 pay-per-view calendar in a terrible way. The only good thing about this is that for WWE, the only way is. They do not get worse than this.
