The film is a bit boring. It is mostly silent film, and most of history is given by a series of lectors. Although creating such a silent movie is not such a bad idea, it is one of those films in which the lack of dialogue and repetitive early scenes makes it simply boring. You do not understand the reason for boredom until it is well and it is too late. The first 40 minutes of the movie are a kind of slow piece of Mexican soft porn and unimaginable soft porn. Later in the film, the style of the first 40 minutes begins to make sense, but it is too late, because then the audience dies. There are some nice pictures at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. I've often wondered why more movies are not filmed there. The campus is built on the edge of lava fields, which give the campus a completely different atmosphere. My biggest problem with the film is that the director / writer made the movie the way he wanted to see it, no matter how it is seen by a viewer who does not know the story. You can not ignore the audience when you tell a story.
