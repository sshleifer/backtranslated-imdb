What the hell was that about? I saw the Matrix and was amazed. It was the most spectacular movie ever made. What the Wachowski brothers ever had to do this film is beyond me. <br /> <br /> There is no story, you can not discuss it. Basically, the whole movie was a load of talking and do not get me wrong, I have no problem with chatty movies, but the whole conversation in the Matrix Reloaded was a pointless burden. Then there will be a fight sequence that will last too long WAY, then a more pointless drivvle, then another battle scene that lasts too long and everything is built to the greatest anti-climax ever. A little bearded guy telling a load of an incomprehensible bull for 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> Also Keanu Reeves gives his worst performance. I knew he was not a good actor, but it was a joke. If you watch his films in the order in which he was in them, it would seem that he gradually deteriorated. God knows what his performance is in "Something you have to give"! Keanu Reeves: The only wooden board ever to become an actor. <br /> <br /> After the splendor of the first movie, it became a huge disappointment. If you have not seen the first movie yet, I suggest you watch it, but do not waste time on this complete stack. <br /> <br />
