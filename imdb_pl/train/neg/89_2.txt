I've seen all four movies in this series. Everyone goes farther and farther from books. This is the worst. My problem is that it does not follow the book that is titled in any way! Directors and producers should call it something other than 'Love's Abiding Joy'. The only thing reminiscent of a book in this movie are the names of some characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names / age / sex of children are incorrect. The whole story does not take place in the book. <br /> <br /> I think that a great resentment for Janette Oke, her books and her fans is to make a movie under her title, which is in no way correct. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions. <br /> <br /> If you want a good family movie, you can do it. This is clean. Do not watch it, however, if you hope for a condensed version of the book. I hope it will be the last movie in this series, but I doubt it. If more movies are made, I would like Michael Landon, Jr. and others to be closer to the original storylines and fables. Books are excellent and, if they are strictly observed, they will make great videos!
