Strange, almost all reviewers are very positive about this film. Is it because it comes from 1975 and has Chamberlain and Curtis in it, and therefore they forgive very bad acting and childish ways of telling stories? <br /> <br /> Maybe because some people are very fond of this movie because they read the book? (I have not read the book, but I do not think it's a problem, filmmakers never assume that viewers have read the book.) <br /> <br /> Or maybe because I'm subconsciously irritated by the fact that English-speaking actors try to behave like their French counterparts?
