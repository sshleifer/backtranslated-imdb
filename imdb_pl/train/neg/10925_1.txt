At the moment I wonder if I should even finish watching this "poppycock" movie. They had a quite interesting idea with a buried film set and that was it. So far this unintelligible mess has no real history. There is a buried set, a monster in the lead with a wolf carrying an amok, an amulet, and a group of evil actors attacked by a wolf masked whatever it is. What would I miss if I had good sense to throw away this nonsense, then chase the dunes, some really bad C.G.I., some incredibly stupid dialogue, more evil C.G.I. and a hero struggling with paper cutouts. In addition to the original idea, this movie has absolutely zero advantages. My mistake that I am still watching. - MERK
