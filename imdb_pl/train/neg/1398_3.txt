I bought it (it was only $ 3, ok?) Under the title "Gray Matter". I was intrigued by the new vision of Sherriff Roscoe in a role other than DukesOfHazzard. As other reviewers have warned, this is a rather boring story about a secret government experiment that went bad. <br /> <br /> And yes, there are plenty of photos, especially at home with a pool in front of him. Some characters and interiors are so indefinite that filmmakers are afraid that we can forget who is who, so they keep pushing us away, showing the buildings outside. It's really fun. After a while the shot from the pool is like a television station identification logo, reminding us that we are watching "Gray Matter". <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed two attacks on names. At some point, an angry researcher mocks someone responsible, calling it "Scientific b * tch!". This is a very inadequate insult. A few scenes later a different topic releases a couple, purring about this "scientific bardon!". It just sounded awkward to me. <br /> <br /> Sometime this movie will disappear forever. In the next decade, you will not be able to find any copies of it. Almost never happened. <br /> <br />
