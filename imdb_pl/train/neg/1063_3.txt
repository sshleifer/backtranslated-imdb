The idea is nice. Bringing so many stars in one movie is great. But ... too many stories, too short and really meaningless. No connection between scenes. There were 3-4 wonderful stories ... but they were from 18. The frame reminded me of "All the invisible children" - a movie that I enjoyed a lot. In comparison, "Paris Je T'Aime" lacks an intriguing story that is developing - it starts and ends. It lacks a topic that connects everyone - children. I do not consider Paris to be a sufficient topic to combine 18 short sketches. Perhaps for people who know Paris, this is interesting. Otherwise, I would not recommend it ...
