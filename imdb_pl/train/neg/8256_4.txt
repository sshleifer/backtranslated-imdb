The only word that I can describe to describe this movie is: Ordinary. <br /> <br /> The storyline of the character Gary Sinise attempting to commit suicide is an absurd assumption and come ... living like some sort of Salingeristic hermit or a hermit in a booth leading golf balls to the ocean because he could not stand living in a lucrative golfing community pro / am? give me the river. I would like it to be my problems. I like Dylan Baker and Sinise, but this movie was clearly the wrong choice or check for Sinise. The scene where little Timmy Price is being mistreated by another club member in front of her father during the tournament is so exaggerated that I'm ashamed to watch him
