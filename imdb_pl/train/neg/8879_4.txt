I think Cliff Robertson was certainly one of our best actors. He has half a dozen classics. It feels good here as heavy, but the direction is so bad and the pace so tiring that it never disappears. The story starts well, but I wonder how he could count on his wife hanging out. She still mugs well and wears things. Death is double. First of all, if we had the time spent by the heroes moving from one room to another or one part of the house to another, it would consume about one-third of the movie. Let's add that Robertson's character sitting in bed in blue light, looking confused, can add another piece. I agree with those who claimed that half an hour would make it quite a decent, but insignificant film. The biggest weakness is only an intricate conspiracy, which, when everything is said and done, leaves amazing questions. I do not put spoilers in, but when it's over, do not think too much. I can come up with ten "what would have been if" without sweating. It would be better if it remained a ghost story.
