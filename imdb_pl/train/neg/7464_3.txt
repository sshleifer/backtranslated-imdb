I did not watch the whole movie. I could not watch the whole movie. I stopped the DVD after watching for half an hour and I suggest anyone who thinks about watching themselves, to stop before removing the CD from the box. <br /> <br /> I like mafia movies both tragic and comic, but Corky Romano can only be described as a tragic attempt of a mafia comedy. <br /> <br /> The problem is that Corky Romano just tries too hard to make the audience laugh, and the conspiracy seems to be an excuse to move Chris Kattan (Corky) from one scene to another. Corky himself is completely lost and he lacks subtlety or credulity - all his strange manners meet as invented - Chris Kattan clearly "works" and does not play a role - it immediately reflects you from history. Each scene is completely predictable, the "comedy event" that will take place on the set is obvious as soon as each scene is entered. In comedies like Mr. Bean disasters caused by the title character are fun, because you can empathize with the character's motivations and the initial event, and the situation in which the character ends, is not telegram. Corky, however, gives the impression that he deliberately screwed up in a desperate attempt to laughter among the audience. <br /> <br /> If Chris did not play such a foreign character (which never merges with other characters in the movie) and whose behavior is completely inexplicable (except for the attempt to draw laughter), and the comedy scenes were not so predictable and stereotypical - all the jokes seemed too familiar) this movie could be viewed. But it's not like that. Do not watch this.
