Okay, so I went to this movie, not expecting too much, I thought about an action similar to the Fast and the Furious. A few nice cars, nice girls, some decent plot. Unfortunately, I would have to say that it was probably the worst movie I saw this year. Do not get me wrong, the cars were nice, and the girls were fine, but the way they put the film together was just bad. History never made you care about the cast, and the movie just seemed to be complex. So, in general, this movie was not the worst thing, but if you're looking for a movie this weekend, I will pass it on for now.
