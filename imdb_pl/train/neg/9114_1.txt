Because "cruel" would be the only existing word describing the intentions of these creators. Where do you even start? In gushing charisma I will start from the horrible action of almost everyone in this film. Scratch it. It almost does not belong to this sentence. I can not imagine even one character who would be well represented. Although, honestly, it would be almost impossible to depict those zero-figure characters in a successful way. However, the girl who played Katherine (whose name I purposely do not turn on - I pretend she does not exist) remains one of the worst actors I've ever seen, only dimmed by the guy who played Sebastian. The story was terrible. He tried to reflect the glow that was first, but failed in many ways. Almost every part of it was useless - although I admit (reluctantly) that the return of the action was quite good, which was a surprise. And the ending was at least slightly funny. But this movie is there with the worst I've seen. Do not watch this. Just do not. Watching it has no value. No. He only takes the joy of the first.
