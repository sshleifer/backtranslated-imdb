Who? What? Where? If? Why? Acting was terrible. Very robotic, practiced. I've seen all the actors in this movie in better roles. The scenario was very elementary. At the end of this movie, the plot was connected. And Jeane Claude LaMarre should also be connected. That he would never try to write / direct another movie.
