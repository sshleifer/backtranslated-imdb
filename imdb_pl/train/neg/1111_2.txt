The last song of Johnny Rivers was the only great thing about this movie. Unfortunately, that's all I can say about this western film. I have to write 8 more lines to make my comments published, but there are more than 8 terrible lines in this west. I'm not sure if the film was a tribute to Hopa Along or just a parody. The hero and villain in this film were too plastic. It is not realistic at all. Many supporting actors in this film looked authentic, but the shooting scenes were a joke. The previous commentator thought that this movie was great, and in the comments he took President Bush a cheap shot. It was not a democratic or republican western. It was just a bad, western movie sold on the market. I wonder if he earned some money. Sometimes I thought I was watching a movie made by students of a student film. If it was, it was a great movie.
