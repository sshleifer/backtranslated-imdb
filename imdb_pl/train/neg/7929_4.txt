I think if you're interested in science fiction and horror, it might be interesting. Acting was fine, but not great. Two pregnant girls are supposed to be fifteen, but older actresses obviously play in them, which at the time turned out to be twenty-one and twenty-one. The story is fine, but the story jumps a bit, leaving one guess if you're in Boston or Pennsylvania. The priest seems to use the speed of the warp between them. The Catholic Church is presented as having a secret sect to study events that happen only to people of that faith. What if both girls were Protestants? Would Catholics be interested? That is why some have come up. Who knows, one day the Catholic church can even learn what the Bible teaches. If you miss this, you do not feel that you have lost something.
