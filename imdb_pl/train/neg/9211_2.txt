This movie reminds me of many anti-drug movies from the 1950s and 1960s because they were created by people who apparently never experienced the social evil that they warn us about. Tom Hanks and his buddies play a role, but there are no cubes, a lot of candles, and then you're just pushed back in a bad editing showing that Hanks falls on a woman in the group. quite funny, but misunderstood. I wonder how many poor children destroyed their D & D materials and were told that using their imagination was a path to destruction. In the film, it's just a special school program, bad acting (though Hanks shows some of his talent) and talk about relationships, and nobody seems to have a good time. It seems that these films focus psychologically on young people starting the path to adulthood, which, it seems, is more serious and requires you to zap and do things that everyone else does. Despite 2 votes, it's worth to watch because of its unique genre, scare movies that I personally find quite funny.
