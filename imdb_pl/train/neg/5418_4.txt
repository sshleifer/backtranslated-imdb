This movie is like S.E. Hinton wrote in the seventies, and Copola adapted to the screen in the early 80s, and if Trueblood was indeed a product, the results could have been much better (especially in the acting department). Instead, we get rather that poor and fun element of mediocrity. <br /> <br /> Jeff Fahey plays Ray Trueblood, a former street rover, I think, this is an accurate description. It was in the days of action movies that exploited boys aged 40 and 30 and dressed them in style threads or in a more effeminate selection of gang costumes, and they fought for bad music in the 80s. Nevertheless, Ray is the lonely guardian of his younger brother, Donny (Chad Lowe in the part where he screams a lot), which he is forced to leave inexplicably at the railway station, when he escapes from cops, gets caught and forced to serve in the Marines. Flash forward, and Ray returns to the city and searches for his brother, who also became part of the street gangs, although in the gang that was Ray's opponent, and now the old results must be resolved (and again, the clay must be avoided this time he defended the women's honor in the sense of an action movie before Ray could continue his normal life with his brother, Donny. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is funny, for me most of them have a lot to do with over-taking, although not by Fahey and Sherlyn Fenn, who plays a waitress with whom he befriends, Lowe guys and Lowe seem to be unnecessarily exaggerating, like tough New York, though the bigger disconnect is recycled feature lines and maybe the kind of film that was much better than the product from 1989.
