As a sensitive 10-year-old I liked the philosophy of "love conquers everything" from the 1970s "Bridget Loves Bernie". I understood the controversy regarding the romantic complications between the Jewish taxi driver (David Birney) and the Irish Catholic school teacher (Meredith Baxter) and both parents (Harold J. Stone and Bibi Osterwald as Bernie's parents; Audra Lindley and David Doyle as Bridget's parents) problems with the inter-faith marriage of a young couple. <br /> <br /> Looking at the show with years of personal life experiences, I'm amazed that the show was even successful for one, although the season was highly rated. Created by veteran TV screenwriter Bernard Slade, who a few years after canceling the series wrote the successful play "Same Time, Next Year", "Bridget Loves Bernie" was a very light, superficial comedy that collapsed under the weight of its own weight. br /> <br /> You could not deny the real chemistry between Birney and Baxter. But in later years, both actors showed that they are better actors in other projects (Birney in his short role in "St. Elsewhere" and Baxter in "Family" and "Family Ties"). Here, they tried to breathe life into the show, which required a much more comic advantage, which could add more depth to the very controversial subject. <br /> <br /> The show was broadcast on Saturday nights between two CBS gyms: "All in the Family" and "Mary Tyler Moore". Both of these shows were intelligent, fun and had quite an advantage (more on the first one, the latter), which kept my interest in the situation and heroes. Bridget Loves Bernie was not very smart and only had occasional giggles. <br /> <br /> This was another example of a show that really was not as good as I remembered.
