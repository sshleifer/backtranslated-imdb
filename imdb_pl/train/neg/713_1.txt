Can I say, first of all, that I felt so strongly in this film that I signed up to IMDb to review it. And my review? This is the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The summary of the film sounded interesting - Nazis, occultism, travel in time, etc., but the plot of the film could not properly combine all these elements. Do you remember the episode of South Park, in which manatees writing Family Guy appeared using "balls of ideas"? Do these manatas also write Unholy? It's as if the writer wanted to include all these different ideas, but he had no idea how to connect them all, and then make matters even less sensible, including the subject of the journey during Donna Darko to the end, disrupting the chronology. <br /> <br /> At the beginning I could say that it was a bad movie. The special effects were too low on the budget for something better than on DVD. Acting was not great, but in fairness I saw worse. I will praise Nazi images, they were terrifying, but the bad Nazi butcher was just comical. <br /> <br /> I do not have a vendetta against this movie or anything, but to be honest, I'm even in the genre of horror movies. But this movie can not be described as a thriller or drama. If this story were well told, it would be a good movie. But it was exaggerated. Waaaaay over hyped.
