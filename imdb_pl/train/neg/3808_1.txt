WARNING! This review will reveal the ending of the movie "Scoop". If you do not want to know how the movie ends, do not read this review! <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is so bad that you think "Annie Hall" is a fluke. <br /> <br /> He gets one star because you see Hugh Jackman's bare chest. This is the only thing that "Scoop" wants. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen's misogynist and his fixation on young enough women, at this moment to be his granddaughter, paralyzed every possibility of making films that the <br /> <br /> plot seems promising : a ghost, Ian McShane, runs a fluffy student, Scarlett Johansson, to investigate whether the English Lord, Hugh Jackman, is a notorious Tarot. A prostitute card killer. The magician, Woody Allen, helps the girl. Despite the promising story, the film lacks charm, humor and atmosphere. It is an incredibly leaden, amateurish effort for someone who made at least one previous movie, no matter how many tens. Perhaps Allen suffered a stroke that was not reported in the press. <br /> <br /> Much consists of the fact that, unlike his previous films, Woody Allen, now a septuagenarian, He finally let the younger male lead to get the girl. <br /> <br /> No. In fact, the plot is constructed in such a way that the girl has no one. <br /> <br /> There is an early scene in which Johansson, without any central reason for the film, lets himself be drunk and seduced by a powerful, older director. "Seduced" is the euphemism of what is happening. This is the moment "slam, bam, and go go him". It has no relation to the story, and Johansson is cheaper in the eye of the viewer. Why did Allen add this unnecessary scene to the movie? Because it shows a powerful director - like Allen - having sex with a female advantage. Allen also gets a cake and eats it. <br /> <br /> Johansson is not an actress yet. He does not know how to control the screen, unless he is wearing a tight, low cut. He's imitating Allen in a few scenes, and it looks weird and sad. <br /> <br /> It does not help that her character is written as a doll that can not function without a ghost or an elderly person and less than an inspiring magician telling her what to do at every step. <br /> <br /> It's roughly the age of Jackman, and she appears as a very low screen presence in her scenes. <br /> <br /> Audience who is not obsessed with breasts, deserves better in their heroines, and Jackman deserves something better - a script that gives the heroine some intelligence and agency and an actress who can communicate these features . <br /> br /> Hugh Jackman is similarly deceived by the script. Allen apparently can not stand that Jackman is so handsome and young, so he does not give Jackman anything to say or do. Like Johansson, it is used only for its good appearance. It's a shame because, as Jackman has shown in many productions, from "Oklahoma" to "X Men", it CAN work. <br /> <br /> Here is a great turnaround - Jackman, kind, charming English Lord, really is a killer. So although the movie says it's about letting someone else than Allen, get a girlfriend, she does not get anyone. Jackman, the man he loves is the man who murdered the prostitute. Nice, Woody. A good way to punish your heroine for being out of reach. <br /> <br /> In passive aggressive touch, Allen deprives her heroine of her own presence, killing her character, the mage, leaving Scarlett Johansson alone at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> The final remark: during my show no member of the audience laughed at any point in the movie. Always a bad sign when a movie is advertised as a comedy.
