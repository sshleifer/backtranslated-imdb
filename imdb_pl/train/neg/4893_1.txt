The film is actually too slow. There are some nice pictures, but it can not outweigh the fact that the movie is actually boring. You see the sexual intercourse of many watermelons and sexual intercourse while eating melons and maybe a little more. For someone it may sound interesting, but believe me that I watch it for 2 hours, it is not fun at all. Although you laugh a few times, but it really is not enough and can be more out of despair and disbelief than with fun. To disturb the director of boredom, he tries to put some videos in the film. These are really colorful clips of absurd songs from the 50s, but it's hard to say exactly and try to be so funny that it's really sad. Several times you have the impression that the plot can evolve into something that creates a powerful scene, but eventually it just evaporates in some way and that's all. In addition to clips, there are almost no dialogues, let alone music. The director tries to be original and artistic at all costs. Personally, I can not recommend a movie. I believe art is something that should not be boring. During the projection yawed throughout the cinema, which only confirms my short review.
