The worst DCOM I've ever seen. Always. Well, maybe not as bad as Smart House. It was just bad. Acting and history were fine, but the SUCKED effects! <br /> <br /> They were so false! The only good fight scene was brother and Shen. It was probably the only scene where I was excited. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think that this movie is very boring, and the movie seems to be over. <br /> <br /> I'll give her four for Brenda Song, who is a very funny actress and this one fight scene. <br /> <br /> 4/10
