This film should never have been made. <br /> <br /> What a budget shame. <br /> <br /> Please, hire convincing actors and make the right movie. Very thin plot and unconvincing lines. Almost hilarious, and it's a shame for the action movie .... <br /> <br /> Definitely not worth watching. <br /> <br /> They are constantly playing the same "shots" of a flying Stealth airplane away. You've seen it, and it was not worth re-launching 3 or 4 times. <br /> <br /> It's time for Steven Seagal to stop shooting movies. <br /> <br /> His films are getting worse every time. <br /> <br /> Black Dawn and Submerged were bad, but this movie is even worse.
