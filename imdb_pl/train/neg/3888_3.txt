I started to melt, so I will make this review as short and sweet as possible. <br /> <br /> There's this astronaut, and he goes into a spaceship with two other guys, you know? Except that something happens that exposes him to radiation, and then when they come back ... well, no matter what happened to other guys, but our astronaut began to drown! No, do not just burn out, but MELT! Like a lime cone for ice cream! Okay, maybe not so fast, but you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> Anyway, he's getting red and sticky, and the fact that he's drowning makes him really crazy. I suppose that he also checked the manual of a "melting man" because he suddenly knows that he must eat the human body to completely dissolve, so he starts to tear people apart. <br /> <br /> There are other characters, but in a movie where a man melts and melts (melts), do you really need others? What is important, WHO will munch on and WHAT will stay with them? HOW long it will take him to dissolve into nothingness? Why was this film made in the first place? WHERE did they get the money? WHEN do you fall asleep while watching? <br /> <br /> I almost disbanded, but I still have enough time to tell you that this movie is terribly boring, even though the idea is really nice and nice gross. The makeup is clean, but everything else is ... SPLAT
