In the seventeenth century Japan lived a samurai that set the standards for ever. His name was Mayeda. He is sent on an epic journey around the world to get 5,000 Muscat from the King of Spain. While on the sea a violent storm absorbs their precious gold for the purchase of weapons and almost deprives them of their lives. Mayeda must fight all the opportunities to survive and secure the fate of his beloved Japan. Shogun Mayeda is a multi-million-dollar epic adventure taking place on three continents. <br /> <br /> Older Sho Kosugi cinema legends (Tenchu: Stealth Assassins), Christopher Lee (Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy), John Rhys Davies (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Indiana Jones Trilogy) and Toshiro Milfune (Seven Samurai, Blood Throne), Shogun Mayeda (Kabuto) is a film masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Osaki's winning stunt team bought Bob Ivy's screen for exciting battle / action sequences, such as the opening battle against the eastern army, attack on the Mayeda ship with invaluable jewels and the final confrontation of Sho Kosugi and David Essex. There is also excellent music by the famous composer John Scott. Director Sho Kusugi was not even nominated for an Oscar for this film that deals with emotional conflicts, such as the death of the Mayedas family, the search for love and acceptance of mourning, all of which are treated very well. Highly recommended film masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Note: all of the above situations are opposite for a given movie.
