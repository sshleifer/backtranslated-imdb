I'm not sure if it's a spoiler; it may be a public service. If you are one of those people who focus on immediate satisfaction, skipping the final credits, you will miss the last line of the lector who announced that the US had just given in to Nazi Germany on May 7, 1945, to end World War II. Here are just some of the problems associated with this closure: <br /> <br /> 1) The older viewer must conjure the equivalent of two or three UNHOLY films in the mind's eye to fill the gaping gap between movie events and a startling ending. <br /> <br /> 2) The average person will really kick off that he did not "watch" one of these SURVIVAL films filling empty spaces created in their own head for free time and money to see this DANGEROUS from the video store (or on the cable). <br /> <br /> 3) This final sequence of imaginary information bulletins may be the first information younger viewers of World War II are exposed to, leading them to the conclusion that George W. Bush is the latest heir to the Nazi throne.
