I do not know why this behavior was ever tolerated in the film industry! This movie (short) is disgusting (to put it mildly)! It is a group of 5-7 year-old children in diapers with large hair clips that behave like adults (and too much!). However, this is interesting because it is a good example of how "good old days" may not have been so good! (Thank God we now have laws against this kind of stuff!) <br /> <br /> {This is one shortcut from "Shirley Temple Festival"}
