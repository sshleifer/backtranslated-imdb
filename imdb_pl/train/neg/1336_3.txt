This film definitely did not belong to the best films of Mary-Kate and Ashley. I really did not like it and I was disappointed with this movie. For some reason it seemed like it was a movie that they gathered very quickly. In some parts it was so boring that I had to rewind it quickly. There are no g√≥wnarek or any exciting parts, such as their other films.
