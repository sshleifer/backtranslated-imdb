Director Fred Schepisi (Roxanne) directs this intentional but worse comedy about Albert Einstein (Matthau), trying to connect his scientific niece (Ryan) with an ordinary guy Tim Robbins to get her to relax and enjoy life in the 1950s. For Ryan to like Robbins, Einstein tries to make Robbins look like a genius scientist. The idea is sweet, but the film is plunged into obscure situations and stupid dialogue. Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan and a wonderful supporting cast do everything to keep this stupid comedy on the surface, but they can not save the movie. It is unfortunate that so many talents went to produce such a bland film. I do not recommend it to anyone unless they are big fans of Meg Ryan.
