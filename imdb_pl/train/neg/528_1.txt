I never expect the adaptation of the film to follow the novel too closely (especially the beloved one, like the Evening), but when I saw that the author of the book, Susan Minot, was a screenwriter and executive producer of the film, I thought that evening would be a good adaptation. <br /> <br /> If you liked this book, do not worry about this movie. It's so far from the book that the two are hardly similar. <br /> <br /> Here, our characters are completely different: the bride is in love with Harris. Harris is the son of a housekeeper. Buddy is drunk, in love with Ann and / or Harris. I do not think one character has changed from book to screen; oh, it just gets the worst with every passing moment. <br /> <br /> And, really, we have not learned from Bridges of Madison County, that we are not fascinated by the story we are fascinated with, to the scenes of our heroes "adult children have unbearable and underage fights, they just do not work on film ? This movie is a disaster. Skip it.
