"Mistress of the Craft" Celeste works as an agent of the London branch of the Interpol 17, which specializes in (I believe) occult criminals. He has the Eye of Destiny, good in his hands, dangerous if anyone else gets it. <br /> <br /> Office 17 caught a Satanist from California, Hyde (no relationship with Dr. Jekyll). Detective Lucy Lutz from LAPD flies to England to take him back to the USA. Lutz is a combination of earlier witch movies that Stephanie Beaton previously played in Witchcraft 9. In Part 7 Lutz another woman played; in 6 Lutz was a man! <br /> <br /> Lutz's participation in 9 was not terribly big, but she is one of the main stars of this. Although she left her high heels and short skirts, she still has peaks in it. And this time she has nude erotic scenes. Beaton is very attractive in this role. <br /> <br /> As usual, there are many sex scenes. An anonymous clubman has a fatal threesome with two vampires, a satanist and a vampire from the head, with a certain break, Lutz finds an English friend, and Celeste and her boyfriend love each other. <br /> <br /> The main returning character of the Witchcraft series, Will Spanner, does not appear in this series, although Lutz mentions him about Agent Bureau 17 Dixon in an interview about vampires. He also calls his partner Detective Garner (parts 6, 7 and 9), although we can not hear his end of the conversation. <br /> <br /> Hyde jumped out of jail by a group of vampires led by Raven, for a Walpurgis ritual that had something to do with a god named Morsheb (I think). Hyde delivers all his lines in a very flat manner, while Raven jumps to the camp level. The battle scenes are terribly choreographed. <br /> <br /> The sound in the film was poorly recorded and poorly edited. In addition, some dialogues are lost under glaring music or sirens. Cinematography is not great either. Making a movie and filming it in the UK was a bit new, at least for this series. <br /> <br /> Wendy Cooper is very good as Celeste; certainly attractive, but more importantly, it is easily the best actor in the movie (despite the bad fighting scenes). I'm surprised that her filmography is so small. If Witchcraft XIV ever appears, and I bet it will happen, they should bring her back, even if it means flying to California! <br /> <br /> Witchcraft X is available alone or on a DVD collection Hotter Than Hell with Witchcraft XI and two unrelated movies.
