loss of my life ... the director should be embarrassed. why people feel they have to make worthless movies, they will never make any sense to me. when she died at the end, it made me laugh. I had to change the channel many times throughout the movie because I was embarrassed watching such bad acting. Let's hope the guy who played Heath will never get a job. Besides, I hope that the director will never make another film, and his salary will be taken for this nonsense. {.02 out of 10}
