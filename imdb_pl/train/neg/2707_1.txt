This is one of the most rotten films of the 90s. I do not recommend this if you have something better to do. <br /> <br /> This picture shows African Americans as savage, uncultivated, brutal, inarticulated sociopaths smoking coolers. Fudge (Ice Cube) and his group of countrymen constantly neglect others in the dorm, not only whites, but also Asians and are never punished for their actions. Despite all this tolerance, they are still groaning and crying over the evil white oppressors who direct their lives and stand in their way. In fact, Knot's influence causes Remmy to connect with the heads of the skin, give up college and ultimately kill Malik's girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Skinheads are portrayed as a secret group of inexperienced who share the descent from campus and generally stay away from everyone else. They never throw out their music to get people angry or scoff at the police. They commit serious crimes such as battery and rape, but they are not as disgusting or as dangerous as Fudge and Dreads (Busta Rhymes). <br /> <br /> There's a lot of material in this movie that almost offended me or giggled. Some of them are as follows: <br /> <br /> Fudge and Dreads are referred to as Columbus University students, but we never see them in class and it is completely unclear how they pay tuition fees. It only remains to speculate that the weeds that burn have something to do with their finances. Although they are university students, they can not say a single line of proper English. Their characters develop only thanks to compulsive moaning and xenophobia. <br /> <br /> It looks like drunk Kristen (Kristy Swanson) knew exactly why drunk Billy takes her to her home. She even asked him for a gum so that they could start. The fact that he penetrated her without a condom became a rape, while it would be a great sex only if he had one useful. Later, Kristen was assured by Taryn (Jennifer Connely) that she was not responsible for this matter, and despite the intentional jumping into the bed of a man, she was not ready for sexual intercourse and was brutally exploited by a sexual predator. Then, about a week later, she met and slept with a very sensitive benefactor who knew how to avoid rape and brought a condom. The director stressed precisely contraception. <br /> <br /> This movie is complete and complete trash, which makes Black people look like cocks, and women look stupid and weak. Cole Hauser's act and Laurence Fishburne's accent are the only reasons why I can see it. The writer / director is obviously a man of limited intelligence. Go ahead and limit your own, watching this nonsense, if you like, but remember that neurons do not grow back. Just follow the advice at the end and UNLEARN.
