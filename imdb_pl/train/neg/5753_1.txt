... although the movie, which is trying to sell as a horror, clearly lacked blood. <br /> <br /> There was also a clear lack of a qualified director, actor, editor and scriptwriter. <br /> <br /> Jeremy London played in one of the most terrifying performances I have ever seen - his "descent into maelström" of madness is painfully self-conscious and clumsy. Oh look at him, twitch! Oh, look at him, drink strong spirits! Oh, look at him, raise your eyebrows, and guide your head with an embarrassing angle! Oh, look at his unwashed, greasy dark hair! Oh, listen to his hoarse voice! He must be a tortured artist / writer / genius! Oh, yes, the poet goes out - this is another boy who thinks he is Byron. (Or Poe.) Oh, for love ... did anybody give this guy instructions how to act well, or they just pulled him out of a cardboard box, a non-existent small plastic toy in an abandoned brand of barley cereal. Okay, that was a stupid line - but that's only because London's performance melted my brain with its horror. <br /> <br /> Katherine Heigl is a charming and very wild rose, but she did not grow into her shoes in this movie - she directed her lines as if she was holding, in fact her entire performance was very wooden, her poses were stiff like her lines - who knows, maybe just reacted and tried to neutralize Jeremy London waving excesses, but if he does, he takes it too far. <br /> <br /> Notable is Arie Verveen as Poe - while the role of his character is confused, he ensures the best performance of the song. It just looks good, but it's something more - it has some depth, I believed that it has a life beyond the gloomy two-dimensional quality of the other characters. Huh, maybe it's just because I like Poe, so I could just let my mind wander and think when it was on screen - whatever it was, it had a missing factor of interest. <br /> <br /> The rest of the character is blurred blur - there are all the usual caricatures: a perky blond best friend who is a little pissed; beaten local policeman who has some dorków; a protective older man who may have too much paternal interest in our heroine; plotting an old witch, etc., yawns, yawns. <br /> <br /> As with the "clear lack of blood for a horror movie," none of the themes they mention (and that the London character mentions - so terribly - in his attack on writing Poe) is followed by. As another reviewer said - there was potential here: murder, incest, - really shocking things, but instead they move away from the problems and cut themselves off from violence (raised candlestick swinging in the air - approaching the victim - then --- cropped in black This is good in traditional Noirish horror, it is really expected and is welcome when it happens - it's expensive convention, especially when they are accompanied by fake lightnings and eye makeup Siouxie - but in 'Descendant' it just looks awkward or as if the editor felt nauseous at the last moment and cut it out. "It can be a very tense psychological thriller - horror palingenesis / delusion / madness - or simple (and fun) slasher movie: trying to be both and not (something new and Exciting!), but it fails in any case.The only element of the horror of this whole movie is epic otępienie. <br /> <br /> I think the editor ( if he was at all) he had to be drunk when he was chopping something - there are awkwardly shortened scenes; scenes that seemed inactive (but that could only be a weak script). Like the director and cinematographer - there were some very strange shots and framing that I thought were supposed to be tributes to Hitchcock or Browning, but it ended up looking stupid (again okay in noir, but it tried to be something else) . ) <br /> <br /> The whole thing can be fun (in this way, which was mentioned by previous reviewers - "OMG, how did it happen?!"), if I was in the mood for trash - bagging, unfortunately for me I settled on the couch, with lights at the bottom, with a clear intention of scaring myself stupid - this is a very weak movie and I'm afraid I can not recommend it to people, even for laughter. <br /> <br /> Please, do not waste your time or money - or borrow a real horror / thriller, or find a copy of the fantastic stories of Poe, anyway, We'll have a much more enjoyable and frightening night than you would I expect this rubbish.
