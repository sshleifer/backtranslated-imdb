For the first time, I learned about Wendigo many years ago in one of Alvin Schwartz's "Horrible stories": according to this story, Wendigo - after calling your name in the wind - pulls you and then pulls you into the sky and crushes you. Although it sounds quite bizarre, Schwartz's story has turned it into a fairly coherent idea. <br /> <br /> The "Wendigo" movie is not. Basically it's made up of every stereotypical horror: the family moves into a new home and strange things happen, everyone who hurts them asks everyone and they listen to the old Indian better. I have seen these things so many times that I no longer bother counting. <br /> <br /> In any case, avoid this. Patricia Clarkson and Erik Per Sullivan (Dewey in "Malcolm in the Middle") did a lot better.
