I sat in this turkey, because I had not seen it before, and because the premise sounded as if it had potential. It was mildly fun up to the sequence of hurricanes. At the top of a storm, the wind is strong enough to blow windows out of the house, but the trees in the background are perfectly straight and the leaf is not moving! In fact, when characters move out of the house, bright sunlight is visible, illuminating the tops of the trees. At this point, regardless of the reliability of the filmmakers, they evaporated faster than the very local rain in their film. It is a pity that all hurricanes are not like these, it would certainly help our insurance insurers here at Sunshine State.
