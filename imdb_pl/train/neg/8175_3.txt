The mood of this film is quite good and reflects the atmosphere of the 80s thanks to good performances. <br /> <br /> However, ..... <br /> <br /> The script runs a mill with the exception of a few comedic moments and it seems strange when I expect it to be annoyed. The characters are completely terrified and unbelievable and full-right stereotypes, which the screenwriter probably saw while watching a panoramic document on the national front. The biggest problem is that this movie does not have a real story. Marks all the appropriate "artistic" boxes, but nothing really happens, and at the end you wonder what it was about. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing
