I really wanted to love this program. I honestly did it. <br /> <br /> For the first time homosexual viewers got their own version of "The Bachelor". With the help of his obligate "haga" Andra, James, a handsome, well-to-do thirty-year-old has a chance to love with 15 suitors (or "friends" referred to in the program). The only problem is that half of them are simple and James does not know it. If James chooses a homosexual, he will travel to New Zealand, and if he chooses a simple, simple guy gets $ 25,000. How can it not be fun ?! Take my hand, go: <br /> <br /> The bachelor is the most glaring problem in this program. James is your typical young and successful gay with a nice smile and body, one you'll probably look at in your local bar before grazing on greener pastures. Why they decided to cast James as a leading man, they are beyond me. God knows that so many other hotter and happier homosexual men die to be on television. <br /> <br /> In addition to its rather average appearance, James is as interesting and exciting as a piece of chalk. Even as such, it has this arrogant, self-satisfied protection. If, however, James stood in front of the empty white wall, he would join her. Honestly, I can not remember any interesting or remarkable thing that James said during the show. He is so boring and forgotten. In fact, one of his colleagues advised him that he did not feel a relationship. I thought it was the best part of the show. Besides, James says a horribly annoying smile. It sounds feminine or sounds masculine, but it does not pass tones in the middle of sentences ... so painful to sit down. Throughout the performance I hated him so much that I kept thinking: "Please, choose a simple guy and humiliate yourself and your unhappy haga" <br /> <br /> Then we have suitors. Extremely insipid group of men who do not care about what is happening. Equally boring, they seem to be indistinguishable from one guy to another, except: "Hey, this guy has light brown highlights or that he has curly hair." Again astonishingly inconsiderable casting decisions seem to be the goal of this program. Although it may be a hackney for entering roles projected, watching them would be much more fun than amorphous drones. However, in all their banality, they still manage to make James (which is not so difficult anyway), but it is. You know that you have a problem when some suitors are actually warmer and more interesting than the main character. And the fact that the suitors seem to have more fun around EVERYONE than with the main man? Very sad. <br /> <br /> I also thought that I would like to point out something that I mentioned on the bulletin boards, which in my opinion was true: straightforward men are hot from gays. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I'm not saying that all gays were ugly and boring, and some of them were very sweet. It's just that they were generally just BLAH compared to the men you would see at concerts such as A Shot At Love with Tila Tequila or The Bachelorette. <br /> <br /> I do not know how many times I came fast during this show. I can accept the main character as interesting as a cardboard box, I can accept mundane, apathetic suitors, but I PLEASE to love God only for a bit. Without such happiness. <br /> <br /> If you're expecting drama, intrigue, sex appeal or excitement, you will be disappointed. The biggest "drama" comes from the fact that one of the suitors may have a boyfriend in New York (scandalous!). However exciting it may be, I guarantee you, it's the ONLY thing that remotely resembles any conflict at this show. <br /> <br /> Sure, there is a phrase, but if you have any appearance of Gaydar, you can easily recognize who is who (it was not difficult at all, I was wrong only once). This program puts so many chips that he fails to deliver anywhere else. <br /> <br /> As James & Co we observe such exciting activities as dancing at a Western step, shopping for gifts, visiting a small zoo and karaoke. YAWN. You probably have occasional topless dances, but who cares if everyone is boring anyway. This is one of the main problems associated with the series: NOBODY seems to have fun - they just go through the movement, trying hard to have fun. And you can not really blame them because the events are extremely unimaginable and bad. <br /> <br /> Finally, the physical aspect does not exist. There are no caresses, caresses, kissing (!), No caresses. It's just "Ok, it was a boring date, I'll come back to my ugly, cheesy butler Sydney Operahouse." This show is so prudish that it's funny. I can understand that they do not want to play the perceived indiscriminate nature of homosexual men, but come, ****. People who watch reality TV programs will want something more than brave hugs and short kisses. This show does not want to compromise. <br /> <br /> I apologize if it was long, but I felt it was a problem to be solved. I recommend Bravo for the first exposure of this kind of show, but the stunningly incompetent manner in which this performance was supported is amazing. To sum up my three points: Boring + Boring + Boring = go to something else. You will have more fun waiting in the doctor's office for a meeting, at least there are interesting magazines.
