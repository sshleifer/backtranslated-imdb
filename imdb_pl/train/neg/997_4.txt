Recently for the first time in several decades I watched "Lipstick" and I supported him "Descent", although I heard more negative comments than good from other film friends whose tastes are as different as mine. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to compare how the unique niche of the Rape Revenge has evolved over the last 32 years, from the full-length movie "I Spit On Your Grave" to the cheesy "Lipstick" sensation, to a tasteful approach to the problem in "The Accused". But "Descent", although it contains some important points, never offers us anything really new in the sense of revelation. No, "Descent" is so poorly made in terms of picture and sound quality that it detracts from any important message that he could hope - a message that, after careful examination, is not a breakthrough. <br /> <br /> Actually, I knew what was going on. What I wanted to see * is * "descent" or degeneration of Dawson's character. Being a big Rosario fan, I wanted to strip the layers, and her mind slowly turned around ... you know, the kind of performance that DeNiro brings to the Taxi Driver. Unfortunately, the scenario and the director / writer's choices do not provide any credible transition. <br /> <br /> The biggest point of failure is the second act. It became obvious what the intentions of the director were in this segment of club hopping, drug use and obsession with the big black stallion Adrian (nightmare of every white boy, natch) from Q & A to DVD, but this trip to Dawson is never credible rendered. We do not know exactly what the hell is doing half the time, what he's doing, and why he's doing it. Poor audio / video quality does not help again, but the sequence is too damn long and pointless. It destroys all impulses and investments in the main set of characters during an exceptionally well-prepared first act. Before we reach the final, our interest has already decreased. <br /> <br /> One of the successes that Dawson points out in questions and answers is that at the end of the scene of "revenge" we are pumped into revenge, then realize how real the reality is relaxed and ugly . While this is certainly important, it does not make the scene more intriguing. <br /> <br /> If you have a DVD, check the removed "classroom" scene. This is an excellent 8-minute plus that crackles with energy and provocation (although all verbal) and really shows Dawson's slow materialization when he is amazed by the spontaneous poor advisors Francie Swift. If more display scenes like this were added, and the middle third was cut out, we could have an interesting psychological study of the impact of nonsense acts of violence. <br /> <br /> As the film ultimately turns out, however, everything we receive is what we've seen before, only in more graphical rendering. So what?
