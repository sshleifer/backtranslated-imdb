Actress Patty Duke wrote a penetrating, funny, hewn book about her acting career, crazy life with love and manic episodes of depression and suicide attempts that almost pulled her off for good. With this rich material you can draw from (and Patty playing in the final act), you would think that a crack television director such as Gilbert Cates could collect all of this in the movie, but "Call Me Anna" is a pale shadow of Duke's autobiography 'a. For those who have not read the book, a sketchy narrative (skipping over time) is not absorbing, we must never be aware of what is happening, and production seems to be stunted by the low budget. The actors are poorly manned, and the value of owning Duke himself does not pay off - the false reality of the movie is so thick at the moment that Patty can not provide stability to the script. It seems that the producers were honest enough (and aware) to anxiously steer the film towards Duke's final diagnosis and mental freedom, but they omitted many dramatic possibilities in this process.
