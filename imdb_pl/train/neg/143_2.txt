Trying to bring back the teen genre who was picked up by forgery, such as Scary Movie and Shriek, if you know what I did last Friday, Valentine fails. Why did people like Halloween? Because it was original, new and went beyond anything that was ever done. Why did they like Scream? Because it made sense at least. Valentine is just a stupid slasher-flick who has almost no blood. The plot is similar to Halloween and Urban Legend, it is not fun. And when the killer appears on the screen, you know who it is, just ssssssssssssoooooooooooooo predictable. Teenage genre is DEAD Get over it! <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10
