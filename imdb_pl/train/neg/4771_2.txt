Do not waste time on this movie. It could have been good, but the ending was one of the worst I've ever seen. I really have to wonder how the people involved in making this movie could have looked at this last scene and thought: "Yes! Now is the end! "And we patted our backs. For me it seemed that they lacked ideas! They built the last scenes to have a nice accent, but instead let the whole accumulation fall flat on his face. When the last shot went black and I heard the credit music beginning, I was shocked - I could not believe what I saw and that someone could even call it the ending. The best thing anyone can do with this movie is rewriting the end and giving it content. Seriously, I'd really like someone to come into this room in the room, look in their face and say: WTF ?? !!!!
