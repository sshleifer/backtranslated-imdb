I do not think any player in Hollywood's history will survive as long as David Niven gave most of the weak films he had to carry because of his incredible charm. He could work, he got an Oscar for it, but most of the material he did was as light as one layer of double-layered tissue paper. <br /> <br /> An example is Happy Go Lovely. It's a musical and you remember most of the Vera-Ellen dance. You remember that they are in Scott's costume, because the movie takes place in Edinburgh during their festival. But if you can call one song from it, you must have a photographic memory. <br /> <br /> The plot is light. Vera-Ellen is an American singer in a musical that apparently has its own city in Edinburgh. He starts in the choir and one day he runs late. He rises from the chauffeur of the king-millionaire with wishes. Everyone now assumes that this is the millionaire's main blow. The door opens like never before. <br /> <br /> Millionaire is David Niven who agrees with this and the various situations that result from the error. Cesar Romero has some good moments as a crazy producer of this musical. <br /> <br /> In the end, however, Happy Go Lovely is a light and harmless down, which David Niven did so much and was so tired.
