This movie is so bad that I wanted to vomit. A badly made, complete zone of free laughter. Why, in the name of God, would you oppose a film that to some extent is false (and damn funny) in its present form? The sets are funny, the effects are so bad that they are not even funny, and the acting farce. It's a complete mystery why you even consider viewing this piece of rubbish. National Lampoon once made Animal House, which people still consider to be completely and completely fun. Now they have been demoted to making TV movies, such as this solid ****. Name your explanation, and this can be accurately used to describe this video.
