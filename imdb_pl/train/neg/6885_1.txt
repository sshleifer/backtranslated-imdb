... in a horrible, incomprehensible, would-be edgy comedy. <br /> <br /> I was a lonely victim during the show 7:20 tonight (3 days after the film was opened), so there is some satisfaction knowing that film-makers follow warnings. <br /> <br /> Rose flower of Jon Heder blossomed. The emerging double chin is not his fault; but re-inventing his cool kid in another bad wig simply does not work. It would be another crime if it was to be Eli Wallach's last screen. Diane Keaton will probably survive this payment - mainly because so few will see her in the worst vehicle she has chosen in the last few weeks. <br /> <br /> Sitting alone in the theater today, I livened up (he even laughed) when Daniels was free to deliver the only three-dimensional form of the film. He is really one of our best actors. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, even the work of Jeff Daniels can not realize this image.
