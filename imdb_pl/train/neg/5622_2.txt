OK, in addition to psychedelic background images, the information presented here was good. Music that I could do without (not that it was bad music, it just did not fit the movie at all). <br /> <br /> Regarding the content of the film, the director often repeats - the lack of a pagan perspective on the existence of Christ and a surprising comparison of the deeds and events of Christ's life with the life of mythological figures / gods such as Mitra and Dionyses. Then he recalls the chronology of the origin of Christianity and presents the case of "ok", but not the one that upset me. <br /> <br /> If the director stuck in the facts and continued with them, the movie was good. However, at this point the film breaks down into a group of personally satisfying attacks on Mel Gibson's "Passion of Christ" and a Christian private school in which the director participated in his youth. During an interview with my old director (who in the process reveals that the director was under a false pretext), I felt that the director is behaving a bit childishly. He asked good questions, but the interview, like the movie itself, broke up into an attack on the principles of this particular private school, not Christianity. <br /> <br /> In total, if you're only interested in information, watch the first 30 minutes and then turn it off.
