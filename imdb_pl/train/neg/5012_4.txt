I watched this movie based on the fact that the rocks Amber Benson and Nick Stahl are generally pretty cool - I thought that every movie with two actors, which I like and respect, can not be all bad. And in that sense, I was right - considering the voracious dialogue they were given, both of them behave quite well. You understand, not good enough to stop the sucking of the movie, but good enough that I managed to go through the 75-minute movie minutes (and this is the main sign of the horrible movie: when, after 40 minutes, you're already praying for it is over. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to know where to start problems in the "Taboo" Dialog, as mentioned, is terrifying, wooden and completely unnatural. most of the time around the house, it is an unforgivable fault, the plot is so intricate that it makes no sense to be so banal at the same time to be completely predictable (literally, none of the main "twists" in this film will surprise anyone except the toddler). Apart from a few interesting shots, the director tries too hard with too little success, awkward shots and a shaky shot from the camera that distracts the small element historia jest. <br /> <br /> The three stars of this film are awarded for including Amber Benson, and the last one is cast on the grounds that one of the jokes made me giggle. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, never and under any circumstances. Avoid at all costs.
