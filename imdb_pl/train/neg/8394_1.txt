Apparently this is a horror of DTV class Z. <br /> <br /> But with lines like: <br /> <br /> "It's easy to die, I have, many times" <br /> <br /> and <br /> <br /> "Why do you read this book?" "Because it makes the story more interesting" <br /> <br /> and <br /> <br /> "You've come here, now you can go outside! "(after he leads a man to the basement) <br /> <br /> (and listen to what they intone) <br /> <br /> - it's not clear what the movie is about, made in times known for poststructuralism, or rather whether it is just a bad movie. Acting is terrible, but some actors I know, do they inhibit it? <br /> <br /> An old house, cut out of course with a modern apartment, is a place of murder. A (bad) movie is created on the spot, and history repeats itself again.
