You know what kind of movie you enter when the protagonist of the serial killer is transported to an electric chair (in what seems to be a baking truck), just to collide with the prison vehicle (and I'm not doing it up) a tanker to genetic engineering. The goo, which spurts forward, melts it and combines its DNA with snow, creating our hero, a deadly snowman. <br /> <br /> However, my favorite part of the movie is a shot from behind the shoulder of a snowman throwing a poor schmuck, in which his hands look suspiciously like a pair of white gloves in a pot. <br /> <br /> Mmmmm, schlock ...
