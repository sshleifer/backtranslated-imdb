I found Tremors 4: The Legend Begins to make them boring and boring. All action scenes were stupid. The so-called "GRABOIDS" are reduced to the size of a modern domestic cat, if not smaller. Acting was frightening, and this movie was just an unnecessary movie in the Tremor Saga, because although it tells the story of how the Graybids came about, the story is so stupid and useless. If you want to tell a story on the road, make sure you use SAME ACTOR (Michael Gross) to be someone in the past, when he is someone in the current Tremor movies. Gezez ... If you have not seen this movie, do not waste time. for trembling, 1, 2 and 3, for a good time. This movie, however, makes sure that the pilot sits next to you with the STOP button working to quickly withdraw from this nonsense.
