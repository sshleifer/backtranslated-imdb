It's true that there are a lot of movies a lot worse than this movie. This movie was not Manos: The Hands of Fate, nor Troll 2 (yes, I saw them twice ...), but at the same time this movie is No Alien, Predator or even Alien Vs. Predator (yes, even this movie outgrew it). Such movies make Battlefield Earth look like Star Wars, it's so bad. Razzie gives you an observation point and your biggest competition has just arrived at the cinemas. This movie, which I'm talking about, is of course Alone in the Dark. I will try to take you step by step, why this movie was so bad. <br /> <br /> Acting - I will start with what probably was the best element of this movie (next to the final subtitles that "Wish I had An Angel" played, actor, Christian Slater, have to be proud of himself, successfully proved that you can play decently in a worse movie than drink a liquid against freezing. "To answer, I wondered why he just did not leave halfway, maybe because of Stephen Dorff, who was also in the movie (someone he would like to be, but it does not work for him.) actress, but good looking and all that really matters in such films, does not mean that the acting was perfect, it was mediocre, not good, and maybe the only thing in the movie is not dobra. <br /> <br /> The Soundtrack- With the exception of "Wish I had An Angel", the soundtrack is pointless, and a bad heavy medal is pumped into the ears of the audience, maybe in di steal a horrible story (something to which wk I will make a long trip.) The long and very expensive 2 CD soundtrack is now available for sale to those musically challenged. <br /> <br /> Direction - Directed by: Hollywood's favorite director, Uwe Ball, who brought us the classic House of the Dead. Saying to us: "Yes, movies can completely ruin it, and this is just the beginning of my deadly saga about terrible movies." It is said that at least he is directed by Uwe Ball. I was not told that I would guess that the monkey was kidnapped from the Congo, brought here and forced to express opinions on how to make a film under penalty of shock. The director of photography was probably a camcorder stuck to a skateboard and pushed forward until it hits the wall. In scenes where the camera should stay still, it moves all the time, not allowing us to stop anywhere, and when it should move, the camera stops for some reason. <br /> <br /> Production - Who on earth is stupid enough to spend money on this bomb? I feel sorry for a fool ... sometimes. Sometimes I'm glad he has been taught this lesson, never spending money on trash worse than the dog's feces in the bag. <br /> <br /> Writing / Storyboard - An attempt to analyze history is more painful then jamming the ice cube under the big finger and kicking the ball as hard as I could, but I will still try. <br /> <br /> Edward Carnby escapes as a child from an orphanage, where 20 children, where to go as part of scientific experiments. He escapes and hides in an electric socket where he is electrocuted (this is the point where it got so bad that I started laughing). Then he quickly moves forward many years later, where he is a detective of paranoia. He is attacked by a zombie who can not be shot, kills him and continues his life. He is later attacked by some crazy monster and discovers secrets that no one else knows. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is bad, really bad. The film expects us to read about 10 minutes, which seemed to be 100, a random text about an untruthful civilization called Abskani. The film does not have one turn behind the other, more than the audience can handle, more than the audience wants to deal with, more than the audience can worry about. This story is bad that even the Double Dragon does better. <br /> <br /> In general, do not miss this movie. I gave him 1 in 10, but that's because there is not 0.
