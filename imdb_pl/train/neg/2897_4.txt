"Dan in real life" does not excite much. First of all, the whole configuration is amazingly invented. Did you really believe that during this very long first conversation at a restaurant meeting, Marie would not tell Dan where she was going? And because Dan talked during this conversation, why would she be so attracted to him? Therefore, I never discovered why Marie was so fascinated by Dan throughout the film. He is very narcissistic and does not do much to convince us that he is a really good guy (for example, he lies in a bookstore Marie, laughs at his former girlfriends and tries to envy Maria with a "blind date"). There are more ideas, such as this absurd scene in the bowling alley, where Dan and Marie are caught inventing by the whole family. Yes, it can happen. Dan in real life is slow, caressing and manipulative. Even chick videos, such as The Jane Austen Book Club, score higher than the predictable "tear squeezer".
