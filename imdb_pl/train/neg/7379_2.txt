What was Steven Seagal thinking? First of all, I love Seagala. I love all of his films until mid-2000. His early works are some of the best in this genre. However, this does not meet its perfect name. Attack Force (with protagonist Marshall Lawson {Seagal}) should be a mindless action movie with Seagal in a typical form of ass kicking. However, what we get is a criminal mystery bordering on a political thriller with little or no action. Seagal is always in the shade because of its weight. I could not follow this story. There are people who mutate to supermen when they take drugs. What happened in this movie. Seagal's dubbing is a disgrace, a mess and shame. Why dub a man? History is terrible. I got 2/10 from me because of the scene in which Seagal asks for a backup, even though he has an army with him, and a funny fight scene in which the seagal wavers his hands like a girl in front of the camera! "Revenge is a two-way street," says Seagal in this movie ... Forget revenge on Steven, you need redemption!
