I saw this movie without knowing anything before the deal. The plot was terrible, there were no large gaps in information. In the film, I did not have a "battle of reason". The actors just spit out silly nonsense, sometimes causing me to gnash my teeth in agony when they were afraid. The plot was predictable, except for the nauseating homo erotic scene at the end (I'm not homophobic, but I got tired of stomach disease), even the ending was predictable. And it can be said that the detective was Jude Law in his outfit, everything from a false accent, a horrible dental job, facial hair in a costume shop, all indications were that it was a disguise. The whole movie was just a lost time in my life. This movie resembled a puppet show with Jude Law and Michael Caine as a puppet, and the house as a window to see the show, really in my opinion.
