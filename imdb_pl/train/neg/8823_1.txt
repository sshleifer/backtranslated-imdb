This is one of the worst B-slasher machines I've ever seen in my life. The ending is something that you have to believe. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Harry standing and Phillip standing on the stairs with his mother watching his father leave the chimney, dressed in Santa's suit. He puts presents under a tree, eats cookies and milk, and then returns to the chimney. Phillip goes to bed, but Harry just goes to see that his father is dressed in a Santa Claus suit, sexually pleasing to his mother. Then Harry goes up the stairs, breaks the snowball, grabs a shard of glass and cuts. <br /> <br /> Then you go to the present. You see Harry. He is a lonely man who sleeps in Santa's suit and watches small children through binoculars. He has two books. One book for good children and one for bad children. He writes down everything they do in these books. The guy is a creeper. He also works at the Jolly Dream toy factory. His brother Phillip has a family and two children and lives in a nice house. <br /> <br /> When Harry learns that his boss only cares about profits, he goes and collects all the toys and delivers them to several children. Then he travels to the church and kills 4 people. Then he goes to another house and puts presents under a tree. The children catch him, but they go back to bed. So Harry goes to the bedroom and kills his father and leaves. <br /> <br /> As he walks towards the house, a group of kids notices him and runs up to him. Parents are upset and try to make their children come back to them so that they do not get hurt. How do they know that Harry is a killer? Sure, you have to be suspicious because you never know who it may be. Harry gives presents to the children, and father pulls out the switch's blade, trying to stab him in front of the children. <br /> <br /> When Harry escapes, the town's inhabitants light torches and follow him to kill him. They do not even know he's a killer. When Harry reaches his brother's house, his brother and he talk and Phillip suffocates him. He just loses consciousness. Phillip loads Harry into his van. When Harry wakes up, he starts. <br /> <br /> Finishing is something that I could not believe. You will have to see it again to believe it. <br /> <br /> One of the things that eavesdropped on me was black Santa. That's right, the man in Santa's costume they saw was a white man. Why, then, did they bring the black man? <br /> <br /> Skip it and see the Silent Night Death Night and the Murder of Saint Nicholas. You will get money to watch these two films. They're better than this pile of rubbish! I give this film 1 star from 10. I would like to give him 0 stars, because this film deserves it.
