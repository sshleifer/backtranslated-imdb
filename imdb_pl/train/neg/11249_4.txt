Stunningly visually? Certainly. I've seen some movies that have looked so good for some time. Sky Captain and World of Tomorrow use striking cinematography, computer graphics and creative futuristic designs to create a world that is historically known and yet quite fresh. It seems that the period is the 30's or early 40's. The film tells about the recent attacks on New York by mechanized armies stealing generators and the like for some inexplicable reason. Also, the mysterious disappearances of the relevant scientific minds converge. Who can stop them and save the world? All right, you do not have to move your faith to know that it's Captain Heaven himself, with his wise reporter girl, always hot at the head, and in the wings of his trusted, completely competent helper. What Sky Captain has in the atmosphere and graphics is missing in telling stories and make-up. The plot of this movie is ridiculous. Having said that, the film is heading to the serial sense of film series from the past. They had quite distant stories and bad acting - but none of them, and I mean none of them, had the budget and big names that this movie had. Two award-winning artists' academies and Jude Law could keep the film on the surface, one might think, but the Sky Captain is drowning. Despite the fantastic dark look, I found myself regretting that the film would not end and I could continue my life. I was not interested in a story that aroused little interest. I did not care about any shows of glib. Paltrow was simply awful. Jolie was a joke with a virtually no substance role. The law can not transfer the one-line tradition too clearly to its limited arms. I mean, let's face it, he's not Will Smith, Mel Gibson, and even Wesley Snipes. The sad thing about Sky Captain, at least for me, was that he promised so many promises, but he did not spend so much. I was bored ten minutes in the movie - I was waiting for something that would interest me - and it never came.
