I went to watch this movie, expecting "nothing really too much", still disappointed. The opening scene heralded a small action with a shade of comedy. Keeps you in touch for the first half, until you expect the time has come for the action to start. Well, nothing like that happens. The movie stretches and the end simply hits you to the point where you are nervous. I wonder what the director thought. He did not make any sense. The film was lacking in all aspects, it did not have a real storyline and it seemed very empty, even if "Rambo" was in it, I do not think that it would help in the assessment. There is simply no logic in the film. A great way to waste time and money. By far the most annoying movie I've ever seen and I'm sure there will be others who will have the same point of view after survival. Definitely not for people who have some sense in the film.
