The plot, character development and gags in this film are very weak. It's a waste of time. The conclusion from Saving Grace is to make a person feel warm and fuzzy, as if the characters grew up during their struggles. There was no such development to allow such warm, blurred feelings. Drug gags are caked, and much of the movie does not sound real. The plot builds what should be tension, but the characters are not developed enough to care. Then he goes through solving all the unique problems in about a minute of time on the screen, leaving the viewer feeling that they just lost their time.
