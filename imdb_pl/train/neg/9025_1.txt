Sorry - this movie is simply cheap TV production. I have seen a lot of promotional materials and I expect a professional film such as "Stormriders" - what I have been shown is a low-budget film, such as "XENA" or "Hercules" on television. No atmosphere, very boring, more than a worse fight scene. A few good ideas - no more. I hope that I will get a chance to make such a movie, and then I will show you how to make such a movie !!! <br /> <br /> My ASIAN-Tips: "MUSA - THE WARRIOR", "STORMERS", "SHAOLIN SOCCER", "BATTLE ROYAL", "VERSUS" etc. <br /> <br /> I apologize for my bad english!
