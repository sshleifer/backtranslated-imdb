If I had not read Pat Barker's Union Street before watching this movie, I would like it. Unfortunately, it is not. This is actually my kind of film, it is well done and I do not want to say otherwise, but as an adaptation it fails in every angle. <br /> <br /> A shocking novel about reality. Having lived in a workers' area in northern England, I took my heart and refused to leave for a few weeks after finishing. I read about women from Union Street through tears, disgust, shock, anger, compassion and misery. Perfect. A novel that sometimes seemed unreadable to me, but a novel I simply could not put down. Depressing yes, but totally gripping. <br /> <br /> Film. About her. Hollywood took Barker's truth and reality and covered it with a layer of sweet powdered sugar. A beautiful movie, an inspiring soundtrack, great performances, a tale of hope and romance ... yes. Adaptation of Union Street ... no. <br /> <br /> Women from Union Street and their stories are condensed in the form of Fonda, their stories are touched, but many of them have been rejected. I agree that some of Barker's stories are sensitive and too frightening to watch, and a movie with about 7 leading heroes is simply not practical, but the content is not my main concern. The essence and true insides of the novel are lost - darkness and rain, broken windows covered with cardboard and a graphically depicted stench of poverty is replaced by the sun, nice houses and the flickering result of William. <br /> <br /> If you liked the movie because of its positivity and hope in the face of "reality", I advise you to wait with reading the book without first preparing for something more similar to the "Schindler's List" ... but without a happy ending .
