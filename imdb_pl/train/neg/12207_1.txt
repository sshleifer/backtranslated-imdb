I remember that I loved the movie when it appeared. I was 12 years old, I had Commodore 64 and I loved playing Rambo. So I was very excited when I bought this movie really cheap. I put it in the VCR and started it: this movie is really bad! Sylvester Stallone speaks like 3 words in the whole movie (except for this horrible sentimental speech at the end) and has the same facial expression. And this stupid love inside is just so incredibly predictable. I just finished passing the whole thing quickly and went to exchange the movie for something else.
