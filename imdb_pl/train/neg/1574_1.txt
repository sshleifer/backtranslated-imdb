There is no history! The plot is hopeless! Filmed on the basis of a car with a locked accelerator, no brakes and a locked lever of the automatic transmission can not be good! I would have stopped the car in one minute, regardless of whether I was in it or in a police car that was constantly following it. I felt sorry for the actors who had to endure such a bad script. Several scenes in which some resemblance to the action was dramatically dramatized and far from reality can be obtained. In addition, there were many mistakes, for example the hood of a fleeing car that was launched at 100 miles per hour. Initially, it simply folded on the windshield, as in reality, but then it exploded. The car was later in the movie watched with a hood on .... <br /> <br /> This movie was just annoying, stay away from it!
