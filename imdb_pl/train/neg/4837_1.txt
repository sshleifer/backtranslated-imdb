I went to see this movie to see what the noise is all about. I was as disappointed as surprised to see how he scored 6 (?) Oscars and 7.9 marks on IMDb from today. <br /> <br /> Kathryn Bigelow should be the happiest director ever to win the best picture and the best Oscar director for a really really bad movie and I wonder why? Was the totally unrealistic story of a man dealing with the bombing of cowboy bombs meaningful to someone I could not see? Why I still imagined that this movie was a modification of an old bad Western movie about a cowboy doing "courageous deeds" in the Wild Wild West infected with "bad" Red Indians; but has this time been set in a different background? Was he awarded the Oscars, because the director was ex James Cameron, and made it a cool story for the weaker (gossip) TV shows during the day? Or maybe it was some Emperor's dress code - where most people knew it was junk, but he just could not say it because the others did not seem to say it out loud? <br /> <br /> And finally, what was with this sniper scene, in which they showed the housing of the shell falling in a super slow motion in high resolution, as if wanting to convey a "deep message" or something like that? Something like "guys from EOD are suddenly doing good snipers and getting dirty terrorists all the time"? Was it just me who felt that there are so many pieces and pieces squeezed here and there for no apparent reason? And can you get Oscars for editing and directing for that? <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it yet, do not waste your money on tickets. Wait until they run it on TV in a few years. You will not miss much.
