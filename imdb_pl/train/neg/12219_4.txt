It was a strange movie. It started quite well. A solid soundtrack behind images of gore and chaos, when our psychopath was doing its job. <br /> <br /> Then comes his "fall". Here I could say that I was in a real cheesy movie "B". Poor acting, I mean, how hard is it to hold a gun and behave like a policeman? These guys could not. After the death scene of our psychopath, we get a preliminary loan and the film begins ... <br /> <br /> From this moment on there are badly working big boobs, an occasional bucket of blood and poorly executed death scenes. br /> <br /> That being said, I gave the film four, because despite its defects there was a kind of quirkiness that I simply could not completely shake off. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie, but I must admit that I look worse.
