I've seen a lot of horror over the years, like Nightstalker, who's been working on the legend of Wendigo, so I could not wait for an angry spirit causing chaos to spice up the Halloween season. Man, I was wrong. The whole movie creates that the events that are about to happen will be frightening and frightening, but then they provide a very simplified story about revenge and murder because of the loss of any property. A bit scary - no! This movie has a lot to do with Cold Creek Manor, another total loser. <br /> <br /> It's becoming harder and harder to believe Hollywood is talking about frightening movies, because something original and scary is rare in them. . What idiots are you paying for such a fake movie to be made? Return to the guys from the drawing board and do something useful with those millions of greens that you have to quit.
