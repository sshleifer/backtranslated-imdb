Some of these viewers' comments are just ridiculous. Does not it hurt you to watch with your significant person? I apologized to my boyfriend for the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It was so slow and really weird. <br /> <br /> Both Redgraves, Vanessa and Natasha were not suited for this, especially since Vanessa is making this absurd, bold American accent. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes was the same wiggly-lipped awkward girl she was in in My So-Called Life. He still has to push himself in any way. Girl, find a new way to pretend to cry! <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep was one of the only parts of the movie that was redemption, she was on screen for five minutes, and I swear to God, she took her hand out of the movie screen and woke me up. <br /> <br /> Oh! And Hugh Dancy, who is getting better every time I see him. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close and Eileen Atkins were also great in their two and a half scenes. <br /> <br /> I mean, it was a well-filmed movie, it was very pretty, the settings were interestingly dressed, providing relief for the intense boredom I felt. <br /> <br /> I do not know, it's just pathetic when the movie, which can be proud of the cast of "The greatest actresses of our time" sucks. Certainly had more than a few noticeable editing errors, and the main character (Ann) was a great jerk. I was glad that she died. But that's because I felt bad for Lili, Ann's friend - mainly because these two ladies were better actors and made me feel a little empathy. <br /> <br /> Ugh. BAD work, Movie evening. You were not funny and you did not even stimulate thinking. I hope the book is better, so it does not waste people more time. 3/10
