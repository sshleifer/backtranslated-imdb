In this video, it's hard to find any positive ones. It seems that the producer must have earned without much effort and that is why we are treated like a full Galaxy show, which is the worst excuse for a movie in history. Policewomen looked extremely sexy in their little uniforms. More shots from two cops and much less galaxies would be a good solution. Of course, this would increase the budget, so they decided to fill the space with this unfortunate repetition. Mrs. Albright looks sexy, and her acting is paramount. Mrs. Stabs, whom I had heard earlier, but I have not seen her on the screen before, also looked very desirable, but it seems that she lacks basic acting talent. Along with Mrs. Albright, it's real rubbish.
