I watch this movie when I write it. . . If the following comments "prove my lack of development as a true creator of artistic films", so be it. . . <br /> <br /> But. . . I thought (I still think about how I am watching now) about this film. . . to put it mildly, it's very, very overrated. Again, very much. <br /> <br /> It looks like a really bad student movie made by someone who has very limited resources. . . and who did not pay too much attention to details. <br /> <br /> I do not want to think about all the different ways in which this movie is missing, but. . . well . . . I just do not understand it (remember, I fully admit that maybe this ME is an idiot here - not the creator of the film - for not getting this "piece of imagination"). . . I rent it for a whim, because the reviews were very, very special. . . <br /> <br /> Sheesh. . .
