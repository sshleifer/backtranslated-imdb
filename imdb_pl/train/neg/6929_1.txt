I have read the reviews about this film and decided to give it a try. I am a guy with open minds and I gave good reviews to a few bad movies. As the end credits went to it, I was looking for meaning and something nice to say. Here's: "This film was fortunately short." That's all I have. <br /> <br /> Okay, okay. Scenes and visuals were well done, and the music helped to give life to the mood of asylum, but the film was painful to watch, and the endless dialogue rebounded from the good songs. I was laughing at the movie, but the way you laugh at your best friend who was just ashamed of the big crowd. <br /> <br /> During the "chicken dance" in the final, which I had just decided to roll up the film and let the bodies fall where they fall. I do not know what could have saved this movie. Acting was not bad and it looked like it had a budget, but there was simply no way to watch it; even the presence of beautiful naked breasts. Maybe I should have called myself or a lot of beer to get the full experience of the movie. Anyway, I do not watch this movie unless I'm really depressed. Then I can say: "At least I was not in" Dr. Tarr's Torture Dungeon. "I'm better than these guys."
