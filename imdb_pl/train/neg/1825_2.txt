I do not know what. I just could not laugh at it. I had an open mind. I did not want to talk about it. But I really could not laugh at the movie. It was not funny to me. Some parts seemed too difficult for Ben Stiller and Jack Black. The fact that you put two very funny men does not mean that it will be a great comedy. Some movies simply should not be done. It's one of them. Because she has a lot of old jokes, and acting was just stupid. I know, I know it's a comedy. At least yes. But I was not impressed. I'm sorry, but I can not give anything lower than two. And that's all I give. <br /> <br /> 2/10
