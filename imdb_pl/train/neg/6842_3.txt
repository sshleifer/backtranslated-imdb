"Paula, I can be a bitch, but I will never be butch!" <br /> <br /> A funny line in an otherwise rather tiring patch of skin, in which there is nice honey in Stacey Walker, but that's all. This girl is a real teasing girl who lures her boyfriends, co-workers, and even lesbian roommate Paula to her bedroom, but then turns into a job that cries "rape" and calls the police! <br /> <br /> The schizophrenic personality of this certified c ** t is interesting maybe for some time, but this story eventually turns into a real, recurring matter of one note. At least the ending is worth waiting for those who care about it.
