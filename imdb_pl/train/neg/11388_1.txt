This story is about a romantic triangle between the n. African male prostitute, French transsexual prostitute (Stephanie) and a Russian waiter who does not speak French and never seems to shave. <br /> <br /> The film is boring, gloomy and depressing, wintered on a foggy, cloudy day, winter days or in badly lit interiors, where each is bathed in strange blue luminescence. And yes, I know, it's because the white balance has been turned off. Everyone is pale and depressed and looks haggard, shabby and dirty. The bodies are bony and shot in such a close-up that they look quite ugly and unattractive. Crets, greasy hair. Yuk. Bad news in a movie where people spend a lot of time naked or having sex. <br /> <br /> And the story? Stephanie's mother dies. All three heroes return to their home village of Stephanie, where thanks to many retrospections to the abandoned village and predictably dirty interiors, we can see Stephanie's childhood as a boy named Pierre. Mother dies. Well ... and that's all, really. Character development is limited to a minimum, as is the description of history. <br /> <br /> I suppose the plot is not linear (it would explain many non sequiteurs), but really, after paying seven euros, I do not want to build the film myself: this is what the director takes my money. Expecting me to join the story-telling process and get my hands dirty, ask too much. <br /> <br /> This movie is a pile of pretentious garbage, which arises primarily from the desire of a les bourgeois epater (ie shake straigh). I see how it was a shoo-in at the Berlin Film Festival and I see why it is nowhere.
