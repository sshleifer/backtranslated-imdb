I saw the majority of "My Bollywood Bride" today at the IAAC film festival in New York and had to leave the theater because of the feeling of nausea that was rising in me. I saw Bollywood movies and saw satire of Bollywood movies. This movie could not decide which one he wanted to be, so he ended up being a joke. <br /> <br /> It seems that it has been copied from films such as Bride and Prejudice and Bollywood Calling, and what a sloppy, lazy job. How can Bollywood be set aside from determination to stick to abused, beaten scripts? Is there no one who can show on screen millions of real, fascinating stories that are sure to exist and appear on the earth of a billion people? A thoughtful car driver, a cow on the street, free scenes from foreign locations, senseless scenes on the streets of Mumbai, everything is there. All possible phrases about India have been faithfully included. So disgustingly predictable. ugh !!! Actors' performances are weak in all areas, with the exception of Neha Dubey, who is talented and beautiful. One wonders why she would choose such a project.
