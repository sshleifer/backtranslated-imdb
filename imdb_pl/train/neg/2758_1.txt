I give this film 1 because there are no negative numbers in the IMDb rating system. this movie was awful. It was very badly made, the story was poorly written, the action was unbelievable. I doubt that even the Salvation Army could fight as poorly as the soldiers in this film. I will not even write any story spoilers because the movie is not good enough for story spoilers. Writing comments to the story would be pointless. If I had to compare this movie, I would have to compare it to Reign of Fire, although I did not like Reign of Fire, at least this movie was better than this one. <br /> <br /> Some people in the theater left the movie before the film was half finished. The only reason I did not do it was that I just did not think about it. I counted for a CGI feast and a masterful fight, but it was not. Martial arts lasted 30 seconds and were very disappointing with the routine exercise performed during the flashing scene. CGI was not well made either. One scene comes to mind. During one of the previous battles of tanks, soldiers fire about .... Nothing. Someone forgot to point out the animation guys in this movie, so the street was completely devoid of bad guys. I also think that the voice of the evil guy was named by the voice of Imotep from the movies "Mummy." Was it the same with the same hoarse echo. (Someone owed royalties here?) Ever since I mentioned the battle scene, I will say what can be considered a spoiler, but only for purists that I suppose. <br /> <br /> Do not look at it, do not buy a DVD when it appears. You have been warned.
