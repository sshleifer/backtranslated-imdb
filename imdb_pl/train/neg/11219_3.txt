It was a film about infidelity and revenge. A twin with a "twin" connection senses that something is wrong with her sister. This movie lasted forever to determine the plot. A plot that has been done many times. Acting was poor in the majority. After the story ends, the movie ends. Laura and Ashley are twins who live with an offensive father. Father seems to favor Ashley, so Laura is to blame for everything. There is a promise that girls will never be separated, but as they grow up, their lives go in different directions. Ashley gets a job at a restaurant where he meets Barry, a married man. Of course, nothing good can come of this. The fact that Barry had tinnitus was a bad excuse to track him down. I waited for this film to improve and there will be a solution somewhere, but it did not happen.
