I bought this DVD without any previous references, but the names of John Huston, Raquel Welch, Mae West and Farrah Fawcett on the cover. I found the Brazilian title very strange, but I decided to watch, expecting to see a funny comedy, maybe like "Switch." However, history without sense is terrible and difficult to describe. Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed) undergoes surgery to change gender in Copenhagen and returns to Hollywood, saying that he is supposed to be Myra Breckinridge (Raquel Welch) and get half of the property of his uncle Buck Loner (John Huston). During these days Myra and her alter ego Myron spoil the young couple in their uncle's academy with perverse sex. At some point, the sloppy screenplay is so confused that I believe that the whole story was just a trip by Myron caused by an accident. Unfortunately the beauty of Raquel Welch and Farrah Fawcett is not enough to maintain this movement. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Homem & Mulher At√© Certo Ponto" ("Man and woman to some extent")
