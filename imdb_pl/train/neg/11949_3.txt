This stupid comedy really copes well with wasting comedy talent. In particular, Dan Aykroyd and Howard Hesseman are misused here. I could laugh once or twice during this movie, but generally it is a boring movie with a bit of stupidity thrown in for good. The premise, although routine, was still not bad, but after setting the story the film disappeared. Do not waste time on this error.
