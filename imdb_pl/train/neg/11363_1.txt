This movie was advertised on radio, TV, magazines, etc. Almost every hour or in any number. When we went to the Kinnepolis multiplex, our expectations were very high. But oh how sad this movie is! It's a Hollywood movie about the film in the movie. Shades are so clear that we are not ready to produce "great Hollywood movies". I'm not a film critic, but I think a good movie starts with a good script. And the script is a nightmare. As my subject says, it's nothing, and then looped. You can just stare at the TV without seeing anything. That was the feeling when we saw Shades. Shades are BAD PRODUCTION !!!
