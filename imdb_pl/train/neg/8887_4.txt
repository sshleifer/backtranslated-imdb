Good films can not be based only on the beautiful garden and the top of the hill. Surprised by the fact that he won two awards. Extremely overrated. For the first time I saw this kind of films from China, visually stunning, but also with something really captivating, well, more than 10 years ago and I am sure that more are coming. This is not one of them, I'm afraid.
