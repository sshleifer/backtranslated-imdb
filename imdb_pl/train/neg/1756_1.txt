At the back of the torch for years (this was the way it was reported), the television meeting of the two most beloved characters in the sitcom's history started badly - and from there straight from the hill. Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) and her best friend Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper) meet in New York after a long alienation and catching up. What an innovative concept! But what is sad is not saying anything about what we're talking about (let alone making a movie) during those years. Instead, the script itself contains the ejection of one crazed old feature device after the other (most often related to older women in the workplace), while completely overlooking the bizarre charm and sophistication that made the original show a winner. The supporting staff is immediately forgotten, humor does not exist, and the chemistry that Moore and Harper once owned does not exist anymore. Moore has allegedly been stuck in a vain for years, waiting for the "right scenario" before he gets involved. If it was the one she thought was "right", what the hell did she reject? This is not the age of the heroes who do it (for the time being it is inevitably marching on), but the almost complete lack of imagination combined with the blatant disregard for the elements that made the series work. It used to be intended as a pilot, but of course it did not arouse interest among potential sponsors. Or that's what the potential audience is all about. A quick and forgotten film is a parody and offense to the classic.
