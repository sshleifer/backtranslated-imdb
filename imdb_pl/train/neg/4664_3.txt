I voted 3 for this movie because it looks great, like all Greenaways output. However, it was his usual mix of "art" of sex and pretentious nonsense. I know that many people like this movie, but it has tired me a lot. Certainly not for everyone. Omnipresent McGregor of course played a role for credibility, but I do not think he should really waste time. I hate anyone to send to the pseudo corner, but please ..... !!! On the plus side it is very visually appealing and I liked music, but I could not see it to the end and I can not say that for many movies. I usually watch the whole thing, but it's unbearable !!
