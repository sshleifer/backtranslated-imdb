I waited a long time to see TORTURE DUNGEON DR TARR and after watching it I was very disappointed. This is not a baroque film I expected. The trailer (which I saw on the DVD "Something Weird") is much better than the whole movie, which is extremely oblivious. Almost no scenes stand out in it, and the look and style is interesting, but it does not even come close to other Baroque films, from Fellini or Jodorowsky. The characters are boring and almost nothing dramatic happens, although we see rape, crucifixion, madness, etc. <br /> <br /> The main problem with TORTURE DUNGEON DR TARR was that it was talk - more than anything else . It was almost like watching a book. I just wanted the movie to have moments of silence or mood, or something like that, instead we see / listen to the main characters who talk endlessly about blunt things. <br /> <br /> Failed opportunity.
