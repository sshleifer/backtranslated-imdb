It's a 30-minute show of one joke. Joke, cavemen are not treated fairly. Hahaha!!! He can not call because he is a caveman. Cavemen are not as smart as people. Oh jeez, those cavemen are so unsophisticated. There is no humor in this program. They can only joke about this joke and they already have Geico ads. This program does not deserve a time slot in the national T.V. <br /> <br /> This program tries to be fun, but it is not. Watching this program, I thought I was trying to be like "Bonelor's Gone Wild Show." So they go to the bar and try to sleep with many women. The crying caveman is annoying. A caveman with glasses is too smart to be a caveman (HAHAHA !!!). All three have personalities, but I can not understand why they do not care.
