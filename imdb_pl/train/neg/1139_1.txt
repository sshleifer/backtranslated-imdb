Remember that I have not seen the movie since I discovered it in 2007, and my city is smaller and it is not there. However, I really want to say something about it. Actually, I'm researching the university on the title character of Richard Maurice Bucke and I would like to emphasize that the person on whom the main character was based was in fact completely different !!! The ideas of people and artistic licenses granted by Hollywood, the real doctor Bucke completely supported the hysterectomy to heal the madness of women and would never practice something as liberal as in the film. I think it's funny when we see different film critics who write for legal newspapers who say that this movie has some historical basis! The only fact I see is the friendship between Dr. Bucke and Walt Whitman. Please, do not waste time on a film with such a disregard for the horror experienced by real women at the hands of this doctor, who has now been glorified by the film industry.
