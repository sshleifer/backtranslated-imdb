It's just not enough here. There are some fun places, but not really. I was very disappointed because I love stupid movies. I expected it to be a hidden treasure. THERE WAS NO. It was a hidden turd. <br /> <br /> The whole time I watched it, I thought: "Geez, I could do better than I am and I'm a moron". Do not believe these good reviews. I was drawn in by them. At no time did I laugh aloud. Maybe it was fun or innovative in 1987, but man fell today. This movie had a promise, it just did not make it. Maybe if they rewrote it several more times. I can not blame the actors. They were not the best, but they just did not have much to work. This movie has failed because of bold. SORELY disappointed.
