This film is to be a mysterious, serious thriller about a man looking for a missing girl. However, 30 minutes after the film turns into a funny, unrealistic story with annoying characters and random scenes. I can not imagine that someone will not laugh when randomly Cage Karate kicks this blonde or when they "abolish" an old lady. Lines, characters and acting are badly made from the very beginning. I've always liked Nicolas Cage as an actor, but this year he did some awful movies; it's definitely the worst (yet ...). <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch an intense, thrilling thriller. If you really want to enjoy this story, rent the original. However, if you intend to watch it, be prepared to laugh on some lines and end the scenes instead of taking them seriously; it's the only way you like this movie.
