I used to think that movies require stories or other means that make you care about the story or whatever happens. This movie showed me that you do not really need to have something like that. <br /> <br /> I could summarize it simply. But IMDb wants me to have more lines. It was quite nice. not convincing in the slightest. The way the characters talk in the movie makes you think that it should take place within a few days, but there is no passage of time and I am pretty sure that everything is happening in an hour. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for entertainment, buy a gallon of milk and see how fast you can drink it before throwing it out. It would be a much better use of your time. A time you will never recover. Jurassic Park 3 has been removed better than this movie.
