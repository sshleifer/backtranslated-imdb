Townies is the most lazy movie I've ever seen and I've seen Blair Witch movies (part one and two). He seems confused by what he wants to be. It's not fun enough for comedy, it's not tragic enough for drama, it's not bloody enough for horror and it's not good enough to watch. He has scenes depicting a man doing karate "slapstick / bloody", so I think this movie will be in the style of Toxic Avenger and Street Trash. Then, without warning, he jumps into a drama about a missing girl, a delayed (mentally retarded) woman and a trusting mother. Then he hits the ONLY part of the movie, which seems to be set up as sitcom without laughter. The part I'm talking about is a lonely TOWNIE who is so lonely that he is comforted by rotting corpses. It was the ONLY part of the movie that gave me ANY feeling. The rest is the belt of my life. Then, to show how CRUEL Wayne is, there's a type of DOCUMENT at the end of Wayne's (director) movie that publicly laughs at Toby (the stars). I was sick. Although Killer Nerd and Bride of Killer Nerd (two other Wayne movies) are not the best, at least they are invented enough, you can have fun until the final credits. I even like Killer Nerd a bit, he has some great lines that I use today. <br /> <br /> If you like underground movies, you like terrestrial films, and if you like to watch your feet, just relaxing, they are, you will not like TOWNIES! <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (with ****) <br /> <br />
