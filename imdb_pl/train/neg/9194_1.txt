Ok, first of all I'm a big fan of zombie movies. I loved all Romero movies and loved the re-make of Dawn of the Dead. So when I heard every critic moving this movie, I was still an optimist. I mean, the critics hated Resident Evil and although it may not be a particularly great movie, I liked it, if it was not for the fact that it was just a nice zombie shoot-out with a half-decent plot. However, this is pure crap. A horrible dialogue, a half-lost plot and scenes from video games inserted into the movie. Who in his right mind thought it was a good idea. The only thing in this movie (I use this term), which I liked Jurgen Prochnow as Captain Kirk (Ugh). While his name throws originality out of the window, you can see in his performance that he knows that he is in a terrible movie about god and he can use it as well. Everyone else behaves as if they were doing Shakespeare. And I can add very badly. Essentially, the only reason someone should see this monstrosity is whether or not you are.) Are you a big zombie buff and you need to see every zombie or b move.) I like to play MST3K, a home game. See it with your friends and be prepared for a lot of unintentional laughter. <br /> <br />
