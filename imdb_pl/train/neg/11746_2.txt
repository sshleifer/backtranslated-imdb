Well, this movie certainly caused quite a stir; From the noise at the Toronto Film Festival to the gush of opinions at CBC Radio. A refreshing, crazy, funny indie movie. I've been waiting impatiently for months. <br /> <br /> How can I just put it? It drew in a very big way. Exercise cinematic lameness, which makes Adam Sandler look like a comic genius. <br /> <br /> At best, it was a bit funny and the worst calling a coma. A unique scenario badly directed and cheesy changed into a desperate mess. <br /> <br /> And what about the music 500 dB more than the rest of the soundtrack? It was the only really strange thing. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a really funny, bizarre movie involving strangers, try Repoman. There's no comparison!
