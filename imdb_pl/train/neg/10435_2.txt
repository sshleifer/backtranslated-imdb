With these people, he manages to take many shots, using old recordings and gassing animals to get them out, not to mention that some of the scenes have been filmed on the created plan with the actors, what to believe in? The old movie of countries is nice, but watching these movies is painful for animals and the degradation of the natives. I know that racism is fine in these old movies, but there is something else that will make this pair lose credibility. Presented as flyers, they never fly their planes, Martin Johnson was a former vaudeville, he used friends like Jack London for financial gain, stiffening their royalties, refusing visible depression of his wife, using her as a sweet prop, all of which makes these films unbearable. In no way were they the first to travel to this land or the first to write about them. He was OK as a filmmaker and photographer, but that's all.
