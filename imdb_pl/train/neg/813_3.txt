The biggest mistake that makes me angry is that they say Zues gets DUTCH commands. But she speaks to him in German. These two things are completely different, it's like saying "it's good that he takes French instructions" and starts speaking Spanish. <br /> <br /> James Belushi gives the feeling of being a comedian, not a detective. The role just does not suit him, even if it's supposed to be a comedy. <br /> <br /> To many stereotypical / predictable things. A typical comment or phrases. <br /> <br /> If you do not look at these things, I think it can be a nice movie to watch if ever on TV. But I would not suggest hiring it.
