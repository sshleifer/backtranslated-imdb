I've seen a lot of horrors in my time, all ridiculously bad, but none reaches the depths to which this piece of rubbish is falling. This movie caused anger and anger in me when I watched him, trying to get his head exactly what the movie was about. Now, after I saw him, I understand - sort of - what's going on and why, but the movie itself is too confusing to be pleasant when you watch it. Yes, there are the usual scenes of disinterested violence, one-liners that show the stunning insight of her character ("The highway belongs to me ... ME!") And enough nudity to distract us enough from "conspiracy", but you will still leave this movie alone and use, like a puppy that is no longer desirable and stays in the box next to the road. Blech.
