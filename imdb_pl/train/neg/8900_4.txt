I liked the first movie, but it is a textbook example of continuation, which would be better on the left side of the drawing board. The general idea of ​​the first film was, if not great, at least very interesting. This sequel tries to develop the idea and characters from the first movie, and although Christopher Walken is still good as Gabriel, the whole idea suddenly becomes a bit ridiculous. If you have not seen any of these films, get the first movie and forget about the sequels, they can take all the joy from the original.
