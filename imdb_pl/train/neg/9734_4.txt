The man discovers that his parents were part of a nuclear experiment in the 1950s and that he now has the power ... to explode with flames! <br /> <br /> I was really prepared for this movie, and the director was great Toby Hooper and the wild wild card Brad Dourif. Unfortunately, he did not rise above the average film about individual violence. There is an interesting premise behind spontaneous combustion, but it never seems to fulfill its potential and prolong the plot too much. Special effects are not bad and help move the film to the finale. <br /> <br /> The cast is not bad, Dourif steals the show. <br /> <br /> Around, no classics, but it is not the worst. <br /> <br /> ** with ****
