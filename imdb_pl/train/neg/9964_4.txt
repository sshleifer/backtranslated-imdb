In the recent biography of Alec Guinness, I could not find much about "To Paris With Love." I'm sure Guinness made a movie to leave Paris for a free trip to Paris. Film has no other reason to exist. <br /> <br /> Of course, Paris is nicely photographed with this wonderful opening of Guinness and his son riding the Champs Elysees with the Arc de Triomphe in the background. Unfortunately, it falls from there. <br /> <br /> There is simply no chemistry between Guinness and a young girl with whom he has a brief contact in Paris. According to Guinness's latest biography by Piers Paul Read, Guinness positively disliked the girl, he considered her behavior unprofessional. As for what Odile Vernois thought about her star, there is no record. They have as much chemistry as two castrated cats. <br /> <br /> Guinness has a good moment in the movie, which was straight from one of his comedies, Ealing, when he climbs a tree trying to regain the badminton shuttlecock. But I would not wait through this movie. <br /> <br /> At least Alec went from Paris to Paris.
