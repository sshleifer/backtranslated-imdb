The formal move of a guy who wants a girl, a guy who's lying to stand next to a girl, a guy who gets a best friend to help outrageously (comedus reliefus, no?), To help fool a girl, etc. It's done to death and with rare exceptions from several accidents with assessment, this has been done better. <br /> <br /> Apart from the clever storyline, it is attractive and there are several good moments. Jonathon Schaech did better, and his acting here was close to becoming a phone. It was not a total loss, but nothing new in this cold matter.
