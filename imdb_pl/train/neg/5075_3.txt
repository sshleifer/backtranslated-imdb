The animation was good, the photos were good, although not entirely original, but the story was too long, too confusing and, in addition, dramatic. After about an hour I could not wait to finish it. With so many characters who have nothing to say and plot the elements that come out of nowhere or nowhere, this movie really was not one movie and would be better as a short series or probably two movies. If you like this type of typical story, you may like it, but to be honest, I was spoiled for much more creative stories that have something to convey. Go hire a Miyazaki movie and watch it twice, get more.
