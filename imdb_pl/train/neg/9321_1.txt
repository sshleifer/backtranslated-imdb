I rented this movie about 4-5 years ago and I was disappointed immediately. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see a shorter movie in the style of b-movie, but it ended up being faeces for my eyes. Acting was similar to watching dry grass. I've seen better acting in the softcore movie ... <br /> <br /> The idea that a crazy killer appears out of nowhere has surprised me. What was the horror? <br /> <br /> the production value of this movie was ridiculous at best. There was no fear. It looked like a high school student got a new camera for Christmas. The plot was everywhere, if it existed. If you're bored looking for a bad horror movie to rent, skip this one. There are a lot of better b movies there.
