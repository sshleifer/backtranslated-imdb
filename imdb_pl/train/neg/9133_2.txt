This is a strictly reviewable pilot episode that appears on DVD. <br /> <br /> Television moved out of my life in 1981, so I never followed the series or any part of it - which means I'm immune to the nostalgic charm that Moonlighting seems to have for most reviewers. <br /> <br /> (Possible warning spoiler) <br /> <br /> Pilot Moonlighting is your primary "cave meets the spear", where the "charming" red-skinned man manipulates the wrong woman to realize what she really wants and need. The premises on which the script's 'joke' was based must have been out of date around 1950. They also contain some bad inscriptions, like in the scene where Maddie storms equipment instead of shooting at the villain, strictly in order to prove to herself that the woman needs male help. <br /> <br /> I often feel that Susan Faludi is overreacting when she sees a male chauvinistic conspiracy in simple entertainment, but in this particular case I'm with her all - Moonlighting is wearing BACKLASH. <br /> <br /> In a sense, however, this DVD is a must for all serious fans of Bruce Willis: in addition to the pilot episode, it includes a screen test that landed on Willis. Both features show how incredibly Willis' performance developed between 1985 and 1988/89 (Die Hard 1, In Country). Impressive! <br /> <br /> Rating (and I am a fan of Bruce Willis): 2 out of 10
