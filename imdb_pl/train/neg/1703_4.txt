A veterinarian from Vietnam decides to take over the city with electricity and amok, and anyone who stands in his way will be eliminated (including women). Released for the cinema just before "A Star Is Born", which turned his career, this action drama Mishmash with the participation of Kris Kristofferson is madly detached, mindless and crazy. Filmed in Simi Valley, California, the results are really inappropriate, with kitschy stereotypes and mindless violence making up most of the script by director George Armitage. Armitage collected the most interesting cast from the seventies for his film, including Jan-Michael Vincent, Victoria Principal, Bernadette Peters and, in a sense, Loni Anderson; however, Kristofferson is at the center of the whole matter, which is harsh and rude. He deserves points, which I consider to be a completely unpleasant drive-in thriller, but bad vibrations (and ridiculous climax) cover the whole project like an ugly spot. * 1/2 of ****
