Saint Sh * t was a terrible god. I sat in the theater for an hour and ten minutes and thought I would dig my eyes in the estate of Oedipus Rex. dear God. this film does not deserve more than anything that a high school movie fan did. save money, this movie offers nothing. unless you like shows from the side and you are sleeping in cinemas. you know, h3ll, bring your girlfriend and make things interesting. you will be the only one anyway. F @ ck this slide show. <br /> <br /> Ye Be Warned. <br /> <br /> I recommend that you do not watch this. <br /> <br /> hello. <br /> <br /> how are you? <br /> <br /> I'm pretty good. <br /> <br /> enjoying this day? <br /> <br /> I am. <br /> <br /> this comment was a hundred times more fun than pretending to watch this movie. it is sad.
