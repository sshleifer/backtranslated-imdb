I knew that from the moment we met, it was not between me and the D-wars. At first his title was lazy. War D. How writing the Dragon was too much for them. Besides ... you really can not be so blatant by your title unless your Blue Monkey. Blue Monkey can do everything he wants, damn it. <br /> <br /> The second sign of the rocky relationship between us was the crazy progression of the story. Here is a movie, a dreamy reporter who reports on huge snake songs, flashes until he and dad were traveling to what must have been a competition for a gremlin store, and a dreamy children's reporter finds a box that shines. The old store reveals some scary truths. That Bauraki, the allegedly evil snake, was deceived because of his chance of being a god. tells the child that he is an embodied warrior and that somewhere in LA he is his reborn lover and gives him jewelery from rubbish. The store also retains that despite its obvious white, it is 500 years old Asian. <br /> <br /> Fifteen years later a dreamy reporter remembers that perfectly well and starts acting like crazy trying to find this random girl. cgi hijinks are going, and in the last ten minutes my brain is melting in my nose. Why? Continue, dear reader, if you have Balls. <br /> <br /> so Sarah, a resurrected lover, has her own memories. I have the advantage of having the best friend from Asia, and on the stage where he starts going crazy and making posters with Asian characters, he tells me that whoever made this film has no idea what he is doing. This is a Korean legend and has been revived from a Korean princess, but everything is in Chinese. Later that night her tat dragon begins to hurt, calls the police, because it looks like she has a heart attack. You see, in this crazy crazy world they seem to deal with heart attacks differently, because the next time we see her, she's locked in her room with the guard outside and the nurse says she's crazy. I have a new phobia now and that is, if I ever get in trouble, the first rescuers will assume I'm crazy. <br /> <br /> I have another point of contention with my strict mistress, Dwar. There is a scene in which Patrick Dempsey Jr. (Dreamy Reporter) is in a cafe with a black friend Sassy. In the scenes preceding the Miffed Near divinity, Bauraki killed an elephant, slipped through the suburb, and killed one of Sarah's friends. You see, people were afraid to go out after 9-11, but we had to get stronger after decisive coffee and cakes were worth the risk to our lives. Business as usual, in no way a gigantic snake will stop me from switching on my caffeine. If I stay inside and I am afraid for my life, the terrorists and the serpent deities win. <br /> <br /> After receiving a satisfying dragon in battle on a helicopter, my cruel lover Dwar treats me on the stage pi $$ and filled with vinegar to finish it all. Bauraki has her own fortress, and her right under LA. They really do not say, but Dreamy Reporter and Sarah are knocked out in a car accident that will kill smaller men and when they wake up, just like a dragon of a palace. some delayed dialogue later a good god of the dragon snake jumps out of nowhere and snakes fight / love anything. And I'm not joking about a good snake from nowhere. Maybe you think I'm dumping it disproportionately, I'm not there, there's no mention of it in the movie, and then suddenly ... there! A few seconds later, a good dragon becomes a god of dragons, lights Baurki, Sarah turns into a ghost and goes with the god of dragons, a dreamy reporter left in the middle of nowhere credit ... thank God <br /> <br /> Now our relationship is so rocky as good times. There was a guy who looked like a turtle destroyer and talked exactly like a Tuscan striker from a star wars. I'll call him Tuskan Shredder. He could do what he wanted whenever he wanted to never be useful. He could go through the wall in a scene where it was not helpful. He could go into his dreams when it would not do anything, and he would light ten random soldiers in the fire, but not when it mattered. He was also allergic to touching this jewelry. I like him because he was hit twice by the car in the same scene and gave fantastic sounds to the invaders. <br /> <br /> The actors were mostly great ... if the great ones somehow meant horrible. Jason Behr, about whom I thought he was amazing in Roswell, I'm slowly discovering, can only work one way, and this is pretentious, smart and Patrick Dempsey "ish". <br /> <br /> The only thing I love about this filthy prostitute is Dwars, her main actor, Bauraki. This huge serpent came out of his heart. I dare say that he was better at playing in the snake demi of the god of evil, and John Barrymore played Richard III or Hamlet. Emotions appeared in every scene, stealing thunder from his smaller, deadly cast. When he ate an elephant, I felt like no one in the past, present or future had ever eaten an elephant with the same feeling. He was more than an actor, he was a force of nature and he put heart and soul into every second of this damned project. Hell, my favorite actor in this movie was the CGI snake. I have balls to admit it, right? <br /> <br /> I hope Bauraki will get more work, not a type cast that Jason Behr finds a range of emotions other than a sleepy look, and that I never have to see the Blue Monkey anymore. <br /> <br /> So D-War is over. I want my CDs to come back and be friends
