By the way, it captures part of the plot. Charlie Brown Christmas is one of those timeless classics that teach you the values ​​of Christmas and enjoy the holidays. However, it is not. Trying to capture the emotions associated with A Charlie Brown Christmas, there is even another Christmas game, but it fails with boring and easy jokes. Charlie Brown no longer wonders about the spirit of Christmas, but instead wants to buy a gift for Peggy Jean ($ 25 gloves ... what?). His sister Sally is the most annoying figure in the movie. Here's one of her jokes: Sally wants to write a letter to Santa, but he does not know how to spell Charlie (for some reason she must be in her letter), so he decides to call him Sam instead, because he knows how to spell Sam. In addition, Sally plays an angel in art in a word: "Hark!" Instead, he says a hockey stick (har har). If Sally says 12 times (everything sounds strange exactly the same), he will not kill you, nothing will be. Peppermint Patty and Marcy are a big focal point, but it does not make it better. Marcy is funny with her answers to Patty, but Patty is a different story. Sounds like a boy (who does not dispel gossip) and rages when he must be a sheep in the game (terrible baas and everything). Apparently, every year she is a sheep and worries that she will forget about her lines (lines that she does not have). She is so worried that she mentions it twice, one by one, and receives the same answer. I assume that he must have a short-term loss of memory or something. Lucy and Linus are more welcome (although Linus still has annoying advice), but it does not matter much. I'm sure Schroeder is not even in it. In summary, she tries to be a parasite of the original, but compromised the news for a few quick laughter.
