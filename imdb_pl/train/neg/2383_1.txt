This is the candidate for the most disappointing movie experience of my life. Nice title, excellent director (previously I saw "To Die For" and "Drugstore Cowboy") and hey - Uma Thurman in the cast. How can you be wrong? Well, that question shook in my temples for hours after seeing this turkey. <br /> <br /> Disappointed and unpalatable, trying to be uncommon, this is a dead zone of the film, which should be avoided at all costs. His critical warning was well deserved. You have here one of those rare films that do not contain a single, saving quality. Zero with ****.
