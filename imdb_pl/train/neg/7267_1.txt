This film is simply too long, too repetitive, with male nudity and sexuality (as it is called gay with my own collection of adult titles) is definitely too free and unnecessary. Most of the first third of the movie could be shortened to ten minutes and it was equally effective without any patience (and endurance) of the audience. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie early on Saturday afternoon with the audience of the film festival; a type of crowd that tends to be more adventurous, interested in more experimental or unusual films, for example, without much dialogue, short films, foreign films. A crowd selling around 275 theaters began to dribble in the first half of the movie, and while most decided on a "payout" (which never arrived), never, in about 14 years, ever participated in many film, experimental, gay and other festivals. they have seen such a large number of people leaving the film. <br /> <br /> This movie could easily be reduced by more than half and was as effective as it was. He could also go in different directions, still with a shorter duration of action and was much more effective. <br /> <br /> In its present shape, it is not something that can be easily recommended or one that I could have a desire to see again.
