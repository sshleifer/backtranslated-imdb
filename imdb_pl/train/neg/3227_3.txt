This is part of the well-known Guinea Pig series. A short-lived Japanese television program that was canceled after the psychopath admitted that he was inspired by the murder of a young student during the concert. This short series is, like all other movies in this series, with virtually no history. A group of guys caught a young woman. They attach it and begin to torture her to death while filming. They beat her, poured her with boiling oil, used pliers, and finally, in a "loving" close-up, they pushed the needle into her eye. This is the simplest of all Guinea Pig films and one of the first. Probably the film, more than any of the others, gave Guinea Pig a rumor about the tabace. They certainly inspired the film "8 mm" by Nicolas Cage. These films have become very popular in horror circles. They went to more refined, but also graphic films, such as "Naked Blood". They probably fill the emptiness of Mondo films, which have been cleaned up a little and have become a television reality. Not recommended, but it will probably attract those who will see something sometime, and I wonder why then, I know I will.
