I was expecting a French B-Movie musical. In the end, Dhéry, Blanche, DeFunès were superstars of the low-budget French films of that time. And it's in color! But I have hallucinations in this incredible hour of 30 pure mediocrity. Musical numbers are terrible, and the comedy is absolutely boring and stupid. And songs? What songs? This is just another number of bad numbers, one after the other. The only very rare thing about this is the nakedness of women. At that time, it was not known. In fact, some numbers are just to show us a topless woman. It contributes to mediocrity! And try to find the young Michel Serrault, the future great actor of the French cinema, in part as a musician, in his first film. Good luck!
