I rented Hybrid over the weekend. What a disappointment! A silly, lame attempt at a television movie. The guy they got for the lead was completely weak, and when he was running (he did a lot), he looked like he was eating the mint sweets ... with his back! The contacts with the wolf he wore were great, although I think that the actor rely too much on them because nothing at all threatened his actions. The wise chicks of American Indians must be one of the hardest hard witches ever seen. Talk about a sour cow! She smiled once for the whole movie and I think it was because she had sex. The sex scene was also bad. They could as well show blown curtains if you can kick it. <br /> <br /> At the end, and this is my great hatred for pets, in the cover and DVD menu, the losers digitally pulled cool sharp teeth on the guy. They were not anywhere in the movie. :(
