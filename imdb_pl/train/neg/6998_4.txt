Hollywood has always had problems with reconciliation with the "religious image." Strange Cargo turns out to be no exception. A film using the talents of a great cast and produced on the highest budget, with the appropriate mood photography of Robert Planck, the film does not pass the credibility test. Perhaps because the film seems so realistic that the sudden intrusion of fantasy elements disturbs the viewer's involvement in the action and the fate of the character. It was difficult for me to sit motionless through all imaginary metaphors, parallels and biblical references, and I could not accept the contented-pleased Ian Hunter as everything Christ did. And censors in Boston, Detroit and Providence at least agreed with me. The film was banned. Niewielu widz√≥w z Bostonu / Detroit / Providence complained or traveled to other cities because it was obvious from the trailer that Gable and Crawford somehow got involved in the "picture of the news". He came everywhere. <br /> <br /> Strangely, the film enjoys a revival on television. The home atmosphere makes the allegory of the film more open to viewers. However, despite the growing reputation of a strange or unusual movie, the plot of this strange cargo flows in accordance with predictable, highly moralistic lines that no one will guess how the main characters will eventually reconcile with their destiny.
