It's simply the worst movie I've ever seen. The range varies from 2 hours, and the box art was completely misleading. My friends and I hired him because we thought he would be a poor man 300. You know, laugh and joke. No. There is nothing funny in this film, just pain. Then the movie starts and they speak a different language. We think: "Oh, that's just the beginning." But no, from there the film drops sharply and becomes a more boring book that had to be read in primary school, where nothing literally happens for hours, and battle scenes compete with the scenes of 2 children fighting on the playground. Skip the cinematography, and this film belongs to the garbage compactor. Such films will lead to the world we see in Wall-E, which by the way was a good movie.
