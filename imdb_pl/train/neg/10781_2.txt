In fact, it has never been this way. I'm not sure why Billy Crystal wanted to play a screw comedy from the 1940s. What a slackers! None of these people approached Cary Grant, Spencer Tracy, Katherine Hepburn, etc. And today's audience is not so open to this easy mud. Writing is trivial. The reduced plot is thin and obvious. Chemistry between leading figures does not exist. It is interesting that Julia Roberts seems to think that she is the reincarnation of a great star from the "golden age of Hollywood" whenever she can be. It's an effect he tries and fails to achieve again thanks to Richard Gere at Runaway Bride.
