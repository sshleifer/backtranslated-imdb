I believed that the pace is glacial, and the original story is not proportional to the content. My wife slept most of the time and did not try to wake her up because I felt that there was nothing missing. <br /> <br /> When Holmes and Watson enter the house, and then are potentially caught, it is unclear how he could hide all of his entry and burglary tools so quickly. It is also not clear how the office door is closed, preventing the servants from entering. <br /> <br /> The thing that intrigued me was at the very end when a flash appeared in the eye of the broken statute. I have no idea what it was meant to represent.
