A prisoner bandit from a train near Yuma releases his gangster and goes to the retired sheriff responsible for killing his wife (and also a hidden store of gold, which remains hidden thanks to screenwriters). An attempt to upgrade a Western genre to violence and brutality in the style of the '70s is not even in the same league as some of the newly created westerns of the 1960s. It is impossibly simple and square, with female figures nearby as training bags and possible rape victims. As a former commanding sheriff, Charlton Heston gives one of his lazy, least inspired performances in history (he has one good moment, he tries to read the letter and rummage through his glasses). James Coburn, as half-mad half-breed, is also a largely autopilot, but Coburn has a way to transform even the craziest dialogue and situation into something prickly and annoying. It's his show all the time. * 1/2 of ****
