This is your typical Priyadarshan movie - a bunch of weird characters in some stupid mission. Its peak climax is that the entire cast of the film meets and fights in some crazy cinema over hidden money. Regardless of whether it is a winning lottery ticket for the Malamaal Weekly, black money in Hera Pheri, "kodokoo" in Phir Hera Pheri, etc., the director becomes ridiculously predictable. Do not get me wrong; as stereotypical and absurd may be his films, I usually end up enjoying comedy. However, in most of his previous films, there was good humor (Hungama and Hera Pheri are noteworthy). Now the cheerfulness of his films disappears because he still uses the same formula. <br /> <br /> The songs are good. Tanushree Datta looks amazing. Rajpal Yadav is annoying, and Tusshar is not much better. Kunal Khemu is doing well and Sharman Joshi is the best.
