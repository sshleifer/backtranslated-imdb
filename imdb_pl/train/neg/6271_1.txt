There are no words to explain how bad WEEKEND NIGHTMARE is. It just eludes the description. Something about a computer that can change personal items into silver bullets that come into the mouths of victims, which kills them or turns into zombies. The whole thing is so damn it's stunning. There is also a girl with a personal computer in the room, and the computer is talking through a puppet !!!!!!!! I do not do this. The computer also controls things like cars, even though there is nothing connecting the computer to the vehicle. <br /> <br /> "Film" is total rubbish. Surreal bad trash. Spectacular, one of a kind bad basket. Here and there are many sex scenes that are not too hot or erotic. There is even one scene in which a woman seemingly loves or wants to kiss a French tarantula that made me roll on the floor. <br /> <br /> Definitely one of the worst movies ever made. There, with the equally unfortunate video BOARDINGHOUSE or BOOGEYMAN II (both NIGHTMARE WEEKEND and BOOGEYMAN II have scenes with a killer toothbrush!). At least it's nice to watch it and try to understand what's going on.
