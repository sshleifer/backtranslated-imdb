I will be dumb and on the subject. This movie is not good at all. The movie part hated acting, script, storytelling, directing and almost all editions. Amanda Peet has proven that she can act because it was the highlight of The Whole Nine Yards. She should have avoided this movie with a ten-foot pole. However, the infantile part of me found this movie very funny. If you can forget about how poor the quality of production is, and if ridicule jokes are funny to you, you should be okay. And for those who can not get off the pedestal, this is your choice. My inner child did not die, and I laughed a little. Even then, only 3 out of 10, because it really stinks as a movie.
