When I was 11, Grease 2 was like a crack. It was a classless, disgraceful, euphoric and highly addictive experience. My sister and I watched it, rewound it, and watched it again and again until we lost consciousness or become too confused and hostile towards each other. So if you're an 11-year-old girl and you rated this movie as "brilliant" or "funny" or "better than the original Grease", you blame your young fledgling hormones and you can be sure that this relentless fixation with complete trash will pass. <br /> <br /> If you are not a little girl, you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that Grease 2 was something other than inept, flawless, thoughtless embarrassment for all who participated in its production, distribution and / or consumption. <br /> <br /> Because of the critics, I will now honor this film, explaining why it blows? <br /> <br /> 1. In a well-made musical, songs should develop narration or develop characters. In Grease 2, with a few exceptions, music is obscenely useless. Most of the songs seem to relate to the recorded innuendo about sex in excessive and general way ("Score Tonight", "Reproduction", "Do It For Our Country" and "Prowlin")), without one specific statement about any of the characters in the film or topics. Plus, all the music is uncomfortable stupid and no one in the cast shows even the most primitive abilities to sing and dance. <br /> <br /> 2. Birds T should be bad, and if not at least a bit nice, then each of them is an annoying loser. Finally, when Johnny Nogerelli offers Michael the T-bird's holy jacket and initiates him to the gang, Michael should kick him to the ground, spit on him and leave, so that he can scrub every part of the body that has been touched by him. But of course he accepts it as if it were gold, because despite the fact that they are a bunch of inept meat-eaters, there is no greater honor than being one with T-birds. <br /> <br /> 3. Because Michael is beautiful, wise, kind, resourceful and above-average in every way (regardless of his musical impotence), it is possible that Stephanie will finally embrace him when he reveals himself as a man behind the mask. Stephanie, on the other hand, is a sloppy, loose jaw, hitting chewing gum, dirty sweatshirt, brazen rude and tacky dingbat. So besides being pretty (I think), there are no nice qualities, so the audience has no reason for the depth of Michael's train to her. <br /> <br /> I could continue and continue, but I did not want to mention a glaring inferiority to my predecessor, because there are apparently so many weirdoes who seem to feel that such a comparison is unfair. I will tell you, however, to those who think you want to go back to this mess because of the old days: Grease 2 is an experience similar to the re-experience of your first kiss. Only you are now 32 years old and you are kissing a 13-year-old brat with acne and slob braces. The magic has gone away, and you feel dirty and disturbed. Trust me.
