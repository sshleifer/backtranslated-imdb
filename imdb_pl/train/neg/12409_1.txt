And it comes from someone who can stand almost ANY watching. Operation and sound are terrible. It may be "so bad that it's a good" merit point for some. However, I take my horror movies seriously and it is simply bullshit - it's just very cheap, I think it's my main complaint. Dialogue is often a comic remark about how many times it "surprised me". The actress of the "child" is seriously a terrible god - I pray that her acting career will end here ... the line "DONUTS! And HATE DONUTS "is worth repeating.
