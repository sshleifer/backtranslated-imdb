Come on! Come to Pakistani banging guys. Bollywood can not only make great films, but can seriously affect the generation of viewers. <br /> <br /> I am a HUGE Bollywood fan - but anti-pakistani films just force me to shout too much to enjoy the script, cinematography, action sequences - everything. <br /> <br /> I am really happy that viewers on both sides of the border reject propaganda, and there are movies like Main Hoon Na, which did a great job not only because they deserved the quality of Bollywood masala - but also because he is trying to say: give a chance to peace and shows that on both sides there are madmen who do not represent the masses.
