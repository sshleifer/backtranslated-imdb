I'm not a big fan of roms / comics in the best of times. A few of them were pretty good (checking Dream for an Insomniac), but this one is just the same, but less. <br /> <br /> With a duration of 100min, I expect more than 1 laugh every 30 minutes. The only real belly laugh is that strange men and friends instinctively help Lee's character. <br /> <br /> All I can say is AVOID. I guarantee that there are at least 10 other films on the shelf that you deserve $$ <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 (and only because I'm a big fan of Lee)
