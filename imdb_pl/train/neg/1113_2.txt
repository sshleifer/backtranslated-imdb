Hopalong Cassidy with a horse that is not white and is not called Topper? Go figure! <br /> <br /> This travesty makes great injustice to the greatest of all cowboy heroes, Hopalong Cassidy. The actor who plays in it is young compared to the old, blond in comparison with white hair and kills people instead of shooting a gun. Will the real Hopalong rise! <br /> <br /> One of the worst films ever made and believe it or not, by the person who brought us the grandfather's saga!
