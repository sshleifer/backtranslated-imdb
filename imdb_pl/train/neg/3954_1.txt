ALL FILM is a flashback from Boogeyman's first film, and inexplicably from another Uli Lommel / Suzanna Love Brainwaves movie. It is bound in a more current (from the early 90's) material that is boring, poorly made and cheap. The film is not only almost completely retrospective, but it REPEATs the same flashbacks throughout the film. So you see the recycled material over and over again, as if you have not seen it anymore. As if the originals were not bad enough. I've never seen a film so padded ... Somebody milked the last dollar from these movies. Total stripping. And talk about the completion ... why do I have to write 10 lines about this basket? If I can tell you it's junk in 2 lines, that should be enough.
