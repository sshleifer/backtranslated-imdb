"A Bugs Life" is like a favorite candy bar - full of great little bits to add up something really delicious. <br /> The story is not good; It is intelligent, "heart" (emotion), and each character has a nice "arc" (growth or change). In comparison, "Toy Story" in "Toy Story" in "Toy Story" is just a toy that learns, and Buzz learns his hatred of Woody's love. "A Bug's Life" has tons of smiles and beautiful moments. <br /> <br /> This solemn image "10" can not be easily dismissed, but certainly this film deserves "10".
