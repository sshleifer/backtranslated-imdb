It is good to see that the Vintage Film Buffet correctly classifies their excellent DVD release as a "musical" because the film is pure and simple. Un-Sheridan, Lucy Ball, Beryl Wallace, Gwenian Gill, Gladys Young, Barbara Fritzie, Wanda Perry and Dorothy White for an extraordinary remake, Murder at the Windmill (1949), a murder storyline window with an exquisite girl appearance with Carlisle and Gertrude Michel. Carl Brisson also has to give his strong voice to "Cocktail for Two". It is undoubtedly the most popular song of the film is less than four times. However, it stole the show Gertrude Michel, her character of "Sweet Marijuana", as well as her strong performance as the hero's rejected girlfriend. For the rest of the cast, we were able to do without Jack Oke and Victor McLaglen. The only good thing about the Oakie character is the Cult Icon, the Toby Wing is his weaker running comic. In fact, comedy is overly tired and very stressed, Super Mute Inspector McLaglenen can not put his hand on the killer, but in this case you are the most suspicious person. Director Mitch Liesen actually goes to great pain to show the killer as an active member of the film audience.
