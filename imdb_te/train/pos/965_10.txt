Yoko Monsters: Spooke Warfare (Yoki Daisenso, 2005) is a film about "Yoko" or folk traditional Japanese "monsters". It is called the Big Monster War or the Ghosts in the Parade. <br /> <br /> The Yoki Teapot Freak, Kappa Water Impump, Life 'Bella, a Shekas, a woman with a second face behind her head, a troll priest with a wallet like a huge pulp, etc. in the first installment. <br /> <br /> Unlike the miracle of this kind of weird monsters, Toggava can be compared with Era's summer holidays, compared with today's Halloween hunters, or "Freak shows", but with particular fraudulent distraction. Ghosts & goldfish monsters and dancing A headman umbrellas are eager to create "chills" in the summer. Depending on the demons filmed in medieval scrolls, some women and fads, while their design for the film is a bit simpler, it makes historically more restorative for the summer winters. <br /> <br /> Unlike this, the Babylonian vampire demon comes to Japan and disguises as samurai. Even though Japanese etiquette is a bit bit of goofy, and a lot of costumes than masks without moving lips, it is very much played poker-facing & very beautiful. It has the most beautiful cinematography in the CGI film of the same decade. <br /> <br /> Yoshiuki Kuroda also directed the famous Loan Wolf & Cub: White Heaven & Hell (1974) & Director and Special FX. Director for the Excellent Diamond Trio. The Yokoye Monsters series is not the best of the majestic, but Yoko is very happy. The first Mike film to be child-oriented in his family films with GOZU & IZOO, even worse for younger audiences.
