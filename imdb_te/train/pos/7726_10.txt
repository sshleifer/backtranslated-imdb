I've always been disappointed that most of the science-fiction films are really rock stars, or war dramas. Star Wars is also one of its central films, a futuristic "straight-shooted gang." <br /> While about 600 people are coming on conventional weapons, many of them have an open shot, they will miss. <br /> I've read a lot of science fiction. Planet, banned at the beginning of the genre, is still the best. The story is based on a long-diverged civilization, Crawl, who created machines that could increase any intelligence by Quantum Leap. Unfortunately, they are not bargains, other than brain intellectual ideas. The primordial angle of the brain, such as Freud, is called it, which is permitted to be ignored. It was released in sleep, the evil dream of the body. Walter Pigeon, Doctor. Morbius, who built his brain to this level, and built the machines and protections that continue with just one step over the horrors of his own mind. His thoughts are creating horrors he will not be able to rescue soon. Krely, a superior race, can not stop it; It has destroyed them. The landing party has never been interested in me. The rest of the actors can change. Un Francis is pretty and innocent, and has produced quite a response in the fifties of the females. Her father's worship is her innocence and Wolfe Fifty astronauts (such as construction work rather than real astronauts). They are always trying to identify "dams". Cook is a great character for Hooch for his role. Although Mr. Spock is not a soulmatic for the literary idea of ​​this artificial creature, Robbie Robot has a lot more personality than most crew and has a wonders. The whole picture is very satisfying because the situation is star. Morbius can not turn back and he is determined to destroy him and destroy everything with him. Some science fiction movies are worth more than once; It is the boundary of the 21st century.
