I bought "The Feast of All Saints", this is not really a horrible film, but many things are good. Most historic value has been played with very talented actresses / actors, and it is not everyday probable that the actors play such a role and it is somewhat reliable. There are some parts that are slightly mediocre and confusing, but I can not say the whole movie is terrible. After you think about it, it's harder to capture the New Orleans of 1800, making it one of the most difficult, and making it difficult to get those parts to recognize the actors. But the biggest problem I have with the movie is that the actors who play free colors are mostly light-skinned Africans. One of the old creole generalizations still exists. Although many creoys were colorful, the cast was very wide for anyone when it came to cast. One of the actors who seemed to be near white is more thoughtful. The actors worked great, the script might be better written, and overall I found the performances were quite believable.
