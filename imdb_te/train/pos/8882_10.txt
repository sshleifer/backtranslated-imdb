<br /> <br /> Before Black Buster Varnes, like John Singleton's best-of-the-kind film, Shaft Remake, the storyline is a notable film with significant performance and excellent balance between the three main characters. It has a problem of nature between blacks, mostly largely ignored by the media and other films, which represent social and economic issues and whites. The film shows that blacks are innocent and racist. <br /> <br /> The amazing thing about this film is that it deals with many elements. It's not about racism, but how hard it is to know the new world (college), date rape, sexuality and loneliness. Omar Eps, Michael Rapaport and Christie Swanson give everyone good performances and a supporting cast is a minor league with Jennifer Connelly, a league (Yaya) and college booms with ice cube and busta rimes. <br /> <br /> <p> Lawrence Fischer ("Peppermit?") is the only opposite of Professor's irony. Certainly, many professors are silent. But they're not flat. Skin Heads are also a bit of an irony, but I guess they are like real life. <br /> If you like American History X, <br /> <br /> 10 to 8,5
