'The Mother' is an extraordinary piece of filmmaking - you think, what the punches are pulling - and finally you're thinking. Much of the function of the main character is opened. Anne Reed (I know only briefly from her roles in some Victoria Wood-led projects and considered a fine comedian) is really amazing here. Marriage and motherhood is not a stereotypical widow housewife that is perfect at all. And at first it's not all free-spirited and adventurous. The rings are true (well, it made me) the right note plays his role. Powerful cast. Great script. The revival of the European cinema is actually;)
