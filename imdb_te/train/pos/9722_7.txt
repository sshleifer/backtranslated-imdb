Simon Pegg plays a piece of a teenage entertainer, Sydney Young, who began a professional writing novel for a grassrock magazine featuring the evil and fame of the rich and famous. He wants to be a prominent figure, however, he has pursued a career as a celebrity from celebrities. The film is based on Taib Young's immense career, which he called a modern magazine in modern review in Britain, which was criticized by many as well as his magazine in the postponement of the sound bullets and then went to an exceptionally unsuccessful career as a writer for Vanity Fair, Much of this is said in the film. <br /> He initially thrilled to work for mainstream publication (called Sharpe Magazine in the film), and he was positive on his first day, despite the nervous nerves. He is the chief editor, Clayton Harding (played by Jeff Bridges), as hard as nails but correctly editing, he needs to keep his job in a magazine like Young. He provides little with Young's instant acceptance, but he is described only as a liberal endurance of Young's off-the-wall criticism and inappropriate behavior. <br /> <br /> The humor in the film is remarkable in dealing with Young's misunderstanding or the generally accepted code of public conduct and the rich and famous. But he believes that he hates the entire popular culture for acting in such a whimsical way and for giving outwardly offensive interviews and he feels confident in those old-fashioned words? <br /> <br /> There are two different women who complicate these things. Alison has a beautiful, casual girl. Sydney's apparent pride and women's paths, and Sophie (Megan Fox), an excellent model, originally frightened by Olsen (Kirsten Dunst), Sydney's best attack, it's true , But she does not have a single idea to curl around her head, Alison is not an ordinary girl, very interesting or attractive, but Dunst Her acting has made her a real person, a relationship with her has all the realism of a Britney Spears marriage, and the film has some confidence because of how it is clear [<br /> <br /> <br / > "ow to lose friends and the people of Eliot have a pretty interesting campus and are filled with honest and satisfying performances Danny Huston, for example, alike's other love interest, like The Big Leaves (also hanging on him), with White White, one of my personal favorite drinks, is one of my personal favorite drinks, Politely pay. In China here full and kahlua is equivalent to $ 350, but my kitchen is without them. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to the day I left Simone Pegg to love his pictures but I'm not fully aware of his range. He played a fierce role in Hot Fuzz, but only seriously involved in the death of his surroundings, in the end he saved himself, how he lost the Dead, Run, Fat Boy, Run, and Friends. He will be interesting star to see what he can do.
