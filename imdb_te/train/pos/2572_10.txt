I thought it was a very funny movie. I love dog movies and funny movies so they are twice better combined. K-9, k-911, and k-9 PI are my favorite movies. Jim Belushi crazy and Jerry Lee is hilarious and adorable they make a great team. I did not really understand how to die for my wife. She died before this film but how? If they say, I missed them. Besides, I will give two thumbs / tails! Those dogs (Jerry Lee and Zeus) must have a lot of training. They were very funny and Doolie talked to him and all the sounds were funny as Jerry Lee. Jerry Lee is my favorite singing song and he bites many people's privileges to get the most funny lulls
