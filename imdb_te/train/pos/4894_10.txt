I grew up with the music in this movie. What a wonderful time for music and dance! My only complaint is that I was too young to go to USO and nightclubs. I feel like living in the past, (I have wonderful memories) so what's wrong with it? World War II is a terrible time, except for music. Glenn Miller's death was a terrible sadness for us. This film is my favorite. Cleo Lyny is awesome; What a voice! I do not know how I lost this movie. My main reason for this comment is alert to the modern generation as a substitute for rap and new age music. Please give this opportunity a chance!
