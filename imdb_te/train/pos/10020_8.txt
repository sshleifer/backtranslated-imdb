The legendary Boris Karlof finished his career by creating four inexpensive scary clinics in Mexico. The Gothic horror entry from this token mood period bunch. Carlofe gives a distinctly witty and respectful performance in an elderly extraordinary character named Mastieys Morvall, who invites his relatives, his small, greedy and back-up no relatives, who have little space for his readiness to read. Pretty soon blunt off the lethal life-sized toy people who populate the place of hateful guests. Actress of "Tintorera" Mexican Sex Symbol Andrass Garcia plays the role of the police officer in Dashing and Julissa looks completely ravishing the role of a single woman. The worst, drama, script, ugly, washed cinematography, pieces of humorous set pieces (a macro fat slab burst in the face through a small cannon!), Tired string score, cartilage dark-doom atmosphere, mostly lousy acting (excluding carloff), cheesy Mild gore, poor dubbing and exciting blazing end all this cheerful awful The feminine is somewhat of a pre-crude and rarely entertained gemstone. The real campy owl.
