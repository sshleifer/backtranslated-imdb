Johann Fontine was the "Dansel in Destress" starring Fred Astier, George Burns, and Gracie Allen in 1937. <br /> <br /> The film, directed by George Stevens, is a British woman (Phoenine) in love with an American mistaken for Astererer having some excellent Gershwin music, including "Nice Work It You Get It" and "A Fuzzy Day." <br /> <br /> In this film, the voice of the singer is more rigid than the others, and he has a wonderful couple. Dance numbers. Barnes plays his role as a top campaigner and is Alan Burns' secretary. She is happy. This problem, as others have said, is Fondine who dances with Astier at the end of the film. Stevens easily used the double because he would perform a long shot and dance between the trees. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth seeing despite its money.
