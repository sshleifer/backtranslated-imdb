Why do you want to know why John Amos left this show, how he died again at the show? I do not relate to everything, but sometimes it hit home with the problems they are facing. By the way, they have always made it from the ghetto? I think the episode with black Jesus is my favorite. We've experienced some good times. Something that they do not quite often. I brought back the show. People can really see in the daytime. I do not think it's a movie or a new performance work. Without the original cast. They really make good times good times. These are my questions and comments. Thank you !!
