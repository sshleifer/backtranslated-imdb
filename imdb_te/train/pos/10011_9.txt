I enjoyed the Night Listener. This is one of the best films of summer. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams offers one of his best performances. In fact, the whole cast is good. All played the right notes for their characters - not too high and not too low. Sandra Oh adds a wonderful funny touch. Tony is as big as burning, and is always up there. It's very believable for everyone. <br /> It's an hour and a half, under an hour and a half. I saw that the general release version was nine minutes less than the Sundance version. <br /> <br /> The director told a story and made a straightforward fashion, this is from many directors to their thoughts these days. <br /> <br /> Tell the audience not only to tell the story but tell the story well. <br /> You can not punk through previews and ads. This is not a Hitchcakia thriller. See The Night Listener You wanted to see a good story. <br /> <br /> If you look forward to Hitchcock you will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> My only complaint with this film is ending. Some of the director's invention has been left, but this is a small quest.
