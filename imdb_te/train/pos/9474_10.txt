I got to see this movie at a preview and it was dazzled. This is not a simple romantic comedy. I could hardly remember laughing in a movie and moved through it. The laughs are not gagging here - they are observations, recognition laughs, "Oh, my God, I think it's the only person I feel!" I will give you a story telling me that I'm falling in love with "Friends of Love". The whole family plays a role in the relationship here. Maybe the best combination of laughter and warmth is "when you're sleeping." <br /> <br /> Steve Karel goes far deeper than he has gone before, and for the first time I really liked him. The cast is amazing, I have a list of leading theater actors who loved other roles, but they blend to make a loyal family. Diane's whistleblower, Juliet Binocch is bright and hilarious (she's funny?), And whale Don Cooke gives a warm, quiet, touching performance. The Sondre Lerche soundtrack is an excellent addition, and I'll buy the CD second available. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this one.
