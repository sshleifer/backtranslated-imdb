I was working in the library and thought I would like this film 5 years ago. Well I loved Parker Posey (she is an amazing actress) and Omar Townsend is really cute with her boyfriend (he does not act but when you look like him) but the movie is bad. It's not funny or beautiful or anything too much. Posey kept her powered image. But she learned the Dewey Decimal System Overtime and later unveiled the bookstore store stores for music beat? Come on! Moreover, when she became a full-time librarian at the end, I had a problem to see - bun, glasses, and jokes - can we go to that stereotype? Worth the value for Posey and Townsend but about it. The TV series is very good.
