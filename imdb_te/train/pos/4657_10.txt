Hot million is a great image in every way. A fun, open story with four excellent performances of outstanding professionals working in the business. Peter Ustinov, as brilliant as usual, and Maggie Smith --- is definitely one of the greatest actresses of all time --- the whole joy. Karl Malden and Bob Newhart cast out the cast and are also perfect. If you want an image that has accurate casting, this is it. So impressive is the way people work off each other in such a natural and effortless way, creating lots of laughs and fun moments throughout. Peter Ustinov is a genius with an incredible comedy, one of his most memorable performances. Directing, photography and editing is also the first-rate, and it's London's great time capsule in the '60s. This is definitely on my all-time favorite list.
