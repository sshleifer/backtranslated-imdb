It is one of the most honest and touching boy-meets-girl-films ever made. "Rebel Without A Cause" and "Say Anything" While giving good pictures, these films strip down the useless subplots and Hollywood divergences. This film focuses entirely on watching a beautiful romance junior. This film will lead to the romantic pair of these two people. You can instantly understand the integrity and chemistry between Jesse and Celine and have the pleasure of seeing them to find them. This movie is mostly dialogue-based. But every conversation between them is amazing. How true this pair makes it romantic. You can see that in any conversation, complicated and without any real conversation, you can be more ambitious and trusted in both of these. It dreams to meet you personally. And it's not too amazing to believe what it makes truth. It happens if you are confident that you can strike a conversation with the person randomly. And puts the icing on the film. It adds to the concept of romantic nirvana that represents the image. And no matter how many times I do this film, I do not think I'm always that tire.
