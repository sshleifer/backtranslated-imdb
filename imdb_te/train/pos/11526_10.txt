I rented the film from a blockbuster in a strategy. I was like Alan Arkin and the cover was gripped ... I read it again and immediately knew I was going to be the best or worst movie ever seen ... I got lucky .. I started laughing from the beginning Alan Arkin brings great role to the film. I bought a rental copy for my own collection and I saw all the time .. I recommend this movie for people's loads and they enjoyed everything I did ... I see complaints about menus and DVDs but do not take away from the movie. Disc is the author of Blockbuster exculsivley which is why it does not allow them to skip past the previews There is a wonderful picture you see next to the Â£ .. Didier to DVD.
