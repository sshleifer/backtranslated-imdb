This movie is a must-see movie. The Congress should see this honest documentary from the views of every soldier in America. The previous critic was completely out of point - the point is to expose the truth about teaching our soldiers to kill people who are not terrorists, but live in our "enemy's" territory, and what the soldiers do. Before another person was killed or wounded, we must support our troops by bringing our troops home immediately. It also reveals that the government does not help its veterans, mentally hurt, with PTSD-post-traumatic stress disorder, or physically lost organs. Julie A. Roberts, Streamwood, IL
