This highly thought-out and carefully researched documentary covers the case of Chagos Islanders who have been expelled from their homeland by the Brigosh and American governments between 1969 and 1971. The Anglo-American policy makers have taken action because of their view that they are strategically critical strategies for controlling the Indian Ocean by estimating their territories of gas and navy power. For a time in the Cold War, newly independent post-colonial states have disappeared from the Western orbit, and the British and American officials have decided to allow the islanders to decide the fate of the islands. Instead they chose to forcibly eliminate wholesale of local population. The film did not provide any provision for ejection to the islanders, displaced Chagosian society from places where they left in Mauritius, and for a decade of persecution and encroaching housing under these new circumstances. <br /> <br /> After releasing several offensive documents from the British Public Record Office, In the months (and years), three decades   ్దాల కన్నా ఎక్కువ కాలం గడిపిన తరువాత, ఏదో ఒక తప్పు అని అనుమానిస్తుంది, మరియు ఈ పత్రాలు ఎప్పుడూ ప్రజలను తయారు చేయలేదు), బహిష్కరణలో చాగోస్సియన్ సమాజం యొక్క చట్టపరమైన విన్నపాలు ఫలితంగా బ్రిటీష్ కోర్టులు ద్వీపవాసులకు అనుకూలంగా మరియు బ్రిటీష్ రాష్ట్రానికి వ్యతిరేకంగా చూసారు. As such, surprising and disturbing conclusions made in the film can only be seen as proof. However, governments of Great Britain and the United States have so far not committed to return to the countries where the courts have resolved. It's very valuable for anyone to see, but it's an important thing to look for Britons and Americans. To be silent in the face of these facts is a complete ugly charge.
