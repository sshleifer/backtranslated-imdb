I went to film with two friends and chose this film to pick out the hat. And it turns out to be a very enjoyable, di-lounging experience! This is a very unexpected story, an incredible picture with very good dialogues and silly comedy. All the characters are clearly made in the style of "Alan Ford" (Italian satirical comedy), but I do not care for me for a second. In fact, this kind of defeat-booms lineup film is very special and interesting. Sam Rockwell gave a very good and convincing role, even though Willyn Mackay is, Clooney is rarely recognizable and intelligent. But the real star is actually Guzman. He played a role in his life in this film! His character is a sequel to the movie Cosimo, which I was happy with, it choke me and almost died with him! Highly recommended for "Alan Ford" fans!
