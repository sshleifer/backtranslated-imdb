I thought it was a lovely picture. The story is John Waters' s thinly veiled autobiography: Pecker's greatest gift is the ability to find beauty in unexpected places. Edward Furlong is in the lead role, but his actor Mink Stoll (a happy kami) and the best performances by Patty Hearst of all people. I think critics will rely on this topic. I feel that they will take Perkur's performance into the gospel, and I think the film is pretty clear.
