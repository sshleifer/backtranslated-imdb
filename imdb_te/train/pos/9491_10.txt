Henry Vernil's film may not be known as the Parallax View, Condor, or 3 Days of JFK, but it is certainly not worse than the classic representatives of this genre. Action fiction president was killed in fictional Western province. After investigating for several years, the Special Government Commission chairperson decides to kill a single armed force. But one man - played by prosecutor Volney, Yves Montand - yet to do something to investigate and therefore the movie begins to begin. The film does not deal with some specific theories, but it adds the whole structure of the relationship between government and society in today's world. Such a film was only done in the 1970s, but it never lost reality. Moreover, it's just a bit scary and it's simultaneous. 10 to 10.
