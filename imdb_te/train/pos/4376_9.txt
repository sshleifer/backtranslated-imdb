Liam Neeson Scottish Legend described Robert Roy Maggre in the early 18th century. He is a real actor. He did all the audience in all his characters. Jessica Lange was excellent as his wife Marie. Mary is a beautiful woman. This is her love of dealing with Rob Roy the Legend, but her passion to reject her love. They need each other. Tim Roth is perfect as bad Cunningham; One way or another, over looking at the picture, you will find Cunningham disgusting. The scene of Scotland is beautiful. At times the environment and conditions are well shot. If you like history, romance, hobbies and love, you'll enjoy Rob Roy. There is violence and blood, but it is necessary to tell this story; No undesirable torture. If you do not use Scottish accent, listen carefully. This is a good point that the film looks good no one has ever been glamorized by the actor or the actress; They look dirty and actually unattractive of different scenes. It does not depend on their expertise in attracting actors, they are marquee names, popularity or sex symbolic appeal. This is something special.
