IRN (Marco Ricca) and Gilberto (Alexander Borges) are partnered with ESTEVO (George Frair), but the first ones are ESTEVÃO (Plat, at least initially, why not explain why). The person will do it and after receiving his money he starts to blackmail the two partners and appears in their company and wants to be there (supervisor or anything?). At the same time he meets MARINA (Mariana Ximenes), daughter of ESTEVO and started dating her! <br /> <br /> This story, which is caught in the hands of crime, corruption, betrayal and intimidation, is no one being innocent or victim, exempt from Marina, does it not only know what's going on and who does not betray anyone? <br /> <br /> The film is sarcastically portrayed with sad and brutal realism in a huge metropolis like São Paulo, where crime every day exists. We can also feel satirical but realistic in the characters like ANISIO (portrayed by Paulo McCross), which blackmails the boys who paid him without any misfortune and even moves with his daughter's daughter! He really needs to be a monster to do something like that, but of course I know there are people like him in Brazil or any other place ?? <br /> <br /> Is it a cruel but honest good movie about a tragic reality? Performance is great and soundtrack.
