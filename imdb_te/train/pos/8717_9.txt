I have to admit to the top right, I'm not a big fan of "family" films these days. Many of them, IMHO, sentimental rubbish. But this one, like the TOY STORY, the previous movie from Pixar, is very fun. The two main characters are perhaps slightly polite (especially when compared to two Leeds in ANTZ, but the film is good), but the rest of the film is designed for it. That animation was great, but humor, though it is widespread (I love Hopper's line, "I'm not killing her, I will kill you, I'll kill you!"), And the actors make all the voices except the two leads (Denise Liarie Film making; no feeling). And like everyone else, I loved outtakes! I hope the video contains new ones.
