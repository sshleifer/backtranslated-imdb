I'm a child about Michael Jackson. His music, his dance .. He and all great times. A few days ago a friend gave me a gift .. "Moonwalker" DVD .. I could not believe it! I took my time and saw the film again .. Years later, and it kicked me back in time. I almost cried. Not Michael Jackson but good old times I was recalled than when I went to his concerts, enjoying music and dance. This film gave me a different perspective before I was a kid. You can really see the parody of Michael's life. Thanks to Michael Jackson, your great music and dancing, bring me back to those great times. It is a shame that people forgot you .. I do not because you gave me your music great moments .. You all are always the best of you all ..
