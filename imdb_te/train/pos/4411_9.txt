9 out of 10 people will continue to worship us for the director's film. But this movie is not watching "entertainment." Ang Lee takes the form of a target in a relatively unexplored aspect of civil war. Lee's films are beautiful, he's not "side" with his characters. He creates letters, morals them with life, problems, and opacity ... and endows them with a reality that hits very close to home than many of which are comfortable. The film has actions, but it is violent and deeply disturbed and rarely from the actress's lover ... That is the same as the characters. <br /> <br /> When you think about one of the most horrific battles of humanity, violence is intimidating. <br /> <br /> It is a fantastic role in the search for more human dangers that live in a civil war. The battle about slavery and an eradication? Lee likes to obscure the most popular line of films like Blue and Gray. However, it is not about idealism as seen in Gone with the Wind. It's about independence, yours and the desire to fight for it. If you look at the characters, "how can they fight for slavery?" The fact is, I really do not think they are, and that picture shows why the film was caught up in the vortex of a very civil war. <br /> The fact that we know the characters we learn from the "home" loyalty feelings, yet they do not reflect what house they are, or whether they really exceed its values. The letter scenes are very moving and subtle. Other examples of obedience extended to Jake and Daniel's limits. <br /> If this tension finally snaps, these characters are suddenly "free" ... we will see the birth of new people. <br /> <br /> In addition to this fantastic vista, frames. Lee has her art (some slow camera, not infiltrated), develops its epic-ness and story in Asian Europe, and is still well-known and easily accessible in North America. <br /> <br /> Relax, let's go to your preconceptions about what's going on a civil war, what is a "genre" as a genre, to be a battle image ... and let's take you into a world of Ang Lee so fragile <br /> <br /> In this way, Lee continued to do what he did in the ice storm. Again, the film is a clear sign of Lee's ability to be directed slowly and without direct "direction" ... he or she can direct without "serious" on the screen. <br /> <br /> A film for those who love and have no love for the film, he brings the jewel (yes, the singer) to an undefined actress. Standard Hollywood epic.
