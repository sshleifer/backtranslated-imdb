Hello, I'm AnarchicMicic. I am a crazy crazy-holly. I saw partially on TV another movie. Then I got to see how the video tape finally ends. Then I wanted the DVD, because a few weeks after the tape showed the first signs of decay. After the DVD I had to put my hands on the soundtrack. Later in many film posters and film script. Right now it has become worse that I try to push other people into addiction with my website and still crazy parties. <br /> How does it happen? <br /> <br /> Okay, that is a funny but sad and melancholic intellectual one that is similar to the British. <br /> <br /> The world is separate from things like legit, movies, child or ultra cool, but true, because the film is 'spinel top is'. These men are also a story of getting older, too. The story that men combine with each other. Or not. It contains some of the best actors possible. Tim Spaul. Stephen Re. Bruce Robinson. Jimmy Nail. Bill Bill Nighy. <br /> <br /> Bill Nyhii, one of the best performances I have seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> Good, soundtrack is unbelievable. Foreigner Mick Jones wrote songs for intuitive band Strange Fruit. Jimmy Nail, who plays Bass-Man Les Vicks and Bill Naughty, is a lyrical poet Ray Ray Simmus really singing. We know about Jimmy Nail, but if you sing Bill Nighi in "Love Ascham", you do not know how great his voice is and how powerful it is. <br /> For each scene, X-th time, especially for those concert scenes you will be fevering. Strange Fruit singing on your lungs, you actually die in the dance audience when "over the world". Reincarnation of Real Strange Fruit in the Visbach Festival stage is a long time shouting and celebrating thousands of people. <br /> <br /> It's hard but ... I'm getting used to this film. I was addicted to Strange Fruit. I want to move the world where this band really exists. <br /> <br />
