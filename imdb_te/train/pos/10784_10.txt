Although not in the whole movie, Andy Griffith again played his role in his CBS TV. Griffith's character is dying and his last wish is that his wife and children have named him his gray (somewhere in the mountains). If you have never seen it on TV, but have never been released in the video, if you've got the chance to see it - take it.
