I loved this movie! I'm biased as a big Disney fan, but I really enjoyed it. This action will begin at the beginning of the film and going on! This is a bit of exit for Disney, they do not spend much time developing character (my husband pointed this out) and there are musical numbers. This is definitely an action adventure. I absolutely enjoyed it and recommended it to anyone who loves Disney, whether they be young or old.
