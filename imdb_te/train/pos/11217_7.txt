Being an otaku from Robotech days, I can still say that Gunbuster is one of my favorite animes all the time. When it's made, the animation has a better quality. There are no traps and sequences that reduce quality in art. Although the final episode is black and white, it does not remove the joy of watching the movie. It is described as "relative", but remember that women do not respond in the same way that men do. Since the main character is a woman, she must be clear that she does not necessarily resort to "macho-man" tactics to get her colleagues respect. Ciruu, coincidentally, also plays a role in Rana 1/2. Noriko can get a 3-dimensional cartoon; She captures the essence of an enthusiastic girl who appears to be completely helpless but eventually succeeded by the strength of her will. Only me, I saw some people like mecha teddy bears. Even Gunbuster uses technology rather than a rather unrealistic "homing laser" and "buster shield" (it's no more than having a huge velvet cloth wrap around the genuine Dracula style). I understand that the scene is funny, but it cracked me. And yet, I will rank the Gun Buster at the top 20 animations of all time.
