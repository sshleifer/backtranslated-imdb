Nicolas Mallet is a failure. A teller in a bank, everyone walks all over him. Then there is a plan to change his life, not his friend, the author, no one. Our hero is leaving his employer. He wants to spend money with many women and spend his rest of his sleeping life. <br /> If death is not (murder / suicide / natural causes) in the film, it is a farce. <br /> <br /> Jean-Louis Trintignant is a preferred aromatic fraud. Romi Snyder is very beautiful to her. Definitely worth a look.
