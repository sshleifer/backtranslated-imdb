Kelley's Secret is a freelance, animated feature, which is one of the fictional stories around a brilliant book from the Middle Ages that have the Book of Kells, four Gospel of the New Testament. I do not know if this book actually exists, but knowing now makes my explanation and analysis much easier. There are some stories and ideas about how this book has evolved, what it has written and how it survived for more than 1,000 years. <br /> <br /> We are introducing Brendan, an orphan who lives with his uncle, Abbott Sealach (Brendan Gleeson), in Kels Abbey, Ireland. Abbott Selach is building a huge wall around the Abbey to protect the villagers and saints. Brendan does not like the wall and not the other monks. They focus on reading more and writing, somehow Abbot does not have time for Selakk. <br /> <br /> "This is a very interesting man, Brother Aidan, a very intelligent man who has not yet finished with him." Abbott Selach He has special plans for Aidan Brendan: first he needs ink for the book, but he needs special berries, the only way to get them out of the walls and in the woods Brendan will meet Ashley in the forest, discovering that he is only able to continue his work, the forest, where Brendon hips lead to Berries and is the same as his company along the way. Warned about it and would not be damaged with it   ్నంగా విషయాలు ఉన్నాయి. <br /> <br /> ఇక్కడ నుండి బ్రెండన్ పుస్తకంలో మరింత సవాళ్లను ఎదుర్కొంటాడు మరియు ముట్టడి యొక్క ఖచ్చితమైన నిశ్చయాత్మకతను ఎదుర్కొంటున్నారు. కెల్ యొక్క బుక్ మరియు దానిలో ఉన్నది ఏమిటో ఇప్పుడు తెలుసుకున్నప్పుడు, యానిమేషన్ ఖచ్చితమైన అర్థాన్ని ఇస్తుంది. I'm sure you've seen images or copies of old images of hundreds of years ago when I decorated pages with frames of borders, colorful pictures, and extravagant designs, creatures and works. Disney's The Scarf In The Stone has a lot of frames. There are a lot of similar models and designs here in animation. It creates a very unique viewing experience that tries to overtake each other in story and animation. <br /> <br /> I can not see the wonderful details. This is some of the best 2D animation I have seen over the years. It's powerful, stimulating, and full-life. The characters are continuously floating around designs, doodles, and trees, on walls, and in the air. This will increase the image. <br /> <br /> This story is very satisfying. I think there is something special in the final action. It does not give much information or it does not know the significance of the book. We will recall its significance but not fully understood. It is said to give hope, but never or why. This is really only part of the film's absence. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> I feel okay to a certain level. It takes a picture before the animation is low. The story lacks some parts, but it is interesting on the glamor of the history. I would like to briefly look at the Kelly Book, which is talking about me and this movie. I think I will help your viewing experience with so many more people. This absolutely impressive and beautifully filmed image can not be exactly missed.
