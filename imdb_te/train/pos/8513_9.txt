I always have the philosophy that every human being has with different interests, the film is fantastic and I feel that every college student can agree with me there. However, this is not a "plot of the plot", some of the real people and the "problems" they face. I found the movie hilarious (especially those parts of those practical jokes on each other). If you're in the same "wave-length" with these people, this movie is awesome. I'm not going to win any Golden Globes or Oscars, or I do not think people in this movie are future Hollywood stars, but "traditional-traditional" among young people who have a relationship with their experience. I have a lot of people with Hans: Scandinavian Guy, "Not See", but he gets all of the chicks (or some). "Slight people" also play a big role in the film, especially those who are drunk. I continue, I can give a spoiler and I do not want to do that, just get the movie and you will not regret it. I give 8/10
