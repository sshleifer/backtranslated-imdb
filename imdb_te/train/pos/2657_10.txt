"Notin" is nothing in 237. But there's nothing in any business, so do you know how to go out? <br /> <br /> There is always a majesty of mental horror as this film has achieved. This is the highest rated horror movie of all and rightly so. <br /> <br /> Jack Nicholson is an outstanding actor and one of the greatest performances in the film. <br /> <br /> A family that goes to a special and deserted hotel for 5 months of winter. <br /> <br /> Cumbria is not the smallest in the direction. The longest-running scenes, harassing music, spiritual messages, and disturbing plot are the best horror ever made. <br /> <br /> There are constant references to the risk, death and horror throughout the film. Red is used in every scene. Red intentionally put Kubrick? <br /> <br /> It is a perfect cookbook classic and the third of his movies I gave 10/10. He is perfect in his direction and can be seen in all his films. <br /> <br /> He likes to tear his viewers into each of his pictures. It has infinite depth. <br /> <br /> At the end, it is the cornerstone of horror and tension. Terror is the best work of 10/10
