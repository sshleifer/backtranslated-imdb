Uberne Ronald Coleman has some of his paintings here. He is literally in every scene and this comic figure is fresh from him, regardless of him. Played out entirely by Anna Lee - he's cute, witty and very clever here, where his wandering, lovely wife is in a phase forward. The film is based on a French play and brings out the best features of that prayer. Auxiliary cast is very well known, at least where the name is ... and this very funny movie is definitely perfect. With a mix of fantastic Mr. Coleman scene Sean Connery and Clarke Gibb, he is at a stage over other characters. His multi-talent can be appreciated in classic "Lost Horizon", which is to watch every movie movie.
