I think it is a great justice for many people who do not understand this film because it is incredibly realistic and inexperienced. Many proud of what is going on in the mind of the victim. As a victim, Dawson has done a fantastic job in the role of Massa. I agree that this is a very brave movie. I'm raping a different, more realistic look than the other movie I've seen on the subject. The end did not last for a while, but I know many victims can imagine this kind of justice, the risk of attack being sent to jail for their crime is around 1%. Very courageous is very good to watch a movie that is very close to reality.
