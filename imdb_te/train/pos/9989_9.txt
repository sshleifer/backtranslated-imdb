It is possible for me to see the film's screening recently. I believe that Mother is in theater for some time in Canada and it will be in theaters. If you are in a nearby theater ... GO! <br /> <br /> The director role is good for development - heart, mind and a little bit of a little. Initially, her attitudes and behaviors are not very meaningful. As her story unfolds, you will become a person who understands. As in life ... perception brings empathy. <br /> <br /> Hagar's relationship with her two sons is painful - and its reflection has a lot of experiences in this world. <br /> <br /> This is the life and adventure of his younger son, John, who takes the viewer on the edge of their seat - and belongs to an empirical and rarely raw emotion. Ellen Page has acted in the film. She is much different than the young woman playing in Juno. This gives me more extensive praise for her performance. <br /> <br /> If you love her in Juno, you'll love her in Stone Angel. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burnstein is a haggard. There is no way to express the ability to make the actor feel the ability to forget each other's character. Never in the film ever thought about LN Burnstein - I have always thought about Hagar. Hook, line and sinks - she took me to the role. <br /> <br /> Kari Schigland's ability to capture this famous book by Canadian most respected authors is great. The stone angel - she brilliantly brings the screens of haggard's stool and angelic parts of this intricate woman.
