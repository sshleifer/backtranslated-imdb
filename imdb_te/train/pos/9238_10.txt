Others commented that this video is just an edited version: "Fire in space" and "Living Legend", if you see the original shows, you have edited the conversation from this video edition. I have found this video version much better because the scenes and lines are added to it. If you want to see the presentation in its original version, see Versions of Video Versions. Now they have more to offer a fan than the original episodes on DVD. Another good video was won by the Earth, which featured more scenes from Galactica in 1980, with more than actual releases. Overall, I would rate it as 10 because you are more than what the networks think of the slot in the time slot of the producers.
