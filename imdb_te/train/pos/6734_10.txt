Riding Giants History and an outstanding documentary that illustrates the stories of three influential big wave surfers, Greg Noll, Jeff Clarke, and Leigh Hamilton. Stacey Paralta has done an excellent job of taking the role of the director and congratulates doing such a wonderful job. The structure of the film is brilliantly modified and works perfectly with storytelling, interviews, animation and surfing footage. The music soundtrack adds the overall satisfaction of watching this movie, while the Riding Giants make brilliant view. Personal highlights are Greg Knoll's comments, his straight-to-the-point frankness, footage of Laird Hamilton in the televised and outside the film's end. But really this whole picture is a big, highlighted recommendation comes highly recommended if you have the chance to see it. It is a shame that is well known, but it is a gem that deserves attention. 10/10
