My Take: Some of the real performances and enthusiasm make use of its familiar plot. <br /> The plot is familiar. President of the United States, an innocent person intentionally kills the first traitor in the United States Secret Service. Following him, his fellow secret service agents try to prove his innocence. In fact we know his innocence, the real culprit is just around the corner, but I am still entertaining by Sentinel. While the thrillers are so ridiculous at this point and are very rich in action sequences, Sentinel is good for all good vintage political crime thrillers. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas, the perfect man for the job, has long been the secret service agent Pete Garrison, to kill the president. In the Secret Service former colleagues (Kefar Sutherland and Eva Longoria) haunt Harrison, but they are trying to find a man behind a martial burn and a traitor in the Secret Service. This leads to very chase scenes, surprisingly (and fortunately), never believable. Screenplay also provides a subplot with Carisson's first lady (played by Kim Basinger). <br /> <br /> Film director Clark Johnson (S.W.A.T.) makes the image look good. Although many criticize it for "a TV movie," I have to admit. The deal is not perfect, it is inspired by many other action thrillers and political conspiracies, which is on Tear Series 24 (which is close to the style and Star Sunderland), although the film takes its tactic into extreme height and does not drop its short details . The performances are fantastic (with a top-lyric cast, along with a number-numbers script. <br /> All in, it's *** 1/2, is not perfect, but far away. <br /> < br>> Rating: * 1/2 from 5.
