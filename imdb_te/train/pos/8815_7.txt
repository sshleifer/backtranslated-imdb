Eleven short stories compilation is a great idea, and some great episodes, but some disappointing shocking. Based on the tragic incident of September 11, 2001 in the United States, eleven directors were invited to give their American approach to the tragedy. The majority of them are the personal sympathy of the American people, with the intolerance of the world with different cultures and people. <br /> <br /> The Ken Loach (UK) offers the best segment in Chile on September 11, 1973, when the Salvador Allied Democrat government was destroyed by support of the dictator Augusto Pinachate USA. <br /> <br /> The other marvelous departments are Yusuf Chahin (Egypt), the world's impatience and the number of victims of American governments in various countries in contemporary history; <br /> <br /> Mira Nair (India), who showed a genuine story of injustice and obscenity against Pakistani family, was actually accused of terrorism in the US. Beautiful: Samira McMalbaugh (Iran) refuses to refrain from describing what happened to the other side of the world as their refugee children of innocent Afghans prepare an insatiable shelter against bombs; Sexual Claude Lelch (France) shows a couple's life near WTC in New York; Danis Tanovik (Bosnia-Herzegovina) shows their warfare in a small space and widows in a single protest; Sean Penn is very poetic, life goes away; And the story of Sohi Imamura is perhaps the most appealing, showing that there is sorrow and humiliation even when there is no holy war. <br /> <br /> The Amos Guitol (Israel) division has a lot of violence and terrorism, which shows more violence and terrorism. <br /> <br /> The title (Brazil): "11D Setembro" ("September 11")
