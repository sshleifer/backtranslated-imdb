The film is filled with a staggering horror film Goodies: Lunatics locked with a mad father wearing a mask due to his terrible failure, poisoning, horror castles, werewolves (man), pre-meditated murder, a mad (innocent lesbian) female scientist, murdered lovers, Tibet Ministers, half of the unnamed experiments half man / half-plant victim, steal the grave, and Suu control, bodies, objects, painted walls, alone in a car accident on the road, electricity, knights in armor - <br /> <br /> aparamayinadi script (which is also the interpretation of the Spanish horror film badly by Chitra standards), and the alteration of some of the bizarre. The main female evil scientist is a scene where a girl is going to dabble in her bedside room with her thugs: "This is amazing, I can not understand ... explain me again this way ..." The film, her bad scientist, said, "Other than all Cut Cover in Mwahaha Cut out the girl thighs as suddenly gets out of bed for all the obvious reason! All your wolves belong mine! Speech. <br /> When I see the difficulties I've seen, they do not know me because there are more than any other jumping jump - a star with an interview, a lot to shoot and a picture. This is an involuntary mess. This was Wolf Man Mark of the Wolf Man (produced 4 years ago, having the same actor but more and more part of the shirt and a different shirt - a word in Spanish for the "continuity") and wrapped up more padding for another actor in Wolfman. </ p> <br /> <br /> Music is completely full orchestral creepy from the house, randomly recorded for music, bosnano, long piano and gong duet. (Thinking about it, it may not be a duet, it may be a solo, the piano part is hanging in hand, while the other is hanging in the gong with the player). /> <br /> This is one of the most confusing trans-state induced bad movies ever made for me. Enjoy. <br /> <br /> Favorite line: "Ilona! This madness and paradise break you!" How true <br /> <br /> Favorite shot: The boyfriend kills his girlfriend and knocks the candle in a stunning cartoon show. There is the enthusiastic direction of rank.
