Here is a real wired for you. It starts with another takeoff on PSYCHO shower scenes, on the campus, when many codes and their duo boyfriends spring breaks in the south for a break break. The trouble begins when they enter the Red Neck County where homicide sheriff dies. One of the cuts in college cuts into the woods, as witnesses to the sheriff's murder as witnesses and her head is open. It then kills one of the Macon County line-time-breaking witnesses, such as deen stalks and traps. Tony March is targeted as a bad, shotgun-cheerful dean. The entire tone of the film is really upset. I think the director did not come out of the film anymore. It is also a study of despair. Compulsion is essential for mourning, confused and refusing the world of proletariat.
