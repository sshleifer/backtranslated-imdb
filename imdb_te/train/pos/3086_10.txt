Here's Italy (I'll write from Venice). Why was canceled? ABC gave the audience the opportunity to build. Cast (w / Hope Davis, Campbell Scott, Erika Christensen, Joe Saldana, Jay Hernandez and Bridget Moynahan) is one of the best I have seen in recent times. We need more demos like this, like the viewers feel when intelligent people do not get people mindless drones. I hope ABC will re-evaluate its decision or choose another station.
