A beautiful picture, touching up the general, yet divine aspects of humanity. <br /> <br /> The film is almost perfect, it's really perfect to see nothing in the world, it's very good. The only thing I'm confident about, is the pace at some points in the middle of the story. Acting is very good, and all actors are easily top actors in high-profile films. The original direction seems to have been well thought out, and the script should look great. <br /> <br /> The moment in the film is a truly brilliant yarn that evokes the feeling of being in the main character in heaven.
