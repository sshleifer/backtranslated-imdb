When I lose the opportunity in 2004 it's a documentary for me, so I'm definitely going to see the repeat. I am truly sympathetic to the film's main character, because this fact has a low dystrophic epidermolysis bollousa (EB) for the skin problem I have. It's a sad, fun and very emotional documentary about a dreaded dermatologist. Johnny Kennedy speaks like a kid (because the vocal muscle is wasting) and does not go through youth, but he is at the age of 36. Very sympathetic movements look at his terrible condition and absorb his bands. Johnny has a very ludicrous comedy, which is said to be beyond the tomb even when he displayed his body in a coffin. He tells his story with the help of his mother, Edna Kennedy, his elder brother and celebrity model, and Johnny's supporter, Nell McAndrow. It won BAFTA for Best Editing and Best New Director (Original), and was nominated for Best Sound (Original) and Fleur Documentary Award. It is ranked 100th in the list of the 100 Greatest TV Treats in 2004. Watch the documentary!
