I think this is still the best. There are some others, such as rock's "pain", and Allen's "Men Pigs Pigs" are fun; "Damn Wayne's last stand" is also tearful and funny - but there are no errors in this routine. All jokes are funny, and the 70-minute time limit is perfect. Enough time for the last 20 years. I love how the audience is completely and unrestricted. For a guy I've seen a lot of fans of classic and a lot of Jim Carrie, the more laid-back fun watching is pretty cool. Ellen and Newhart are not in a category, but you can see if you are bumpy. Thanks Eddie, God bless.
