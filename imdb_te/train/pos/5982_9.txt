One of my favorite films. It's everything - rocking soundtrack, Eddie Clarke, ex-motorhead, loads of action, laugh loads, totally ridiculous plots and spells of the most striking '80s of characters. Eddie, to be different, Leslie (as they are getting wet), Nuke (Rock Burn Out), Eddie's Mom (curiosity), Roger (Geek) and Ozzy (as he is in America). Then there are boys (richer, vicious and stupid) and girls (empty, faint and sly). <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, you can think of a mixture of Sammy Carr, Rock Star, 80's bad rocker. What about the rocket firing guitar? Sammy then pulls the old woman through the TV screen and smashes her. And what does Roger do? Why, just like a good geek, she hoover up. <br /> <br /> If you're in rocks in the 80s or if you're fond of ludicrous movies like me, my favorite scene, Tim Hyain, then check it out. It is available on DVD and treats you too much (trick or).
