When I first published it, I studied the SneakyBook book (the same title of the film) and moved to a better life, with the ability to be able to see "otherity" (with his own and Amazon people living and loved ones) in many ways. His later books are not powerful, but his continuous search. The men of the tribe describe his sexual intercourse at the beginning of the 60th century, but welcomed his honesty and openness. The film delivers both the sharpness and the generosity of everyone, but the "civilized" men will provide a compilation of the inevitable destruction of innocence (which is not morally positive in this regard) when penetrating traditional societies. However, Shaunbaum himself has changed a kind of innocence that represents the possibility of protecting humanity from its own destruction.
