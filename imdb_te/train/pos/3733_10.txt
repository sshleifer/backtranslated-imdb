The suicidal uncle came after I worked in Vietnam due to the psychological problems I had experienced when I returned. So I was surprised when I saw one night in a pay-for-view channel as part of this movie. I wanted to know what went by my uncle and he was ready for Vietnam. I went out and rented this movie and said it's the heart pain I have ever seen. Immediately after rent I bought a DVD. It was emotionally that I did not enjoy any other film as you pulled in very different directions. I think it's best, as long as Vietnam goes to the movies, although the platoon is in the second place. In addition, Colin Farrell's best performance as an actor. I like most of his movies but he is wonderful in this regard. This is one of my first five favorite movies because I gave this a 10 rating.
