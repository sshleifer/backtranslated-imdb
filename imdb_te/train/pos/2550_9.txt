It really is from Hollywood's "golden age", the kind they are not making anymore. It is a unique, fun movie that keeps guessing what happens next. <br /> All actors are definitely cast and they are all great supporting actors. It was the first film I saw with Ronald Coleman and I have been his favorite since then. Reginald Gardiner has always been a favorite assistant of mine and has a specific character in each of his films. Although he has played a different role in the character here, he still adds a movie that would not be another actor in the role. Added.
