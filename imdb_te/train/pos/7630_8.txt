Kurt Russell, whose career started when he kicked Elvis in the Happent at the World Fair in Elvis, probably never topped his performance in this biopic King in helmed by slash and shock meister carpenter. There are times when you feel you're looking Elvis until something snaps you back into reality ... Perhaps the memories of a hapless Dan Johnson in Elvis and the Beauty Queen? All of the shows are amazing: season hubley as Priscilla, Pat Hingle as Colonel, Shelley Winters Mommas Presley brings both her nerves and the right level of epilepsy. <br /> <br /> Kurt's father Bing is here with Elvis 'father Vernon, and a poor performance from Robert Gray, such as Elvis' Buddy and Bodyguard Red West. <br /> <br /> Rock and roll fans must watch.
