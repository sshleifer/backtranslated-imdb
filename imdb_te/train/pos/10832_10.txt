If you like deep purple, do you enjoy the lead role in this amazing movie with Stephen Ray? This story is about the most famous rock band of the 70s, Strange Foods, and they decided to play again. But, of course, there will be a lot of trouble during their concerts. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighi are great, and the song "The Flame Still Bounce" is perfect. You should see it.
