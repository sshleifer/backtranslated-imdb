This is probably one of Brian de Palma's best films, but it's not his best. Body Double, Fury and Carrie are good films but the film is better than blow out and absassant. De Palma has been influenced by many Hitchcock and the film is taken off in Psycho. Angie Dickinson is a frustrated housewife, thinking of her affair and declining a proposal after playing Michael Cain's role, Dickinson meets a man in an art gallery and she sleeps with him. After this point you do not know what happened but there is murder and a call girl who takes a look at Nancy Allen Killer. Dennis Franz Allen finds a detective and her murderer in the case that she does not really believe. It's a pretty good movie but it's not D'Palma's best.
