We loved the movie. I am the mother of two young people. I love to have a picture that I can see with them as men have integrity and character. Money is not the most important thing to do. And the meaning of the family and forever more then words mean. <br /> <br /> I do not think we will see Davis's family more. But all I love is that it does not "over please" others leave me with the same feeling. <br /> <br /> My nine-year-old son also loved this movie. All of them asked him to go buy. This film is a critic for me. So this thing tells me. This action in the family must be purchased for friends. Help bring values ​​back up. Now we are reading books that are tuned. Really hope to see more. Be happy to be happy
