Someone already mentioned about being in the right place. I have a lot of scenes for this documentary, and I have doubts about the honesty of the scenes, which probably has some acting but it's not. This is true. The story of the developing and / or poor people is not new. It uses agents to attack the "AN" to encourage people into violence by the army, intelligence or government (many believe, the US) through the artificial polarization of people through corporate media, misinformation, and intentionally intentionally disturbing the streets, and thus support their rebellions. A sea officer in the film also mentioned it. They wanted people to see people in the streets. These scenes were played in whole Turkey (the USA's pet dog in the Middle East), who faced a total of 3 copies in history and eventually revealed the secret plans of the Turkish army, with an army of prominent mosques stimulating the religious beliefs of the army through government-friendly religious / Bomb by agent Will. <br /> <br /> The film is unique, and by chance, events have taken place. It is clear that the directors are Pro Chavez. <br /> I do not know if the directors are to filter and edit events and information. <br /> <br /> Does Chavez defend the Venezuelan people against the dictatorship of America and the world economy? Any anti-thought oppression with power and eventually becoming a self-indulgent brutality, history will tell. But at least Chavez hopes and I believe it's worth taking the opportunity.
