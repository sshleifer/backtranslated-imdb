The lady from SHANGHAI proves that great intellectual Orson Wells would direct a "main" film if he wanted. Compared to his other, more artistic work, the film is just a moderate missionary, and has almost esoteric elements. <br /> <br /> The final scenario in the exception hall is widely accepted as one of the greatest scenes in film history. <br /> <br /> This leisure is awesome, and Rita Heawat's amazing performance. Her performance in the beginning and in the middle was incredibly awesome, and she appeared in satire instead of other actors. Even the greatest Mr. Wells.
