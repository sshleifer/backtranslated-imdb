I did not see much in the Colombo movies ... actually I saw only one or two of these, unlike this one. I've always liked Columbo, though, somehow even without much of seeing him. Peter Faulk and his character, his voice and his charm, is always the perfect choice for the character. This absolute verification is the latest (and not the last) images released in 2003, although the series was restarted in 1968. It is 35 years old. Faulk scored 40 runs. The series has 68 movies (except for my count off), all of which are made for TV. Everyone knows the role, but no one in the movie has ever seen an image that has never been seen. If you ask me, it is very successful. The plot is pretty good. The only problem I have is that the killer and murder are revealed at the very beginning (although it is the same for all of the Colombo movies), although it has not left any mystery, not too much to look at the end of the film). The pace is good, the scene is very rare if you get frustrated. Acting is very good, especially Faulk and Ruth Gordon. There are some great exchanges of the dialog in this movie. The letters are well written and reliable. The dialog and script are exceptionally good for a TV-movie. In all, the film, yes, is surprisingly good for a TV-movie, and is definitely worth watching for any fan of Colombo and / or crime / mystery flicks. 8/10
