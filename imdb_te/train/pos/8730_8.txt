Many American people say ... what ??? To my initial comment. Yes my comparison master Akira Kurosawa is without doubt as an insult to fans, but if you analyze this movie, my opinion is correct. We have a farmer who went to a city looking for help from a grasshopper who wants to steal the village crop. The great difference is the way the story takes. Our samurisis, like the original Circus performers band are a very complex mixture of people but eventually the village is what's needed, HEROES. Again, looking at this amazing movie (absolutely seven samurai) and finding another pictures that stole the story, tried to get the same magic effect than Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece. The 13th Warrior with a tip Antonio Banderas, Michael Crichton copied the story of his best seller, but did not find the cat's third foot.
