This movie is terrible, but you should see it. I did not come here to discuss the whole movie, just a great chase scene so far. When MDD is thrown on Tim, he gets up. Eddie keeps jams on the way with passionate consequences (hanging on the folk player, DVD purchase and slow look). The best obstacle jumps into a jack but the door is slid on the mug bucket which stretches the slide out of the field. But when he sinks, he gets speed, so he is physically (especially friction); And behind the door is supreme. The tallest staircase ever in any school, which will continue to clear the joke in the air. In fact he dies of a broken neck. He performs all the feelings of reality, but he does the humorous sound that he made in that situation. Go and buy this one. Trust this scene with your 6 bucks.
