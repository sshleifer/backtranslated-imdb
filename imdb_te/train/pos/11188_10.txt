I was a big fan of Stephen King's work, and the film made me a great fan of the king. About the pet seminary family. They went into the new house, they were happy. But behind their house is a pet cemetery. Creed's new neighbor Judd (played by Fred Gwyn) describes the burial ground behind the pet graveyard. The burial land is pure evil. Jude Louis Creed says, when you burst a man (or pet of a pet) in the burial ground, they come back to life. The only problem is, when they come back, they're not the same person, they're bad. As soon as Jude Pet describes everything about the Semester, everything starts to go to hell. I do not want to give some of the main parts of the film just because I have ever explained. Pet Semetary acting is great, but requires some work. This story is one of the main parts of the film, it is very original and persevering. This film has lots of effects that make the movie way more strange, and scary. One of the basic reasons why this movie was sent back to my back was actually cosmetic effects. A character in this movie is really strange. The character is "Zelda." This particular character is three times accurate in the film. Zelda Rachel Creed's sister, though years ago, Rachel still haunts her. The first time Jelda appeared in the film is not usually a horror because it is not talking or anything, but the second is worse, and to be honest, the second time I get out of the country. There is nothing wrong with this picture, it's almost perfect. The Pet Seamari produces great fears, some pretty good performances, the first rated platform, and mesmerizing. This is really one of the most favorite horror films. 10 to 10.
