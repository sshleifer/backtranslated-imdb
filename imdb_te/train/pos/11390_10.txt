Story and music (George Gershwin!) Levant, Guitar, Focch, and, of course, Kelly are great. There is one thing, and that thing is a very important lady. Sorry, Leslie Coron is suffering from me. However, despite her, the plot moves along well with the leading (and deservedly so) ballet. Oh colors, dazzling red, blues, greens, and yellow. Bennies should not be forgotten. ; ) I worship Beaux Arts Ball (totally black and white dresses) and occasionally contrary to the amazing ballots. <br /> I mean, it's great to see if it's all good, but it's not the best. But do not forget the other genie Kelly after a 20-year-old girl.
