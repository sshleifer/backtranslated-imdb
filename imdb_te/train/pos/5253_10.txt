I do not understand why people are disappointed and pan this film! Remember them, this is not something that the SNL movie is unimaginable and original in the plot or direction! Ladies Man, Will Ferrell and Tim Meadows are a delightful movie, even though it's stupid at times, with excellent and amazing performances. Yes jokes are some stupid, and yes, the characters are unbelievable but its comedy! I did not really understand that nobody laughs at this fun moment. Anyway, if I take all that I say - a SNL, crazy and absurd comedy. There is nothing to win awards, however, some modern comedy gold. "10-4 Apricot!"
