Probably the best film of Jackie Chan in the 1980s and put him on the map. This self-directed level of police play is clearly visible from the opening and closing sequences, during which squatter's village and shopping mall are demolished. Differences between the original Chinese and English versions are clear, many of which have failed in the next stage of the jokes. Nothing shook the noisy stars like their Chinese origins. In fact, only the court hearing was corrected, at that time, the trainings in Colognean Hong Kong were conducted in English, the scene original in Cantonese! <br /> <br /> Chance fighting style and martial arts choreography make the joke possible, so non-Cantonese spectators do not miss much. It's not the conversation that makes a Chan film, after all, but the action-and-take-out take-off. The story is easy to follow: Chan is pursuing a gangster godfather (Cho Yuen) with a bad Hong Kong detective, and assigned to protect a star witness (Brigitte Lynne). The action is excellent from the beginning to the end, and there is not much time between the mid-breathing time. It's never you thinking, but what an entertaining, and well-strung-together, movie. Arguably, it is one of the best martial arts films out there.
