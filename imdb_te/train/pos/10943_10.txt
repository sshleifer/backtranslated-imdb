I will vote for 10 out of 10 of those rare opportunities to see this review, pity me, call me to Hollywood and be in her funny / funny world. But with all the intensity, it is good. The first episode was obviously finding it's feet, but it came that Silverman would run all the way through weirdness. This is not a laugh of comedy but it's very good, it's a very laugh-track, and when these laughs are not correct, it's impossible to hear their inner gaze laughing. I see it as bizarre drew kare show with weird characters and a very strong central character. Well worth a watch, look forward to the following parts. There is a very good chance from simple comedy. <br /> ps, sarah? Please phone me
