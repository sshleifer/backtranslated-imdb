This was a very interesting story because I liked the movie more than anything else, but the story in the story was thought to have been cut from a long story. The book makes sense, over 400 pages. From the 1920s to the 1970s, it extended over time to fiction in the fictional South American country. I think it's a six-hour short-range better than a 140-minute film. <br /> When it comes back, the story is not confusing, it's confusing. Well said what is said. An inaccurate Clara's supernatural powers are incompatible; But they should be more or less equal to the film order, or they should be left out. Two other disadvantages (may be spoilers): Esteban's ultimate return to good is somewhat more suddenly, as Ferrula's curse is worn, although the tone of the story suggests that the tone never fails. Acting is amazing. Glenn Close, like the spoiled spinster Ferula, is unusual. Jeremy Irons, the ruthless self-rich rich, is also amazing. Meryl Streep, as the main character Clara, is great, though she is better than she is in the film. There are small characters that are very well played. There is no dialectic coach in the film. Each actor appears to speak with a different voice.
