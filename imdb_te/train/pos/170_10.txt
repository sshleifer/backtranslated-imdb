Listen to the fuddy-daddy critically on this one, this is a gem! Young wealthy Jon and her brother are uninhabited after their father's death - now they need to work for a country! She, naturally, becomes a reporter, and he, naturally, is the driver of the crowd! Jungle colleagues meet their career Gangster Clark Gable, head to meet. At this time, it is possible to swim for lingerie on a moon, a couple of dancing numbers (for a steam-sharp bearer) for most young things and zone. But none of this is supposed to be taken seriously - when Hollywood is really naughty, that's all good fun since those wonderful pre-coded days. The zone looks great, and displays a lot of emotional range to give longevity as his career (God stopped her dance!). Gap is great as a slimy gangster - he is not yet a star and therefore the hero does not. Great to see him play something different. And William Bakewell is as amazing as the poor chaos brother. And a occasional wink to the audience - and moving the piece with cracking pace are director Harry Beaumont are some great montages and tracking shots courtesy! So much happiness!
