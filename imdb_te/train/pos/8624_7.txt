What is the best way to start a movie review like Der Todding? I come live from watching this movie, and the images are still burning in my brain - and I do not think they are moving anytime soon. <br /> If you're on this page, it's good to say that this is a good idea, even if it does not appear to you. Otherwise, let me know that this is not a moderate-budget gem that has been lost as "Dark near" for some years, or a low-budget, scully, "fun" B-movie. It's a low-budget art, a simple and sharp way forward. This idea is a simpler - seven stories revolving around, and closing, suicides are the corpse that appears in the autopsy. The simplest right, even boring? It's not. The film can not describe how hard you are half-time; <br /> When I go or want it, it will actually attract you. <br /> <br /> The technological gains and scenes I directed burned apparently on super-8 cameras and sometimes unstable. I could not point out that any of the sound effects could be synchronized outside of a full-fledged film rival, but at the end of the day this will pale into all the insignificance. <br /> While serious films go, I have seen them the hardest, and yet Der Todesking has moved me so much as some others have done, especially being a ghari and having very few scenes that I would consider "grateful". In fact, the most disturbing scene I found was the last story. I will not destroy it if the emotional pain of the character is nearly falling from the screen and if it does not happen for the end, you can be sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Definitely, it is not the best film ever made, and places are very cruel and maybe a little vigilant, but despite these flaws, Der Todesking has an experience I would recommend to anyone who likes challenging cinema. If you're a comfortable viewer or "good" film, or you're inclined to be cruel and meaningless, you're not looking for it. <br /> If you enjoy or not, you can not forget in a hurry.
