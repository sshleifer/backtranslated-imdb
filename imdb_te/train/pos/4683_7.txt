(Q) What do you call 100 film criticisms buried in their sand in the sand? Good answer. Well, I do not know from Peter Mattei from Adam but if he refers to his filmmaking in the junior auteur, "Love in the Time of Money" is a "good start". A classy shoot with weird music box style, the movie goes from person B to person C to one person ... and again and again with A & B people carousel. The movie starts with nine happy moments and begins with the street prostitute and her client. The film's story is not a story, it may have anything with many complicated slams received. Last night I saw "Angels in America" ​​in America and was finally frustrated, but this little conversation was committed to me in the study of letters. Be careful. I can be the only person who really liked this movie. (B)
