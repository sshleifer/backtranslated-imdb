Story about four teenage girls growing in California. Jeanie (Jodie Foster) bunch to a higher level - but she wants to go out of her home with her divorced mother (Sally Kelmerman). Annie (Cherie Cure) drugs are accustomed to alcohol and bad boys and beaten by her father. Madji (Marilyn Kagan) has more parents. <br /> This is nothing new since we have seen many times - but this is a big difference - it's accurate. I graduated from high school in 1980 (I first saw the movie) and was surprised at how realistic it was. They come to the right, with the conversations, clothes and attitudes. The film's main song (by "On the Radio" by Donna Summer) was a big hit. This film hit me harder than any other teen movie because I understand and interact with the characters. I learned the girls in high school now! This movie (of course) is out of date but we can never see it forever. </ P> <br /> All the scores are good when the faster has the best possible performance. Relationship between her and kelmermism is fantastic and well-made. <br /> <br /> Very good movie - Emergency view if you get older in the 1980s. The film has the right eligibility (drug use and catchphrase) but all teens should be seen. I'll give it to 8.
