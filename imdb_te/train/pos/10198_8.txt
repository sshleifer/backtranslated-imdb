I am grateful to Caesar Morano and his staff. "Panahogoy" is hopefully an ancestor of the resurrection in this language (which is more than a Tagalag). The dialects and lifestyle of the region are reminiscent of the Philippines. Downside: The American antagonist's corny and stilted acting. I did not think it was intended for a passenger passing in the 1930s in its bright red kit-car car in the "role" of the same character and most of all. Without those little and glittering details, "Panahagoy" was at least 10 to 9 in my rating - Dagong Salamat, Manoy Cesar! Affiliation: This film certainly stops the "Gallo, Plata, Mata" of Payack Gallagher, which was provided with Visas's diverse perspective during World War II. Allus and cinematography will recount some parts and storytelling "Noli My Tangier" back to Spielberg's "The Color Purple".
