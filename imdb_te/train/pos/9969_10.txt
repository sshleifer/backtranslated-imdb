Shawshank, Godfather, Pulp Fiction ... all good films. Great pictures. <br /> <br /> The film is so great that it has a lot of messages, and when I look at it I shout. Really, this is one of those films you should watch 10 times. The pitch is that we have ice cream, we see sadness in his eyes, and we experience deep pain and wonder ... what's so bad about this ice cream? Would it be good for us as we do bad things like humans? <br /> <br /> The film has the best composition of Santa Claus. Unlike other sensations, he is a normal person. Children take him and see children dreams, and we are surprised; Do we believe that is really good? Along the way, this Santa is actually referring to Christ, the whole meaning behind Christmas. <br /> <br /> You pay money to watch this movie. This episode should be stopped by movies and air as 24/7. Whether it's Christmas or not, the film gets a 500/10. Whoever tells what is bad is a liar.
