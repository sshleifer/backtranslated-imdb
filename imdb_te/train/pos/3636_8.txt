It's a good feeling, a person's dreams and drive or push to realize them. This is a beautiful and inspirational movie. Some of the people have come out with every movie, especially why good people are missing. Dennis Quaid Jim Morris, a science teacher and high school baseball coach, provides a solid show in this true story, who takes his team forward to take another shot in a professional baseball career. With an incredible supporting cast, including Brian Cox, all of his accomplishments have been as unsustainable as Krusty old former naval officer. It is good to see him as a villain in a movie. If I make a complaint with this film, it's the same: Raisy Applegate will not sign the national anthem once again. <br /> <br /> Seriously, the film belongs to great baseball movies such as "Base of Dreams" and "The Natural". It rates two thumbs up and one big "well done."
