Kim Novak is a masch lover, and James Stewart is a witch hunter for her choice. Comic's comedy comedy from Broadway platform; Witch Color painted by James Wang Howe, and performed a sterling cast. Ernie Kouaks is an incredibly bitter writer Redlich. I love this movie, even though some are visible. Kim alone makes it the winner in my book. Ha! My # 5 movie in 1958.
