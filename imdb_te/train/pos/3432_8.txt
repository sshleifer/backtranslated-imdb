This is one of the milestones to set up in the timeline. Darkness was built in 1993 in Tallinn. It is not only the typical inhabitants of Estonia but the confusion and macroeconomic period. Other former countries are part of the great Soviet empire. Estonia is born a young nation. Newly formed governments seem to have to face problems with the teeth, and Estonia is also facing some problems. Machines for their dirty pockets to fill their selfish schemes. This is one of the main themes of the film. Darkness is seen in the Tallinn film Estonian film, but it was made by Finnish director Elka Jarvalati. He made his best effort to combine several doses of Estonian humor. So it is called a comedy film of a political comedy. General people are taking part in the film, which is good and bad. This is not a new concept as it is readily available in the religious books of different faiths. The Darkness looks to us in Tolney showing us how the general governments are also being demolished by corrupt individuals.
