In other reviews, I worry about the sensitivity of Sinatra (or sympathetic!). <br /> <br /> <p> msgid "" "I do not act as Sky Masters, but Sinatra never reads anybody else's exception. <br /> <br /> No, no one likes to be as a Sky Masters? ?? It's a great piece: an attractive gambler who makes a huge mistake when he allows suckered into a bet, he should take the Salvation Army Sargeant Sarah Brown to Cuba, or lose it. Is not it money? It's pride, but he and she meet their match. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile Nathan Detroit should try to find a craps for a great deal of him if his long-term husband Adelaide was for the first time ever denied to his future husband. <br /> <br /> This film is a series of short stories of Damon Ryan's: his unique talk of hearing, and his great character names and his horse-racing / nightclub / late night jubiling world. Then it turned out to be a music, and you can not help but think that it's never really out of step in the form of cinema. Is the camera unusual and sets exceptional? And not pleasingly ?? Flat and small child. <br /> <br /> My absolute favorite about this movie is that both singers are singing and acting as Brando (Sky), and Jean Simmons (Sergeant Sarah Brown). However, keeping the prostitutes to these roles has created better music; But what is essentially forgotten is that two such magnificent actors have brought something to the party instead: what they have more vocal talent than make up for passion, acting ability, and grief, pathos, pathos. You are with Sky, arguing against Sarah, logic, stability, pipe and safety. Have fun with Sarah's loosening with the "milk" Cuba influence. You feel an hour before the raging hours of the sudden and sudden feeling in their room and carrying them home with the plane. As Sky says correctly, it is "chemistry". Pro singers ?? Should they be Broadway belters or soft crooners ?? It does not necessarily depend on this. (And they certainly did not.) I have criticized Brando Sinatra for not letting him in his role of Nathan Detroit. Sinatra became intrigued by Brando's four-way acting method. I can not imagine that this film is very attractive today if I'm bound to take on the other side, but not in Brando and Simmons as a Brando fan (do it show up?) With their amazing chemistry; Brando's unpredictability; Simmons face, all the pink cheeks and brown hair, drunk and cue in the Cuban bar. Beautiful. I would lie a copy of the film to have a good feel again. Nathan (sleep) speaks parts 100% brush-off, if you do not, you will forgive me. Are not you Oh, stay quiet and Mindy's cheese is some more!
