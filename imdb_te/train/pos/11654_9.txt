I agree with the comment mentioned above, I love this reality and it seems that producers forget that in most movies (not only movies on Eating Disorders). I do not like again because they have a huge dramatic scenario and they will come back to the end of the film every day, because I do not like it. Not to say that things can not be done in this movie, but the film that creates all of these problems does not cost much, and the end of the film is exactly right. People like to admit it when people are eating disadvantages and want to get better, and then life is peachy, it takes time, and I like how this picture we grow with the characters, we are going to get through with difficulties with them, getting better and worse, which is a very important part of the film. It gets people into the minds of eating disorders, and in most realistic ways, issues the problems and pain, and I liked it. I also loved how people feel confused and betrayed when suffering from eating disorders, fearing to see how people respond when they find it, especially if they accept it. I thought this film was very touching and beautiful and well said, defying my liking.
