Earlier I saw Warriors from the Zoo: Magic Mountain. In that movie, the setting takes place in the mountains of China, Xu Legend appears to be another dimension! Thanks to the extensive use of Tsui Hark's CGI effects. <br /> <br /> The powers coming from clouds, clouds, split swords and ultra cool moon orbels can show all of the mountains between the free flying earth, the clouds, and the ultra cool moon orb. <br /> <br /> Many of these characters, primarily focus on King Sky and Enigma. The romance is the aspect, but the movie looks much darker than its predecessor. Cecilia Cheung is beautiful and her presence on the screen is worth watching this movie. Initially, she is very similar to Countess (from Zhu Warriors) and she is playing Enigma as she faces her last life. <br /> <br /> In fact, the Juu Warriors were limited to its special effects in 1983, with more ludicrous elements. It carries a new level and sets a new standard in the film.
