(I want Luca to do these days, maybe a lawyer or something, Bela Lugosi Jr. or David Hennessey wants to forget the dark shadows of the kid from the dark shadows) from Robert Jannuci, Luca Venantini, Venantino Venantini, Alicia Moro (Two stars Living Daddy City) EMI video does not have any music on initial credits but music is good when it comes to movies with Italian films The music is my favorite scenery is by a desert-alone alien after the robot is with the hands of the robot. Why the alien says you are following me? I think because Tommy answers .. no matter what tommy West Ali Aliens says, I'm going east Then, the theme playing in the background And watching Tommy seated on a rocked pet butterfly ... You look at Tommy, you've taken a long time ... I love this movie, it touches my heart, the robot's hand is a daddy and Eliot as Tommy's dandy in Eliot There will be a draft. . . Oh, they need a lot of water. . . A robot hand and a boy with a trash and a good other guys with an average chick with an iron paw and CRAZY BULL ROAD WARRIOR (MAD MAX 2) by a crazy western / post nuke movie like Wage in the road warrior. . On Saturday afternoon Channel 57 (Philadelphia, PA), I come home and find it after church. . . Frequently. . . Very often. Love it. 10/10
