It's very exciting to read all the comments. But let me tell you the name of a true artist who portrayed the images for a good time. I'm j.j. everyone Artist in the family But, the real artist has a real family, and he has not yet gained any credit in this view. I also say that if I can not tell someone the real artist's name, "I've done the job well". But I know this site cast good times but, you can not agree that he touched the hearts of all of us. I'd love to see if he's still alive. I want to do some work in my home.
