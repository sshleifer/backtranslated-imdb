<br /> <br /> Good movie ... good movie. I'm not a big fan of Vampire, it's surprising that the director's name is Daran Seraphian's sound is usually bad news. Most of his films such as Death Warrant and Gunmen include average action films. This is one of her first movies and may have taken action rather than horror movies. This film really impressed me. No good accomplishment, well-known actors or big budget. It really is the story that keeps you focused. Especially fans of Dracula myth are satisfied. Sarafian's famous Bram Stoker lights up another dimension of the story and is actually honest and real. It describes the life of Romanian Count Dracula and by threatening the Turkish army by using his dead bodies before his castle. The fact is, where the "true story" report will stop. <br /> <br /> In this movie (Vlad Tepesh) migrated to the United States and convinced a woman of tons. And they're all pretty girls, I'll give him. Whole face, unknown faces, enough blood and gore to more and more morbid horror fans and to satisfy an interesting storyline. The film is not really known and hidden on my darkest shelf in my local video store. But definitely keep the dust clean on the cover and put it on the VCR. Heck, it's much better than the famous Nicole Kidman movie with the same title. These two films are not casual, but I have stolen this picture from a very small picture. Take a look at it ... ===
