<br /> Cast: Cassandra Petersen, W. <br /> <br /> Plot: Elvira (Cassandra Pietersen) is his TV show and her dead and her dead, hoping to make a big bucks to open a show at Small Christian Town Fowwell, Massachusetts, Leaves his head to collect aunt's legacy. Unfortunately for her, all she gets is a creepy old house, a poodle, and a magic cookbook. While in Fellwell, Elvira tries to earn money, sucks some of his teenage years and wins the heart of a stud (Daniel Green), putting the cookbook from his creepy uncle (W. Morgan Sheppard), <br /> <br /> My thoughts : I love both Cassandra Peterson and her Alter-Ago Elvira. She is a very successful, beautiful and funny woman and Elvira is a plus to her morbid and ridiculous, she has a wonderful pair of nails. In the film, her attractions are in good use. <br /> <br /> In this film, I liked the whole fish in the water. You're in a Christian town that does not allow you to wear the Alvira, her low cut black dress, her big black hair, and her immense 'twins', and she's also dressed up for most girls. This makes Bob more romantic with his love story (Daniel Green). <br /> <br /> Morgan Shepard's uncle is Vincent of Lvira, who steals the book to use it for evil. <br /> <br /> Film is not really a plot, but it's very ridiculous. Horror spoofing everything from the boob jokes is here and makes me smile more than anything from a scary MOVIE sequel. <br /> <br /> I have heard that there are 56 boo jokes in this film and I like the spoofing of the film by Roger Korman B-Horror. <br /> <br /> If you love Elvira, you will like this film.
