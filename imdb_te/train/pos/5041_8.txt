Matthew McConaughey is a mysterious man waiting for Agent Wesley Doyle (by Powers Boot) at his FBI office. He has information about a serial killer chased by the FBI. When Agent Doyle comes into office, the serial killer actually says that he is his dead brother. Agent Doyle requests some testimony, and the man tells his life story from his childhood. They are the three ordinary family: his wife Mex (Bill Paxton), his brother and himself. One night, his father gathered two brothers, and an angel visited him and told his family to destroy the demons. What happens next is one of the most horrific films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I saw this film four months ago in VHS, and yesterday I saw again on DVD. Despite the low-budget movie, the screenplay is not sharp, without any fault. The cast is the best, but I want to highlight the performance of Fletcher's youth of Matory Volley. It is a difficult and complex character operated by a young adolescent. Bill Paxton is great to direct. There is no clear violence in this horror film. A great entry behind the camera. I regret the Brazilian title of the film: 'A Mao Do Diabo' (The Devil's Hand). If at least 'The Gods Hand', it may be acceptable. But the film is called 'hand of the ghost' is actually ridiculous. Brent Hanley, author of the film, deserves a lack of respect for the Brazilian distributor. This film is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Mao Do Diabo" ("The Devil's Hand")
