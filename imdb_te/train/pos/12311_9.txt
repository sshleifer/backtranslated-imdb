"Chinese Ghost Story" is one of the most exciting Hong Kong films I have ever seen. It's a fantastic combination of fantasy, comedy, romance, horror and martial arts. The film has some amazing visuals and fantastic fights. The scenery between Wu and tree ghost tongue. A good original and refreshing image and good impression of another Emballor.
