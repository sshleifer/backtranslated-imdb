The silent film Claude's Pride starring Mary Pickford was supposed to be set on a fictional island on the coast of Scotland. In fact, most outdoor shots were shot in the Marblehead Massachus on the Marblehead Mech near a number of rocky seaside geographical areas, including Charn and Castle Rock. My first interest in the film was due to two reasons: 1) my hometown of Marblehead movie and 2) My grandmother Lizet M. Woodfin during the filming of many scenes for Mary Pickford "Hill View". Two women were short (5 ') tall and it was true that my father and grandmother were lagging behind the camera for a cliff scene as part of filming Chipton. I told this story for future film historians and fans. This film (my DVD copy is somewhat poor) has a number of scenes featuring the Miss Pick Picker character of a very strong action and expressive performance. I enjoyed it and would like to get a good copy of it, but I do not know if the copies were seen in various movie locations that were dark. Silent art with lots of action is a very nice movie!
