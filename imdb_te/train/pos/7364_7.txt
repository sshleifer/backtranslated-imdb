It's not always easy to explain how a movie is, but at this point I found it. It reminded me of two films: Troy Spitting (some drugs in Scotland and a little more guilty criminals) and The Blair Witch Project (due to filming style). <br /> There are two friends, one of them coming out of jail about the credibility between the two, yet another is not yet caught. With a stolen vehicle they go through the rural rural areas and not get out of the petrol. When they try to find some fuel, they will find a field somewhere in the middle. The farmer thinks they rob him and point out a gun in one of them. If it all goes wrong. One of the friends accidentally shoots the daughter of the farmer and they should walk. A man follows hunting in the fields and forests of Scotland. Two friends are running for their lives. <br /> <br /> Clearly, the film is only 12 days old. It is absolutely unreliable, because the largest part of it is in one place: Scottish countryside, but I'm still pretty awesome. Especially because it's not really a bad movie. It's probably not a great movie ever, but they still have to be proud of what they have achieved. I had a good time watching and overall I enjoyed the movie. I give a 7/10.
