When it came to Christmas 1976, my mother saw me in this movie. I enjoyed it and I loved it now. I know everyone makes fun of Barbra's hair in this, but I think she looks and sounds great! ... and many women who have copied the copy that I see at the time! Also, the bathtub area between the screening and the crystalline bath is just sexy! The music is great as well. This is Babes 70's of Babies at best!
