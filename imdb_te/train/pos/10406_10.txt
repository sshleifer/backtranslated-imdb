<br /> <br /> While traveling to Europe, Sir Alexander Kodaya Launched London Films after the firing of important parts of the world. This luxury surreal charge from the legends of the Arabian Knights. Filled with swords and cloths, which gave a slight break from the headlines in 1940. <br /> <br /> Conrad Weidtt received the best billing, playing the role of the evil wizard Zafar and deserved it. Saturn's face with his stomach reminiscent of his worst roles in such quiet days as in the quiet days. Here is a worthy villain watching. Thief and Sabu, the son of Abbayu, played in this third movie. Although not a hero in the typical sense of the word, his character is absolutely and absolutely heroic in the program. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast will work fine. John Justin is both a zealous and impersonal king who needs to know the facts of Live Hard Life; Sabu gets an important part of action (he will be transformed into a dog), but Justin is a good player when needed. Lovely jun-duprez acted as an endangered princess of Basra, apart from two different men. <br /> <br /> Allen Zayes uses his good voice for a good purpose as the hero. Miles Maleson earned another extraordinary role as Sultan of Basra's children, moving about his mechanical figures from time to time (also responsible for screenplay and dialogue of Maleson's film). The old man Morton Salten played a good role in the legend of the king. <br /> <br /> The film began in Britain, but wartime difficulties moved Korda to southern California, which probably spelled out the existence of the American Ingram in the cast. <br /> <br /> Blues, whites and roses are especially attractive to the construction of fairy tales. <br /> <br /> In 1924, Sabu Dastigir's Shabu Mysore's stables worked in Maharaja, Find and put in front of cameras. His first four films (Elbebant Boy-1937, The Drum-1938, The Thief of Bagdad-1940, Jungle Book-1942) are his best and they work from Hollywood when they are finished. After a special military service in World War II, he resumed his film career, but was infinitely limited for playing minor roles in BLACK Narcissus (1947). His final film, Walt Disney's A Tiger WALKS (1964) has been improved, but it's too late. Sabu died of heart attack at the age of 39 in late 1963.
