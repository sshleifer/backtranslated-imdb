Disney, once innocent, and all the things that are suitable for all ages, began to realize that it must be more varied. Such variation is very clear in the past few years. Images such as "Tarzan" and "The Emperors New Groove" have attempted to go from Disney's past traditional line-walk routines and new, uncharted landscapes. "Atlantis" is still the best stage, but we must remember: it's style Disney. The first serious film from Disney's Animation Studio was a major achievement for them - in fact it turns into PiG's landscape. <br /> <br /> Even though it is a very mature thing, Disney still wants to live in families, not just for adults, <br /> <br /> "Effectively detailed plot, unfortunately a blow of condensation in a 96-minute film Finally, this is an action film about Atlantis, not about the previous attitude, We are active in the first half of the day, like many scenes that can attack the screen as possible. Suspend your disloyalty to how to quickly mark B to characters from B, and you will not find a detailed animated film coming out of Hollywood! If you like the legendary levels of detail in the plot , James Cameron's " <br /> <br /> Some of the ferryboats in the boat are yes, many movies, such as a major male (one Milo Thach, a humble archaeologist) and the main woman (Kida, the Clichad Atlantean princess) . But what I found was that I did not cliche. By the end of the film, once the letters touching / feeling / kissing are very subdued. <br /> <br /> It is not in the billboard that says "little mermaid" (good thing). <br /> <br /> It is a rather cliche film. Right. You have your hero and heroine, half a dozen members of the trip will make their movements in the film. Several other characters appear, take a few minutes of the clock, then disappear. Does not it take a genius to do mathematics? With a 96-minute film focused on action and visuals, and with considerable cast, the characters have little time to expand. So what is it depends on? There are cliche and many of them. Each character mimics something that happened one thousand times. Do you have a holistic scientist, a charming princess, a square colonel, rich fruitkit, manielal sleevebag, russian femme fatale? <br /> <br /> I do not know why this is available. I found that the tongue-cheek nature of the film is very ridiculous. Okay, it's a serious movie, but do you really want Disney to leave every trait of their history? At least the writers attempted to come forward with persistent witty conversations, sometimes even a little inspiration. <br /> <br /> Finally, there are great spectacular views of icing on this cake. CGI animation spaces are really amazing, and recent ones do not dwarf characters, which is a mistake "Titan A.E." Down. Speaking of the characters, Disney employs an outside comics industry artist for designing an anime style for the film. Amicus is very indebted to the visual performance of the film, which is much higher than previous Disney outings. The controversial result of Japanese animation fans, "Nadia", is the overall similarity of the movie with the cartoon series. <br /> <br /> If you do not see this animation, I can not comment. <br /> <br /> There is no sound in the picture. Gary Ridstrom leads the sound team, and the soundtrack! The sound phase from the early shot is alive and there is a treat. <br /> <br /> James Newton Howard treats us with a dynamic musical score, which the film does not greet everywhere, get out of place, and always help build or assist tension. <br /> I meant the creators. To me, it seems that the film is a thrill ride before, but it is more intense than any Disney movie. If you do not like the clich√© attitude in the Clichard's tongue, then you'll be able to enjoy the visuals of the visuals. Heck, at least mythology is more appropriate than telling other Disney efforts (* cough * Hercules * cough *). <br /> <br /> It's 10 in 10 reviews, it is flown away by the film. With which animated film I always stopped my disbelief? After all, the laws of the real world are more often than broken in the cartoon medium. So sit, enjoy the ride, and maybe everyone can get something to enjoy about this film.
