I was amazed at how great a man truly was in the moon. Initially I imagined a cheesy, imaginative movie, but when I saw it, I decided to keep that side. How big is the moon in the moon. The film is so entertaining and well known about its tone and its a fantastic movie. Especially Rice Witherspoon is pretty and friendly) and for everybody. I was not really bothered, I thought it was a very predictable ending, but I did very well. And some things are as simple or as before, but still a great picture. Overall, I do not have to say about this film, it's not bad, you do not like a movie or a movie you liked. And everyone, even if you do not like this kind of movies, it's still enjoyable. <br /> 8.7 in 10 stars
