I've recorded this past years, but it's only round to see today. I'm out of the stuff to see so I'm sick! I'm very glad to see you, it will delete my memory and see it again and again for the first time. This film is awesome! It reminded me of the most fried green tomatoes at the Wisestap Cafe. <br /> <br /> The story goes back in time and we see what connections are at the end of the movie. Some said it was a child's film. I disagree - it's done by Disney and many characters are kids, but I'm 23 and I like it! There were moments when my spine was put on. The story is full of adventure, unlike any other movie these days. I ordered the book from Amazon, can not wait!
