I saw it in '86 at the theater and laugh more than once in my chair. "Beirut" ... "What do you know about Beirut?" ... "Beerut ... the best whale base he lived." <br /> How is it going to end? There is a great time there. The training sequences are very fun but Jack and Reno Falcons v Vikings can watch the best scene when trying to make a night feast with their wives on Monday night football games. Williams and Russell are so much fun with this one and it's very bad that it's neglected like a top-lyric comedy.
