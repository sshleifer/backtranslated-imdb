I've made the best television sci-fi series to nominate this and BABYLON 5. Both of them stand in my mind because there is a steady evolution of the plot and characters, unlike the Star Star Trek series. If you look at the original STAR Trek and STAR Trek: TNG, they have fine displays, but there is a whole theme or plot to connect all episodes. In many ways, the exhibits are not fully displayed without any difficulty in understanding what's going on. The DPP SPACE 9 (which includes all final seasons, along with its final battles) and other trachek shows, has a large one that is unified. The appendix seems to have evolved into a concept with Babylon 5 and has a high level of SG-1. The Bottom Line This series is like a family or a long novel slow looking form. Sure, some of the "throwaway" sections are not connected, but they are very small and are very beautiful. <br /> <br /> And talking about funny, I kept the SG-1 mood light from time to time and not terribly serious. In this way, I actually enjoyed more than BABYLON 5. Jack O'Neill Homer Simpson is a great role in his irony and love - he's slowly deteriorating from the series of subsequent seasons really is really bad. <br /> To truly appreciate SG-1, you should look at the beginning and see how the plot works. The appendix display gives the power of exceptional power. And, if you do not like SG-1 after giving you the right chance, science fiction is probably not your style.
