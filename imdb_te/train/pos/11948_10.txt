"Point Point" and now "Scoop" Two Woody Allen is not only about making films in England (and that's Scarlett Johansson's right cast member), but I confirm what I know for years: Nordic Rich New Yorkers do not pay attention. In this case, Johannson plays Student Sondra Pransky, whom the magician Sid Watersman (Allen) puts in his disappeared box where he met the murdered reporter Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), who suffered a millionaire serial killings by millionaire Peter Liemann (Hugh Jackman). So, she gets to know him, and ... well, I do not know how much I tell you without giving away. But I can probably say that Alan's funny movie over the years. His ubiquitous exclusive humor (especially the line about his religion). <br /> <br /> You definitely love this movie. If you do not have anything else, you fall in love with London. But mostly, it's just damn hilarious. If you do not like Woody Allen, you love it.
