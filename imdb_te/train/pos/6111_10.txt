While surfing the TV, I first saw my tutor friend unexpectedly one or two years ago. Prior to that, I had never viewed Korean movies before my entire life, so MTF was actually the first Korean film I saw. And- What a delightful surprise! I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end, and a great time laughing. Its comic style is quite different from the Hong Kong comic films (I've used it in my life and so tired), breathing fresh air for my Headdome film viewing experience. <br /> <br /> I think some scenes and tricks in MTF are pretty hilarious, witty and real. <br /> <br /> I saw MTF a few days ago for a second time, a surprise / comedic effect has been kind of reduced to me. However, my view of the film has been adversely affected. Instead, this time has passed - it reminds me of how long, two years of youth, incomplete 'enemies' are completely contrary, and how to resolve their conflicts and how to resolve their conflicts gradually. For me, Sul Van and Zhi are actually in favor of both, a pure and realistic one, a characteristic that separates people like Si's girlfriend, Ji Hoon. <br /> <br /> The two are divided into two parts - the 'fighting' between Su Wan and Z Hoon in the 1st and the more violent and fastest in the pace. After Guez passed his final exam and after Sue Van (in the opinion of Zhu Hua) provoking dance, things start to change. The pace is diminishing ... Zie suddenly finds he cares for more Su Wan than he had expected. So, in the 2nd, it refers to the development of their mutual emotions, ultimately with the gang's owner, with the final decline. <br /> Just one last comment. I'm a bit unbelievable- a 21-year-old self-proclaimed 'bad boy' is just a little bit of the fact that he feels almost naked in front of bullies girl and loses his 'cool' .. odd. I know that Ji is just a pure boy at the heart and not his appearance. Btw, Kwong San Wu (Zi Hu) has a sexy body and perfect man! <br /> <br /> MTF is perfect for list of eighth eighth top favorite films.
