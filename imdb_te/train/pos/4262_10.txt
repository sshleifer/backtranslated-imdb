I saw it several times before leaving the scene. Some of my favorite actors are a happy and exciting movie. Only wish I could find it again! I can see if I could buy it accurately. Please bring it back. Fred MacArrey is perfect in his role as a patriot in World War II, and his famous women, Jon Leslie, and especially Jun Hawthar are beautiful and lovely. It's a musical, but also romantic, funny, and brilliant. It's my favorite movie starring June Hoover, and I've always loved her. Her luminous smile was lit up, and her beauty and talent was an asset for any movie. The supporting cast credits their personal roles. Well balanced and light film; We like more!
