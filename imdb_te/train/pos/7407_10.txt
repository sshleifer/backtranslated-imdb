The film was full of surprise. I've seen 2 or 3 times. I really liked this movie. There are many facts about this film. I love all the characters in this film too. Society "Will Be More Earlier" Because Why Does This Culture Drop? Preach no sound. I'm really connected with this film from my baby hood and I'm leaving my life. The film is in my first 5 films. There is such a truth that I think it is not true that you see the film and tell you that it is right in front of your face. The creators of the film did a great job and I enjoyed the film very much. This movie may not be for everyone, but if you have an open mind I would love you.
