I did not call "Jurassic Park" a kid version called "Why Back! A Dinosaurs Story". I'm more interesting than that. As before, we ask security to bring our lives from an era. This opens my eyes when I see that John Goodman, Ria Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Kronkite, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Yardley Smith, Martin Shark and Larry King. <br /> <br /> I do not want to focus only on the cast, one of the "cheers" lady, the "Tonight Show" host, the most trusted name in the news, the famous chef, "Young Frankenstein" police chief Lisa Simpson, one of the three Amygos . I thought this film had two children (totally fun) and an adult (natural history). It's true, it's an escape, but kind of comprehension. I really said that John Goodman, who is the voice of Rex here, is in precision to his voice in "Monsters Inc." Visibility.
