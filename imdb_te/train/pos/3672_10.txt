A mock documentary trying to make their first film in the late 1970s as Canadian producers Bobby Myers (Matthew Modin) and Paul Linder (Soul Rubinck). <br /> <br /> Hollywood North is a fun story of their struggle to pull all of them, despite the very different threads. <br /> <br /> Hollywood North Why the Spintal Tap (1984) is great for this film. Namely, although it is exaggerated in some ways, it is very close to the truth and the truth lies in the "behind-the-scenes" facts that differ from the industry's public face. It was not easy to make a film, and it was very difficult in Canada in the late 1970s. There are tens and hundreds of people in the films. Many have inappropriate desires, motivations and personalities. Financing and on-screen talent is particularly crucial, as the film is under construction or at any stage of decline, no matter how critical the ending is, the extensive reshoots require or entirely leave the image. It is not surprising that Hollywood North focuses on such relationships. The result is a wonderful picture that is both hilarious and tragic at the same time. The script is flawless and the displays are top notch. It must be seen as a junior filmmaker and a serious interest in filmmaking. <br /> It is fun for any spectator with any intellectual and sense of humor.
