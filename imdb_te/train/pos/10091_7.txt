I've seen "Elephant Walk" for the first time in 30 years and what kind of story is the same for "Rebecca". As others have said, the lovely and nourishing lord of the wedding has a tendency to wipe her feet, threatening her marriage with an inexplicable memory of the wrongly cousin's relative memory. <br /> Meanwhile, "Elephant Walk" is also indebted to some. <br /> <br /> Malint offers two stars "Elephant Walk" with two stars, and IMDb. Readers are not very hard, but I have experienced the expectation. Elizabeth Taylor has never been seen as lovelier, and Peter Finch makes a trusted job primarily good man who can not shake off his faithful father's influence. Dana Andrews - "Lara" and "The Live Year of the Our Lives" - Elizabeth's frustrated admirer was wasted. The real star Bungalow is one of the most beautiful interior sets in cinema history.
