After watching it, I thought about it. It reminds me of a great movie. Ice Wide Shut has shown me the same effect. I'm tired of these people who need these happy Hollywood cookie-cutter endings. I'm going to watch again this night to get a little better understanding of the plot - but regardless of the emotional messages of the film.
