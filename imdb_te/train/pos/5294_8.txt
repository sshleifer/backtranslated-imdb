"Peker" proved that Waters had no intention of changing his stupid ways in his old age. Many things have changed since Waters began producing films in the 1960s, but 40 years later he's still doing what he's doing. In years, Waters' budgets have increased significantly. This was one of his most recent works, but I was surprised to see that Waters still had a "trailer-park" touch. Edward Furlong plays the role of a little boy peaker who is engaged in a photography. He lives a lot with his friends and family in Baltimore, MT. But Pecker attracts the attention of the New York art agent (always visible Lily Taylor), and his life becomes worse. Once again, Waters makes fun of art, fame and variety. It's not in his best films, but some big belly laughs are here (the best lines for "Memento"!). It's consistently clever and funny, and I have a "queer" sensibility that comes in love with "Waters".
