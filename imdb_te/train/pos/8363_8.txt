It's one of the best classic Edgar Wallace films from the German series - all the basics for Wallace's crime-fiction film from the 60s: his credentials, Mr Kinsky, and the young Joshim Blackie's cool, sophisticated British butler - and you're not ) Lovitz - FutureBiger, who once again starred again as the brilliant clever American 'Womanizer', Ttama (and just as well as bizarre) has the role of a young Eddie Arend melancolik still very "dry" in contrast (and thus the most entertaining), a police investigator. And you'll get a freakish and very campy 'bad guy' behind a frog mask (hence the title of the film!), You'll get a crazed out swinging soundtrack, classic b-movie action scenes, partially rare ones (remember its origin!), Pruning queens telling, and and ... all ingredients are pure German Edgar Wallace Get well shaken in Champagne's sweet tastin 'cocktail - well recommended !!
