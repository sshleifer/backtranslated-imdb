While the soundtrack is just a bit out of date, this story is more than ever in the US. <br /> <br /> Peter Strauss has been employed by his father for 35 years as Emory, but blue collar jobs are outsourced by US corporations. His wife was well-portrayed by Pamela Reid, and Emory was very genuine to support her family with two children when she lost her job. The mill is closed with misleading intent, but in a month (outsourcing) to pay straws / emories in a month they are abducted and cheap wages to pay for a steel factory. <br /> <br /> John Goodman, Gary Cole (Strauss's brother) and some other colleagues were also influenced. . It is very upset and realistic. Some scenes between Emory and his father are moving. <br /> <br /> Emory thinks that his local union will be able to reopen the mill, as they have promised. <br /> <br /> Emory's brother Lee already sees the writing on the wall. The rust belt (Ohio) does not have any remaining jobs and should be moved. U.S. Where can they go? <br /> <br /> Emory and his crew have a successful view of placing lodging dock with steel products. <br /> <br /> Overall, here is a good message about difficulties in America. You may have some precautions to be personally affected. 8/10.
