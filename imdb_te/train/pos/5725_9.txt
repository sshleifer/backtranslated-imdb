<br /> <br /> The Holy Crop, The Grudge, one of the most horrific films ever seen, is honest with God! In my old age I was very soft, or Sam Raimi and Ghost Pictures did a kick ** job! <br /> <br /> I'm scared to sit in a dark theater and want someone with me to have someone (except the Prophet in Grudge.) I guess, there are many unexpected jump sequences! I thought it was clever but my nerves did not care! I am the whole movie on the edge, from early credits, and the music is wonderfully scary. I'm thinking about that sound, and I do not like it! <br /> <br /> I've actually grabbed a few times and shouted "Oh" at Oh! Oh, yes, I also cover my eyes with half eyes! However, the term for wisdom: I thought some scenes were mentally emotional. My DH event harijan hated and whoever wrote it was sick and mentally, but I do not remember the image I can not compare to. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> End sequence, much more ... alas! For being a 32-year-old mummy, I have nightmares from this movie, especially because that sound. Please get out of my head. <br /> <br /> In summary, as I grew up (Jason, Freddie) this is not the case. This is a very vague picture. <br /> <br /> The two huge trailers for the movie Boogeyman and The Ring 2 !!
