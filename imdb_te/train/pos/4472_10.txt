From the beginning you see that "Anchors Aweigh" is a great comedy. Jenny Kelly and Frank Sinatra make such a funny team! The songs they sing together are pure entertainment. Catherine Grayson is gorgeous and really sweet. Dean Stockwell is the youngest child actor I have ever seen. If you like the piano, you will be surprised by Jose Irubi. The film was the first to combine the animation with real actors and made it look great in unforgettable dance numbers. Undoubtedly one of Kelly's ridiculous films.
