I love this anime! I do not try his best to make the compensation ramma but it's a slap stick but so slapstick so I'm smiling off my head (mostly from Akane Ran's reluctant but small-natured "fiance") ... The main character goes to Ronma in China, intentionally coming into the spring of Juicencio and becomes a girl who is sprinkled with cold water. Since then it's pure confusion after another. Stand Out Cunko and Kodachi, Sexy Shampoo, Happossai are the frustrated brother and sister duo of Happosai all our hero / heroine. Nevertheless, Jenna, who is the father of Ran's father, deals with a very confused confession. If you want an anime to be funny, this is one. It's fine and good with a Japanese dub.
