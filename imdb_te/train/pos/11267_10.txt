<br /> <br /> Robert Wuhl teaches classroom students in New York University, New York University. <br /> <br /> He no longer recognizes the facts of history. I want to see more of this program. It's very entertaining. Mr. Woolh uses examples and makes "show and tale" to get his points. He was not actually the Paul Rever's midnight ride guy Paul Rever! <br /> <br /> Henry Wadsworth Long used the name of Long Fellow Rover because it seemed good. <br /> <br /> I have seen Robert Wuhl for a long time, he is a stunt-up comedy and "arly $ $" HBO. He is a good actor and a good stand-up comedian, but he is a wonderful teacher! I see the episode of this show. It is well worth your time.
