When a small family moves there, there is a philanthropic in Saberia where the father got a new job in a computer company. But no heaven is complete without paradise. Because it certainly has secrets, strange things happen when a family member arrives in a local country club without a husband. Father is not a combination, but everyone in the neighborhood and work is forced to join all members. Robert Urich's good guy's piece is a bit cohesive, but Jonah Cassidy has been filthy as a good-looking housewife. Suspense and well-made chiller with Bitchy Susan Lucy as club chairperson. Look for cult favorite Michael Berryman in a bit of a worthy look. The film binds the feel of psychiatry and has the expectation for the ultimate special effects. I saw this film very few times.
