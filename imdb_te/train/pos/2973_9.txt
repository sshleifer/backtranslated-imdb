It is a film that is genuinely funny in every moment of life. How does the movie act as South Park creators and can not say David Zucker is not directed? I first saw this movie, I do not recognize the cop and the dough are really matt and tray but their talent in acting and writing is great. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that they were really cured after Matt and Trey. Sometimes funny, sometimes foul, sometimes intelligent, sometimes subtle, sometimes loud and sometimes stupid overall, it's a hell of an image that is rated and unrequited. In fact, its frantic. Totally mad.
