Although I liked Kurt Wannegat, I'm not particularly interested in spy stories and I do not know it. The only reason I saw Nick Nolte, one of my favorite actors since I saw "Priyapat of Champions" and "Hotel Rwanda". But the film brought me a pleasant surprise. In fact noble is great, but this is the same plot. Relatively little political conspiracy and moral question has been focused on: he has actually helped the general attitude of the Germans to the Americans by reading secretive anti-radiation messages (and Americans) toward Jews or Hitler. What is the weight of his weight, his unconscious support for his service or anti-Semitism? There is no confusion, and these words never speak. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) did not open his memoirs in the man who had learned to hide his feelings in his entirety. The internal controversy of such a character is nearly impossible - but with the help of spectacular acting and photography, the film is managed. <br /> <br /> There are other points for the use of hammock or romantic cliches (like the song White Christmas). I'm bored with Hollywood spy movies and recommend it to everyone.
