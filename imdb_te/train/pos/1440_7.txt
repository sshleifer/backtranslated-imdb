I liked the silent noir of the first episode, Pacino and Cusak's acting, especially with their scenes. Influenced the setting and scene of the old verification and idealistic youth. I want to have more scenes of Bridget Fonda's film; She is a majestic and attractive character. When the assistant mayor started snooping around mafioso to the bottom of something that his owner apparently did not want to mediate, the film left me in towns. No one in the right minds is an exempt dock junkyard. The story here is baseless. Something that I do not understand: why are police and whites fired if they provide information to remove corruption judge?
