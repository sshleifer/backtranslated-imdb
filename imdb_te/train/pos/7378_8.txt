After seeing the film last Sunday in Sundance, I realized that Nakata's style was first made in the film. Here we have many aspects of the RINGU series, specifically the source of the media's ego. Instead of accusing the video tape, we instead have the weird images in the haunted studio and the movie. In fact, the weird images that appear in the image will immediately bring the video tape cursed in the RINGU. The water that runs through Nakata's next pictures is not only a threat. Final scenes endorse Morne, with the ghost that opened the door and entered the room, reminds me instantly <br /> Nosferatu. A cooling film that can think twice about going to a catwalk.
