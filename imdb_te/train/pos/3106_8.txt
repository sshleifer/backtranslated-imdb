I did not like to see The Bourne Ultimatum when I was asked to watch for AS Film Studies (not to keep Matt Damon) <br /> <br /> I am surprised that the film with Damon is enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Fast fight scenes, frenzied motorbike chases and big explosions threw you out of your seat in TBU. <br /> However, many things really have broken my cheese. <br /> First, just a series of Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA. This order is recurring and ultimately dull. Damon entertained us and appeared in a stage before a stage of the CIA, with Bourne's continuous survival, I was a bit bored. He crashed a car and came out if he did it or something tapped! <br /> Second (inevitably) - Shakey camera. It's totally noticeable and it's inconsistent to everyone who went to see my class (also tutors) on the beach. If we used it in a movie made in class, it would automatically be wrong and we told tutors that we would be told to use a tripod. Gregrass wants us to see Damon and Still's dialogue, but certainly our heads are not shaking. <br /> All the TBUs have a happy picture and a watch value. <br /> <br /> Though entertaining in the movie, I did not think it was the best film. <br /> <br />
