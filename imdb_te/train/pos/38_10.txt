One of the very best three stooges shorts. A complete spooky house of bad guys and "the goon" challenging warning detective agency's best men. Shemp is in the top of the glow-in-the-dark scene. Emil Sitka offers good support as the hero of the murder as his Mr. Goodrid. It ends, the "reliable little shovel" of Shem has a great effect. This 16-minute gem sticks to the small and pack of two stool's fast, and the walls are fast moving twice. Highly recommended.
