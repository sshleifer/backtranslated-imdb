I saw this film only after years. No need to say, the actual experience proves to be a bit atticicactic. <br /> Furthermore, Alec Guz can potentially lead a spectacular cast, if principle, wavers industrial momentum after WWII England. <br /> <br /> It is a familiar story of the tragedies invented by the exact daily production. Remember the car in the water Remember nuclear energy promise? In this case, it is a fabric that does not get out, wrinkle, or dirty! In fact, fabric manufacturers and their workers scare off the opportunity to venture out of the business, so the plot is bit thicker. <br /> <br /> Gains are worth the whole company, and explode again on the Factory Research Lab! (That's the brits ... always on the top of the lip upper lip.) The film might certainly insert as well as the goofy's discovery of Gwens, but it's a good ride.
