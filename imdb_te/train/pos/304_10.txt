I recall a mixture of tragic things like the mystery of Dorothy and the personal fate of Bogdanovich. <br /> I stopped to see my VHS copy, and much more. <br /> I'm looking forward to the DVD version of the day, <br/> <br/> The country and the easy listening music is the first of the second, blue bit of blue, but also happy. /> <br /> All characters are great, with great conditions, great acting and I have a very fictitious movie and are very great with conversations that I've met in the internet or cinema clubs. <br /> <br /> I think this title is a hope for life. <br /> <br /> I know that this is a special comment for the film, but I think it's a lot like this. I will never forget.
