Jane Austen's Emma is the most enjoyable story at this time and this product of the story is the best I've ever seen. Cake Beckinsell's Emma is discouraging. Gwyneth Paltrow, (with the help of a good screenplay and excellent cinematography) can bring out comedy effectively, unable to emma her. Paltrow does not help just the fact that her hairdresser is just 'wrong' for herself (and I believe in the era) and the fact that her empire line dress looks strangely ill. Kate Beckinsale is, on the other hand, eagerly performs comedy and can still show that Mr Knightley (the most romantic of Jane Austen's heroes) looks at her. Mark Strong is a wonderful Mr. Knightley looks beautiful with the right mix, appropriate age, equilibrium, kindness and gentleman behavior. Emma and Mr. Knightley support the cast of good actors and the whole product is very happy.
