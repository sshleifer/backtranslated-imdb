It's great for a low-budget movie. I put this well above your average action B-image. The film is distributed by Sean and Karine and they do not seem to be shy of the camera. Watch for John and Jared characters. I did not think the producers could even consider it, but runner-ups were very important. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to more about Sean and Karine's involvement in the entertainment industry. Sean's character was very real, and Sexy Corin's character was pretty hard and pointless. Her action was well executed with conviction and execution. It's a great idea to play Billy Jane as a smart and intriguing villain. His appeal to the screen is always a pleasure to see. The chemistry between Jane and Sean's character is very good. Action scenes are not cheesy and are connected throughout the film. But there are errors, but that comes with the territory. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a good movie taking into consideration the budget and made for TV. Sean and Karine think they are new to the game. <br /> <br /> I'm getting the chance to join their co-stars in John, Jared and the next star star cast entertainment success. <br /> <br /> Final judgment: *** / ****
