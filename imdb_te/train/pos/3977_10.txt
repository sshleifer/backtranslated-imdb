I personally watched this to see footage of these 60s and 70s. The medication movement is essential to how it began and how it is pleasurable to learn how to become pop culture and ultimately unyielding power in life. Classic Rock Stars interviews are titillating and funny. You feel confidential and at the same time feel your head shaking ... because it's very good and familiar. I've loved all the sections since the 60's. I recommend this to all aspects of rock music, hipper movement, politics and good 'oh history. I realized that this spoiler contains a lot of trouble because I do not know what some spoiler could be considered in this regard, because I discussed what was in the 4 segments, so I wanted to be safe.
