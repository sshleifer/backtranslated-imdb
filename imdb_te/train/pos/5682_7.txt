No, these are not all my friends alice fairy tale! The 'Wonderland' story is based on the true story of the fierce bloody Wonderland murders that came back in 80th California. This bloodbath is no other than 'Johnnie Wade' in the middle. Yes, John Holmes! Daddy Ding-Dang used shotguns other than his infamous 13-inch milk machine. Unlike the legendary adult actor, Holmes is a drug addict for Hollywood. Wall Holmes is occasionally mesmerizing as Holmes, but once the Holmes character is not entirely partial. Who are the supporters of Hollywood reflections, Kate Bosworth & Lisa Kudrow, Women in Holmes' Life, and Eric Bogosian, Josh Lucas & Dylan Mormomot as the men of Tinselletown, men? These characters play live or indirectly, integral parts of 'Wonderland' murders. From this support team, Joan Lucas and Ron Launius are as intensely as impressed. Lucas is gradually becoming a major Hollywood player with such glamorous twists in 'A Beautiful Mind' & 'Sweet Home Alabama'. Director James Cox has proven to be somewhat bit of Cox Sucker, and has seen Holmes as a well-known company. Holmes was finally awarded 'Wonderland' murders. He died from the AIDS virus complexity. 'Wonderland' will keep you surprised at what really happened to that bloody night, and if Holmes really arranges his weapon. Oops! Wrong Holmes Film! As well! If I did this before I got 'pencilis', I was fined. By Homes! *** average
