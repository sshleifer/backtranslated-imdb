I can not understand negative comments about this film. Yes it is a typical boy-meets girl love but it flies with time and with such flair and polish. Henstridge (talk about winning the genetic pool lottery!) Is always magnetic and attractive (who is the film's golden age who died) and Worthen has his own. <br /> The two leads in the chemistry of the simmering chemistry; The movie is very alive when they share the scene - our! <br /> Forget negative comments - If you are suffering a bit of blue, watch this movie, you feel much better. <br /> (UK: I'm looking for his Prince from 33 years old, male, UK and his frustrated romantic)
