I agree with all the accolades, I went through the tissue box looking at this film. It has a sand-authenticity and is true in every way. <br /> <br /> The question I will raise is the current sensibility of the treatment of animals. <br /> <br /> I had a lot of trouble with sheep, goats, and dying deer, filled with a brush filled with blood. <br /> <br /> "It is the age of any animal that has been injured in the production of this action." Imfigine was made in the late 70s before computer simulation came. Can these fake deaths be fake? Or are these art slaughtered for art?
