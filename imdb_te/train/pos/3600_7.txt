At first glance, I thought this film was rarely a feminist because I thought this film was very difficult. But I was wrong. As you read in an earlier published commentary, I agree that feminism is not embarrassing in this film. I never thought the main character would exaggerate her position as a woman. Guzman is a backbone and is different from her classmates. So I was surprised by the story, in fact, I thought it would be much better, except the predictable end. <br /> <br /> In addition, the viewer was a good idea to make the plot a serious twist to some more surprise. <br /> In addition, she kept her role as Rodriguez earned her respect. I can not really explain it, but she convinced me in love scenes. <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br
