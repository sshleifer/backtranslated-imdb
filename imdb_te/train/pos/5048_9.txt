This is a very dark and intriguing horror type thriller based on the idea of ​​religious murders. The storyline focuses on a dangers living in Texas, America where his two younger sons are suddenly killing after being prescribed by God to deliver the world of evil people. Directed by Bill Pakstone, the film plays the role of a distressed father called God's Killer's Hand of God Killer, and Matthew McConaughey continues to showcase his finest performances as the older son, Fenton Michaels. The film revolves around Fenton, who decides not to have his murdered childhood burden, and uses FBI Agent Wesley Doyle (portrayed by Powers Boot) to publish the story. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine a number of films that are literally bound to the seat of the viewer, and are definitely one of them. <br /> <br /> Directors make the film very well and help them to set the plot with a good view. . Acting is very good in this movie, but there are some flaws that some parts are very powerful and can disturb some. <br /> <br /> The concept of the film is very dark, filmed with intelligent acting. This truly is a backbone tingly image and guaranteed to have you at the edge of your seat throughout. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this film for horror, disturbing, and powerful movies or anyone who wants to see someone else. <br /> <br />
