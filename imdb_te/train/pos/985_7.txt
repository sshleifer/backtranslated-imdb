The film is in harmony with the state's enemy in many ways with Will Smith and Jean Hackman, who has an innocent (black) person who follows "the government" with all the modern technology we know. The result is usually a disaster when the storyline is copied in this way. It does not apply here. David Morse's Everything I Love You, so my comments are not good, but there are more good things about this film. The main body, played by Doug Hutchison, is amazing, and this story flows with amazing extras like David Pomerum and Robert Pastor Cores. Our hero, Alvin Sanders (played by Jamie Fox), but was so annoyed at most. He did not have any sympathy from the audience and bad jokes broke, he was not. Or not to start, the strange thing is that he is greatly appreciating you (and his followers as well!). I did not expect much when I rented, but I was surprised by the good action movie with comedy bits. 7/10
