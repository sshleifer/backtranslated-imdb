Remember these two stories fondly and firstly, not just in a very distant future, but a young boy who is preparing for the test day, we will look for the state i.Q test. Some of his friends had already done so and finally played a little bit of his parents' concern to test it. After arriving he is given an injection and why is it interesting. The observer smiles and tells him it just to make sure he tells the truth. The boy asks, again worries, why not? After this and the parents were sitting with a kangaroo while appearing in a message and state that the state was sorry, but their son's i.q level exceeded national dependence and respectfully sought personal graves. The carcass of the ending scene! A message from Charity is a heart warming story about a fortune-related relationship between a girl and a man from the past. How can this be done to learn about the history of history in history and the history of history in the past? Good story with heartfelt ending.
