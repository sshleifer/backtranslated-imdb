I saw this film at the Toronto Film Festival, it's standing! A story tells the story that my knowledge of the German sensitive women Rosenstress (a street in Berlin) did not mention before the end of World War II. Also, this is a special story, and the Holocaust is the only film in the Holocaust (namely the Dutch who helped Dutchmen), the Nazis, and, indeed, in the Nazi regime against their homeland's immorality and cruelty To stand, with the risk of their lives, this performance is great on board, interesting and complicated in New York, Van trotta sex scene direct from the master, and the production values, including beautiful values. The family in New York may be German speaking. In this country many immigrants speak in their native tongue in their own family - a simple event. So that criticism is unreasonable. In other words, it damages the experience. This image is too long, but once I have not seen my watch. I am hoping that I am getting some distribution in the film, not only a great piece of writing, but also because of Hitler's support which helps any jealousy towards the Japanese. If this movie is playing in your area, I would like to see you! You will be happy!
