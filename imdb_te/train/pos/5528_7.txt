This is a very beautiful and almost meditative film. And the scenery and music are perfectly complimentary to each other. I did not connect the girl and the fox red first until it showed a friend (also the red hair!), Which was almost old to children's films, such as the Shrek or Toy Story that kids like these days. But I feel like the introduction of natural beauty and wonders to young people who can make this film perfect. Probably the best of its kind, but for all ages, absolutely fantastic and relaxing opinion-not just children.
