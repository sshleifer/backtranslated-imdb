Why people are talking about the film and not about the terrible films like Godfather. Titanic is a great film of the 21st century. Great acting, direction, effects, music and everything in general. The film has always been abandoned because most people in the world have decided that they do not like one day. There is nothing wrong with this movie. What I say is that the Oscar Award is not the greatest of all time, but the most money that I have ever seen and the worst of all the lowest estimated movies ever seen. Apart from that it really is the best movie of all time. All star wars and the Lord of the Rings trilogy or Masters Hitchcock or the close-up films of something like Spielberg or Tim Burton. All of this is good movies and directors but none matches James Cameron's Masterpiece Titanic.
