This weird film was unfortunate when it was released at the same time as the most popular "Amelie", both of which were played by Admiral Tateau. Laurent Fiored, a talented director, made one of the most memorable films from France in recent memes. <br /> <br /> The film will give you the chance to represent its English title. The French title makes reference to how to create confusion over the Atlantic as they fly, as well as hurricanes in the Pacific, something that is believed by looking at these colorful insects. In the beginning, the director interlaces all the characters appearing in the film and it seems that everybody has a relationship, it is difficult to imagine, but it works well in the context of the film. A chance meeting at the Metro sets the tone for the image. The woman asked her to tell her what was her zodiac sign and to tell her that she had read from her paper. Irene, it seems to cross the paths and she will find her soul mate on the same day. After Irene's train departed, the silent young man sitting next to the woman tells him the date of birth as Irene. <br /> They seem to have been intended for one another at first, but alas, they do not reconnect until the last film. <br /> <br /> Audrey Tautu is like an irritant. Fadel, who pretends to be Unes, does not have much to do until the end, but he has his presence and performs his character well. The talented young actors gave the film a valuable contribution to the success, which is a light to the butterfly wings. <br /> <br /> We are waiting for future films by Laurent Firoed because he appears as a heartbeat in the right place and the way humans are connected.
