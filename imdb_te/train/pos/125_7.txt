Lars von Trier does not lag behind trying new methods. <br /> He describes postwar Germany as a nightmare train journey. With many cities in the wreckage, a young American of German descent, Leo Caesler, is responsible for helping in their recovery. <br /> <br /> His uncle is a night conductor on the Jintropa Railway line and finds him a job. His job is to attend the needs of passengers. A chalk marks are made on soles when the shoes are polished. Even though they were polished, they did not read a terrible argument. <br /> <br /> Railway journey reflects the man's procession through life through all its tests and difficulties. Leo dashes in a sequence reckon with half the hungry objects that recover from their innovation by carriage. <br /> <br /> These films are horrific, in a dream, each has its own terrible effect. <br /> <br /> Jumps with a lateral bomb from the train at a station called Armitz Leo. In the view of many stands, he connects the bomb to the bottom. He returns to his cabin and makes a connection with the time clock. He then jumps out of the train (at high speed) and is on the grass on the river bank. Looking at the stars above, he decides not to build and destroy his job. If he finds a train to reach a big bridge, he runs the clock speed on the train and stop the clock. Work entirely inaccessible if you care to analyze the situation. It is actually very ridiculous. This can only happen in a dream. <br /> <br /> It is strange to recall the small details like a row of hanging hooks on the hooks and take over the train. <br /> <br /> Although the film is widely acclaimed, Lars von Trier's next films (Breaking the Waves and the Idiots) The above-mentioned bomb scene really retains me. Maybe I'm a realistic.
