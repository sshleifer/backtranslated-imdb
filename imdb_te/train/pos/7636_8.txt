I've seen this for a few years, but remember and see again. <br /> <br /> A man at the age of thirty was engaged in a high school baseball game "Lost the Ball". His team lost. 20 years later, he was "wondering if I beat that ball" and how his life is good for it. <br /> <br /> "I remember a lot when I was in high school, I was twice a drill / dancing team and it did not do that." If you were on it, you were all " I did not try until the last two years and after a second time, I took it really harder.I try and try in advance <br /> <br /> As the years passed, sometimes "I never worn those stupid tights if I could not touch my leg." Now I sit down and think that my life is good or I think it's different, but when I watch this film, I'm <br /> <br /> Who knows if I have not met my son and I have not met with my father? I will recommend this film to those who may change. Be careful what you want !!!
