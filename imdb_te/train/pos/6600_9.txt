<br /> I saw this trailer and I gave it a whirl of 5 minutes and my early ideas were "hell is this?" But after 10 minutes I was tied up and after 20 years I got my jaw out of the ground. This is a great example of how different the film is, and it's French. This film is a very cool and intuitive motion capture wrapped in a tidy upcoming film Noir Package and it was very intuitive to me at first but it was black and white animation style movie which was as gray and I found it was wishing each picture was made like this. I think it's helped by dubbing that they have been very easy to destroy as they landed very respectable actors like most sore actors characters in my opinion (Just see any Hong Kong epic film perfect example in English) I've given a total of 2 and I've given it a whole.
