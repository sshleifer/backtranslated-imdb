Although the film is very old, I'm looking at how many times it laughs. <br /> <br /> There is a special quote in this film. <br /> <br /> <br /> Danny (J Piscopo) pulls the Dawn office and parks in a disabled place. <br /> <br /> "Can not park here, disabled". <br /> <br /> Danny replied, "I'm disabled and I'm emotional." <br /> <br /> This is one of the many lines in the film. <br /> <br /> Johnny Dangerously stands out in my first 5 comedy / spoof movies. <br /> As an additional bonus, this is also a legendary actor starring Peter Boyle. So look at this movie & like many people who have seen me & you, you'll be hooked up.
