Acting in the film is amazing. An amateur rocketeer, I found quite a few mistakes. As a human being, it touched my heart and soul. To see the cast, you do not think they are the original characters. Laura Dern, my favorite actress, had nothing to do with her performance. Young actors who are rocket boys perform their years of expertise, especially younger Homer. Homer's father promotes eternal love / real sense of hatred between father and son. The first successful rocket increases when your throat is not torn or tearing in the throat or when your father and son come in, your pulse will be checked (you may die).
