<br /> <br /> I wrote a story about The BBC.com "Jane Eyre", because I was concerned to see the 1983 Timothy Dalton / Jayla Clark adaptation for the Driscream line. <br /> <br /> I do not know what to do. Lighting is bad in this version. Everyone / everything is washed in a bright white klieg light, some shots, casts shadows on the wall behind the characters, and the sound is poorly recorded. <br /> <br /> And make pancake make-up is very heavy. <br /> And the sets are not completely conveyed to the Gothic mood. They are also very fussy, too Martha Stewart. I can not see Brontë's Rochester following Martha Stewart's domestic arrangements. <br /> And with those objections ... This "Jane Eyre" is not only the best, Orson Wales lived in the Rochester cave-like darkness. <br /> <br /> Despite the flaws of this technology, this is called "Jane Eyre", "Jane Eyre". <br /> <br /> The critics of this product are very close to this book. For me, the book is not worth any value and any "word" or anything that should be "Christian" or anything less, the credibility of this version is actually the best property of Bronte. <Br /> <br /> Brontë wrote a good book with a hole. <br /> <br /> As a fan of "Jane Eyre", I acted as a Rochester against Timothy Dalton. This lasted for 150 years. Rochester is not so prominent, famous; Jane and Rochester's famous ugly couple. <br /> <br /> But Dalton Rochester performs mesmerizing. He blew me away. I have never seen his devotion to Rochester's love for character, text, dialogue, and jake. The Dalton page will bring Rochester down to life on the screen. <br /> <br /> Rochester is a bit scary. Dalton scary. Wells had a scary streak, for example, he was "Enough!" After a small piano piece of Fontaine. But Dalton once frightened. <br /> <br /> Rochester's inconsistency, his humor, his fury, and his vulnerability: Dalton is sometimes away from the second one. <br /> <br /> The important thing here is that the star of Rochester shows a part of a dark black hole like Timothy Dalton, a secret that destroys the life and life that he spent a decade in his life. Current fan favorite Toby Stephens does not even try. Dalton takes it out of the park. If I see Timothy Dalton performing in a singles bar, Rochester says, "That guy has trouble, do not even see him." <br /> <br /> Jela Clark is not the only Jane I ever seen, but one of the few janas who want to cast Jane's producers. No, only those who know "Jane Eyre" from the 2006 version of the Bronte * statue do not elaborate with the elaborate jen with the well-defined eyebrows and the rounded lips. <br /> <br /> <br /> Jillah has little mouth, intimate eyes, and a little nose. She's true "little." She is not a fashion model. <br /> <br /> "No, it's true for her book, Brontë's Jane." It's not a red hot mama, she's sheltered, tons of teens, its inner desires come only at key moments, Jelah is here.Jane of the book is someone who wants to look slowly, carefully, patiently, and noticeable if you really want to plumble his depths. /> <br /> More fire in a firefight scenes in Zela <br /> <br /> Despite the intimacy of the text, this version, like every other version I have seen, is completely "iris. "Helen Burns directs Jen in the Christian religion, so that she is clearly and sadly pinned, reading and directing her the read, counter cultural way of life, which is Christian, and a Christian god, , Plain, vain Jane, she needs to live up to her ideals and she <br /> <br /> Charlotte Bronte is a wonderful, complicated, rich novel, and its adaptation, all mines, mines and honors I've seen <br /> <br /> I do not respect the book Other versions have a task to see in many places. You're about Charlotte Bronte's abuse of children, or the look and money built on Jane and Rochester for the kisses in the middle of your adaptation to most of the book. <br /> <br /> This version, like Brontë's novel, is written by Bronte - finds Jane's experiences on Loaded and her relationship with St John - explosive and unforgettable is.
