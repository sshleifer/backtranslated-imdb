The film began slowly, and later gained momentum. However, the fact that the film ran for two nights is that momentum at its peak. The second part was really interesting, but then just ended with curiosity. Football in the yard? Really, what could it get more sappy and maudlin? I have heard plans for this film based on the 70s. If anything like "60" "can do anything great.
