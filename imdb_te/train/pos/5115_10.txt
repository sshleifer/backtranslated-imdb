I did not see this movie in the theater. I agree with the opposite of bias towards Vinny Burinino. Who is John Travolta doing Hollywood films? I remembered that year's Oscar broadcast, and Travolta was completely destroyed when he was not winning. How dare he when "real" actors in running? I'm sorry John, you should have won. After catching the film years ago, I fell in love with the whole movie. Bud, Sissy, Uncle Bob, Wes, all done wonderfully. I, too, have never agreed to pass it through the surf channel. I stop and watch. Over the years, I have learned to do a lot of talk, dance with my thumbs on my wrist and learned to appreciate Travolta. For me the music from the Urban Cowboy, the soundtrack was the only disappointing one. The film directs "looking for love", but the Urban Cowboy soundtrack has the full potential of the classics that do not do it. It should be a double CD ........
