I also had to come back from a modern screening with Redeye and I must say that in a very long time there was not much fun with a movie. Wes Craven is always better. He brings us to the end of the summer thriller longing to be very satisfied with us. This year's thriller .. no doubt. <br /> All actors are wonderful and action is real and fun. F / X is great. This constant built suspense. There is a lot of film on my seat edge. It's been a while since I hear audiences' applause and applause and get excited in a theater. <br /> <br /> If you look at these thrills, action and good plots this summer, REDEYE offers. Let's see!
