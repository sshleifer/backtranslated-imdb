If you're a fan of Chuck Norris or Judson Mills, it's a lot to watch. It has many adventures. The Presidency Man is a great follow up. The main three stars (Chuck Norris, Judson Mills, Jennifer Tung) is my personal opinion. The film has changed well with the original film and the networks should consider it in a regular order. If you see the President, let's recommend this film to you. If you see President Man: One line in the sand but you can not see President Man, then I suggest you are doing it.You were disappointed.
