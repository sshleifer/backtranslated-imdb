I've been looking forward to the original film for quite some time. <br /> <br /> I did not enjoy watching Claire Danes in any of her movies, but I changed my mind to Kate Beckinsale Thales, "Brookedown's Palace is" hard to believe ", but the screenplay is big. As they go to Thailand, they meet with a young man persuading them to go to Hong Kong. However, You know, you know, you have 18 pounds of medicine? If you can get through a small mixture, you will find very well written, and find out the story is out. I have spent time with movies and movies that I see I recently discovered that I would develop a personal concept, which is not different from the film and by the end of the film I paid more attention to the other characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman is an attorney who lives in Thailand, Plays the role. As always Pulman presents excellent performance and beautifully combines the film together. <br /> There are some turns and turns, at the end of the movie, you are in tears. This is one of the most exhaustive movies you have ever seen at home for that movie. It is my opinion that it will come out next time at the video store.
