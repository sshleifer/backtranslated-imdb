The greatest stand-up hands in this show. I would stand up to performances, stand up to the performances, and see Bet's comic view, but I never saw anyone fit Murphy's skills in this program. The impressions are good, the skits are great, the timing is accurate. You can also let the crowd really gets into it. He's good to come a few years later, but this is my # 1 in my book. Also, at one point, especially from the early mid-eighties, Murphy is funny. He is a family barbecue and "Ice Cream! Mooommmm !! Ice Cream Man is coming !!!! Another big part is his mother Clint Eastwood.
