This is a great movie. It is really "the best kept of Asian cinema" if it is any signal than Hong Sung-Sono. It is quite similar to the style of Sai Ming-Liang and Howe Haoo-Hassian and kept them very similar to the plot, but I enjoyed this whole amount more than their films. It still fits that style (the camera always moves), although somehow I found a little self-deliberately "slow" film than the movie Sai Ming-Liang or Howe Hsiao, although public minimalism is slightly less pronounced than their work-Hesein, The reason for that. Plus, it does not place many things which are separated like who does. I thought that the film was somehow more "perfect" and had some open-end (less than) in their work, although it did not say that it was similar to a pre-motion plot. I believe that Sophia Coppola does not directly influence this translation for "Lost in Translation" (a young woman who is surrounded by her, and knows that she is unable to help her in the hotel room wearing punk drops).
