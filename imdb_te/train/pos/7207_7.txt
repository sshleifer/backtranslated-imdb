I went to a good band and witty thriller and went to the Detroit; And that's what this picture is; I can not help but think it's a sleeping man. The classic 1972 film was clearly inspired by the film; Especially in terms of plot, but certainly with the case with the implementation of it. Actors confirmed it in the lead role of Michael Cain. The film is based on the play by Ira Levine (formerly Rosemary's Baby and The Stephord Wives) and was directed by Sydney Br√ºll; A playwright is behind his best days. After his latest play bombs, Sydney finds himself a self; And this did not help a play with the Deathtrap; He comes to his home, who wrote an enthusiast to teach. Death Trap is a commercial success guarantee, and Sydney will soon begin to set up its own plot; It will invite round the enthusiastic letter, kill him, and change the death trap into its own task. <br /> Despite its brilliant twists and turns; Detroit falls on a basic topic, and those characters. The film fails to provide a preferred role, and it is difficult to take care of the story when you're not roping for any player. It did not help through acting. Michael Caine is placed in good and fun performance as you expect, but no one will be proud of you. Christopher Reeve is embarrassing in his role, but Diane Cannon can play a role that only hates the apparently frustrating performance. It's lucky because the story is good; And it is good enough to save the picture. This plot has plenty of turns and turns; Some people work better than others, but enough to ensure that the film is interesting. Director Sidney Lettette deserves some credit because the film's style is another huge plus. The central position is interesting in its own right and cinematography is well suited. Overall, I have to admit that I enjoyed this film; But this could be a lot better.
