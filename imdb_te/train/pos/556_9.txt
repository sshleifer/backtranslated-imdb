Cowboys James Stewart and Walter Brennan used the suit to sink their share in Alaska and Canada. Once there, they have to be strong with a seductive, shifty entrepreneur Ruth Roman and ice-cold, cheerful-go-lucky villain James McIntyre <br /> <br /> John Wayne may have talked more, but some excellent, hard- Edge Western also, with some great director Anthony Mann. <br /> <br /> There are some breathtaking scenery and cinematography in the movie The Far Content Wide Screen. <br /> <br /> Also, the reliable Brennan, the Roman (who is the greatest), the most beautiful Corin Culvert, and James McIntyre, they are the bad guy of my favorite forms, <br /> <br /> It is another highly recommended man / Stewart makes a double bill with northwest-set Western, Bend of the River.
