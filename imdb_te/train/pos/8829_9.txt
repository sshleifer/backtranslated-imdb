More directors like Nacho Vigalondo need more of their talents. 7:35 De La Manana is the perfect genius. Nacho can tell in about 8 minutes, some hollywood stars will take hours to paint. I see this laughing, but do not feel a little dirty on the sexual path. How can you feel after seeing this 8 minutes? Nugget. I've got fun, but at the same time disturbed. Only a lot of people can not do in just 8 minutes. It starts off easily enough. One of the young ladies arrived for breakfast in her usual space. She sits down and begins to sing someone. From there, the film takes you through a very different emotion. It is black & white, but it helps with the feeling that the film gives you. The film depends on how you want to know more about characters, how they interact in the past and how their lives are later impacted. I guess as an old saying, "I want more of them", Nacho can do that. Keep this in mind. Show it to your friends and wonder how 8 minutes is so fun how to take off your clothes.
