I've seen this movie a long time ago in Sky Movie .. I must admit, it's a good Western potter with 2 big names .. On one hand, the infamous and retired lawyer Samuel Burded. On the other .. finally James Coburn playing villain Zach Provo .. no price asking for revenge on the burgage .. <br /> <br /> The good thing about this film is that some really good characters. <br /> <br /> Many actors have done well in this film, especially James Coburn, which seems really understandable in the movie .. but how is it? <br /> I saw Christopher Mitchell in every other movie I played the role of Hall Brickman .. I thought his character was cool, but he was able to get himself back by comparing Barroda. In all, it's a great movie .. Very good to see .. Great score from Gold Smith at the end .. <br /> <br /> The amazing part of the Western character ..! 10 to 8.
