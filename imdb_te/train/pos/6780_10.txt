Coleman's performance is greatly helped by a scripted script. Hollywood studios in the 30s and 40s copied some of the elements of the German Expressionistic film and included them into Hollywood films. Good use of shadows and light and silhouette. I initially liked the scene that Kollaman brought to light in his dressing room at the beginning of the film, when he was immediately dark and unhappy when he was on the face. The viewer already sees the text and drama Shakespeare "Tony" and sees off when he goes on his journey to Doom. I also enjoyed a dramatic death scene in the play, tired of emotions and tries to cope with his custody unexpectedly hard to cope with. She said she was "chasing me hitting me" with chilling and curiosity. You just do not know if he's going to go up and kill her at any time. The cat and mouse chase were well documented to expose the killer, which included the film's 2 / 3RDs filmed well and added to the heroic element of the film. Master work from George Cooker. He is a talented director. Wonderful picture. Not too bad they em make em as they used to ...
