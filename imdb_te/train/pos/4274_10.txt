I like this film too, but it's true that you do not understand it, except from Yugoslavia. Many of the actors died and are the best actors in the former Yugoslavia. The film is now in the Divx and I have it in my collection. Macedonia. Serbia. Montenegro. Bosnia and Herzegovina. Croatia. <br /> <br /> All this is a melting pot of the Yugoslavia and Balkan countries. This could be a dream land if Slobodan Malozivik, Franjo Tudzman and other nationalists could not afford the mind of the nation with the thoughts in their mind.
