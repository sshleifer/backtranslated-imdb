I really liked this version of 'Vanishing Point' against the 1971 version. I found the 1971 version very boring. I'm a bit in the middle of a movie (as I did with the 1971 version), but it's not so great. In fact, when I brought the 1971 reform, I could be only nine years old. Nevertheless, I saw many reconstructions, where I loved the original and the old. I found the story of the 1997 version more understandable and basically kept the original meaningless without cutting the meaning of the 1971 version. In my opinion, I felt the 1997 version had more enthusiasm and was not "blaze". (Boring)
