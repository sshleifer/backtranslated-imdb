Must see your fan of airplane type movies! Johnny Dangerous in the 1920s and 30s is the greatest actors but great lines set. "Hit the wall, hit the wall and beat the # @ $% # @ $ wall." "You can not hang me in a hook johnny" or "sounds like jones frying". This is definitely a spoof of old James Cogny Movies and a lot of them. Jhonnys is a great scene when a priest is running down the death penalty and setting up for his escape. Listen closely to the readings of fake priests, its pretty funny. Another great scene is playing the Dome Deloose Pope. After Pope's reaction to Johnny, he said that after the Pope, many did not make a noise. I recommend this movie for all the laughing or old film fans.
