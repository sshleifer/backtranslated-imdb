When a small hobbit inherits a magic ring from his uncle, Frodo Baggins, Wizard Gandel investigates and finds that the ring is the oldest creation of an evil black lord. When the ring is back in his hands, he will recover his power and destroy the middle ground. Frodo and his loyal friends participated in a quest to destroy the ring with a band warrior. This applies only to the first half of the story, which is inspired by the classic novels. <br /> <br /> Animation is amazingly rotated with rotoscope, which appears on live action footage. Ralph Bakshi worked well with the low budget he gave. Leonard Rosenman, who fits each scene, provided great music for the film. There are some plot holes with the script, but it has to be avoided, considering the original deal is to make the trilogy of the book into two movies, the very first one came crammed. Designed with my big stomach pain character, Samit is a bit too goofy, while other hobbits work entirely normal. Other characters actually wrote well for the screen, and voice actors do a great job, I was pleased that the Legolas plot was actually a bit more useful. <br /> <br /> Another problem is that the evil wizard is Sarman Aruman, thanks to the writers. Overall, I think a little more money and better writers will do justice, but there is something lovely about it. Ralph Baksh made an attempt to make a screen simulation of these classic stories. The film is seriously disturbed by live motion pictures, but it is still a great movie for all ages animated lovers.
