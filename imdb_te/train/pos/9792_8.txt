Once a year "comes" is an image and makes things easy for you. It's just that you did not try to think it's good. You'll enjoy it when you see it, and you take it home. I can not say totally flawless, but it's near. Acting - with great, story-interested and suspense elements. It's a small family story, pretty much speculative, but it's not the secret of things. It's the way the blind girl takes to reach. I was impressed by the director's depiction of their deepest relationship (the blind girl and her cousin). The only thing I do not like is the actress who plays the mother, she is very tough and without need. Keren
