The film is exceptional in the idolatry of Gay and has spread beyond music and cast. Child whales are awesome as the whole picture is seen in the eyes of the main character. Her heartfelt sense of the world around us is funny and beautiful. In a way it is a slacker image for girls. You have to watch a fun mid-night movie that will relax this movie. If you like the diferent media world and combined (?) This purchase.
