It's about love, a strange, yet something impressive story. Honestly, I can never run such twist-off story in real life. <br /> <br /> It is a story that promises to be "ill" from the title. But, after I saw it, I could not get the feeling of "illness", which is related to community rules. It is beautiful in this film ... I'm not using any moral or community rules in impressive. <br /> <br /> The film focuses more on the relationship between Kiki and Alex. You can see how this relationship starts, evolves and finally ends. You love this blossom, the first tragedy, the moves. You feel the connection. And this moment I am immortal. Finally you can expect it not to break ... it does not break ... it's not right. <br /> <br /> But I have added a negative spin to this comment ... I do not know if the story is not somehow * These relationships are meant to give the impression that they are only ill in form, but not in the content. You do not have a whole story, but only fragments. When the movie starts, the relationship between Kiki and the circle is already in place. So, no clue about the nature of the relationship. You feel a tension between them ... fighting between love and the desire to break the relationship. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that this film is a kayaki: "I want to stop ... if you love me, I'm asking you" <br /> <br /> This film may move some questions. What is love and morality ... and where is the limit between them. The idea of ​​the film is that "love is for all ... social and moral standards" or "love is beautiful ... no matter how or where". But in my opinion, this film is already a success for the simple reason that makes you think ...
