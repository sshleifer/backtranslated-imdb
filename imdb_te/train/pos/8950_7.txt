Jimmy Stewart is one of his "low" films in his career for those who do not know you. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak is a witch, when compared to his other pictures, it's not bad, it's not bad - not the pastor. In New York City and for some different reasons, she decides to put a spell on poor Jimmy to make her fall in love with her. Over time, cold and detached Ms. Novak also begins to fall in love with Stewart - and apparently in the book of Witch's book, this is a perfect NO, NO !! <br /> <br /> In the case of witches, the film is different. They are not baby sacrifices or all powerful sources. Their magic is pretty restrictive and meaningless (using his powers to turn off street lights such as Jack Lemmon). And, quite unusual, witches all seem to be bohemians who hang out in hip bars where you might be wearing barefoot and listening to crappy jazz. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film is pretty romantic and courageous, but I do not have to look at it. Acting is very beautiful, but the script does not offer enough pay to make this extraordinary film - in fact, I almost did picture 6 - it's really close.
