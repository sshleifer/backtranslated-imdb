Ghosts that still feel you are one of those films that you strongly and do not let go to the end, especially when you look like a child. Seeing this movie as an adult, it's not really that scary, but the story is so lovely and great mysterious scenes (especially with creepy mommy). One of the best scenes in the film is the scene in their new RV with grandfather and grandma; The scene with rocks is very spectacular and pretty scary. <br /> <br /> Okay, the acting is not very great, and the film sometimes gets a little irritable, but overall the fun is fun ghosts. Many bad people have seen this movie and this film is really good. I wanna say: Mr. Flaker, you have done a good job! And Hollywood producers are there. If you want to remake an image, remake this picture!
