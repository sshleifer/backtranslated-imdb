For some reason I really like this movie, I'm late, but I think why I think why I like it. First, there are people who would like to hate Tom Cruise. I really do not understand. Second, Cameron Crow I think the two groups of movie-goers with this film will successfully p *** es. At the end of the film, the plot is "confused" when the plot is full 180, alive, relaxed, "very strongly thought". <br /> <br /> When Crow explains the mystery of one of his characters, and deep, philosophical, mystery-fans have been destroyed. <br /> This is a good movie. And Tom Cruise makes it a very good job. I can not see all of his movies, or most of them probably do not see his best performance from what I've seen. Supporting cast is good. Penelope Cruz offers a great performance and Jason Lee enjoyed. <br /> I love this story, and I think that Vanilla Sky is nothing more than anything. It's a mystery, an adventure, and a romantic comedy movie, but it's a very good story. And it has many philosophical ideas, and many such ideas and stories take place in historical philosophy. David Aims (Cruise) has everything he wants, more or less lost, a second chance with a catch to retrieve it, eventually facing a full range of his demons and what's going on. <br /> <br /> Many were discouraged, Crowe finally finished He was disappointed that he built the mystery. I think I need it. <br /> <br /> Audience is beyond the shadow of doubt that David will learn about his circumstances, and it makes it more powerful. <br /> <br /> The music in this movie is great. It is probably what makes the film as enjoyable. In particular, Cigar Rose "Njosnavelin", which is a wonderful song. <br /> I give 4 stars for everything. It's a movie with some material for those who like to think through things, and a great story for those looking to relax. Perhaps it is probably a "moderate" approach to why it is not quite as full of mystical mystery or a full-fledged love story. It adds and matches different elements and genres.
