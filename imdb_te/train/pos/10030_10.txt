What is not explainable First, hate this movie. It may not be a great movie all the time, but a break gimme, it got 11 oscars for a reason, it made hundreds of millions of dollars for a reason. This is a good movie. This will bring other anxiety factor. I do not know why the film left me with such an impression when I saw in theaters. I did it again on TV and video, and there was no effect on seeing it on the big screen (twice, or three times, actually). But it could be the appeal of it. It's a movie, yes, the capital M is an Epic, it's a fun in the order of Gone with the Wind or Ben Her. Now, I have a lot of hockey with Ben Hur and Gone with the Wind hammers acting and over-drama. There is no one in that titanic. Well, acting is actually very good. <br /> <br /> This is an emotional ride due to the Titanic work. I usually enjoy mind-blowing movies, or give me a visual thrill. This film is not exactly dumb, but it's not cerebral. To lift the audience's emotions, the final scenes mean just one end. When Bambi's mother died I was not crying, I was suffering from tears. But it's a tear to a ten million power, an emotional roller coaster, if it's a common one, Buzz Aldrin becomes a little girl. And if you see in the video, if you hate it and have a ready distribution of hate, I'm sure you will not be able to like this movie. But if you give this confidence the purpose of the play suspicion, if the infidelity is slightly suspended, you will enjoy it completely. And look at the top ten collections of all time. Is one of them bad? Is one of them worth 10 to 1 score? No, not even Phantom Menace. And the film made $ 1.8 billion worldwide. This is not bad. It is not possible. <br /> p.s. How can anyone compare it to Spiderman? Spiderman is a fun movie, but it's a total 9/11 mokeric, which has reached the maximum level. It's just not unique. No one will remember it in 50 years. But I'm pretty sure Titanic will be remembered.
