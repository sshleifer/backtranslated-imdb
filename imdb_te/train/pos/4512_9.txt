I saw this movie today and I say, it's better than what I had imagined two hours before I saw it. Personally I have some disagreement with its language, but it completely changed my thinking. The film is surprisingly good with great actor and actresses. It's the story of a boy in a dream and everybody to reach everything. This really touched me and persuaded me to be a film based on a true story. A new school, a mental principal and a new teacher, is a little different compared to others and a young boy who knows about their struggles even if they do not work. It showed how much things can make big changes in small things, and how the difference can sometimes cause difficult situations. Also I think the actor's choices certainly succeeded. You've really seen some people looking for episodes as an outsider when they happened. Prior to spoiling this film with appreciation, I have to admit that I did not actually see and experience certain things and situations. School Principal, Fox Aka At the end of the film, Martin pre-class. He was really badly beaten, but the only thing that caused him to do was to compare the blood from the nose to the first blow in the beginning, with frits slightly stitched. .. To say, if I find this DVD from the store somewhere, it's definitely something, I will take it with me.
