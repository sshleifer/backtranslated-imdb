<br /> <br /> Without one of my favorites, it's good for a pace change ... only a few minutes. <br /> <br /> It is all named Tom, Jerry and Spike where the name "Buch" is changed). They have beaten each other, but suddenly Spike takes a heroic and admirable decision: he ceases fighting and suggests that they all be friends. So, all signed the peace treaty and became friends ... It's not long lasting. <br /> Meanwhile, the three are mutually exclusive, patient and kind. When one of them is in danger, they also protect one another. Very big steak looks and relationship until they all become greedy, but amazing but nothing goes. <br /> <br /> And yet ... for a while, I feel really happy and grateful to see friends like Tom, Jerry and Spike. <br /> <br /> Oh, as an interesting factor, there are two songs from "The Wizard of Oz": "We're To See The Wizard" and "Rainbow".
