I live in Rallons when I created this film, and I got lucky to work on it. Additional effects and special effects with Eddy Surkin. Behind the scene shows scenes, the electric chair is coming from Barbarer to the Valley's office floor. It's also fun to meet all the actors from the Viggo to the smallest. The gate that was cut to the prison wall for this film is still called "Disney Gate" by locals. If anyone is interested and never in Ralin, most sets of movies still exist and can be found in a self-guided tour. It's a pleasure to work with R and Hornin and I have the chance to do it again.
