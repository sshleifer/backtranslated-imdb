Although the film is filled with eight cheeses, I have a space for my DVD rack and I do not know why. The moral of the story is 'because the television is worse, so stop it and a life will last'. You have to try to read the book for those of you who have decided to comply with the message, as nothing in the movie. At the end of this story, it ends with a damaged wounded Richard's plane crashing down to kill you, killing each one and closing the network at the same time. I have read many years ago but today it can not compare to 9/11.
