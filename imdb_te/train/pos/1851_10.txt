The film opened for the first time in August at the 27th Annual National Association of Black Journalists Convention in Milwaukee, WI. The film is great !!! Derek Luke is fantastic as Anton Fischer. This young actor is in a very bright future. Real Anton Fischer did a great job of writing a movie and Dengel directed on money. Start it over the weekend. Do not be disappointed.
