I thought Mrs. Wonder wrote greatly. It's not about entertainment. There are tons of sensitive messages I'd like to try to bring throughout Yasmin. And yes, you may have some confusing (especially if you do not see 76 times Sepet and / or Gubra). /> <br /> I watched how they use the characters from the two movies in front of the right? Its counterculture is how the characters really relate. The dominant neighbors are a prostitute from Gubra. And the chic future on the snooker pad is the sacred future of the man and the man's wife. <br /> <br /> I definitely loved voice over. Its crude is still awesome. Like, when they hit a shot with the board of Rumah Tumpangan Gamin, then suddenly Mukhsin's voice is said 'Bismillahhirrahmannirrahim ..' (when he reached the tree when the scene reached the tree). <br /> <br /> It is portrayed in the role of the Malaysian attitude (and in some softness, which is how curious it is). For example, even kids are really sharp tongued (full with annoying voice) and just the bad word PPL may be the length of all cinema. And how you talk about when you intervene in such affairs and not when PPL, ur own life. <br /> <br /> All I can say is, this film is totally reached if my expectation is not exceeded. <br /> <br /> <br /> It's a gorgeous one, and I can not even see my eyes. Do not do the film too. Ha ha
