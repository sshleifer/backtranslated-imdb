Why are other comments on Makkahahi? He is a very interesting film actor. <br /> <br /> The best part of the film is the writing and the wit. Alfred Molina and Patrick McGow make extraordinary funny duo, not stack types. <br /> The version I have seen in HDNET and the Spanish dialog is subtitle, so this is definitely not a problem. Spanish use gives more authenticity. <br /> <br /> A very poorly estimated film executed the IMDB members with an unusually low score. I thought it was fun and interesting and worth 7 years. Lots of discerning movies with high scores and making big money at the box office are less interesting.
