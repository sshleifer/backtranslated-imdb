At the last minute, I was fully involved in the film. It is brilliantly portrayed with lots of interesting and original camera angles and techniques. The plot is surrounded by a deaf woman, friends and colleagues alike. She hires an assistant in her work and finds love with her real intention. She takes advantage of a former con and avenge those who hurt her. Instead she needs lip reading skills. The film is a darker film to the Noir, with incredible spectacular scenes and a better ending. The real beauty of the film comes from the way of taking advantage of the leading character's disability. The use of sound keeps the tension steady, and dramatic changes from silence to noise make blood transmitted, which is perfect. In a little black comedy of romantic sexual repression and quarrels of logical feelings you've got the constructions of a great movie. It wants to be really sort of film Hollywood, but not just.
