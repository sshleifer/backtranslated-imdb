. . But this is in a UHF channel and the reception is very cumbersome. I first saw in the movie because I really liked the movie because I was a bus driver and when I saw the movie, I was driving the model bus. It was only (during his murder investigation after 15 years) that I was amazed that OJ was one of the stars. I only recalled that he was the 'driver and the bus's' and driven wildly. Nobody benefited from this film since I saw it in the mid 80s. I liked the movie, I usually saw thrillers, but after reading the summary in the TV Guide, I started the whole thing (even though it was not).
