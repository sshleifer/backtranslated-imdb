I did not expect the powerful filmmaking experience of "Girlfight". It is an indie; Low budget, no big name actors, freshman director. <br /> <br /> In a contemporary, ethnic, working-class Brooklyn, Kareen has done extraordinary work to seize daily combat in the town of Cusam. Latinos. Diana, journalist, angry and eyelids at her high school members, and with school and her friends suffer. She is raised by her single father, who appears to love her father and her brother, but a strict, sex-based double standard on her children applies. The father's double standard, the younger brother, takes boxing lessons at the local gym, but Diana denies such attempts. At a turn in the small gym, Diana is fascinated by boxing. He does not like small boxing, so he and Diana commercial places; <br /> <br /> Diana needs lessons in his lesson after earning money from Diana. <br /> <br /> Diana is growing up, learning about her through boxing, and addressing some very serious problems head. There's no giggly, 'go to everything that goes right' clarity a la "Bend It Like Beckham". Individual issues of reality and attendance are great for the Pat resolutions, but in my opinion, "Girlfight" is a good and more satisfying film.
