I like the movie. Jeremy Jordan is one of my favorite characters in Twisted Desire and one of the most impressive actors. Melissa Jon Hart is a good actress. I've seen so many movies but all of Jeremy Jordan. I was reluctant about Twisted Desire when "Nick" was arrested and "Jennifer" rats out of him. Twisted wish is my second favorite movie. My first is The Goodies. But I still love Jeremy Jordan.
