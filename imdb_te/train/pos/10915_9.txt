RKO Studios decided to take William Powell from MGM and Jean Arthur from Columbia to be one of their biggest budgetary efforts to garner the popularity of Thin Man. <br /> <br /> In addition to Nick Charles, many people forget that Bill Powell has also starred in some Philo Vance films as the title character. At this point he is beautiful in character. Dr. Bradford does not have many liquid meals like Nick Charles, but the basic blas√© Nick still exists. One difference is that Dr. Bradford lives as a doctor when Nick Charles marries an heir. It helps in the sponsorship of the detective and actually does it in the film. <br /> He has two murders to solve. A jockey comes into a horse race with a large breed of homelessness and dies without any obvious reason. The tutor suspects something of an attempt, but he is hit in a more traditional manner of bullet. <br /> <br /> Marna Lai has shown a more sustainable effect on Bill Powell than Jean Arthur. Dizzy dame more than Arthur Loye. <br /> <br /> Previously, James Gleason is a police inspector in the role of Sam Leven / Not Pendleton. <br /> <br /> When we saw Pavel and Arthur signing in the studio, we saw the whole of Bradford movies killed.
