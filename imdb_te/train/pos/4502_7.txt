I've seen almost all Cynthia Rothrock movies, and for me it's ridiculous. It reminds me of the first Jackie Chan films. However, Ms Rothrock may not be a great actress, but she is very good to be a martial artist and a very pretty young woman. The film is very entertaining, even though it is not the best of all the movies.
