I do not imagine by shooting a family as I feel I'm living in this film now. They are normal meat and blood people, not like ordinary Hollywood fare. Weakening illness - they are experiencing a very common problem. But the story-line grips the heart with a powerful lesson. Cast, script, direction and acting flow together draw the deep viewer in the story. Give this picture your full attention and its message really stimulates.
