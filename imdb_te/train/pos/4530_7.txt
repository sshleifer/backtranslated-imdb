D.W. After the massive financial success of 'The Birth of a Nation', Griffith was able to do any film; He chose to be the most technically prestigious film of the day, 'dissatisfaction.' He took an accident with such inventions in the film Montez and the form, and resulted in the famous financial rail ruins. Buster Keaton may not be at risk with 'Three Aces', a parody of 'impatience'. This was Keaton's first film, his own film (he only appeared in 'The Sap Head'). The film has a plan to divide the three-part division into three different short films, with Griffith's 'intolerance'. Keaton does not. <br /> <br /> Chaplin has already been successful with lengthy comedy films, so if Keaton is taking a risk here, it is totally calculated. <br /> <br /> Chaplin has previously done another movie's comedy, (1915). Keeton also knows the film. In the ancient Rome episode wrestling scenery refers to the stabling of a wrestling competition in Chaplin's film. The comedy distance from the two scenes plot is the same, too. Furthermore, Chaplin's film mimicked DemiLe's 'gimmings' glossy style and Chaplin's film tribute to the film. Keaton did not attempt radical editing, heroic structure or memorable nature in his simulation, although it was dignified even though it was 'impatient'. At least, these stories are not entirely straightforward as other post-insolorance films such as Drew's 'Satan's Book' (Blade at Sans Pogg, 1921) and Fritz Lang's Destiny (Der Made Todd, 1921). <br /> <br /> Keaton is in his physical, daredevil comedy, taking risks. That Keaton was unexpectedly failing to jump across buildings in the modern part. According to the report, he persuaded to change the scene rather than trying to jump. And, it's not only Keaton's dangers; The unhealthy baseball gag is dangerous, for example. Thus, despite Keaton, Griffith, he took risks with his big image. And, I think they both succeeded.
