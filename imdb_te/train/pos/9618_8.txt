I recently bought this movie and I am very happy to actually add this film to my collection. Matt Manfredi and Phil Hay, film directors, took less than a month in the film and spent 1 million euros to build this great picture. This proves that big productions make only great images. <br /> <br /> The title of this movie is perfectly suited. In computer language BUG is a program error that causes reactions in computer function. Our reactions cause these negative disadvantages, but may be the greatest moments of beauty. In the film reguwinary events begin with the death of BUG. <br /> <br /> I'm John Carroll Lynch ("Fargo"), Wallace, can not do everything right.
