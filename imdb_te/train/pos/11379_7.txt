Blood Castel (screenshot of the Demon Lover, Blood Fatty, Evaña - Best, but at least the extortion cinematic-sounding title and etc.) is a very traditional Gothic romance film. It's big, creepy castles, headstrong young woman, a mysterious old man, hinter's hints and supernatural, and romantic elements in the contemporary sense of the genre. It's very deliberate and this means it works best for low-profile horror shields for big fans. If you like images like Robert Wise's The Haunting (1963), you may also have a taste for Spanish and Italian horror in the late 1960s / 1970s, and you may also like Blood Castle. <br /> <br /> Baron Janus Dalmer (Carlos Quinine) lives in a large castle on the outskirts of a traditional, unincorporated European village. The locals scare him because when he loads a woman, she will soon die - consensus that he sets the terrible dogs on them. This is a very problem because Baron has a very healthy appetite for women. <br /> Meanwhile, Dr. Ivana Rokowski (Erna Scourer) is a Baron Dollar's fortress appearing at the village center. She has an out-of-town town where Baron has been appointed for her expertise in chemistry. Of course, no one wants to go near the castle. Finally, this is a shadowy man (who also shadier) learns to take her. Once there, a strange woman living in the castle of Olga (Christina Galona) rejected this, and she says that she is a woman so she should not be there. Let Baron Dalmer be her. She ends up, but somewhat reluctant. Baron's brother, Igor, hired her to oppose the effects of the severe burning syndrome. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Baron's brother is just the flesh of the bitter, black liquid. And yet, this is a strange, illusion dreams. What's going on in the castle? Baron's responsibility for crimes? He is mad? <br /> <br /> "As I mentioned, the film is very intentional at its speed and is very small and I can go on such topics. I do not care (yes, I'm in a very small minority), but I'm a big fan of the European horror of the 1960s and 1970s, one of my favorite directors, Mario Bava. I love you, but occasionally, blood chassis sometimes shakes me slowly. <br /> <br /> It is not too big to speak with the scenes that walk down the castle corridors with scenes. Jose Luis Merino has managed more than acceptable sets and places, and they are well adapted by Emanuelle de Cola Edit. However, Blood Castle has a relatively low budget, and Roger Corman-structured film, everything (that is usually a low-budget, often with surprisingly high quality "speed"). When there is a lushness of colors and complex set decoration, everything is very small. However, the retrovirate print that I viewed looks like a 30-year-old photograph that has been abandoned in the sun. <br /> Furthermore, Merino and De Cola rarely built fantastic scenes. For example, a scene of Evanahna in a dark hall is filmed from an exaggerated angle and an important plot element only gets out of the shadows on the wall. <br /> <br /> The performances are great, and the ladies are just attractive and dragging your eye into the frame, there are also amazingly blocked twin indir Bergmansque shots with actors suggesting complicated relationships. - especially Schürer - very attractive. Merino utilizes this fact by incorporating a good amount of nudity. Other Words for Prayer (1974), Naked and Lustful (1974), strip nude (English titles) for your killer, 1975) and erotic exploits of a sexy seductor (1977). Blood Castle is very good, but with nudity, there are still rape and slavery, and sex and death scenes. </ P> <br /> The main attraction here is, however, perhaps the slowest combustion romance story. Finally, the horror elements, mystery elements and some unexpected twist bonuses, but ultimately, Blood Castle is a love story that combines a couple with different difficulties and contradictions (often with physical threats or harm).
