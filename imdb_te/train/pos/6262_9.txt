It is hard to believe that "incredible tribe" makes this incredible migration twice a year, and that filmmakers, Cooper and Scudesack did not make some shots and shots. But what shots they do! <br /> <br /> Cinematography is in serious condition. The documentary added to the sensational and Iranian music video release provided an additional valuable documentary. <br /> <br /> This and the weekend of "Can Tiki" is a thrill, see exactly how it will be tough and hardy and brave people, whether for primitive survival or adventure or in the name of science.
