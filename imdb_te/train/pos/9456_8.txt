Their naked grin (Man Bites Dog) or their complete violence (most peekingpa movies), unlike many other images that are disturbed by Deliverance obstacles by its interval. Certainly, the innocent scene is pretty straightforward in its lovely, but the image's effect has come a lot from the distinct sense of the surrounding four leads, both before and after its fault slowly and everything leads. When passing on the bridge over Canossa Child, he does not admit that he was playing with the previous music, even showing signs of human love in the most vulnerable in the modern film. The last time will be gradually rising throughout the crucifixion, even after the final credits, continuous - the ending of the characters makes the scary reality realistic. The film's ability is mainly through Ned Beatty and Joan Voyett as the main victim and reluctant hero. Burt Reynolds is not good too. The film's cultural impact is demonstrated by people who understand the 'banjo landscape' - Carter has certainly done a satisfactory happy job on a region's tourism industry. I can only think of movies that put me on such a serious recession after I finished - Se7en's oppressive atmosphere is the best comparison I feel. Although it looks good, it does not match, because it is typical.
