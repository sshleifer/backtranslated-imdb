Eddie Murphy spends his time looking for lost children, so when a very special magical baby is kidnapped in Tibet, Sexy Charlotte Lewis asks for his help to keep these children from the victim. The story is a bit crazy, it is very ridiculous throughout, despite the comedy of joy throughout the film; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Golden Child is very funny, action pack and is very perfectly compelling in a beautiful, almost magic. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
