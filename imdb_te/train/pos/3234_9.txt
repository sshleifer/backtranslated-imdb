I thought it was a very clever cinema. I was very glad and really did not ask for more. Actually I own the movie because I did not come back to anyone ... what to do, but I really want to keep what I enjoyed. Moreover, I do not own many foreign films, this is the first. Now, I personally love the Finnish stuff, I absolutely added how much I enjoyed. But overall, looking at its value. <br /> <br /> However, if you do not have enough amount to understand or do not try to read the subtitle bid, the film is not for you. <br /> Definitely 9/10.
