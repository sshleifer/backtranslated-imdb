Most of the film's plot, spectacular acting performance, script, melancholy, sweet weather, fantastic direction is written - what can I add? Looking for a lot of heart warming, beautifully acted, sharp scenes ever shot. This is the role of Christmas Eve and Frank Morgan (shop owner - Mr. Mathewscheck) from his broken marriage and suicide attempt. He invites his employees to the Christmas dinner. He denied each of them respectfully. They have plans for their own Christmas Eve. At this stage, this moving scene is deep pain. Frank Morgan gives his career performance and this scene brings me tears. Fortunately we are happy with this special scene. The new employee, the little boy, was the last to exit the shop into a beautiful snow-street scenery. Seriously Mr. Matuschek approaches this boy and asks him how he can spend the evening with him, he will have to treat him with all the wonderful Christmas food he probably did not see this little boy! To engage the chop, he is also alone with Matthews and together they have a wonderful Christmas meal. Every time I see this scene, it moves me. You introduced a delightful DVD look with Mr. Frank Morgan to Mr. Muttuschek and appeared as director Ernst Lubitz's director. The film is from the beginning to the end.
