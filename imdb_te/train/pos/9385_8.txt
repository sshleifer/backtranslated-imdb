Red Rock West is a good example of how good a movie is with a budget. All you need is a smart script, good actors and loads of atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Nick Cage plays a former sea pirate in Lebanon, who falls to his last 5 dollars after refusing his worst knee job in an oil field. <br /> <br /> He played a role in Red Rock and was broken by Barten Wayne (JT Walsh, his most terrible but still scary) for Hitman from Texas. <br /> <br /> He looks like a burglary to kill his wife. When he arrives there, she should just check her out. She offers a double to kill the vin. Cage just wants to leave the town with his liberty and leave sparring lovers. But a series of pitfalls and setbacks back and forth for him, red yoke and out yo-yoing results. Eventually, this leads to Lail's run from Dallas (a cheeky and somewhat sympathetic Dennis Hopper), a real hitman from Texas that helps him get the plot more complicated. RRW has never had a much bigger release, so many viewers have found it on video or cable TV shows. It looks like a TV movie like this, but it's bigger than that. The soft, slower-time direction, mood score and no desert air theaters are made for a great movie, but it's best for you today to watch the DVD on a larger HDTV. The only weird point I feel is the boring femme fatale of Laura Flynn Boyle with the evil dyke-ish hairdo. I certainly will not come for her but you'll agree if you assume that Nick Cage's character is terrorist lesbians.
