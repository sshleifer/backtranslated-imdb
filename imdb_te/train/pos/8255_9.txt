<br /> As previously pointed out, this is not a very real zombie movie, but it is a real comedy. Sweet satire to sweep sweet sarcasm. While some bloody scenes are essential, the film is almost nothing and as the film is presented (feel-good 50), I can not imagine that Fido & his fellow victims are scared. Although the cast is generally good, I thought that Mass and Nelson stood out. Humor is not your face, but is in possession; There are a lot of attention to the attention and I am attracted by the smile of the movie. It is not exactly the film's masterpiece, but it will not be hard - instead, Currie succeeds in providing a hearty black comedy.
