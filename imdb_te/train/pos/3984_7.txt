As part of the celebration for the release of Casino Royale, the film is shown by director Roger Mitchell (Notting Hill) with the new Bond. I was almost off it being a bit boring, but I'm glad I was stuck with it. Mainly May (Anne Reid) is the only mother of Helen (Anna Wilson-Jones), who does not see anyone and has a boyfriend over the years. She wants to marry her daughter Darren (Daniel Craig course). After only a few days, May and Darren have a secret affair. And at her age, with a 30-something, and with a new bond?! Anyway, they want to keep a secret apparently, but if Helen will find it May have regrets and wonders. When she does, Darren gets less hassle than May. In fact, Helen asks her permission to beat her. Toots was also starring Peter Vaughn, starring Danieira Gavich Au Peir, Harry Mitchell Harry, Rossi Michel Rossi and Johnny English's Oliver Ford Davis Bruce. Very nice!
