As an employee of the Swedish Air Force I enjoyed the nice Gripeen and Hkp 9 (MBB Bo 105) flight scenes in the film. In this trouble, EWS 39 is a jammer pad, one of the few disappointments, in one case an anrt Rb 75 (Maverick) missile in black with "EWS 39" letters in black. <br /> <br /> But, rather, it's an entertaining film with a very fun ending (last minute). There are many Swedish military units that have shown interest to anyone, and now the SSG of the theme can be seen. <br /> <br />
