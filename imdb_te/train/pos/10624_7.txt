I wanted to get my place after reading other reviews. The picture is not great, but it has great stuff. Lighting and scenes with camera work are great. The story is slow and weak, but entertaining. Acting is very bad, but it's worse than you will find on the Syfy Channel. The music is great and Gore is good. The film has a great leather face and is produced by Bruce Campbell. Although I have seen the whole movie and are more speculative, it's still fun. Women are attractive enough and the main actor is doing a good job of brewing and creepy. The film is a modern film and suitable for children aged 13 and older. No sex scenes. I've given it from 10 to 7 and I think it's fair. I will see that I can not do anything again. The most annoying aspect of the gay noisy angel image, the devil is very creepy.
