Comfortable I'm coming to I'm Curious (yellow) and it's a companion of great tremors. I read a number of reports on the controversial and explicit sexual relationships that I have broadly promoted. I do not have anything, but it's a completely irritating and enthusiastic film experience. Most of the commentators who viewed the film portrayed the film as 'slums' or 'boring' as pornography. Perhaps this pornography, the concept of pornography something titens, but it is intentionally un-romantic. Lena, the protagonist, throws her the realism and humanity she has in her performance, which is just convincing and eternal. Her breasts may be aromatic, her nipples are unusually large, her thighs are fat, and her face, chubby. But by the end of the film, the audience came to recognize her, and she accepted the flaws as human. This touch requires more confidence. If the director is a brigade bardot, then the effect is removed. I can not recommend more of this thought-provoking piece. Be prepared to invest so many ideas in this deliberately picturized movie. The patient and the usual viewer will be completely rewarded as many other movies are dreamed of.
