First, I liked this film. <br /> <br /> I can not understand the comments I heard from people about the surprising ending. I do not know anything except some "gotta-watching" recommendations about this film, but I know this plot in ten minutes. (I did not mention the fact that others do not spoil a good film.) Even though it's obvious, I've been watching. <br /> <br /> If you have played any role in all of the films, it is good to see how the role motivations in the next scenes. <br /> <br /> When I imagined at the beginning of the film, I hate it. <br /> <br /> "He's powerful and believable in everything I've seen. <br /> <br / > Rogerov Dawson is a solid actress who plays a brief, rather upbeat role, despite a terminal heart condition. <br /> If you can not find her, you will want to replace your eyes. <br /> <br /> Woody Harrelson returns to the screen I was not too late to see him, But it was only me .Voody did not have a screenshot time, but his precious, piano-playing, he sold for selling the Blind Man. <br /> <br /> A small bit of research on the jellyfish is its poisoning cardiovascular, neurotoxic And say dermatoncreatic. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is not for platinum, for some very good performances , And I would have to recommend it for the fact that we can induce some tragic emotions that we usually try to avoid.
