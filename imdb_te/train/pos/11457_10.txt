As the jacket declares, the film is "Gorgeously Shot and Shot as Master," and yes, it's mesmerizing. <br /> <br /> We are at the throat and in the uninterrupted Ebblo, the water streams, the timing of what we can see in the transient works from the golden wrist's hands, and their ephemeris to eternity. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " When you rotate the waves, and rotate, stirring, repetitions, starts, and stop, and then start again, seriously rarely, and brings a permanent note of tragedy. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film Golds Worthy said "Words do their job, but here's what I'm doing." I take a guilt and a moment, I think it was a moment, because the combination of form and time, change and shape and color and color and complexity is more than just a combination of the combination of hardwork and unmistakable combination of Golds. <br /> In another case he is "what's to be here ... and what's not." <br /> <br /> In the twentieth century, I am well aware of how some artists compare to the cosmos of space cosmos, how great craft works for cavalry. Thus they began to reflect this understanding by creating intentionally transparent works. <br /> <br /> The idea is that the sense of timelessness of art expresses how low the human weaknesses are. <br /> <br /> The possibility of Golds Worthy's probably is this kind of expression. He painted a few grass or leaves to reach the straw or straw, or it was put on the cut-off river; In this process merges both the composition and its ephemerity. <br /> <br /> We need temporary and timelessness to understand our world and our position. It is important to do these things in the context of nature, so it is set in what is naturally seated. So we know that the walls of the stone and the golden wreath of the stone are silent and solid, and they are not remembered for eternity, but instead for some specific length, to blaze and return. <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> In a sense, Shelley's famous poem "Ozymandias" is her work By his words "answer" and sparring expression as a river, the art of living through its experience, as well as the Tibetan sand paintings are carefully thought out, measured and measured, as they are beautifully and heavily completed, , So we know everything is flux <br /> <br /> In the modern world, these artworks are in the photos and videos, and Golds Worthy is a well-known photographer (I must say) and he tells us all his unsuccessful works, he looks at them in more reflective mood, See what happened and <br /> <br /> Cute and appropriate hunting music by Fred Frith is directed by Thomas Raidlehmer This film is not a mistake. It is one of the most beautiful documentaries I've seen and is one of the most spiritual.
