Esteisti (1933) (USA 1940) is a Handy LaMarr (as Hedy Keisler). <br /> <br /> The first summary of 19-year-old Heidi Lamarr's world is the early moves of this 1930 treasure. The screen in an angelic wedding gown. It started in a legendary career. <br /> It's Eva's (Lamar) wedding night and her old husband is not interested in her romantic progress. She went to a lonely bed and in a beautiful scene, surpassed her for marrying her fidelies with her wedding ring. The husband is more interested in and more in love than in love. Gustav's toughness uses gorgeous camera angles and intuitive shot frames to capture Lagard's considerable talent and beauty. Without the words spoken at the beginning of the film, she can grasp our sympathy, our hearts and our support. This combination was created for those who were watching when the audience in 1930 was shot. <br /> <br /> She returns to her father's estate and divorces. The next day, she wakes up with full sense of freedom and happiness. She had to go outside and feel rural freedom and fresh air. Eva goes on a horse riding and takes place across a beautiful lake. One of the most famous scenes in film history, Haydie Lamarr became the first person ever to be nude in a mainstream film. Scandalous in the lush adventure sports with woods and her bathing in the lake. But the audience could not stay away. <br /> <br /> Like today's films, the controversy has become a must-see film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Eva's unfortunate adventure introduces a young young man who helps her to run her dress on her horse. After an awkward meeting, they eventually come to each other. Their first romantic meeting was as controversial as the nude scene, its blatant waves emotism. However, in these romantic times the work is beautiful. <br /> <br /> Mama creates a happy moment, Emma uses a beautiful early camera trick as literally drowning her new lover. <br /> <br /> How is this demonstration in Lamarre episode? Many people think that it can be a career suicide. Instead, she gained worldwide reputation and attracted Louise B Meyer, who contracted with MGM. There are some really romantic moments in the film, and today's fake standards are also present. It is impossible to imagine how they got in 1930. Again, the magic is very intelligent with his paintings, far away from the imagination. <br /> <br /> Eva's former husband and her current lover meeting is probably inevitable. However, the convention is not a consequence. The film takes some unexpected twists on its final show and makes it a great story and a lovely start to the great stage of Hardy Lamarr for Hedy Lamar. <br /> <br /> I recommend this time controversy this time you urge it in the rest of the Tame movie and the rest of it on DVD. It is only worth it for Happi Lamar seeing happiness. But this story is very reasonable and it's time. <br /> <br /> www.tccandler.com - TC Candor Film Reviews!
