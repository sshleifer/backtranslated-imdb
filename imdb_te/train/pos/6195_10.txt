After seeing this movie months ago, it keeps jumping back into my consciousness and I feel that I have at least 3 times viewed it when I rent it at the time, but I'd like to buy it or at least see it. <br /> <I've been in love with Hall Hart's direction many years ago - I've found that these movies rarely laugh at me in the area of ​​entertainment. It's a strange feeling, granted, and I assume most people do not really get there, or it makes them feel confused and somewhat uncomfortable - I really expect to get it - if these movies have made me I can not remember if I laughed, this is one of the funniest films I've seen over the years. If you do not see the joke of a grocery bag, a film from Fay Street to the publisher of his brother, his son's headquarters, may not be intriguing. <br /> <br /> The bag itself is a silent character, usually as a symbol of motherhood, with a sharp edge that must be brought to her before the international conspiracy of the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> I am "Henry Fool" my favorite favorite of the films of Heart. I honestly do not remember it well - I think the character itself is despicable and I have found it tedious. <br /> <br /> In addition to Possy Prayer, one of my favorite actresses is very happy to see Elina Lovenson. Her eccentric innocence is perfect for Hart's direction. <br /> <br /> The film is the most famous international conspiracy story and describes the political situation in Afghanistan. It was not initially suspected. <br /> <br /> This is the essence of this "stand alone" sequel. If you know about Henry Fool, mystery revolves around him, so little you expect his appearance at the end of the movie - an alcohol chain-smoking complaint machine, harging insults at his Islamic terrorist caretaker. <br /> <br /> If I'm Hartley's recent movies "Girl from Monday" and "No Such Thing", "I'm undoubtedly and satisfied, Fay Grim" is far more than what I expected, Oscar winner with the sense of humor and realism Never be brave.
