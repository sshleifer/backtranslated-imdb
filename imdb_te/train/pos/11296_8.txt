I have personal interest in this film. When I was 17, and from high school I got a job at 20th Century Fox. At the end of my first day (wiping the deck of the aircraft carrier), it was said that the next morning, a suitcase with enough clothes for an hour or two. The next morning I was waiting for the bus, and 20 of us went to San Diego south. The smallest of these we stopped at a military base called Camp Kalan or Camp Han. Once we were in the shade, a few miles in the north went to the Grand Bridge, the big Marine base. There, on the beach, we started building what was considered a Japanese Pacific Island base. It took a week or ten days to complete the installation, including water tank, gun fragments, sand dunes and residential housing. It's very high, sometimes 'golden time', which is tripled to our regular hourly wages. <br /> <br /> The first rate of food during our diet was = the main rik - it was wonderful because it was a battlefield and very difficult to get good meat at home. <br /> <br /> I am waiting for anxiety after completing the job Eight or ten months later this is the image coming out. I am eagerly awaiting me for two hours before the end of my handwork. The film's dive was then three or four minutes (probably less), which was bombarded on the base. A bit disappointing, but still fun. <br /> <br /> In unemployment I enjoyed the film and never seen it. I realized that the film could come back to the government and I learned that Fox was paid on a cost-plus basis, which would cause our extreme salary and lifestyle. Bob Weaverka
