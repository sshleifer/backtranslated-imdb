In New York, Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) was a slave executive of a real estate office abducted by his wife Gina (Maurisa Tommy) for his addiction and a huge amount of expensive lifestyles. When an audit is scheduled in his department, he will be upset for the money. His infant brother Hank Hanson (Ethan Hawk) gave his daughter three months of support, and every Thursday afternoon he had a love affair with Gina. Since the insurance company is paying compensation, Andy will plot their parents' jewelry on Saturday morning without the use of firearms to find an old employee who loses his job without damaging his parents. On Monday morning, we will raise the money he needs to cover his embezzlement. He invites Hank to invite him because he is very popular and recognizable in jewelry. However, Hank will invite Bobby Lassorda (Brian F. O'Brine) to steal the store, but when their mother Nannat (Rosemary Harris) comes to work as a substitute and errors. Nanet kills Bobby and kills, but she is also shot dead by Lifeline. <br /> <br /> After Nanet's death, their father, Charles Hanson (Albert Finney), is determined to investigate exploitation with tragic consequences. <br /> <br /> "The Devil Knows Before You Dead or Dead" is the story of the comedy, mistakes. The realism and distinction are in the screenplay, a non-linear narrative "Pulp Fiction". Eight-three years Sydney Lettet has another great work, and it impresses the director's longevity. Philip Seymour Hoffman has been great in the role of a man suffering from his father, because he sees the world falling out of his unsafe and clumsy brother. Marisa Tommy still has a wonderful body which is spectacular and gorgeous. The violent resolution shows that the world is really a nasty place. <br /> The title (Brazilian): "Antes Que Que Ouco Esta Marto" ("Devil Knows You Dead or Dead")
