I was surprised that Hugh O'Connor was young Christie Brown, and thought I was really great for her role. I can not believe how well he played the role. However, Daniel Day-Lewis is very clever. My favorite scene is using the boys to play football and using his head to stop Christie's goals and penalty kicks! Fantastic performances by two Christies (and other).
