I'll just tip the standards here and I'll enjoy it. However, the cartoon is really going to appeal to those who have very absurdist tendencies. <br /> <br /> Animation is terrible, but yeah, that's the point. The main character is foul thing, violent, and stupid. There are no ransom features. His wife's verses and nails, the most important communication skills are simply not clear. <br /> But again, that is the point; <br /> <br /> This is really small, so I rent myself instead of buying it.
