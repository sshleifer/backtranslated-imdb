I've always enjoyed life-making movies. Life sometimes does not require boring patches, no real plot, and a happy ending. "A River Runs Through It" is the definitive name of the film (and Norman Maclean's novel). Life ebbs and flows like a river, and it's tough spots, but it's a wonderful trip. <br /> <br /> Robert Redford brings a lot of image. His story has a friendly feel, it fits perfectly. As director, he is forbidden and calm, and captures some amazing scenes. For acting, Craig Shepher and Brad Pitt are surprised by the brothers. I do not know how much to describe the exhibitions of Tom Screat and Brenda Blethith, unless they really feel true. <br /> <br /> "A River Runs Through It" is a wonderful movie
