We do not know what the earlier tribal Elders described in the great division that we understand. On every occasion, there are a lot of hazards that many know. On the contrary, they are alert to those who are not prepared for what they say are 'end time'. There is no obvious reason for an Aboriginal nation in this movie called "The Last Wave". When they are arrested, they are silent. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) is a defense attorney who is assigned to protect the accused. Burton attempts to preserve the barrier of the Tribal, even though it has been warned by his contemporaries from his childhood through prophetic imagery, alerting the modern signals given by the sympathetic Aborigines of Chris Lee (David Galpillil), and therefore does not fall under standard justice. The film was filled with vague, darker images of Apocalypse End World disasters, and warned of the future island tsunami and doom. Black drama and deep rituals give the film a frightening appeal and therefore not for the fools, in fact the simplest pursuit of fouls are morbid years of motion picture makers. Good silent play. ****
