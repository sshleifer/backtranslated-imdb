The Una Gironata Polyure is a picture made of spectacular use of closed spaces. In this frustration, the audience will find emotional confusion and the tumultuous perspectives of two popular characters of Ettore Scola. Marcello Maestroani and Sophia Loren both decide to come together for a few moments in the lives of their people. This is the source of sadness with a story that believes that it will take people close to the people close to the people. All men really sorry for Sophia Loren. Women surely cry out to their hearts at the survival capacity of Marcelo Maestrioria. The hidden sexuality is also one of the main issues of this stupid, sharp image. Characters with elements of their own sexuality are exchanged. Uni Ginorna Palaireau is well documented in the homosexual film mixed with nicely with women. The Italian director Ettore scores a good mix of reality and fantasy. Showing how Hitler's monarchy changed the positions of ordinary Italian people. One word about this chivalrous man was greatly played by Marcello Maestroani. He does not beg for compassion. He happily accepts his fortune and reads to face the worst time of his short and meaningful life. The best masterpiece of the movie!
