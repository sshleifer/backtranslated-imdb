The movie is T.R. I initially dislike the big glue thumbs, but the absurd humor looks gianious of it and sissy actors - I do not know the younger she has played - but she is so great and so !!! <br /> <br /> Half an hour later, two people who went out of the film, I'm with a friend - a test to see the movie that is always good with one of my friends. - And, we both enjoyed it very much - hilariously laughing - sad about "realistic police-normalos". <br /> <br /> I would love to see stuff out of cut - <br /> <br /> I do not have a idea if he liked the film or likes it, I'm Gus. Sand was still an artistic picture because the first time viewers (or producers ???) came out of the scenes well. Even though it's so small ... it's one of my most favorite of all time - and I know that people with a majority of people do not have such a film, and people who enjoy those pictures want to know what they think ... .... no pity. <br /> <br /> When you see it, hopefully there will be a DVD with the whole thing - hoping to see more of crisp and kiniyans. Think twice and enjoy it if you choose ... m
