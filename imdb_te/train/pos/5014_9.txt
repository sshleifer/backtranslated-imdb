Barbra Streisand is still enthusiastic in 1964, and CBS has grown more than some industry eyebrows when she signed for her 10-year-old, 5 million dollar contract (which is none of these days). But more important than that, Barbra and her manager insisted on creative control - and it came. She has her way of drawing this special, and most of her vision is brilliant, tearful, and incredible. The title song (not specifically written for her) initially, Streisand races through the classy cast of songs attached to "I'm Late" ("Alice in Wonderland")! - her mess ears and mice and "shave a lot"!); It is absolutely lovely, not bizarre, choice - and it has enjoyed the release of two soundtrack albums. She slowly slows down her "Believe" (which comes very slowly), but dramatic "How Does the Wine Taste?" That is amazing. "A Kid Again" is beautiful (watching Streisand's huge chair - Where's the idea of ​​Lilly Tomlin?), "Sweet Zoo" ("I'm Alligator - Crocodile ??, Alligator!"). "Wonder Is Wonder" is very cool and elegant, and her "People" number is amazing, with an orchestra to hit her in the song. In New York City's Bergdough Goodman, Straussd acting with high fashion-ups in kick-up (when she's stamps to the highest player, the tape is actually looking at the gasp). Before the studio audience (made with lucky fan club devotees), "When the Sun Comes Out" (Streisand is originally out of breathing in dramatic scenes), after which "Why Did I Wish You?" (Perhaps her best start song) Very soon "Lover, Come Back to Me" (she eventually drowned by Orchestra), and a 'funny girl' Dle. The finale, "Happy Days or Hear Again", reported 12, and closed the bell in an amazing fashion. These black and white gems sponsored by Chestrandh (Fiber Manufacturing Company) jazzya set-ups, with amazing cinematography, kick sets and clothes. They really can not make this em 'em anymore - and special and related to La Streamland.
