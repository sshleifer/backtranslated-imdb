Give the possibility to get cooking - an amazing picture with a little slow start. The story is built on interest and complexity. Characters and storytellers expect truth and cliche in all right movements. "New York City", the overall image of the HBO / Hollywood concept of Sex and Relations, is an outstanding contrast to the amazing commercial breaks of "New York City". It is a rare picture of honesty and compassion of its characters. Loved it! Great cast with great performances by Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, and her girlfriend (forgotten by his name).
