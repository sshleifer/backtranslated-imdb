Actually like the original, and this movie is its ups and downs. <br /> <br /> Up: The original voice came back to the cast. <br /> <br /> Downs: I do not like the voice of Timon. I know that I have made a voice in The Simpsons, but the program is just plain stupid. <br /> <br /> If you do not know what you want, you can not do it yourself "Again songs. (There are some original songs, but they are just background music. <br /> <br /> Downs: But Stupid songs. (Aka Timon 's solo.) <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a good movie. I recommend the fans. <br /> <br /> If you like the real one, you do not like these opportunities. <br /> <br /> My score: 7/10
