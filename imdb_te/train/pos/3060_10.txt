This is always sad when the "edge" movies are ignored by filmmakers. <br /> <br /> William H. Mackay, as Alex, is as convinced as ever. The "panic" is a superb compelling and sharp study of a character who thinks it is not the meaning of his life. It seems that this famous actor has a special talent for pulling your heart movements, even if his characters are flawed; We can not always forgive the lifestyles of the main characters he plays, but the fears and confusion emotions he has caused us to frequently know all too painful. The title, "Panic," was initially contradictory with the absence of extreme emotion. At one time, Alex is rarely angry with his doctor. However, as the story is revealed, it is clear that driving forces behind the existence of this man are tension and frustration. <br /> <br /> "Fargo," another strong character based film. Some people see middle aged person who have synchronized the rest of life in both "Fargo" and "Panic". He lost his way, and the only way would be dark and dark again. <br /> <br /> Alex meets Sarah with a 23-year-old woman (who is doing a massage of nev Camel), the office. As a background, this community is less coincidental, more functional of the task. Being with Alex Sarah finds a certain conveniency, when she compared herself to a person who lost her, lost her life and waits for her indefinite end to a lifetime of her life. Choosing for movies like this is a lively and persuasive way to answer the critics of Nave Campbell who interrogated her acting abilities. Most often she has roles who she is weak, Campbell offering deep in what her muscles bend. This show may be open to the eyes of many. <br /> <br /> In the perfect film world, "Panic" is not only a number of films but also a very wide audience. If you look at movies for greatness and depth, you will not be removed, just like the latest State of the Art Special Effects, then "Fear". A +.
