* Spoilers may include * * Spoilers <br /> <br /> At the age of Shrek (film) & Pixar (studio), this is a very traditional animated film. It is accompanied by some characters that are commonly found together (not to mention, save a human baby and try to bring it back to his father). They start out as enemies and end up being the best friend. The sound like this Disney movie, it is (only made by the 20th Century Fox). The movie trailer is one of the best I've seen in the ages, but does not live to predict the set of movie trailer. The film's producers did not create their minds, and the problem was complicated by the problem that triggered the film's target audience. Yes, there are a few jokes in the movie that the adults understand, but the film is mostly targeted at children. 90 minutes of parents enjoy. Their child's attention focuses more on them than others. The backgrounds are cool and the voice is cool but this is not a very good movie. Children love this film, not only adults.
