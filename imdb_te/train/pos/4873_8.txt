Western attack on traditional Serbian values ​​- you will not be able to understand his stories - you do not know that Kusturika has occasionally explored in his paintings. This continuous background is expressed by its vehicle through fantasy and outrageous comedy, which Kusturika is mandatory. From his fairytale work and Magnum Opus 'Underground,' Kusturaña's films 'Black Cat White Cat', 'Life is a Miracle' and recently 'Promise Me This', 'Westernization' of his shorter, carnival style Balkan culture, its vague arrival And attack the traditional nationals. In the case of 'Promise Me', the city's contradictory world (urban area) and village (traditional ethnic) place are contrary. The city's world reflects Western features that have been restricted to the territorial and temporal arrangement; It is revealed to the young child - the villager who is known for organized crime, sexual exploitation, recognition and extreme understanding of traditional values. The ending of the film will illustrate this feeling when the funeral and marriage are seen on the final dirt road. They were on the brink of collision; Correctly, the marriage refers to the lifestyle and pulse of the village, that is, the traditional values, funeral mourners, in this case the example of the death of tradition. Yet Kusturica brilliantly examines this theme by her own unique, stylized unity. It works like a vehicle in its vehicle with its horrible and flamboyant style.
