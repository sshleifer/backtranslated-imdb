The story of the two dogs and the cat who was looking back home. Old and wise Golden Retriever Shadow, young American Bulldog Chance and Himalayan cat run away from Sassy Ranch and go into the wilderness to reunite with their family. Hollywood Bound The Incredible Journey (1993) Family Adventure, directed by Duane Dunham. It was a remake of the 1963 film. This movie has a sequel after three years. Michael J. Fox is the perfect man to voice-over for Chance. Fox has some youthful power to bring the character. Sally does a great voice work as a sauce. Dan Amesh is amazing as Shadow. This is the second film of the popular actor. The actors who seem to be the same are great. Kim Grester Laura Burnford-Sewer Robert Hays Bob Sever. Berke Thall Peter Burnford. Vernonica Lauren Hope Burnford. Kevin Chevaliah Jamie Sewer. Jean Smart pictured Kate. It is amazing to see these pets trying to survive in the jungle. The river and her ag bear bear scene is out and funny. Chance does not have that big, hungry bear. And his meeting with Pandiko will be painful.This is very fun for the entire family.
