The police system is much less than a long time. Obviously it follows the stages of "dragnet" and "naked city", but emerges as a fun programmer. It is the best thing, which now has the form of entering the world that is not long ... New York New York at the end of the 40th century. Here it is among all of the oldest school tattoo parlors to grease spoons for cheap hotels. <br /> <br /> These old police films have travels for a long time and are now very frustrated for anyone who does not like the pure, uninhabited city scenery today. <br /> <br /> In this case, the tattooed woman's murder was found in an abandoned car. Our main heroes, Detective Tobin and Kornin, pedestrians, but without the tedious and complex efforts of "laboratory guys", they'd get somewhere. While technology is not in the same league, the cops use the firmness of the C.S.I. <br /> <br /> As you may think, some critics would like to be directed by Ed Wood and will extras from his movies. What bosh! I enjoyed John Miles for becoming Ganguly's former Marine Tobin ... He is very happy-luck to play the role of a welcoming character from the typical stone-faced histonics of the most creepy covers of time. Patricia Barry is beautiful and delightful and her perky girlfriend helps solve the crime. Walter Kinsella is stuffy and droll like the old detective Kargegan. I liked the chemistry for both of these and made it somewhat different than the kind of robotic "dragnet" approach. <br /> <br /> The mystery is not too deep, but there is not a rank among the crime cinema that's not the final chase and shootout, but it's a tactic stranger than "my stranger of interest," while running briefly.
