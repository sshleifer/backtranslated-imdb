<br /> I think my second time watching this movie (through the French language version of the first in Italian language) and I think it will improve on the next. <br /> Slowly built-in beautifully-painted-up character study and Parisian settings are equally impressed. In the long term, it was not for the highest-level polance and I reached number 9 in its filmography, but it is still very subtle and confident and often a widespread comedy. It also includes a fine cast, all of whom have a good form, but notably Isabelle Adjani, Melvin Douglas and Joe Van Fleet. <br /> <br /> Even though, I'm bothered by a bit Trelkovsky Sudden Struggle by 'change' into the previous tenant; Apart from the cafe owner opposite the apartment building, if he wanted anything with a different desire, Simon gave him anything without asking him (as long as I could) he wanted! Well, Simon's apartments have been found to be still in the apartment, but she drives herself to herself and drives herself (though he clearly commits these innocents) himself? If the feudal and other tenants were in the night at the Opera tried to commit suicide, especially where the scene - the film (where Adjani is all but disappears), especially in the scene - in the bathroom, is the opposite of the last episode, the one already used in 1968 by Jean Cocktio (Poet of Blood) Concept (1930)! <br /> <br /> End, then, simultaneously predictable and not solved: jump out of the window of this special apartment ?! I remember when I first saw this factor, and I'm sorry to say it now! You look, the first three-thirds of the film is pretty solid, but I rely less on places that are allocated to the Polans.
