Walter Mottau and George Burns are a well-known comedian comedian actress, Luis and Clark, who did not speak in 10 years. Burns retired and Matthew took personally and there was a grudge since then. The premiere of this delightful Neal Simon game made in the film. In fact, Mattau and Barnes make their way to their best, and everything that you get from today is comprehensible. Richard Benjamin shines as Mathew's nephew and agent. There are also old clips of the real stars of the golden age to enter the stream of the movie, and the character actor Fritz Feld starts with "pop". <br /> <br /> Rosetta Lanourair, who began his career in the theater with Orson Wales in the 30s, and later Grandma is a great character in "Family Matters". <br /> I am the only problem with it (and the way I met Merta when they met for the first time.) Of course, he was angry at him for years, but some of the things that he did were considered to be tough or just bad behavior. I used to see other movies that way in Matthew Act, but not George Burns, and, Matthau <br /> <br /> All in all, if you want to help and forget your problems, "The Sunshine Boys." They want to lift your spirits and think about the simplest time and way of life. <Br> /> <br /> Benjamin: "You have to hide it." <br /> Matthew: "Wait, wait, you are hiding it."
