If you have not seen this movie anymore, it is for you like old-fashioned actors. Frank Sinatra was a great voice when he was very young and drowned with cheeks and sung some great old songs. Michael Morgan, (Milly Pico) performed a great deal of dance and musical numbers. Leon Errol, (Cyrus Drake), played with Victor Borge (Sir Victor FitzRoy Victor), a great supporting role, performing classical piano and a slapstick comedy as he did in his career. It's not great music, but Frank Sinatra is a great pleasure to see at the start of his career in the 1940s.
