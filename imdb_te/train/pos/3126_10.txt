I do not provide 10 star ratings easily. An image is really impressive to me, and the Bourne Ultimatum has gone far beyond. Moreover, this trilogy is very well integrated, and I believe the great trio of our time trips. Although three films are not separate from the Ludlum novels, they are still the strongest milestone in film success. <br /> <br /> I just wanted the Bourne Ultimatum series to be completed, but I did not even try to stop smiling hours. <br /> <br /> From the moment when the opening title appears, ride. Paul Green Grass again did. Everything we love from previous Bourne films is here again: action, speech and moving camera. But for me, the last one is not always a problem. <br /> <br /> The film will return to see the film several times before being released on the division. It should be a perfectly satisfying ending, and an excellent image, and overall, an unforgettable trilogy time test stand.
