I sat down to see this movie very shivering and with little hope. I did not think it was possible to survive as long as the film was about its subject. But it's definitely, and some later. First, I should say that Jared Harris was an extraordinary job as John Lennon. Sometimes Harris Lennon seemed to be channeling. This comparison is often unusual, and he clearly read Lennon's habits and vocal defeats. <br /> <br /> Aiden Quinn is very good as McCartney, having a fantastic resemblance to Makacca, but he made an occasional trip to his scouss slavery. <br /> <br /> This writing work is well written and well-documented. It's of course, pure fantasy, but sometimes I felt a vampire peeking through a keyhole in this reunion. The ceiling scene was particularly moving, as McCartney told Lennon that he had never heard him - he was valuable and important, and was not his fault that he had not been abandoned by his parents. <br /> I have a complaint. I do not know that he is a bit like John. At this stage of her life, she starred in the film. He is well maintained his domestic situation and he is very friendly when he comes to the fans. A few years later, he was very friendly, he approached an autograph on the day he killed his murderer. <br /> <br /> The film was a little too long for the film to re-imagine those feelings. I'm pretty sure that the Beatles returned together at some stage. <br /> <br /> I'm sure Lennon and McCartney are still friends. <br /> Well, VH1. <br /> I'll watch again and again. <br /> <br />
