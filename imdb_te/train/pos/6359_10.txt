You went to this movie to see some huge academy award presentation ... Oh well .. But if you want to see a funny delightful adaptation of the old classic, you will love it .. Jim Carey is exceptionally amazing. The storyline is great, some of the parts added to the Grinch's history are also good. Ron Howard could never be beaten ... but some ADULT comments and splits were added, which was a performance of children or family. Try not to lose sight of that .. Do not you really wake up to enjoy the movie ... And for comments about Ron Howard, try to direct a major movie and you ..
