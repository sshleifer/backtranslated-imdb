I must admit that I am very suspicious about this documentary. I think it is the kind of American campaign that we do not like in Europe. I made a mistake. It describes the events of 9/11 in the eyes of firefighters calling for a small number of crashing down planes. It is a wonderful coins that have been filmed at all in this documentary! The film was initially portrayed as a rookie NY firefighter as "a man" about documnetary. <br /> <br /> "It's a wonderful thing." Regards,
