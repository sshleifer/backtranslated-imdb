When I first came to the video, my younger sister got it a gift and by that time I was probably 12 years old ... the lack of cinematic conflicts with many movies for me is the main characters for me get mad at each other because when it comes time to explain themselves they are just you You say one thing shouting on the screen that makes the whole deal sense Are not exposed to any reasonably intelligent person to know.

I also have one of those factors I hope to pass, and just enjoy the story, it's a great movie for the kid and it sticks in your mind ... what you think about how you deal with people and I repeat every 10 years Should avrtam.
