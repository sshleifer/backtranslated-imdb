This image is correct. As an earlier USAF aviation cadet, I can say all of this movie. Tedium of the application process. Waiting for word. Acceptance is joy. Concern about this by course. Seeing one's friends (perhaps the best of them) is sadness. The ultimate price paid to pay - the death of flow student student airmen. The fame of graduation. Flying flying, flying. Many people are called but some have been selected. We need to pay what we have to pay for anxiety.
