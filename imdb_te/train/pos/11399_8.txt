Okay, so the plot is on the ground moving. Yes, exactly, there are some randomly inserted songs and / or dance scenes (for example: Adam's concert and Henry's venue law). <br /> <br /> But, 'An American' is a polished, first-rated musical in Paris - most likely based on Jean Kelly's magnificent dance talent and choreography, and the charmed trollloads that charm him to import into every scene with Coron. <br /> <br /> The most accomplished and technically awe-inspired number in this music is definitely a clear 16-minute ballet image. It is a wonderfully portrayed, and Kelly and Caron are pretty dancing. But my favorite number should be the role of 'I Got Rhythm' singing Kelly with a group of French school kids then break a range of American dances. <br /> <br /> Not going to be 'classic' with 'Sing' in the Virgin ', but it does not look pretty, it goes to prove how special effects are not required. There is a high level. Watch value!
