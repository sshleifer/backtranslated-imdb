There is nothing that does not like about Moonstruck. I'm from a New York Italian family and I come back to small houses when I watch. Actors & actresses, plots, subplots, humor .. They are all wonderful. It starts slightly slowly, but it happens in two days! I fell in love with Laboe because of this film. In the list of favorite films, Moon Struck No. 3. It's "Theater Humming" in the "Good" movie or you can repeat some of your favorite lines. "Old Man, I'll leave you until you die another part of the dogs and die"; "It's good, because you know they're crazy because they know, because they're dead", "who killed me", "Who killed me" I can not always look at it anytime, and I always try to munstroke it when it makes me happy.
