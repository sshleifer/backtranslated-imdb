The author / director / co-star Adam Jones leads great things. I thought it was after seeing his film "Cross Eyed". Rarely doing a freelance movie and leaving me feeling good. The cleverly written and politically directed "cross id" is constantly ending. Adam Jones is not yet well known, but he will be. If the movie has one or two "named actors", it will have a box office sensation. I still have a chance to watch through a mainstream audience, which only takes time to work with the same film distributor. Regardless where it ends, you will not be disappointed if you have the chance to see it.
