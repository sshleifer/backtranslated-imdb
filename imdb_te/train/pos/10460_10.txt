This is a good picture with a powerful message of love and redemption. I loved the transformation of the consequences of the terrible disease on the brother and family. Well played and directed well. If there are any errors, this story will show you a special suburban family and their troubles. What about all the people of all cultural backgrounds? I like to see the film showing all these cultures as in real life. However, the film has grown with its understanding of its values ​​and how close a person is close to his person. The movie was loved and it brought my eyes tears
