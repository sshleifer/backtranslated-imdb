This is probably one of the worst films ever made. That's ... terrible. But it's great! If you're going to be disappointed, it's best if you have a gripping plot and a strange and entertaining look. However, if you want to see 50 million pots and Goro's amazing hair / bad English, you are looking for a real treat. If you do not have a competition to recognize the most amusing holes / screws, you've previously enjoyed funny entertainment. I would really recommend this movie to fans of bored or dye-hard smile. Also, be careful after the next bit, because Goro's Japanese fans are a bit worried about it, and he wants to sell himself. (He is not really, not Johnny Kitagawa (who is the executive producer) can do for him).
