In all honesty, if someone tells me, the series of absurd events of Lemonie Sneakers, Angels City and the Director of Caspers is going to make a neat little budget indie and it's true that I'm telling the guy that's funny. But the director did the bid cyberliner. <br /> <br /> There is a similar concept in "10 Elements or Less" "Sunrise," "Translation in Lost," or recently "Once". This is a chance meeting of two people, if they do not put Serendipity there, they can never cross the paths, or if they do, they can not speak to each other. Like those pictures, "10 items or less" focuses on relationships and how the characters understand each other and increase one's strengths and weaknesses. <br /> <br /> In this story, Morgan Freeman will spend a day with a lady in a low-lane portrait of a grocery store employee for an upcoming independent film and an unknown actor who has no idea about things beyond his control, or 10 pajas. She has a rotten marriage and has the hope of a new job as a secretary. In the beginning, Freeman's character just needs a lift home. <br /> <br /> When she has spent time with her, she wants to learn about her and give her some suggestions. <br /> <br /> Broad cyberling creates almost complete roles through the exchange between freeman and fast speed. This theme is just a setup to interact with each other in a 80 minutes interval. Freeman has the pleasure of his role, the role of Vega as character in Scarlet in the upper class world. <br /> At Vega, this time, he suffers from a life-long situation waiting to go beyond the stubborn checkout clerk. <br /> <br /> There are really a couple things in this film. First of all, Cyberling may have seen from independent films that the conversation is honest and can not come into any Hollywood hazard. It is very mutually friendly to convince all of the film. <br /> The situation is also unpredictable. <br /> I was impressed by the performances. While the film's reliability is released from Who's Go, Part of him does not appear to be majestic and fun. Paz Vega, meanwhile, has been pamming himself for a breakthrough in the US film for some time in the future. I love her in sponglish, she's hard here, no nice nonsense scarlet. At the end of the film, she successfully raises her role. <br /> <br /> Overall, 10 characters are the best of a character that is well written and directed by Broad Cyberling. He has not done much work and his film has a lot of Hollywood films. And here's where the artist is definitely working and let's see how he will take this road again.
