I'm not a fan of new movies, but this is a real pleasure to see. Adults and children can see it together - how extraordinary! My aunt likes it too. It's laughter, tears, love, adventure, special effects, good actors - and talking parrot. It reminded me of a favorite, the Wizard of Oz. The leader, Paulie, is an intellectual parrot, breaks away from his home and family and passes through many adventures, temptations and disappointments, and always keeps his resolve to find his friend, Mary. Highly recommended.
