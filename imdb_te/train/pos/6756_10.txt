Otto Preming, who completed a Nail Wheel at Twenty-Century Fox, recalled his "Laura" for this "Start", dramatic detective drama. Dana Andrews again played the role of police, but this time he blamed police brutality by hard, stubborn and his superiors - "You do not hate hoods, you're willing to fight them!" Mark Dickson (Andrews) denounced the criminals, his own father kicked. <br /> <br /> One night, the suspect, Ken Pine (Ken Pine) Craig Stevens, kills him while investigating the murder. For a shaked Dickson offense, a hateful thief, Sculis (Gary Merrill), is intent on covering it with the frame. However, Pine's mother-in-law, Jiggs Taylor (Tom Tully), his daughter, department store model Morgan Taylor (Tarney) separated from her husband but remained in compliance with his gambling schemes. Pine killed his wife and handed him over to his father, his son's mother-in-law showed up in the apartment, but Dixon was not up to the body. <br /> Morgan falls for Mark and gives money for a lawyer. He decides to take scalenge anyway, but he leaves a letter to the department in the event of his death and agrees. In the end, he does not live with knowledge of what he does and allows him to read the letter by his high and Morgan. Despite all the tragedies, Morgan expresses love for Mark and waits for him. <br /> <br /> The film is good enough to identify the confusion in television on DVD for many years. Eddie Muller, the film Noir historian, offers commentary and makes a good job, but the audience can not catch the importance of casting two leads since he took six years ago to find his statement. In that respect, he was mistaken for the WTSE two years before "The Iron Curtain" and the film was a box-office success. <br /> <br /> Andrews and Tyrne were terrified, and Ruth Donnelly was a comic relief to the restaurant owner Martha waving flames between Detective and Dame. <br /> <br /> Night view of the movie gives the film a threat to the film. Gary Merrill is the greatest of low-life scales, a criminal in the past with Dickson's father ("your father liked me", he ridiculed Mark). Karl Malden and a young Neville brand are also excellent. And Tom Tully is just as touching and funny as Morgan's unfairly acclaimed pop. <br /> A noisy movie noir with a stunning cast.
