I saw this exhibition as a reminder of David Lynch's Twin Peaks - a worship that I worship. The program quickly starts to introduce us to the main characters and rather unusually the pilot episode is very best for me, its very dramatic and really out of the whole evil of the show ready to develop for the rest of the season. My first major criticisms seemed to be a little disturbing by the show - it's not just one season after the cancellation, but by its own fault, it seems to be very probable and deserves a better treatment than that. Acting is amazing, and the show has the best characters (good and bad), they are very well developed in a small space. Bit has an odd cheesy effect for the first 5 or 10 performances of the dramatic, but it has been corrected for the season's progress. Well worth a watch, something out of something absolutely something!
