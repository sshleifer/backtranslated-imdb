I loved this movie! I was a true Tom Hanks fan, and I always impressed with her work. From his most dramatic roles, such as Cost Away, The Green Mile, Private Ryan, Forest Gump, Apollo 13 & Philadelphia. Ajay League of Their Own, Turner and Hooch, Catch Me If You Can, The Lady Killers, Big & For his cheerful characters like the course Toy Story. But Hanks is not the greatest actor to light up the screen in this film. Tyler Hechlin, Hool's son, offers great promises to Hollywood co-stars and offers less of an upcoming actor and a great performance. I hope he will do great things for someone who is sure to look at his career. Paul Newman always provides an amazing performance on the screen. He is really a myth. We can not forget people who do not have such big characters in the film, but it helped make it great. I will never forget the beautiful & very talented Jennifer Jason Leo, the Bollywood star of the Caroline & Single White Female, which brings her the screen grace to Hank's mistress in the film and makes an amazing job. Another fund in the film Liam Eiken. He did such a small role, and Lemoni, and Sweet, who did a great job as his roles in November, and I was a great performer at the Dream of Africa Africa.
