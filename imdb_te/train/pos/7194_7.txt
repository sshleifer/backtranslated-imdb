The best of Zorro chapterplays in this rank adds exciting screen play punch to the exciting musical score. There is an excellent support cast and secret villain that keeps you guessing until the end of the chapter. Rid Hadley does a fine job as Don Diego and his alter Ago Zorro. Lewist, but not sure, Whitney and English are the great directing team.
