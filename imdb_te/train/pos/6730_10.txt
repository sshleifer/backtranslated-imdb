I used to write comments at IMDb, but I will not do that anymore. It has become a huge IMDb, and accordingly the scores are damaged. What is my purpose? There are some worst (or negative) views, and if he likes it, he delivers a 10 and if he is 1. It certainly does not measure correctly. Now for the movie. I'm really sorry that I have distributed the 10s for a lot of movies, because I have to score this score with 12 or 13, which is not possible. There is something I do not expect to see in any other film in this documentary. It's just mesmerizing, and not just a way to tell; It really is. The last 25 minutes of power, visual joy and discreet - the words spoken by the boys starring - really that ... possible match. I can not keep movies, rarely I can not get that feeling, but this is the kind of image you buy and keep, and watch from time to time, maybe go through 10 or 20 times a year. I have nothing to say yet. This is true for me, target 10.
