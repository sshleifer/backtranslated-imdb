As Al Gary shook us with his firmly honest and cleverly presented documentary film "An Uncomfortable Truth", the directors Alastair Foturill and Mark Linfield also remind us about the time to improve our way of life to save our beautiful planet. "Planet Earth" is also a awakening of our planet's global warming that has dangerous consequences for all living things around the world. El Gore showed us the future of the Grand Earth, which for a long time has always been shown by hard facts provided by documented examples through interesting monologues. The creators of this documentary chose a different yet equally powerful way to achieve this. We will not present them with the future representation of our planet, but if we do not get drastic changes around us, they will show us the true beauty of the planet. We saw the places that existed but did not think they were pretty. In the film, we can see in the most extraordinary locations until the huge forests with vast deserts, fauna and flora and snow-covered landscapes can be seen in the eye. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, we see the most beautiful animals trying to survive in different environments. <br /> <br /> It combines it with al gyrates, to understand us that our planet is very valuable to intervene. Patrick Stewart Voice Over always relaxed and it's very good, but first it seemed to be watching an X-Men movie. Cinematography is perhaps the greatest thing for this documentary. Sometimes: You can not forget that a person with your camera will actually have to shoot that happy footage. <br /> <br /> In short: This is definitely a must for everyone. This beautiful planet belongs to every single person on earth! The truth is: I never thought our planet was so amazingly beautiful!
