Recently (May 2008) learned that this childhood favorite DVD is available. Even though I have seen high-quality films since then (at the end of the 70s (I'm 10 in 1978), the three episodes, the lowest budget issue still strong. <br /> <br /> I've seen my 10-year-old daughter now, <br /> <br /> Never before in the Norway, or series). And still worth looking at.
