This cartoon is smaller in the platform, but it's visually amazing. Very small spoilers are available. <br /> <br /> These little tiny tales are very responsible for the return of spring every year. Back. Both gnomes and storm have their own songs. It's a pretty good plot, like this. But this cartoon plot-it's not about color and animation. Visuals are exceptional. In 1936 such a bright color was still a wonder and there was some amazing inspiration. <br /> <br /> <br /> My favorite moments surround the ligand motion by small pipes. The pipes line up in line with more than one point, from the smallest to the tall and the colors move through the pipes and appear to be a sequence. <br /> <br /> The silence of the visuals of the war between the emerging greenery and the winter storm is very well executed. These types of shorts were popularized by Hugh Harman and Rudolf Eyesing, but they led from their MGM to their ultimate exit because the cartoon was probably on the budget and MGM was finally the animation department. <br /> <br /> It's really a beautiful cartoon and worth seeing. It is available in the DVD Attack of the '30s characters. Specially recommended if you like good animation.
