This is the least underestimated picture of Brooks artillery. Definitely, its flaws. It does not have the realistic view of the homeless (how Citizen Kane lounge told the realistic view of the singers, or the Titanic gave you the original view of Ethiians's Idiots). Most jokes come flat. But still, the movie is very funny, not very funny, it's really impressive to remove the story about the story of some members of the traditionally rebellious. Its not the Fisher King, but its not the worst, either. My only complaint is that Brooks is leading someone else (I love Mel as a director and writer, not quite a major).
