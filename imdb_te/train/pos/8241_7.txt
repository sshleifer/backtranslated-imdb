Fidoi is a very odd picture. In many ways, it is very good. <br /> <br /> When I saw my first idea, how would they market this thing? If Shawn of the Dead is a romantic comedy with zombies, Fido combines the comedy of fifty odors with a boy and his dog story zombies. <br /> <br /> Fido Shawn's carnage, gore & belly laughs. This is a different beast (sorry for revenge). <br /> <br /> Initially, I thought we were in Matinee, a fifty-century theoretical paradigm, but soon bright In the primary colors and fifties <br /> <br /> Young Timmy Robinson is a lonely boy in school. <br /> <br /> Jones is a zombie trying to get along with mom (Carrie-Anne Moss). Jimmy did not like it at first, but 'Fido' (Billy Connelly) is a great friend of Jimmy soon. <br /> <br /> Fido is not a horror movie, but my problem with the picture is what exactly it is. <br /> <br /> Humor is a light family variety, and sometimes the plot line relies on a lot of mom and his dog / family moments. <br /> <br /> The film is still shot through the wonderful, really funny moments, <br /> <br /> This film guarantees a family comedy, from time to time, to give an R rating to everyone. <br /> <br /> The film is gorgeous, its hard tonal issues, I hope this film finds a check, it's a very little gem in the film's worst of the year's worst.
