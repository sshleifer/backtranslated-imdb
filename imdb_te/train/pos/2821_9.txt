Although Louis B. Meyer was interested in dealing with young Gret Grafto, the first American and MGM film actress was very pretty. It's apparent that all the nice imagery that you can produce studio is all nice polish and artistry, it's clear that the image is allocated some amazing talents to produce the film image and make the matte pictures. <br /> <br /> 84 years later, it looks very beautiful. <br /> <br /> Like her other early American films, she looks different as Garo. She is very noticeable, her makeup is just a bit later than a year - you do not see her in the next few films with less scenes and sensitivity to her. I want them to keep this look, but who thinks that she is so familiar with the trademark, who says I've gone that way? About the film Gabbo and how she and her family are unjustly forced by their landlord to the landlord. The employer, too respected Do√±a Bernarda, said it because the bank demanded payment, because her son had fallen for Garbo - and what better way to get rid of her than the streets forced them to! Nice lady, huh? Over the years passing and now as the Gorbo World has become a new singing sensation. When she returned a few years after her hometown, she saw her old boyfriend (Had assured her that she would marry him but her mother, Donna Bernarda refused to allow it). His new love for another woman is now tested - is he married to this lady heir to a huge pig luck or he wants his old flame? Also, will Geobo even take him back after he's rare? At this time, heavy rainfall hits. The land floods are beginning and soon the houses are dry. Cortez and a friend make a mad dash like the break of the dam! In a clear seal of his sequence in the cascading stream, he will eventually be alive and Garbo's home. She welcomes them and they will stay with her until the storm passes. Then, he admits that he loves him and confesses that he has stormed the storm to make sure he is safe. She tells her to lose! Next, you will see Ricardo's second choice and get married to the pian king's daughter. He has a little excitement for this apparently - she made nothing wrong and you feel sorry for the woman. Soon, Cortez Garbo looks back home - he's love-sick and she needs it. In this scene, Garibbo is too bright and can not leave him - as they melt in one's hands. <br /> Once again, she tells her of her love. <br /> When Donna Bernarda realizes this, she is not proud. Apparently, a pig meat queen is better than an internationally known singer. Because of the intervention of this nasty elder, Garbhu leaves - the mother and her son did not like the son of Vimpi. But, Cortez runs - he wants her to be his wife and he does not rest. The few moments that made this announcement speak to Cordage for a family friend, and persuade her for her career and fame. Too "do not rest until he holds her for his wife", huh? Although Cordage and being wimp by one, for some reason she can not take her to hate herself. So, he married the piranani and spends a very dull life. After a few years Garbo meets Cortez again, he is a dull middle-aged man - she is beautiful as ever. <br /> <br /> At the time, the film was taken, Garbo is not a star in the US and Cortez. So, in this light, it is surprising that they gave such an unlikable role to play Courts. Instead of the role of the usual belief as confidently valentino character for him, here he is an uncertain wimp - heavy WIMP. And, from here, his career is slowly dirty down. <br /> <br /> Garo, this character has helped her become a big star - she concentrated on the film and she played the role of a guy later. <br /> <br /> For the movie, it's great, but a tad is repeated. <br /> <br /> The most joyful film - is deftly constructed, solemn and valuable. And, sometimes I can think about it, I have no real complaints in this fantastic picture.
