In 2006, in "Cold Blood" - a inspired thriller from 1967 - there were two new interesting cases of the past. The first and most serious, it was recently in the investigation of the star, Robert Blake, who killed his wife. Second, the recent Oscar-winning biography, "Capote" showed this murky real crime story writer Truman Capote's muddled back story. These two new twists make this film a timely movie for modern audiences. <br /> <br /> As in a single film in its era, "Cold Blood" is top notch in every way. Fantastic black and white cinematography from Conrad Hall (later "American Beauty" and "Road to Person"). Many of Stills's film farm of Kansas's Farm House sells fine art photography on the roads of the country on either night or tree. బ్రూక్స్ నుండి అద్భుతమైన సన్నివేశాలను మరియు అద్భుతమైన సన్నివేశాలను (ఇద్దరు హేతురహిత కిల్లర్స్ యొక్క ఇతివృత్తంతో అరుదుగా కత్తిరించిన అమాయక కుటుంబం యొక్క అమాయక రోజువారీ జీవితాన్ని మేము చూసేటప్పుడు), బ్రోక్స్ మరియు జాక్ దిశలో కలిపి, సంపన్న పెంపకం వాతావరణం ప్రేరేపిత సస్పెన్స్ కోసం వేదికను ఏర్పరుస్తుంది (వాస్తవానికి ఇది నిజ జీవితంలో జరిగిన సంఘటనల ఆధారంగా అన్నింటినీ ఎల  It seems to be over). At this day and age, it can be seen how to perform a spectacular murder scene that can be viewed in this film, where graphic nature of the action is sent to the viewer by reducing the blood shown on the screen. <br /> <br /> The film is well-known by Robert Blake's bizarre performance, which is more sympathetic to the killing duo and unrelenting brutality. Flash backlit scenes were very good for her horrible childhood. Before he was sent to execution, he had a scene at the end of the film where he spoke to the dignitaries and made his last "confession" to talk. It is one of the classic movie moments that is a perfect marriage of sand acting, excellent writing, flawless direction, and haunting photography. <br /> <br /> "Cold blade" is slow. <br /> <br /> "Cold blade" is slow, slow. The killers are a middle class act of a compelling nature of social commentary in the Lam and at the end. The political message of execution of death penalty is their secondary description of the mad killers and their food is secondary.
