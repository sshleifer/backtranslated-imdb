I'm amazed to see this is not a one-of-the-solar criticizing the old movie. We usually do not get good opera movies, and here is a real grand opera composition. Understandable, scenes are not great. It's up to date. But the opera should not be wrong; And I'm the opera buff. I can not even recognize a lip-synchronization; If we did not know that audio will convince me that Tebaldi is not Sofia Loren in nothing. She does everything with her flair! Her dark makeup is good; And she brought the role of a gorgeous life! The rest of the cast are awesome, excellent ballet band. Most actors are fantastic; Loren is really awesome. Her rival Amneris is also amazing. This 1953 job is a disgraceful remedy for no one to ignore. Verdi would have enjoyed it! Obviously, Renata Tebaldi has an engine behind the screen as an idiom. I love this old movie!
