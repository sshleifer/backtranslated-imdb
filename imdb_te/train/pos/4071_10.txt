At age seven I saw this film and it was completely cheated, but I did not know what the so-called film was called. Now I'm twenty-one and I have done a couple of weeks ago in the movie and have bought a copy. Even though the memory of my cinematography is a little hazy, I'm not disappointed. The animation in this film is so unbelievable and it is wonderful to conjuring an entire world that is well animated that you draw in the film alone. But the film is also enchanting and entertaining adults and children. This film will be directed by a floating island, mad general, friendly pirate grandmother and well-constructive love story.
