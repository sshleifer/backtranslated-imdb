The film improved my impression of Errol Flynn. Flynn is well known for his savior-fair and sprinttraura, but in this film he gives the opportunity to become an actor (just a little bit), an unabashed social climber in a sense of a big ego and match nerve. The supporting cast is excellent; <br /> <br /> This story certainly moves, but not particularly deep (the possibility of social commentary on the occasion of surprising distribution), it is definitely exciting and satisfying. I'm confident of the history story from what I know about Jim Corbett. I really liked the great depictions of San Francisco in the 1880s. In all, it's too small to like this movie ... It's worth the time to see it.
