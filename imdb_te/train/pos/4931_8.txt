When the plague breaks in New Orleans, Richard Widmark is one of the lesser-known films of "Elia Kazan" as "Streets in the Streets". The Kazan pace keeps active, and there are a lot of spectacular collisions - the scenes between Widmark and Barbara Bell Geddes plays his wife and scene in the police station, the family life and work life and the average citizen relationships, the fierce contradiction of low-life lives and relationships, the threatening jack fence, His weak man man, Zero Mastel, Tommy Cook and Luisa Filmed with Charles. There are also some interesting visuals - scenes with actors acting in the palace up to the knees. <br /> <br /> While this story is not very spectacular, it is wonderful and dialogue is sharp. Directing and performing. It is quite simply contains some questionable items that are identified by the viewer. Next to it, looking at it well worth it. Kazan is a wonderful director.
