This is a picture of a number of things that Japanese people can understand. There are some things that are well translated, clearly private jokes or regional icons. <br /> My opinion is that it tried to send a sort of message, but it was ruined on me. <br /> Mainly, this is a simple picture with good special effects. Some kid becomes "one" and in the end there is no connection to Yokoi's war. It would have been nice to understand what hell they were talking about, but I do not really realize the plot as Azumi Bean walking between Yoko and a large tongued umbrella (Rihanna eat your heart!). <br /> <br /> Bottom line: nice visuals, Kid screams a lot, the river princess is terribly beautiful and the rest is the worst.
