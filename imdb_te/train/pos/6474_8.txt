I could not fully draw in this and wait for each episode. How much emotional life the family of the family has brought together has the effect on those intimate topics. Finally, we are only a problem that is "described" as a family. We did not hear what was obvious and did not know what was the part of Gary in the whole thing? Why did Kyle phone him and why did he go with it? After investing in a series of five hours, we betrayed us only for five minutes. I was asked around and it was no wise man who did not see any of my friends. Very strange but maybe we missed something crucial ???
