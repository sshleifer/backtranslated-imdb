I do not know if I'm unrealistic, but I have absolutely enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> The return of the cabin through the lake is the sequel of my favorite films lake. In fact, I liked the film more than the first one. I also felt that cast in this movie was great, Judd Nelson was always the best! I also enjoyed the entire plot. I liked the fact that Stanley's screenplay was filmed by the filming cabin by this second film Lake- it's not a completely unnecessary movie by Stanley capturing other girls and drowning them. - If you see some deeper meaning, this movie is probably not for you. However, if you are looking for a fun way to spend two hours, go ahead and watch it. I probably watched this film at least ten hours. :)
