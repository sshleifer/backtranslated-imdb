To be honest, I had to watch this movie, did not expect much, but hey, I did not cheat, I had a good time. Although I tried to modernize Nancy Drew, fresh and fresh air in the air, it reminded me of these young images of 60-70s from Europe and Quebec where children can interact with each other. In this case, a 16-year-old teenager tries to justify justice by trying to solve a mystery about the death of a deceased actor who died 25 years ago. However, when her father was in Hollywood, why did she rent a house with the door behind the doors? Well, at least Emma Roberts does a great job here. The first such person as Chindy Kid brought Nancy to support his sister's pranks, but eventually, Nancy was good enough to join her in her subject. The rest of the auxiliary cast is great, and at this time Rachel league Cook is happy to see a cook: a single mother (her family has been rescued, but this time, she has played a mature woman ...) Anyway, it's not dump, it's fun!
