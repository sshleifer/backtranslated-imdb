In the end, what happens in television is a surprise. Before I saw the film, I read a short plot on a television list and I accepted it. A movie about a hit man thought-a shrink-wanting-leaving-business-and-falling-love love .... sound. But the film works. From the beginning of the film it is clear that the man has a weight on his shoulders, even before he says a word. The look and feel of the film is perfect. <br /> <br /> Unlike the hitman family aspect of the touch of surrealism, the character of Mikey enjoys his marriage, and his father's control. Mackie suffers a repression, and his young son discusses his bedtime talks. This young boy performs well acting skills under his age, and the interaction between father and son is very natural, personal and loving. <br /> <br /> It's one of the best films I've seen for a while, and I can not believe I came across by late night on the television.
