This extraordinary and unique Winchester revolves around the 1873 rifle and revolves around all of those who have been thrown at one point or another in the film, making it an exceptional and unique little Western image. <Br /> <br /> It's a lot more entertaining film to watch but it's not true without Western. The film was made in Western style film production of '40' / 50 'style, so lovers of the genre should not be stopped by its exceptional eccentricity. <br /> <br /> The Rifle is actually the main plot of the film, allowing the story that follows many characters throughout the story, all of which are connected to the course and the end of the story is complete circle. Without this film, the film is very pretty looking at the movie, because the story often jumps out of danger with a different character. How wonderful they also managed to put Wyatt Earp in all of this. But this is not really criticism. The film and its story were original and that the film seemed to go from one event to another. This gave the film an episode of adventure and entertainment. <br /> This is a great movie. I liked the image settings used and it seems very exciting that the director Anthony Man was the first Western. Fortunately he later went on to play a more Western direction, which is often played by James Stewart as the lead leader. <br /> <br /> James Stewart is a pretty charming casting option to pick the main character. He is one of the soft and most courteous and acting actors, so he has cast him as a tough gunsling, which looks like a bit of an odd pick. But Stewart has been surprisingly convinced as a tough guy and he is actually versatile and really capable of being an actor. <br /> <br /> The other surprising actors in the film are also unrelated to this genre. Shelley Winters plays the leading role of women, and later well-known actors Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis appear in some minor roles. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
