There are many new styles of sitcom but an old-fashioned way with best-performing spectators and indoor sets. The 70 show is a great example. When the program came into the air, no one actually played Kurtwood Smith and Debra Joe Dupp have been very impressed by TopR Grace and Ashton Kutun (these two shows are leaving the show to continue their other interests). The show began with his character, Eric, and close friends of his friends. Ashton is already our time John Travolta. Remember when Diana Hyland was in love with John Enid Enough, think Ashton with Demi Moore. The cast of cast is never known because this is a good thing because the famous actor can ruin it. I miss Mo Gaffe, who played the role of Dr. Don Girl Friend Jonne. I miss Lisa Robin Kelly as the original Larry, replacement she could not match and I'm sorry about that. I liked Tommy Chong's performance as a waste of steve Hyde but a beloved father. I liked watching Tanya Roberts along with Charlie Angels. I love the mother of Brooke Shields Jackie. Before she went to Broadway, she really performed her talent. This show is a lot of surprising happy. I hope that the show will last for a long time, even though I have left 2 people in their show but I hope they should be too long. I was more successful in Fox than the creators of the show, Bonnie and Terry Turner, my other favorite show, the Third Rock from the Sun, and their performance was destroyed by NBC. Turners are not dummies and I hope to create more shows in the future.
