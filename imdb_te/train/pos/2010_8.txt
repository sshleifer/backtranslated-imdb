I thought this film was pretty good. Some parts are brown but they can be understood from the time it was made 55 years ago. I thought that I had convinced Milly Morgan Miliky who gave me the best performance in the film. Jack Haley is also good as Mike O'Brien. Although I'm not a big fan of Sinatra, I think he's very good in this movie. If you have a desire for a crazy, in the top musical comedy, the movie for Higher and Higher you. <br /> <br />
