A new way to enjoy the work of Golds Worthy, allows rivers and tides fans to watch in motion. Goldwick develops an admiration for using each stone, leaf and thorn, looking at building his pieces. Golds describes how the living flow, rivers, and tides influence and influence its work. However, I'm very happy with the film of Goldsworthy's pieces (no snowballs), I think it's a bit long. Motion picture producers did a tremendous job to bring Gold's work into life, and created a charming movie to watch.
