A rare case I want to see a movie again. "Amy Girls" is such a film. I stood for more shows in old-time film theaters. Is this story autobiographical for the author / director? It's the brightness of reality. <br /> All actors have performed their roles with confidence and sensitivity. Who does not want Mercedes Reuhl as a big sister? <br /> <br /> We know that it works for many films, actors, producers, directors, sound technicians etc. This kind of belief in "Promise Girls" will cease. That family feels like that part! How she wanted to come to Dolorres Care when her family was abolishing her emotional life. And Le Grant was eagerly excited about her level of criticism in the hair color of Cloris Lechmann. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The love of this film family is emotional and very affectionate. <br /> <br /> It means Italian 'Amitti'.
