One of the best televised drama of the past decade. Five hours of modern day British exploration of the modern day society, the awareness and sympathy of them are constantly challenging. David Morrissey, as usual, is clever. The first was the controversial heavy copper copper with the heroine, but it was intelligent and caring, because he worked with him in revealing the truth. Before I saw the Surrence Jones. I believe she came from the world of her television soaps. Her acting is amazing when she manages her humor and composure while trying to balance the pressure of her acting and care for her mom. I can talk and talk about each member of the cast that contribute to this amazing drama, but their efforts will be a little easier to understand without such an absorbing script, which constantly challenges your imaginations about any characters. Such programs, which restore one's faith in the television drama, make it almost impossible to solve most of the garbage filling.
