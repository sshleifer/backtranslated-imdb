I saw hundreds of silent films. Some are always classic (such as Nosferatu, Metropolis, The General and Wings) but my favorite movie of them (it's not the best - but a favorite, yes). In fact, when I looked at it on IMDb, I noticed that I immediately laughed myself because the image was so gosh-darn beautiful and well made. Marian Davis has proven with the film, she really has great talent and is not just a mistress of William Randolph Hrust. <br /> <br /> In this story, a hawk from Hollywood to Georgia, every hoping that she will be an instant star! Her experiences and curious characters of medieval stars make this movie a real treat for buffs and a must see!
