Although I agree that it is good but a good film, I am still enjoying it for a number of other posters. One reason is music: I like to watch a very cool show in the well-performed scene in the Condolly brothers - Cante and Pete - Nightclub. These guys were two of the best jazz trumpeters in their day, and they were able to buzz the mind of Jimmy Stewart with a painful trumpet duet, each of Stewart's ears. Condolis played really well, although I suspect that the original music was dubbed by them for the scene. I'm not quite sure about the music gained by George Dunling, for music (rather than having worked with three stooges in more than one case), but Jazz is casting Candoli brothers as wrestling battles with a real nice touch.
