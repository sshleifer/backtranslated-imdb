I love almost all of the movies in the Dirty Harry series, and I'm exempted by the name "Infurs". "Dead Pool" is very weak in many areas, but I'm still enjoying it. One of my favorites of the series, if there is nothing to the great line, "go ahead, do my day". This one also has an interesting but familiar plot of anyone killing those who made her wrong. Just think of the Magnum Force, about the murders and you'll have your plot. It is a little more than a good park in an amusement park. It's a Dirty Harry Bulldog gift and will be tripping to a funny sitcom rather than a Santra lock. The only question is why Clint Eastwood has many mediocre actress Sandra Locke in his movies. Overall, the film will score a score every time when I'm so happy. Granted she is not bad here, but her role may be very good by someone else. Another problem with this movie and other dirty Harry films is that they sometimes appear to be guns. I like the guns of the next person, but what are his scenes really necessary to explain the different strengths and how many bullets he has for all the new weapons? Still, Dirty Harry's movies are very good entry.
