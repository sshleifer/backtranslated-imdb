Author and director Michael Powell is considered "A Matter of Life and Death", and since 1946 he and Emerik Presbyger's fictional fantasy are favorite of their movies. <br /> <br /> After the Second World War, this colorful romantic adventure has provided a good tonic for the recovery and recovery of the country. <br /> <br /> 'Archers' after the string of other patriotic war films has made their their quirkiest, skittish and very patriotic. British Empire British, its Baroque Composition, Technology Innovation, and a well-known multi-ethnic cast for the British legacy (Shakespeare, Beer, Fair play, good manners) <br /> <br /> Another 1946 classic, "It's a fantastic life," AMOLAD opens up a great sound, one of those graceful voiceovers that we preach about earth and sky, and we have any big and wonderful world. <br /> <br /> It breaks inside a British cockpit, hit hard, flames and co-pilot already dead. <br /> <br /> Nearly 5 minutes a British pilot Peter (David Nevan) and American radio introduced the fastest firing in June. (Kim Hunter) is breathtaking in its intimacy. While resigning to the post of dying, Peter has expressed much power, charm, and graceful confessions, and ends with his warm affair with 'I Love You' <br /> Peter with the magic of the moment, through the supervision of his conductor 71, whose job 'shipped to the other world', escapes death and finds himself alone on a beach. He later encounters a running bicycle, and immediately fits the body with a voice. <br /> <br /> But their error was to recognize Peter and send the court back to the High Court, and ordered the French conductor (Maurice GÃ¶ring) to get him back. <br /> <br /> The fate of Peter is ultimately with the heavenly court and the American prosecutor (Raymond Massey) whose jurors are many of the dead war heroes and civilized British representatives. After announcing the verdict, surreal inquiry into the Rich Technicolor surreal inquiry may be better, but the final shot in the hospital confirms the predictable result. When Abstract Peter and his troubled French guardian climbs up the huge statues of Peter's potential advocates, the first time in the B / w chassis is the "stairway to heaven" (American title of the film). Abraham Lincoln and Plato. The second time, the soft-faded color stairway provides the setting for a distinctive image in the film - Peter and June are frozen by their side, their surprising eyes move forward in the frame, their duty is sealed. Never having a mutual relationship between Peter and June never becomes soft or verbus; It is the upper class and the couple are already in favor of marriage and need to treat with their understanding and understanding their love people, so it can keep them together. <br /> <br /> The French conductor who freezes the time and people's bodies, while publishing Peter's 'Top 100 Game Tricks' book and his coffee, lecture Peter between history and his unfortunate miracles. <br /> <br /> Other Pavel Visually like the / Presbyger cooperatives, this is the first time they met with b / w? The second is the happiest quality when used for heavenly scenes and both are equally appealing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The best script is the intended set of imagery set, which does not seem to be written or displayed on the screen with a conversation. Made in 1946, "A Matter of Life and Death" is one of those films that describes the age, watching and witty Pavel / Presbyger's work fresh and inventive, CGI also removes them from its emotional wonders, At its age where its artificial effects are the vampip. <br /> <br /> The need for reduced average seconds for cutting the other jaring changes and the inevitable reason to reduce the conversation so that it can preserve a lot of audience attention. Powell adds a spell that is subtly sensible to the viewer from the first frame, giving the freedom to experiment with images without breaking Peter's status as a logical development.
