First, I really enjoyed this film and its message. Very poetic, heartfelt and funny and sad scenes, very agile, it is a pleasure to see. But here are my "exceptions": the film is too long and at some point, it adds additional clashes to the main story line. I disagree with another comment that many such people in such a small village are "inaccurate" with problems. I think this is absolutely realistic! There are incredible dramas happening everywhere, we do not know about the people we meet just over. I did not like it, it was loaded with signals and forced to do so. It's just too much, which leaves a bad taste. I have dramatically referred to the big problems in the group (others have been accused before the elderly, and people are more "shy" to speak personally before each of those people working with a group). And: to protect itself is a powerful instinct of humans. Why not fight on the earth and not lose its own self? I understand he is not weak, I try to save himself at least while he is attacking me, but I'm madly inclined to see him do nothing. Storyteller was forced to bring in a message like "no violence", but the method he chose is not good. I also face violence, but he loses credibility when he kills all the attacks. And: Gabriella ... Because the woman on earth, beating her who has spent years old, arresting her and saying, "I do not hurt you, like us all". Oh really, this too spoiled! She is going to be a saint or what? She's bitter, but it's not human, she's not human, she's her work with Daniel and it's all her great songs that she forgot all of her great songs, so there are these damaged moments. I think it's a joyful movie, that's amazing enough, given quite a few things my inconvenience. Look !! ;-) "
