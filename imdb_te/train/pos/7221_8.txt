If you ever feel that you have a handle on death trap, another plot will twist. Only the best to sit back and enjoy this ride. <br /> <br /> Sidney Br√ºhl (Michael Caine)) is very popular to kiss on the screen between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve (which is unfortunately cut off from the television version I have seen) person. Once a successful playwright, his last many plays in the Broadway were unsuccessful. And his wife, Mira (Diane Cannon), does not support both monetary and emotional feelings and believes that Sydney is good. Injury, a young playwright, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) sent a game to watch Sydney. It is Anderson's first ever, and the young man can see Sydney as a gifted writer. He jokes his wife, he must invite Anderson, kill him and submit his play. She first laughs at him, but when Sydney really asks Anderson for a feast, he is concerned that he can really take his plan into reality. <br /> This is a fantastic script. There turns turns and all the plots, and they get faster and more angry when you get close to the end. It is the type of image you have on the edge of your seat from the beginning, and you put the whole time there. Complete work of suspense and mystery. <br /> Acting is amazing. Cain gives his usual excellent performance, and he performs a knack for playing culture, refined and intellectual men. Reeve also gives an incredible rendering of a person who is almost wider eye or innocent. Canon works well for the insane myra. <br /> <br /> This film, which is at an unexpected end, and recurring views can help to get rid of the missing items. Viewings. Unfortunately, the unfortunate classic is to remember a sensation that has experienced some sensitivity at the time - this is a real shame.
