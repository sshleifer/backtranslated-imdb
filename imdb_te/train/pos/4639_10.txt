I got this one a few weeks ago and I love it! It is full of modern, light but true complexities of life. This is similar to other Eytan Fox movies and answers. This is my favorite, along with Josie & Jagger. These pictures are very universal and bubbles alone. You can not be Jewish or lesbian - I'm not, but the movie goes directly to my top ten films. First it looks like pure entertainment but you will think more. The relations we live in are surface, meaningful, deep, lethal, and you must name it. You do not know what you're up to, and you're not sure what's the title of this story as you see the first time. It's worth seeing many times. Fox films have great bonus materials - a great music video and "The Making of" (Leurer Ashcanazi interview, including the title of the title, who is suspicious of the Israeli lifestyle in the movie and the Arabs).
