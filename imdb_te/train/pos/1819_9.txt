When I first saw it, we received it a year ago from our local library and watched it about 3 times. We saw it again and last time I watched more than I did! <br /> <br /> The film is about two dogs, Charlie and Itchi (voiced by Dome Dulis and I love Dum Deluus!). Charlie is half a gangster and half a good man, I love it. Itching is on his side. Charlie was killed by his friend (NOT) and sent to heaven. <br /> When Charlie comes back to life, it is at the start of an exciting adventure. <br /> <br /> The five main reasons why I say that I'm totally crazy about this movie is: one: I love the characters (except the carfess). My favorite three Charlie, itchy and a little girl named Anne-Mary after a little bit. Two: I love the history period in which I set this film. It is set during the ban in the United States. Three: Don blot animation (as always) is amazing. The backgrounds are very good. Four: There is a strange excitement in this film that keeps me on the edge of my seat. Five: These songs are beautiful. <br /> <br /> When you see this lovely movie you will not be disappointed! :);) :()
