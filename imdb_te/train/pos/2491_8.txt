Budget limits, time limits, shooting the script and cutting it down, reducing it, reducing ... This group is good, young filmmakers. Attenting to this script - yes, zealous - time and knowledge of your time, devotion, positions actors and friends and some kind of zero depends on the impacts of the dollar; And can get the first feature, a 1 in 1000 subject. These guys make movies. Good ones. See their shorts collection "Heartland Horrors" and see the development. I work with them, it's the most fun thing you do in business. I am faced with harsh, insulting criticism for the film, a critic is a deliberate opinion of the horror audience, as a critic is listening to a conversation or a thought or feeling or a desire to do the work. Bring yourself "EVERTY ERA". It's not preconceive to just expect it to be because it's put in the horror / thriller style of its supernatural premise. It can control a blade with a devotion to the message that does not attack your brain's visual center, but attracts a person's sympathy to the mind and the other suffering of the soul. Mark Risquev, Curtis, "The Empty Ekra"
