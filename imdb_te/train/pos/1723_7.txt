Excellent P.O.W. The adventure received from Eric Williams from his own book (Paperback copy of my father library) was inspired by real events; Is it the first film of its kind and therefore, is there a lot for the answer ?? Such as Alberti, R.N. (1953), Straak 17 (1953) and GREAT ESCAPE (1963) and high-level releases from the other side of the Atlantic, COLDITZ STORY (1955) and DANGER ININ (1959). This, then, sets the solidly solid base: make a ingenious plan to escape a page loan from the British soldiers in the Greek myth of the intern in a German camp? Hooligan from under an aspiring horse used in full view of physical exercise and their recruits! Actually, the film is neatly split into two halves: the slow dealing process of the tunnel is out in the first contracts, escape, and the next stages depict their fortunes outside the camp as they try to make neutral Sweden. The cast includes a number of loyal cast actors (Anthony Dawson, Bryan Forbes, Michael Goodlin and Walter), starring many of the British actors (Leo Jean), Current (Anthony Steel) and Up-and-Venture (Peter Finch, David Tomlinson and Bill Travers) gotel). Three Leeds / Failures Zen, Steel and Tomlinson: The first two stick together, the next goes its own way? Only when it comes to security is to enter into others. As expected, the narrative contains suspense and passion; Most male centered P.O.W. Sagas, too, will be kept at a minimum interest rate for women's interest. Director Lee does not have a long career? This and somewhat similar to (such as the change of both settings and perspectives) a town like Alice (1956) is his most important achievement ?? But when he delayed the report on the situation (certainly, in the report delayed, Lee has been alert to his position, producer Ian Dorriumpul worked with loose ends!). However, the specific reference value is sensitive lighting (especially at nighttime).
