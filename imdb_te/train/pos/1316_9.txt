I looked at this finely thought, and beautifully featured / directed movie. Nick and Tuck me to see if my time is wasting watching a movie on the Lifetime Movie Network due to the horrendous commercial advertisements. Reading earlier comments convinced me to give me a shot. After all the worst I happen to be that I fall asleep at one of the boring yet long bug spray ads. Why can i see When IMDB gives a picture of 5.8 WHO's statistical average of 7.3 it must definitely hit. <br /> <br /> When I take the time to view this movie, I'm totally delighted, trade pax and all. I am surprised by the ability to make harsh characters playing the main role of Helen Hunt to fit each role. <br /> <br /> She was shot dead in her hard and yet well-known human police officer. When the scene is called for a quick confusion and a timely dialogue, she lashes the leg with any actor. And distributing volumes of emotional reaction without the expression of her facial expression and body language. By designing, without designing, the design of killing any good image, it was a true edge-of-seat nail-byte. I gave it to 9.0
