I saw this film at the Brussels International Film Festival. I also met the director. I heard Ed Wood wrote this story in 10 years! <br /> If you take the film seriously (like MR Wood) it is one of the worst films you see. . And this is cool. <br /> <br /> When I was not asleep, I spent the elder. It did not even try to be a good film. <br /> <br /> This is a very good movie. The script is filled with nalpism and anarchism - there is a lot of black humor. Billy Jane's character is absolutely amazing. You see, it's a high art ... or less garbage. <br /> **** / *****
