Director Raul Walsh is like Michael Bay, about 40 years old. And I'm in a positive way, so I'm not sure to bay. <br /> <br /> Raul Walsh is in his days when his films are simply the simplest of high quality entertainment. <br /> <br /> "Gentleman Jim" quality entertainment. In addition to the first class director, there are also first grade actors with Errol Flynn, the general leader of Raul Walsh in the lead role. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They have also really used dynamic camera-work and are both exciting and enthusiastic to see the boxing tournaments, the final championship fight against John El Sullivan as the ultimate highlight. <br /> The biopsies of '40 and earlier are still very different from today's biographies. Modern biographies often glorify its main content and show his / her life from death and everything, primarily emotional things, primarily from birth. Like old films based on real-life personalities, 'old' biopics are similarly designed, meaning film producers often use creative freedoms and / or the life of the main character with the events of the event. This film is not just a biography about a boxing legend, but has played a good role from the time when the illegal bare fist enters the modern age of fighting boxing. <br /> <br /> Eroel Flynn plays the real role of life famed boxer James J. Corbett's sister gentleman Jim. Not many people know it, but Flynn did some good acting jobs in the 40s, one of which was one. He also appears in the highest shape. He looks quite different from his trademark small whiskey in the film. <br /> <br /> There are some good supporting actors and some good performances in the film. <br /> <br /> Today's great and exciting movie is still really nice. <br /> <br />
