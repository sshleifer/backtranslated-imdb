If you are a Crispine Glover fan, you should see it. If you are a fan of Sean Penn, you should see. If you're generally a fan of cinema, you should see it. If you do not know who Crispin Glover is, if you do not know who Sean Penn is, then the film still has a lot of value, but it improves the work that you have not seen before by Crispin or Sean. <Br /> <br /> This film is very funny, but it is pure genius. I do not know anything like this movie. This is its own style. I doubt that I will do something like that. Exactly why it can not exactly do anything without damaging, some other reviews have already done better. <br /> <br /> In response to any of the critics, it gave a bad review, and I want you to see the movie again. In fact, the film does not have any point called "boring". This is probably the funniest, most entertaining, and least boring movie ever made. And age and recurring views are only good. <br /> <br /> Bare trio director Trent Harris is also an excellent worker of Excellent Rubin and Ed, and Crispin Glover. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the copies are rarely seen. I was able to find a VHS version after some tribute search, and there are a few ways to learn about it. But I really want to put this anyone on a DVD.
