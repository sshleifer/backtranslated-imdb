I rented the movie (and thought it got the theatrical release). Previews look awesome on the movie. I was actually quite surprised, it was well worth looking at; This is almost as much as a collective picture. Although it has some very funny moments and being a flawed sarcastic of people on display and performance at the very event being flawed. It is particularly flawed by the horror soundtrack of the funniest 'comedy' effects, but overall it is both honest and common, which is completely different or on the way to Larry Sanders. <br /> <br /> The moment when it comes to Jerry Springer's criticism, he is also a lightweight goal. Springer Citizen was able to make a kennel and was declared the 'worst movie ever'. I recommend this film to those interested in the show. The flawed but new and interesting part of the film.
