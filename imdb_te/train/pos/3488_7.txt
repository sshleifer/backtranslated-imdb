WWE was saved by WrestleManias 14. The departure of Bret Hart and the Hart Foundation's next evaporation was WWE's Wiley D-Generation X stable. Their gracious leader, Shawn Michaels, thanked Hart to the intervention of Vince McMahon, and his teams routinely went to challenge his domination from triple H and Chia. But a new competitor emerged at the Royal Rumble. Stone Cold Steve Austin. Hated by MacMonoment, feared Austin DX. So they are scared of the fact that "The Bad Desert Man on the Planet" has helped Mike Tyson with the help of special implementation. <br /> <br /> The first one was won by the Legion of Doom, which won with an unforgettable 15th Team Battle Royale. NO.1 contenders for tag titles. I forgot the match until I got the PPV. <br /> <br /> The next match saw the Light Heavyweight title defending champion Takah Mykonoko against Aguila. WWE established a WWE Light Heavyweight title as a competitor to the stronger cruiser weight category in WWW. It was unsuccessful and the title was always defended in WrestleMania. Small match, about five minutes, and much less to achieve too. <br /> <br /> Well, our next match DX member Triple H was not defended against the Owen Hart, Soul Survivor outside fashion from Shawn Michaels in the RAW in December where he won the WWE European title. There was a big entrance to performing his theme song with the Triple H DX band. China also handcuffed to WWE Commissioner SGT Slaughter, along with RingSide along with Triple H. Triple H and Owen have a very small competition, the Chinese Heart has suffered a short blow, which will retain the title of Triple H. <br /> <br /> In reality we need to take the time away from our next match that we saw in the real life husband and wife Marc Mero and the gallant loser. Luna Wachon in the first mixed tag match in WrestleMania in 8 years. And, in all honesty, it is not worth the wait. Although not terrible, this match is no longer memorable. It ended with Meroe's single run in WWE and the main purpose was to break up his relationship with the Sapill. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ ref> Turning Ken Shamrock down, the Intercontinental Championship broke the IC champion The Rock but refused to allow his ankle lock offering to allow the referee to change his decision. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> After Dumpster threw up behind the cactus and Chainsaw match after the match, the decision turned to the next night. For the first encounter between Kane and his brother Undertaker. Kane Undertaker spent the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble, where Shaun Michaels locked the Los Undertaker in a casket and retaliated to leave his paternal home and leave him in the pre-awk of the day. <br /> <br /> <br /> It was a good match and Undertaker Ken threw him down and knocked him with three tombs. It was also interviewed by Steve Austin with WWE Champion Mike Tyson. Michaels suffered a weak injury in his match against the Undertaker at the Royal Rumble, and was greatly recognized in the match despite his physical limitations. Triple H and China were initially left behind after interference from outside. Austin dean with an attempt at Sweet Chin Music and Stone Cold stunner was refreshed. Tyson later returned to the ring to count the property three times, winning with Austin, and Michaels dropped after the match. Tyson and Austin have gone together and the cat is playing with the mouse. <br /> <br /> The final PPV match for Shawn Michaels for four and a half years. It became a key turning point in WWE's war with WWW to establish Austin as the biggest actress in the wrestling business and the mainstream publication of Tyson. Austin is the biggest actress in WWE history and leads with WWE, along with Rock, Mick Foley, The Undertaker and Triple H, as well as their highest level of cultural connections. And it started here at WrestleMania 14.
