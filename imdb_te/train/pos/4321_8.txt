I'll keep it short. I believe this is an extraordinary picture. I have seen other critics who have commented on the strongly written effect, poorly shot and have a terrific soundtrack and worse, not in the picture of its life. Okay, so it's not very much about its entire length, but this film has a message of hope that some others seemed missed. I hope it is not too late to save people from the terrible things that are going on in many lives. Gangland violence is real, right? This is not correct! The film has an important social message, which may not be cynics but should be praised rather than appreciated. I saw at least eight times the experience with at least pleasure, every time I felt that in equal enjoyment, I felt that I could make the world better, every time. This is me for 10 to 9 me. This is quite accurate in my eyes. JMV
