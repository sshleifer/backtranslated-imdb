Emma is a true love. If you are charged with nonsense, wit and stupidity, you love this movie! This is true for the novel, it is very important, with some twists added for pleasure. Gwen does not have my favorite actes but she does justice to a role that everything she needs in spades. If I could do the right thing for any other actress, I was shining in the role. <br /> <br /> <br /> Jeremy Naram, the heroine. How surprised are you I looked at him pretty, but heck! What is the right role for you! He's wise, regal Mr. K is very good, I literally see him in a new light. He makes and stunning romantic lead. <br /> <br /> Evan McGregor, Gret Saachi, brings in the rest of them. Good cast. Good picture. If you're a fan of Jane Austen, see this movie along with Pride and Prejudice - and most importantly, buy books. This improves the image of an unusual height
