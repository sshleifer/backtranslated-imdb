Must see for someone who loves a photography. Wonderful and breathtaking, leaves you in ore. Twice in a movie and now seen on DVD. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Watch this day again when watching the video store. The nature and especially of a fox is said to be simpler of telling the child's love. In some ways it reminded me of the bare, which did not tell the story of the heroic form. It works well for children. <br /> <br /> But the star cinematographers of the movie, how did they do what they did? Amazing amazing.
