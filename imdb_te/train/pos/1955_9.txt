The movie I love. Some of the best British actors and only Sharon Stone. Catherine Trammel (Stone) manipulates a highly educated group of people's lives on their sincere efforts to collect experiences to write a murder mystery book. She plays a very good psychological role when using her sexy sex appeal to portray one of the ultimate Black Widows. The use of dark places in the Tramell community and the sadomasochistic waves in the free part of the town's 'visit after the darkness'. Initially, only a R rating from the dialog is low. Stone is also a Hannibal Lecter, an emotionless femme fatal without a meal plan.
