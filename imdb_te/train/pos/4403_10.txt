Image of a ride, aesthetic and historical significance with the devil as Ang Lee's next Brockback Mountain. Film lovers should look twice as desirable to grasp its artistic nuance. <br /> <br /> The perfect part of the surprising depth of human art. I do not really remember another war movie, so you can capture, change your existing sense of history and politics, restore your belief in humanity. After seeing many murders, the most suffering, you do not think you're numb, instead you think the relationship between people is valuable. Actors' performances kill your heart, music leads your mind. Some shoots are not just a few pictures, they exceed themselves, looking at the soul. <br /> <br /> Such a film does not require long comments or reviews. Tobe Maguire, Jeffrey Wright and Jewel Kilcher, Cinematographer and Composer of Beautiful and Literary Music, for the cast who has no success in Ocean!
