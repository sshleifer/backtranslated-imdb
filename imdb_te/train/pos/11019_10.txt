Cliffhanger is known as Stylestar Stallone's last action movie before he becomes such an induced actor. It's about a mountain climber to help his friend after capturing mercenaries who want to take three more suitcases for over 100 million dollars. It has a great action scene, your seat is fun and a great time for movies.
