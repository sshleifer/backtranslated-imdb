I'm not tired of being one of the best political thrillers ever made. The story takes place in a fictional state, but it clearly deals with Kennedy's murder. The honest and honest district attorney (portrayed by Yves Mantand) wants to close the dossier (= Oswald) and other officials who are continuing to investigate with his officers. <br /> <br /> The screenplay is strong and fast and has tension to the end. The part of dealing with milgram experimentation with officials is a bit untrue (not uncertain). The closing sequence - Icarus really explains who - partly slowly shot in motion and exacerbated by a Morgan soundtrack is the most powerful sequence ever seen in a movie.
