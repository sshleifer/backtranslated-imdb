I saw this picture twice and I think it's very good for the limited equipment used to create this film. Dr. Hayderdhall explained his theory about immigration to South American pre-Columbian Indians immigration policy islands. The documentary Dr. Hierdald and the crew are selected by the Bella trees in Ecuador and floating with the Pacific River to the Assembly in Peru. They began their 101-day marine adventure test with the strength of their oldest ornaments left only by the locals on that day. Look for your real adventure!
