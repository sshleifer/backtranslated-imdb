In this episode, the bust is completely shining, and I've seen the funniest excitement for the physical (and silent!) Comedy I've seen at the end of the career. His shouting in the talkie sequences is still a shock to hear. His relationship is not the only thing I care about the buster - but his ability to make a pity is still uneven. <br /> <br /> My deepest gratitude to Rod Serling is to provide us with this episode and provide the full range of Buster's intellect. He did not make much time (in one episode), but it was a touching tribute to Hollywood's great intellectual.
