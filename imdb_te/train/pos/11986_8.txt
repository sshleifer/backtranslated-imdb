I've seen one easy talk 'night', which is okay. Maybe Buster Keeton threw me out strangely saying, or a leading lady's hard line line delivery. The next day I thought about the movie. I was unable to get Durante from my head, I tried to remember the first scene of Thelma Todd, and I thought Keaton had done some funny anglers and physical comedy. The next night, she saw a scene with Thelma Todd, Chorus Girl who tried to impress Buster and Jimmy with her sex appeal. Very funny scenery, the actors are amazing, their faces, their eyes, their crazy expressions. I saw another scene and opened their show on Broadway. Buster in every act of his cheerful innocence bucket. Again, I was laughing out loud, appreciating Keaton's clowning and tumbling. The next day I saw the whole movie again, this time I'm looking for the first time: it's gorgeous! It's sensational! It's fabulous! Three great comedies! Todd Dances! Durante sang Keaton speaks! Sure it's not a movie ... but there are too many smiles in this movie.
