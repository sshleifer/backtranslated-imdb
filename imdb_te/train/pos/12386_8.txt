One of the best horror films in the industry of 'The Sentinel'! There are actually very few movies I feel really scary. Alison Parker is a model of some fame. She is a lawyer named Michael Lehman, and another best known model called Jennifer. Everything is great in her life until she decides to live alone for a while and rents a beautiful and old apartment. <br /> <br /> The problem is, her neighbor is very strange. Suddenly Alison begins to have faints with health problems and frequency; She remembers some traumatic facts about her past, which can cause nightmares or illusions. <br /> I personally feel 'Sentinel' a very creepy film, and '' The Exorcist '' '' Two horrible films I've already seen. When we realized that only the priest had occupied Alison's house and froze my blood! It's terrible to see her blind at the end of the film to be a new sentinel to keep the demons away from our world.
