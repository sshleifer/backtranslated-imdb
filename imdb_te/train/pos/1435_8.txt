I appreciate movies like this: smart and well-designed, entertaining, absorbing, well-played and well directed. No one - even the Pacino - is trying to stand out, the scene * is chewing; <br /> <br /> One of the most influential moments in this film (pulling up ao at his beloved ramp) is definitely cooled by its captivity. <br /> <br /> Quiz show City Hall is a similar type of garment: the mind, as well as the eye, ear, and heart. <br /> <br /> * You know that Pacino will chew it in a special scene, but it is definitely necessary. Great scene, too.
