I rented this movie before viewing the viewer rating from this site. It's an amazing picture that's added to my Christmas selection. The cast is a wonderfully selected and Ben Affleck plays a good role. I told viewers that I did not see the movie that I went ahead and did not buy. I'll rate right there with Christmas holidays. The film was very funny and well written and Ben maintained exceptional executive execution. What he says and does is how much I can imagine a person with so much money to work on. The film is much more ridiculous than Christmas with Santa Claus and Cranks. Plus it teaches true meaning of Christmas which is a good story line and you can not buy love money.
