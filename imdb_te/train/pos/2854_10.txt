Many have already said about this film and I want to join those who have appreciated me. This is a very special feature film, which uses elements of different genres: drama, comedy, gangster movie without its mess. You'll have to laugh at points, and think of the faults and faults you've seen at other points. Some scenes of Sabu's intellectual movie may be shown. One of the three men who had a romantic dinner about a young girl who was walking along one another, they went down the road. The range is beautiful and well illustrated by the characters of the three runners. It is romantic and funny at the same time. Another example of Sabu's intellect is the runners tired of the movie. The first of these is the distinctive defeat between the three guys, the woman who left the other and again and again when you dance with each other and dance with him. All of the runners get to this point they think that something they are missing or are on the track again. On the one side of the film they keep chasing each other, walking on the line, just laughing. So here all the sun and profitability we call the life that we show throughout the movie. His characters have failed (will they ultimately do?) But he will not lose their respect. "Monday" and "Postman Blues" will justify Sabu's argument that he is a genius. <br /> <br /> <br />
