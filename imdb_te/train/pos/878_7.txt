Interesting characters, tension lots. Close black and white without black and white. The massive sympathetic mainstream character, the quiet jaw secretary, is off as a decoy away from his own, revolving his companions, turning the people in his path harder and finally engaging in a robbery. I'm put a little off the trend for quality movies if jerks do not portray the criminals in a sympathetic way without solving the injury that has been made to others other than to portray their instant rival. Who does not know who has stolen us in the film, or what happens to the innocent wife who uses the chef-secretary to sympathize with the wrong bar owner? Very bad, this film was great.
