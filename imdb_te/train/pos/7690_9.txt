When people think of downtown Chicago, they feel when they think of Walter Payton, Didda and "Da Bears", Rain Sadberg, The White Socks in 2005, or his long-time Michael Jordan and his six championships (and the finals MVP) with the Chicago Bulls. In this genre, people rarely consider the struggling part of life in Chicago housing, urban centers, and urban housing projects in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> Television's most powerful performances and the sensational sitcom is "Good Times", and I am obsessed with a small kid on CBS, and now enjoyed it in TV Land. <br /> <br /> "Good Times" is another Norman Lear classic, "The Jeffersons", the best African American sitcom and "All in the Family". The "Good Times" has brought difficulties to the Ghetto and Urban Housing projects, and the charm, well written and thoughtful plot, and especially the Easter Roel and John Amos. Children in a supporting cast is especially important when Janet Jackson and her early years learn that Jackson and Ralph Carter Florida and James Evans are young children, life age life is unfair, and he has to learn to stand on his own two feet. <br /> <br /> Children's big JJ is part of the role played by Jimmy Walker in this program and is primarily for comic relief. His emotional ages was 11 or 12. Although he appeared as a person at the age of twenty, Suffers, and it is often credited to the evil James Evans (Amos). Get his own life, get a job and get out of the house. JJ An enthusiastic painter, but rather than his younger brother, who is strong enough to get a college degree, or even more important to the family, get a job to support a home above the welfare level. <br /> <br /> The two classic episodes of Janet Jackson's role of Good Times are the name of running the 104 fever, and Florida Evans desperately seeking better medical help she can not afford for anything but the clinic doctor who is too professional does not give her any more projects than she has legally own Family from attention. Other episodes, James Evans, can not pay $ 104 a month. Evans are going to get bigger to face the family, where they are thrown from projects and where to go. Florida Evans goes to the bottom of the Social Services Board to get loan or grant to help his family. But the government does not consider her family a penny because the five families have more than $ 4,200 in property, which is unjustly but unfortunately legitimately on the poverty line. James and children want the hustle for money, but do not want to do anything anyway as a person of Florida's great moral character and the dire of their plight. Eventually, the family finds a solution to keep their heads above water. <br /> <br /> "Good Times" is a classic show since the 1970s, you are heading over the water in the cruel world. James and Florida Evans work hard in regular jobs, attempting to bring their children to the right and prevent social crisis. I was very young to understand Sitcom's message in the first of the 70s in CBS, but in 2006 I really enjoyed it in TV Land. "Good Times" is one of the classic sitcoms from the back of the day.
