It's a fantastic Swedish film .. I saw the first Swedish film I've seen .. It's very simple .. It's a great combination ..! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> Conductor, who lost his battle with Michael, faces his wife and helps Michael find his own peace in music for people in his hometown for great reason. <br /> I'm not alone that's not the best .. but that's some deep meaning.
