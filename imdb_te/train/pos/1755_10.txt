This film is a riot. I had the best of the movies. I have seen some good comedies in my time and are generally pretty funny. But the walls of this wall are great walls. I think the best last movie in the show is the non stop at the end I did laughed very hard and did the 5-minute clean up of the sentimental plot as they were quite like the sign. It is also a constant barrage of a linear and goofy situation. I want to see you again before leaving the theater because you can not get all the jokes for the first time, just like the jaker movies. <br /> <br /> If the original film starts, it will make good use of the editing, which is at times unstable, but that we should forgive. All letters are great. It's not like Adam Sandler's film, he tries to be funny and everyone is hurt around him and the joke's butt. I remember all the major characters in the coming years because they all liked it. There are no victims in this movie. In addition, she earned a 45-year-old actress to play her girlfriend. Catherine Keiner plays her and she is a sweetheart in the film. You want women like her to really exist. <br /> She is not "10" like other prominent women, but her smile is warm when Julia Roberts crosses over byte. <br /> <br /> If you look at the trailer for the movie, do not think too well. I promise you, the trailer does not do justice. They do not give all the good jokes. <br /> Oh and another thing. I've put it in their top ten list of critics. Many of them have complained that they are not eligible to win, and they will not be in their list next year. This means you Ebert !!!
