"If I sit down I will never be forever," she said, when she told her mother (the title was one) with her son and some to rest. He rested for a woman and her condition at her age: to rest in peace and to neglect her. But she is not yet in the mood for "resting" and not yet. Suddenly, the revelation comes: she was 30 when she was a muscular carpenter (Daniel Craig, Brand James Bond), she said, "No one ever thought of touching her again anymore". This is a story that you can reflect on many things. Especially when her husband dies, a 60-year-old woman needs to do in her life. We do not seem to progress in such matters. I mean, no one is surprised when Sean Connery's love affair with a movie with Catherine Zeta Jones ... but what if it is not? <br /> <br /> The film has intelligent tones along with its length, excluding 2 or 3 sequences. The tones are broken up and there are some clear and foul-boggling conversations. Those obscene touches and the son and daughter of their maternal love (which is pretty absurd-if you understand what you mean when you're watching-) "The Mother" is only the subject of conversation. <br /> My rate: 7/10
