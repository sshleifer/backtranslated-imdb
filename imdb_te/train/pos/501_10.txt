I think this is the best one of the best Star Trek series yet, I say Potential .. We all know they have the opportunity to drop the ball and run out of ideas ... But I HOPE NOT! It's ok for those who have not seen it! Every time they encounter races without "PRIME Directive", they will be cool .. and the Scot is a great choice for the captain of the Bubbles, and the Wulkan Babe is very hot (check out the distracting scene) I gave this full 10 ... It's away from other series openers Blows .. I hope this goes to more than 7 years ...
