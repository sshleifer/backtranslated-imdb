Robot Jacks tries hard, but basically the line of action scenes - the robot against the robot, the man against the man, the man against the woman. The probability of the premise is that, but the script really seems to have given it more draft couple that need it. However, it is very good for a science fiction action movie. Some of it did the script by Joe Hldemann. For those who do not know the name, the science fiction novel "The Forever War" wrote Haldman Award. It is considered to be one of the best battlefield novels right there with Robert Heinlein's "Starship Troopers" and John Steckley's "Armor". And this film is like a huge force battle shield rather than huge robots. <br /> Despite some estimates, this is actually based on Paul VÃ¶hoyen's "Starship Troopers," which had to be admired. Based on Homer's "Iliad". A couple of names were common. Achilles is not parallel to the Iliad because of his robot's foot, which does not have the death of Achilles. Or the ancient Achilles is a great warrior. He is weak, but vengeance and small. The robot joke that was killed in the first scene may not be enough. Greek Iliad had Heracles. Hercules was named after him. <br /> <br /> The effects for effects and budgets are very good. True, it did not compare to "Terminator 2" a year later, but the film is ten times higher. Stop motion is as good as robotic walkers in "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi". <br /> <br /> Ray Harrihausen's animation is much better than most, but it's a long time. <br /> <br /> Incredible expectations will not be disappointing. It's much better than some big-budget blockbuster vanabels that have other low-budget flakes and good effects, but outrageous scripts.
