A real classic, ten out of ten! Every actor is perfect, screenplay is haunting thrillers. The scenes in the car and scenes are breathtaking. If the image is already on the DVD, it should be seen in the Widescreen version. It can be seen in the end five or four times, since then it has not forgotten. It was one of the first Warner to feature cinematography features, a process known as Warner Scope, which provided a very good cinematography. An Oscar is eligible for their performances by Shelley Winters and Jack Palace. The only thing that I can criticize is Nicholas Ray, who is raising his rhythm and tension.
