It was a weekend I saw this funny movie. And I really like it. All kids are beautiful, those stupid thinking who remind me of my own childhood. It's a real entertaining film for a group of families on the weekend night, memories and lots of laughters. Kid's humor always works. Good acting as well. Simple story but cool shooting. Good job for the director to find the way out of the kid. When it comes to the kid movie, I think "12 and holding it". This year, but the boy's world is different, it's real and cruel. Excellent work. H2EFW requires every child and family to focus on childhood happiness. Nemo's voice from the PS "Thinking Nemo" is unclear.
