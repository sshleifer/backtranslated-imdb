Would you like to know how far Hollywood can get away before the Hayes code is officially implemented? Well, unfortunately finds that "Convention City" loses, as well as just have to find "Tarzan and his mate". In 1934, there was also an exclusively sexually explicit and exposed meat. See Jane's naked swim. Although Tarzan is often considered to be younger and no-brainer B-adventure films, the film proves that the series was originally very adult. <br /> <br /> After seventy years, it was still sexy when it came. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have always enjoyed the wild films of Hollywood in 30 years and 40s, but I'll call great pictures. "Tarzan and his colleague" is the best film from this long trend. Today's scenes of attacks on Safari, or locals, create tensions today. Moreover, animals are very good (especially boulders throwing monkeys). Acting will not win any major awards soon, but it certainly fits for this kind of film. The film was once again stolen by the cheetah, a cute monkey in the forest. The pre-code is one of Hollywood's most entertaining examples.
