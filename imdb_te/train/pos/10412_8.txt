Baghdad's thief is a treasure. First and foremost, this is a good story. Despite the basic importance of these four stories to my hero, the most famous of the Arabian Nights stories is from Disney Corporation, which eventually includes the interest of Baghdad's Thief. The story moves at a good speed and has a twist or two that reduces the reduction estimate. Sabu, who plays the role of a young thief, also shows up to today's teen actors in appeal, when my eldest daughter told him "he was a Cuu-T-e!" <br /> <br /> In 1940, the film won an Oscar for cinematography and special effects. Today, in fact, those effects have long since ("It looks like Barbie flying in the air," when I see Johnny flying my birth). Yet they were better suited to the story. This film is over 60 years old. The effects match the script. Moreover, they have seen in Baghdad's Thief pretty much the state in the next twenty-five years. Compare the early montage from a 1967 Star Trek episode to see this. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you feel like you have a good time, The most valuable thing to look at is a very pleasing picture of all the effects I recommend.
