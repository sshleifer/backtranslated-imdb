Many of the sinks of the movie camera in the first century discovered some of its potential. This is a good story for the Playboy type. It requires money and unexpectedly sells his soul to Satan for a lot of money. Unfortunately, the soul is his double and he often has to face him, leaving his life. Both have a few moments of spectacular time, in fact, both at the same time on stage. The middle part is a bit dull, but the Faustian story is always in the minds of the viewer. One thing I have to say is the general intolerance of the people in this film. Moreover, they have given up at least some life since they are far from action. I first discovered this film 25 years ago and finally was able to see it. I'm not disappointed.
