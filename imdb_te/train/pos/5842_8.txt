As I said, "I like it", is not it simple and old in my observations? It's reasonably funny by bits, it's got great stars and it's gorgeous to look at. The songs (which are later recurring) are unforgettable, but they get a healthy contraindication (such as the terrible cute Mr. Fairbanks exploded in the crazy Wagner version of Miss Garrel of the laser ballad); There is not much dance with the 1861 chinolins around Miss Garrell, and the comedy may be a bit heavy hand, but the result is still very exciting. The photography (including the thrill real outdoor shots) is amazing, playing with the huge golden shades of different shades. Miss Garell is a bit of her lead and memorable side, but this continental "old world" comedy is still fresh and comfortable. This is pretty good along the lines of "Down to Earth" with Rita Heath, and many are unpleasant. So I suppose many people think that "lady in the armnine" is old and stuffy. But it is a fairy tale, and this is to move at a particular paste anyway. My advice - just enjoy the artwork, clothes, witty script and enjoy everything to make this film a fun, and compliment. In Germany, the film was released on DVD, both in German and English Soundtrack.
