ABC did more for this show by allowing television veterans, James Garner and David Spread to take part in the cast for this show. At first, this performance can be seen with John Ritter and Katie Sagal. The loss of John shook the world. Katie and three children are really a professional career. After the death of John in the real world, the lesson of the hour came home to me. I lost my father at the age of 17, feeling sorry for them, and understood them. ABC should be proud to perform this performance and preserve it as John's last wish. Because of such impossible conditions, the show has matured and developed. They should be rewarded with Emmys.
