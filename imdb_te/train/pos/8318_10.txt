A wonderful picture. Marie Alice, Philip M. Thomas, and the amazing acting by young Irene Kara. Tony King is very real in Satin. The film is the last of all the "all black" films of the last 70s, and unlike the "Blake Floatation" films of the era, the film actually has a story and is very well done. Aurora Franklin's feature film soundtrack was popular at R & B charts at that time.
