<br /> <br /> I saw a statement for this video. Then I realized that I had read my sister's book. I rented the day I finished the book. Remember the book a lot. This cast is great. Tara Fitzgerald was wonderful when Hélène and Rupert Graves were hateful to Arthur. Textiles, music and settings are very beautiful. <br /> Warning! <br /> <br /> There are some pornographic scenes that have trouble and some violence. That's why this video is 15. There are some things thrown out. In part, I felt the accuracy went downhill. It's better than the book, I'm glad to see it, reading it for people who read the book, like Brontë fans or dress plays (I am all 3 am!) Are sex scenes. This book is low. Anne Bronte's books are widely read as Dan, or Jane Ere or Worthing Heights. <br /> When I read the book, I wondered how much religion I was, but here they all got off! <br /> <br />
