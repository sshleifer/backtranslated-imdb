The film was a long-awaited release, and I was disappointed because I was disappointed with the expectation. When looking again I must say that I am pretty good. The first of all is to the original history (not entirely) and the only thing to keep the right of the image. Modesty's history is shown in childhood and the truth is very truthful. Acting is probably not the best thing, and the plot is a bit thinner, but it's good to be a musical when compared to the 1966 Vitti movie. Usually I would recommend it only to the fans of Modesty Blaze or catching on TV.
