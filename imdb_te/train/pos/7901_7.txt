The worst image of all time? Wow, alas now. <br /> You can tell about a movie you want to do. I live in Oregon, so I enjoyed beautifully-painted shots in the beautiful Smith Rocks and other locations in Central Oregon in Oregon (at the beginning of the film on our own Ken Kesey and the sweet comic baby Sissy's fiance of Ken Barbs). <br /> <br /> In this film, it is better for me to give better film than "average" score. Read the book a ago, and thinking to me "goodness, nobody ever could make a film of this interesting, aggressive, weird book ... especially 20 years later, mores (moses) <br />" When I first saw the film 1994 <br /> <br /> Sissy is a wonderfully cast, and I am telling you all what to do, I was also pleasantly surprised by the way Sham Phoenix and John Hurt's performances: I'm not a homosexual or bi-or trance, but many people want to play like them - and those "real" actors act as if they were a bit like a bit, stage-ey - always a bit "On." Gus Van Sant is an unnatural native oregon, but he has done a good job with this crazy book, IMHO .
