The political film of the late Jubrisky Point Antonioni often misunderstood, Antoniones American film. The stylist, following the "blow-up" suit, means that the pace is faster than previous legends, but this is not exactly accurate. <br /> <br /> Normally the film glorifies the hippie generation. <br /> <br /> Two leaders come from very different surroundings. Daria, Mark from "rebellious" young people from the estate agency corporation. But in the real Antonio fashion, they are trying to escape their surroundings. Mark rebeles a student rally and the empty rhetoric that disappoints the black Panthers, but Daria has been unable to keep her motion with her car. <br /> <br /> Annette, master director and shallow, then moving the city, after the rebellious youth filmed confusedly. An environmental corporatism, billboard advertising, is satisfied with meaninglessness, which creates profit at the same time to extend the same expansion to the population. <br /> In fact, when a small village in the desert desert stops, the environment gets into trouble, and people like lost cases are best by an old boxing winner, now reduced to a shade, drinking alcohol and smoking and talking confused. A fantastic tragedy is that some of the more half of the jungle children are surrounded by a stronger, some "benefactor", but "destroying the true part of America's history." Antonio has an opinion on hippies as an undesirable vague symbol. <br /> After that there is the desert, the landscape becomes a devastating effect, pure and horrific, ancient, wild and dead. The two heroes raise love, reflecting a similar sequence in the "Red" sequence "Red Dessert" in Fantasy's "Flower" generation, where Gillian tells a story to her son. It is colorful and colorful with colorless landscape. <br /> <br /> At the end of the cinema, the great conclusions, the Western civilization flew to the pieces. <br /> <br /> Athiyioni's two "international" films (British "blow up" and American "jabrisky point") are lesser than previous masterpieces, fast pace and inevitably contrived settings (Swing London, Flower Power America). But when it comes down to it, it's clear he has not lost the edge.
