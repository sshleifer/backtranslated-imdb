Traditional Western wide open spaces, clear etiquette, inevitable storylines, are synonymous with optimistic confidence of a leader's ability to shape his own destiny to escape his past. These symptoms directly reflect the self-American spirit, self-shaped dream, boundaries, and boundaries, so this style is still being suggested by opportunistic politicians. With some great exceptions (eg Welman, Hawks), Western is not healthy with nerves or genuine anxiety. <br /> <br /> Anthony Mann was changed forever, and this first flaw in the genre was never the greatest violent, bright, complicated, yet to tell the wonderful Western countries. <br /> <br /> Traditional Western, harsh completeness, the unfortunate events he may have had in the past, the image's dominance and the right, a supporter, will remove its barriers, recover harmony in effect; And a villain, often, ironically, drive the plot, the hero forces into certain actions. The difference between the two is simple as epic, such as wearing white or black hats. <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/html"> Man's background opposes the wide open spaces and the opposite of the optimists. Nayar has been constantly charged, in the role of morality in the distortion of a volatile character, the villain is often a villain, a passive victim of the inner-labyrinth of his own making. Noir is not a breakthrough, questioning them and refusing signs and instructions of signals, their creation and diagnosis. <br /> <br /> WINCHESTER 73 is full of worry. Nayar is often regarded as a psychologist style, thinking of the main character's sufferings. [73] It also does, and the protagonist is lovely, as the protagonist Jimmy Stewart begins his hardest film opening with Mann and Hitchcock. In many ways, good-natured and sweet, right-handed and trying to restore natural disruptions, he is near-lunatic, he's disappointed with nothing, in its relentless quest, Athen Edwards, at the Beatles <br /> <br /> Like Nair, his anxiety mental Has the foundation - Outdoor rather than many healthy leaders An (symbolically killed) their fathers, mekadej's father was killed before he was to complete the process; Chase his brother is a low level of moral hostility. Clockwise Shootout Out Catherine: McManda returned to the Skegers 'Common' Society, as he saw some of the world's most horrific horror panic. <br /> <br /> This is not really about the film, it's not really about a hero or a villain, but an inactive part of the violet that drives the action. The 73 glass window opens with the gun's headline for the display, its admirers get trapped, grunted, different, fictitious, and out-of-the-art. Throughout the film, human energy is strongly reduced to signifiers - change of names; Lynn and Dutch MimiM each other shooting because they do not have guns; quests lose their moral strength and close to their learners madness; The armies need help from confederate strangers to fight the battles; When a person refers to his name, he is respected with respect; When someone leaves his fianc√©e to others, another man reveals to be cowardly; The gun retains its reputation, strength and fullness. <br /> <br /> It is not a revenge story that drives the movie, a gun story; It removes the movie from traditional expectations, and creates a strange, unfair, and modern feel. <br /> <br /> When we're with a gun, we'll be able to retaliate that we are totally confused by another plot. <br /> <br /> This emphasis on the gun is a sign of powerful men, the criticism of the masculinity, exposing widespread rituals that do not mean the cost of society and order; Brutal capitalist greed; Indian merchants who cheated both the seller and the enemies are murders; Cowardice; Mental killers; Before returning to his 'real' owner, a broken hero is completely compromised and killed as a murderer. <br /> <br /> The gun is not printed under its own owner's name, because there is no fixed owner, there is no fixed morality, a lack of anesthetic to traditional masseuse. Western mythology 73 - Waithatt Earp, Dodge City, Cavalry, Civil War, Wide Open West - to undermine them. The ear has all but name that has not been proven to be unspeakable - Dodge City is not more illegal than anywhere; The cavalry is unclear (the Custard Old Little Big Horn is lost) and the bitter struggle of war is shown as absurd. The legend of Open West puts the most closed, inescapable, circular story, its roles, refusing to allow them to shape their fate, but it allows them to design. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] But this film is also evident as some Western countries have achieved, for all its construction. Man's break-up technique penetrates into key positions in his camera, varying outdoors with a serious test, saloon doors and state coaches live and live.
