This is one of my favorite series when I was a kid. The Swedish Broadcasting Company decided to broadcast once again when my first semester medical school was completed. I was surprised to see the depth described in the organs. Sure, some things have been simplified, but most of these are correct (which took 22 years ago!) And much more. I suggested to see a medical student soon. This is a good way to learn basic medical terms. Now I'm in my 7th semester and as soon as I have bought the DVD-box again I'll see the series again :-)
