If you're a purist, do not waste your time - otherwise hold your hat and enjoy the adventure. I liked the Stewart Granger / Deborah Kerr version - I have seen dozens, but each bit is fine, just different. I will spoil these images because I do not explain details. Also, there is a pleasure to see Alison Doody again (I'm a huge Indiana Jones fan), Patrick Swayze is good as Quatemaine, and the cast is fantastic. I have found the quality of the supporting cast in the trademarks of Halmark Production and this film is no exception. Cinematography is awesome and the score is perfect. If you're looking for fun, you will not be disappointed.
