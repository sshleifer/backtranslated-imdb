However, it is clear that Kakka Kakha is part of the Tamil prayer and that means "to protect". <br /> <br /> Similarly, the Tamil film industry is full of commercial enterprises, and the Rajnikant or Vijay film rules stand out. <br /> <br /> Now the nut shell is an amazing film with an amazing soundtrack. The final scene is absolutely incredibly amazing, especially the end (which is not really unexpected!). Gore is very high at times, but definitely this great movie!
