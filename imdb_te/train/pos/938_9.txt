Although George C. Scott is the sole actor in this version of the ACC without the British voice, he is more than his over-the-top and big-than-life commentary of Ebenezer Scoutze. <br /> In particular, he encounters Bob Krutet in his office at the end of the film. As the Scot is in front of the big window, the sun is a burning mantle on him; His closest look is your silhouette. Scotch's voice has evolved, has a chondered and impact ... now Marlon Brando's first scene in the Apocalypse. "Horror," indeed! <br /> <br /> However, as they say, work for you will also work for you. Scott's film displays such a joyful chaos throughout, because it proves epidemic. To keep on the other, "front" screws are almost "afterwards," he's not even though he can not really be attractive. <br /> <br /> You are responsible for Scott's Glib Rage as "Dr. Smith" since Jonathan Harris used the same approach while playing that character and many other burdens (theater and screen). But there may be other "Christmas Carol" cleaners. See cinema and judge for you.
