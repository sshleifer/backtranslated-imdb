In prison, four prisoners occupy a cell: a carrier (Gerard Laroche), who used his wife to cheat, cheated his wife; Drag lászálá (Philip Ladenback) and his follower, a pacerate (Dimitri Ratatou), who had eaten his six-month-old sister; And intellectual Marcus who killed his wife (Clovis Cornilac). One night, Kerrell discovered an ancient magazine hidden in a hole in the carriage wall. At the beginning of the last century, they realized that the book was written by Danors (Geoffrey Carrie) and belonged to a black magic. They decide to read and use its content to escape from prison, when they find out the truth about the dawn of fate. "Malfek" is original, witty and claustrophobic French low budget horror film. The story is practically the same, with no clues and hooks to attract the viewer's attention to the final scene. I am a great fan of French cinema, usually love, dramas and police stories. But recently I saw some good French horror films like "My Juue D'Enfants", "Belforto" and "Dead End". <br /> The title (Brazil): "Sinise's Mall" ("Symbols of Evil")
