Eight thylers appeared in this low-familiar classics from London who fall in love with the tea garden owner from British Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). With the advent of her, she immediately got out of place and had to be persistently aware of the new culture, as well as the angry elephant herd. Directed by William Dieter, The Life of Emile Zola and Jenny's Portrait, this romance is somewhat dark and almost amazingly skillful and I have a black and white background building and beautiful island view.
