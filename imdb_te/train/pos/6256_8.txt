I can come here, but if the film has its technical masterpiece, I last saw a piece in TCM last night, the question arises: why do they do that? Killing the lives of many of their lives, many of them die on the trek, when they get to the "land of milk and honey", if their animals get food, why such a lethal journey will be made? Are they there? Do you feed your life, your whole community, and a flock of cattle? As it is dangerous, it will only redirect the redness of this kind of people to do only for that purpose. Death of a cow for a cow? I'm better than them!
