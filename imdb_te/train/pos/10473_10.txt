I first saw this movie, I'm in a bad frame. For some reason it has clicked on my level, family, passion and the desire of those who share your life. It does not hurt that anybody to share your life is beautiful girl like Claire (Cyndy Preston). I also bought the soundtrack for this movie (very hard). Dear it and hope that some day DV will come out
