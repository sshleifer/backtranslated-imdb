This image is good. This is actually a cleverly written and really 'conformist' that is a great attraction for those who do not have movie pickers. Do not make me wrong - there are some great movies that have a wide range of attractions, but when you're reading a movie based on "everyone's watching" - you know whether you're in the middle or really upset. This lovely subtle humor has - although only a few people are obviously looking. The actors portrayed their roles and I thought there was a very "personal" personality in the film. Children, as well as adults appeal. ESP. It is good to find a good movie that is not filled with sexual references and drugs! A great picture is not neglected by public consumption. This one should be purchased.
