These three studios flick is at my tie with my other favorite flick "Disorder in Court". <br /> <br /> When the lovely Christine McInterre is singing a great version of the "Voices of Spring", the boys attend a recording studio. She signed a record deal, but she proved herself to be honest with her father about her choice of career and proved herself as a real singer. When she and others abandon the studio, the Stooges makes little fun and decides to play her record and dress up Christine as Christine. The Contract Lady, who can do Christine's career, is curious to see him and invites Curley to sing for her party. In reality they are a man who is disturbed at the party and they will destroy his solo before the crowd, so he will find a way to get them back. <br /> <br /> Stogie Flick, it should not miss! <br /> <br />
