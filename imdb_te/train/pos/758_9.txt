I know that Jacques is talking about a similar event, and I've seen one or two episodes in Freeview, and it's just more intense, same. Usually three Welsh guys, and a mad british barbaric love of skateboarding, and brought together a complete refusal / masochistic joy to harm themselves and their health and safety. They are eating puks-covered pizza, jammed nettles, naked paint balling, jokes on little man, sleeping, snoring, fighting work places, e.g. Armies, cowboys, and many mad injuries, bumps, blood and vomiting. Matthew Pritchard, Lee Danton, who has done pretty much anything, also made Don Joyce (British one) very physically and an OTT laugh, and Pancho (Mike Locke), a lot more popular for small, fat and lazy. It's 100 Greatest funny moments. Very nice!
