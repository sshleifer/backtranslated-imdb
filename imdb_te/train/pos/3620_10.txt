This night I saw this movie. It's great !! I'm a big fan of sports movies, it's one of my favorites. Dennis Quaid is great. (Oh, by the way, Mr. Quaid, if you're reading this ... my sister Austin lives, where do you live ..... and she once bought you a drink ... well ... she kept you up ... But she does not need to say: c) [no one will ever believe it ...]) However it's a great movie. Everyone who loves a good sports movie should go out! : C)
