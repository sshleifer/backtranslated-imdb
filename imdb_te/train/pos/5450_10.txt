Barbara Stanwick plays Lily Powers. She is a waitress for her father's speech in a small artificial mining town. He sells her to men. <br /> <br /> In fact, I only saw the 71-minute version but its time was pretty - at the time I escaped to New York. It's very beautiful these days. The film moves very quickly and has tons of sexual admiration - some of which are pretty crazy (but fun). It's also in 1933 - there is nothing classic or souvenir about this - it's just a quick, gleefully dirty little movie with lots of fun - it moves so quickly that you can ignore that could happen very easily. This is entirely different from the slight "moral" end of the Sensors Demand. I saw a 75-minute version of the uncut, somewhat tragic and good as it comes across the incredible and stupid one - I saw in a theater and the crowd laughed on it - a guy said quite rightfully "no way"). This version is expected to be lost until 2004 when it was discovered incorrectly! I believe that it is only one of these releases - but know. <br /> <br /> Acting is good - Stanwick is playing in the top while flapping his character and on top. She believes she is sad and sleepy. There are also strong support from the beautiful Donald Cook and George Brent. Also look for the front star John Wayne in a hilarious bit of a gentle and mild office worker! Fun, dirty and fast. I give this a 9.
