This film is a wonderfully simple task. At the same time enjoying it from the beginning is sad. Mirta Otto (oh, how much she is more famous!) And George Del Hoya's performances are almost as painful as both beautiful and yet painful spirits come to understand each other. The cast to support the workers at the Dead Letter Office, including the amazing bit-parts, Alice's long-suffering boyfriend, I could not help, and a little sorry. I can see and see a special scene (and I have it!), Movies like this can not be recognized as such a shame, so they take them to the public eye to enjoy more people. I cried, I laughed and I sighed. I recommend this picture to anyone.
