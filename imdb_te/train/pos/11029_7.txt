I'm from a very Sylvester Stallone fan and I'm not very important to him, it's in the French cinema Taxi 3, which is an almost invisible character. <br /> <br /> Gabe (Stallone) falls to her death when she fails to save one of her friends. He can not force himself to work as a mountain ranger from a 4000-foot high mountain peak. For almost a year he did not set up food in the reserve, but until he returned. As soon as he returns, they call an emergency call from a group of hikers who are trapped in a blizzard. At least, that's what Rangers believe. In fact, this is a group of thieves who collapsed in their flight in the mountains after their audacious plan to steal cases that were financed by a flying government plane. Cases are spread over the reserve and they need help with professional climbers to return them <br /> <br /> This is not one of the most brilliant movies ever, but in its genre it is an enjoyable one. I especially enjoyed John Leighgun as a bad master mind and a gang of thieves. I know him well from the TV series "3rd Rock From The Sun", but I enjoyed her performance in the film. Overall acting, it's a lot of activities and of course some even a liners, but it's also a nice design. The film is depicted in an amazing natural environment. I like the snowy mountains and the valleys, mountain rivers and forests ... I will score more than I would normally give to this action / adventure movie. I give a 6.5 / 10. If you do not expect too much, it's a fun movie.
