This is one of my all-time favorite films, and while it moves very slowly, it is very valuable. A corporate attorney (Richard Chamberlain) "City" pulled into the case of Aboriginal people, and this is not a common case. Well, one man was dead, but it was not a simple murder. Lately the average rainfall is longer than that, and the climate of most part is slightly claustrophobia & oppression. The Aborigines resorted to secret and refused to kill the beans. This is a lot to make white men making predictions about "City" vs "Tribal" Aborigines, and of course Abo tribes in the big city will practice tribal paths. Uh Huh. Chamberlain has strange dreams and what he's looking for is crucial, no matter how many times I've seen, I can not understand the exact connection. This is the best example of the ability to create tension because there is nothing very strange and creepy film, Peter Weir's. The end is a little blurry but I literally take it, it's the easiest way and terrible. 10 to 10 and is highly recommended.
