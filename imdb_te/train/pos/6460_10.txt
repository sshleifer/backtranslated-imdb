If the filmmaker and director of music were intended to open hearts, they could do with his music, they succeeded with me. The common human conditions became original, personal and immediate, and I thought I had personally touched every situation. I believe that I will credit the power of music along with the perspective of the film writer. Without scattering, I can say that the film's importance is moving too much to live. What really does not matter? Empathy? Just a deep emotion? In a very long time. I'd like to find a way to show it to others. It was found at the Seattle International Film Festival.
