I strongly recommend this film. This was about the boy, Stanley Elnotes (Shia LeBeouf), who was mistakenly convicted and sent to the Camp Green Center for Children's Detention Center. There, he will have to dig the holes in a 5 foot depth and 5 feet diameter. While there, he meets the camp's other boys (Zero, Magnet, Armpit, Squid, X-Ray and Zigzag). All of them are digging, build 'buildor', but find out the treasure of the illegal Kate Barlow. Stanley learns more about the past (and book) throughout, about more about himself, and more digging holes. When I came to books for movies, I was very picky, because (if the movie is to follow the book correctly). But, it still did well.
