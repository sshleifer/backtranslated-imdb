The film is a great example of good storytelling. Acting is amazing. The story is stimulating without overly fraudulent or fake. They probably have twin points made by a tad more good or bad for people than they really are, but considering a Hollywood film, they have shown remarkable restraint. There is only one explosion in the film, although they have a chance. The film, which has enthusiastic parts, has not been taken as action film. This story was unfortunately focused on an extraordinary person during normal times. Well done!
