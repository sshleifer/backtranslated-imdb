Like his previous film "In Glass Case", Agusti Villaronga achieved a more visually visually and most poetic canvas than its predecessor. This is one of the most visual and chasing films ever seen. Strong drama, intensity and intimidation are involved or intimidated, and it never goes out. Thus, it pulls off an almost impossible feat: So over-the-top and yet so painfully detained, so charge and still poor, and even the explosive finals are the virtuosic treats of the eye. Unseen, beautiful, and the longest ... this picture is just amazing!
