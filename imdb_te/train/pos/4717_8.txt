How does anyone love this film? I think of the joyful irony of old gangster films. If you have never seen them, rather see it. Michael Keaton plays a role in this role. A person punches the English language everywhere he speaks and Griffin Dunn is a clueless D.A. Plays the role, but my favorite character is Joe Pisco. He has all the best lines. Danny Davitto, Alan Hale and Ray Walthon are in this star-studded movie, they are far more ridiculous than gangsters than "mafia", the underground bounty.
