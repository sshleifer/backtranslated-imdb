YES, the plot is rarely acceptable and very thin. Yes, the acting is ridiculous from the mean. YES, this happened several times. Whatever we are dealing with is not to be withdrawn from these facts and acting more than that. There are actually some original death scenes and tension increases throughout the film. In addition you will not have more than a few minutes from killing the ghari. I look at the eye that everyone can see this picture and see what it is. No one is a scary, funny slasher movie with a theme tune for the latter.
