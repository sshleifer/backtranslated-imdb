<br /> <br /> What's interesting about it is the Japanese film they decided to bring to America, but they actually filmed it. Japan with original crew! I made this film ... more Japanese (which was a lot more successful than most Japanese-to-America horror films) but it did not quite reach American audiences. Japanese culture is frightening and the American culture of film is a threat to all. <br /> <br /> A big, busy, unknown, frightened fish in the pond: it worked well when they intended to capture the nervous fears of the main character. <br /> <br /> The storyline is very confusing. In ordinary Japanese fashion it is very complicated and confusing. From the beginning of the film to the middle part of the story and from there we have constantly moved back and forth, at the end of the film, we see the end of the story and the beginning. By the time this steady flipping was very confusing for me. Moreover, I did not think that some things were very well explained and asked me to explain to my friend (she had already seen, as well as the sequel's story reveal). <br /> <br /> Overall, American audiences have a love, taking racism imagery and macbrette detail, a healthy splash of jump scenes.
