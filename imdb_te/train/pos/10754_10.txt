When I first showed it on CBS, I saw this. I was one of many people in NYC that day, and I'm going to school at Hunter College. I want to see all the destruction and carnage again, but like most people I'm curious to see what's going on. Looking at this documentary my eyes got tears. My memories came back and only serious pictures are unbelievable. I bought a DVD anniversary and I see it a few times. How wonderful this guys were able to capture this footage. If you do not see this documentary, help yourself and check it out. This is clearly discouraging and tears to the eyes, but this is a wonderful document for the dark bell of these countries.
