Acting - amazing. Story - amazing. This script is amazing. <br /> <br /> There are a few ways to describe this film. Yes, it's slow and talking, but the whole story of their lives and how it's thrown out and the guerrillas outlined are you willing to hear every little thing to learn more about this sensational and tragic story. I read the book I read in the movie, and it made it easier in this story and answered some questions that were not answered in the film. Gilmore's 'other' half of the story, is to read the exciters song. The film made me think of the phrase "pirating to the other side of the glass". You hear a song from the movie called Gary Gilmore Eyes, which is Gary Gilmore's eyes (one of Gary's deaths) by Punk Band and you hear it last time after seeing Myle Gary, only if you are the only song here Look a little differently. This film opened my eyes in that way and in many others. I highly recommend this movie (and book).
