New York, I Love You, the collective work of eleven short films, each segment runs for 10 minutes. The shorts are not exactly related but they all have something in common, love. The film stars Shia LaBeouf, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Orlando Bloom, Chris Cooper, Andy Garcia, Christina Ricky, Irfan. Khan, Robin Wright Penn, Julie Christie, Ethan Hawk, Bradley Cooper, Rachel Bilson and Anton Yelchin. With such a stellar cast and such an interesting radius, I look forward to a wonderful movie; Add New York I Love You No Problem It is the sum of its parts. Some sections are funny, original and interesting, but others are such meaningless (Orlando Bloom / Christina Ricky and Ethan Hawk / Maggie Q sections) that's terrible. The image is definitely uneven and has a very experimental tone. By story-telling, some film students seem to have put together. There are two great sequences in the film, Eli Wallach and Cloris Lechmann have participated in their 67-year marriage anniversary in their broklin. And moments like this, a viewer made me, because the image is more consistent, because here is a lot of potential. But, since the whole story is unsatisfactory, I have saved all cinematography and soundtrack for myself. Editing is accurate, the way the film is painted is very impressive and the space soundtrack is not very fitting. Finally, I feel like New York I Love You is an experimental film, and is the highest and lowest of most experiences. It will look at one of the whole movie, which determines whether he will enjoy it or not. <br /> <br /> It may be worthwhile for the time and cost of waste for others. <br /> <br />
