The film was a few years later, I would have given a lower score. However, for 1909, it was a small film and still pretty much. Do not try to compare this silent film to silence - the industry has become so intense that the stories of the first decade of the 2040s have not been seen as all the 1910s and beyond. <br /> The film is 11 minutes (about the average of most movies) and Edgar Allen Poe's story, the variation of the AMONTILLADO OF CASK. While most of the story is familiar to me, I do not want to destroy the film. It's enough to say that it's very serious !!
