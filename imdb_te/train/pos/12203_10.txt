Orson Wells "Shanghai From Shanghai" does not have an amazing screenplay of "Citizen Kane", e.g. Charles Lauton, Jr.'s cinematography, unforgettable set pieces (aquarium scenery, seaside scene a wonderful, blonde-refreshing Rita Havatth singing "Please Do not Love Me", and the amazing Stunning Hall of Mirrors Climax), and the amazing cast (Everett Sloan in his great performance Wells, in a beautifully featured role, is mentioned earlier by Miss Hewworth - Wells Wife - she is very beautiful at that time), making for a very memorable experience. The strange murder mystery plot is pleasant and compelling, not indecent at all. The viewer is surprised by twists and turns, and the closure line of Wells is a rare classic. "Lady from Shanghai" receives four stars from this impartial intermediary.
