"Amazing Mr. Williams" stars Melvin Douglas, who made five films in 1939, one of which was Ninochko with Gorbo. His co-star Jon Blondel (Maxin), starred in five films for the two films of the year, both of which were the three films they did together! Douglas Lepthius Williams, and he and his co-horts are shown with a dead body and must have realized what really happened. Viewers recognize his colleagues - actors (Clarence Collab, Donald MacBride, Dan Bedeo) are always in positions of power ... Senators, bank presidents, policemen. It has a humorous comedy for e-dunny - police always throw each other out and Williams and his girlfriend are fighting the word. Some fun dresses - Williams also takes the guy with his girlfriend, along with the date arrested. There are many pleasant things here, so start slowly and then wait for the funniest things. Do not want to give any spoilers, so you should catch up with Turner Classic Movies. Director Alexander Hall made a lot of humor and was briefly engaged to Lucy.
