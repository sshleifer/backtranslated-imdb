I did not give this film a perfect score to be honest compared to great classics like "Citizen Kane" and "Seven Samurai". However, the film is so awesome, which scores little for the simple IMDb voter. <br /> <br /> Hale Kate Eisenberg is the only acting criticism I can suggest that she does not play the role of a perfect stem. <br /> <br /> Forgive, 6-year-old Child Dustin Huffman is asked to make it impossible at the Rainman Film Making. Such as the Bollywood road trip, the con-games, the friendly party-animal (bird-bird), the younger and the Disney-like comedy for vintage. Tony Shalub wore his character as a pair of comfortable jeans. It looks normal, it seems. Buddy Hackett and Cheech Marin make the right characters in this movie, the characters that we all know best for ourselves I always recognize that Joe Mohar is a little too soft and the character on his screen is also sufficient Finally, it works well, creates a parrot and anti-parrot as a team and creates its own magic. <br /> <br /> If you are trying to find a picture for children and you do not want to insult or bother you, "Paulie" is a perfect candidate, However, I am happy to say the happy moment of "Pali", a time when a big warm-wave Undikaryala hadari of the air conditioning went on the tour, half the restaurants are cool (as our hotel was), and I said, "Let us work, so we have to work in the air. So for 100 minutes we have cooled, amused, and given heart-warming experience. I have seen recently in VCR in less emotional situations, and I realized how good the movie is. <br /> <br /> A sleeper image you do not care about.
