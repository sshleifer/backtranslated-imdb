I was going to bed with my gum last night, and when she was rubbing on her teeth, I chanced until the Chinese movie I was Mask King came across. At first I thought it was a kung fu film, so I started looking at it, which immediately captured me and I finished it. <br /> <br /> The little girl in the picture is completely upholding. She is a great actor for being too small. Maybe it was in Chinese language, it was difficult to tell me because English was translated ... but she really looked perfectly in the role. I tried to make her the "owner", but everything was getting dirty. LOL. Even when she brought him another grandson, he could go on her art ... The kid was kidnapped, so he was arrested and 5 days to live. <br /> <br /> Finally, she teaches her how much she loves and teaches her mask's art ... She is good to her grandfather. <br /> Definitely a gem, and completely original. <br /> Scott
