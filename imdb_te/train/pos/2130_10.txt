A fantastic picture, filled with great poor performance and sharp, intelligent conversation. What really separates the picture, however, is the undercurrent of the tragedy across. These stories are the fears of losing their jobs in the world of affairs, loneliness, suicide, disappointment, and horrific consequences. Longer than ever, World War II was put in the unseaked world in the beginning. In fact, if you compare serious scenes to the comedy scenes, the movie is just comedy. Yet it's funny - listen to Jimmy Stewart Margaret Sullivan's tough removal and see her oppressed expression of replies that her comments are a great blend of "poetry and meanness". It's funny, point, and sad all at once. One of the greatest achievements and ten biggest screen comedies ever made.
