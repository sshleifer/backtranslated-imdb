Tom Hanks never seen you before. Hanks Michael Sullivan, "The Angel of Death". He was a murderer for his surrogate father John Rooney (Paul Newman) for the elderly Irish Mob boss. Sullivan's youngest son (Tyler Hochlin) is witnessing on the road in seven weeks of bank robbering for his father's survivors and both to take revenge for Sullivan's wife and other sons. Enter Jude Law as a journalist / photographer who is ready to kill Sullivan for the opportunity to add to the collection of dead migrants. In the 30s, the drama of life is beautifully filmed. Sometimes the pace bogas down, but then the graphic violence blasted the story. Director Sam Mendes directs this powerful drama about obedience, responsibility, betrayal and a secret person and his young son's bond. Other prominent cast members include: Dylan Baker, Stanley Tookie, Daniel Craig and Jennifer Jason Lee. Hanks again proves to be incredible in a very memorable film. Make room for some Oscars!
