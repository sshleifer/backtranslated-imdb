I'm always surprised at what you see about World War II in Germany's national television. You may think that you do not like to open old wounds, but there is no documentary about the horror and atrocities of this war without a documentary or film. Perhaps it is a way of dealing with their past, I do not know, but you can not blame them for ignoring what happened. And it is said that: Most of those documentaries are really worth a watch because they try to comment on the truth and say the same about their movies (think about "Der Untergang" or "Downfall" <br /> <br /> One of those films is "Rosenstrauss "It tells the true story of the mixed marriages in war and is now a family with a family in the USA After Hannah's father died, her mother had not changed much before, but suddenly became a traditional Jew, but her mother's troublesome childhood began to dig where she did not know where Hannah was <br /> <br /> Mixed marriages in the Nazi regime Nlo this film is. I knew, the subject of another film made. (This is not yet known to them, pure Aryan man, or woman, called the marriage to be of the Jews, they immediately in concentration camps sent to, but they are in a factory had to work). But not just about the issues of mixed marriages, it's also a good idea that these people often see their own parents and relatives. How difficult it was to them sometimes during the Nazi regime and how these women, how many women, who had done everything within their power to get their people locked up once they were locked up in Rosen Straussay ... <br /> <br /> Acting is pretty cool and it Although I did not do well as initially submitted, the story is very well written (and it's definitely you see Dalicina only part of the trailer). Maybe it's only me, but I have a big part of what happened today. <br /> <br /> Hannah goes to Berlin and speaks to those who have learned more about her mother's past. There is something in the Second World War, and if you're looking for a lot of action shots, it's a must-see movie. It's not what wars or guns you're looking for, but it's definitely a very interesting picture because you know only a part of the war on the subject. I give 8/10.
