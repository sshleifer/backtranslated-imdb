The film has a lot of raw probability. The script is sharp, the dialogue (usually) is excellent (although it may be able to lose cheesy voice-overs), direction and cinematography is surprisingly good, but some of the experiments do not work. The main problem here is David Ducovin. Geek-boy once, always geek-boy; And the sad, simple fact is that Fox Mulder can not play. He pose, he tries to be soft, he poses, he tries to macho. Ultimately he is trying hard. He has criticized his role, he performs a lot of his lines, and he is surprised by all the ways through his talented Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie of his class. Timothy Hutton (as always) is good. He is in a spotty moment or two that dramatically filmed his character, but he can say he's been fun with it. He saw the character, and he played a role in physical and environment. Angelina Jolie is also good. There is not much of her role; In fact, even though I am more strengthening her ... her character did not adequately develop, yet she liked her. And the chemistry between her and Hutton is clear (Gee, why Uma can leave him!) It's hard around the edges, but with great cast and great supporting roles. If David DeQuovin does not cut his character into pieces, it's * very good. 7/10.
