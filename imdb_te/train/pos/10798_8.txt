At first I saw this gem from Joe Sarno and I never miss Jennifer Wells after seeing it. At first, I thought it was a bit slower than I expected for a Suron film, but when Jennifer entered her, I ever watched her anytime, I sat down and took notice. The film was very difficult to prevent her presence in the film, and she portrayed each scene sensitive. I saw a lot of suron's movies from the rest and saw other films starring or starring Jennifer Wales, and Jennifer was at their mass best. This film of domestic adult drama is magnificently directed by Saro, and Jennifer (symptomatic and literally) is an acting prowess that requires a performance. Co-stars Rebecca Brook (also known as Mary Mendem) and Chris Jordan, frequently co-stars of Ms. Welles and co-stars of Mrs. Walsh and are often considered to be courageous and adventurous housewives. This movie is a Sarko classic.
