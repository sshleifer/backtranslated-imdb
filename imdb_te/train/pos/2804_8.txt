The title of the film almost saw me and saw me. <br /> <br /> Though Beckham is a little bit less than Manchester United fanless, I have shared my unpleasant things behind me and I am happy. <br /> <br /> I was very much in film, but I was pleasantly surprised. The film never looked with me and I enjoyed every second. If you like East East, you will like this movie. OK, so the storyline is not new, and the classic storytells are in the movie, but it's all very fun and fresh breath of breath. The film moves very fast and makes the discovery fun. Occayional funny moments are good chuckle and humor are not some poor effort, and it's a good British comedy which is all good.
