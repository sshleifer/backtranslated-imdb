Gorgeous techolerol produces an extraordinarily romantic story between a strongly religious believer woman and tripartist sisters who have left her mutt, breaking her pledge. The film opens in a convent in Europe where a former student prays - a lonely beauty in the black-eyed Domini (Marilyn Dietrich). Mother Superior advised her to go to the desert and "find her", and recently lost her pain on her late father. She sat opposite a very troubled man (Charles Boyer) in a train car on the way to Sahara - our former saint. She is at a hotel near Palm-Tree Oasis, where she looks back to our mysterious man who is confronted with a very charming dance girl who is confused about what to do. <br /> <br /> I find this film is very fun and entertaining - sentimental, melodramatic, and different (in a way, almost surreal and a bit campy). Photography in this is really interesting - full of intricate facial expressions and beautiful colored shots of the crossroads of the desert crossing, silhouette statues to the sunset sky. Marlene Dietrich fills it perfectly, retains the performance and looks awesome. Charles Boyer - is not usually one of my favorite - actually pretty good in this, I think it's sort of a part of suits and he looks a lot younger and more beautiful. Basil Rathbone is very nice here. Another great orchestra score by Max Steiner helps to keep the rolling play - a very pleasant picture of everything.
