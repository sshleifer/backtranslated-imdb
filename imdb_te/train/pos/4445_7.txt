This early Cirque drama, portrayed in black and white, displays the German director's flair to expand the tale lines of tiredness into something similar to the art of a short film. Set in 1910, Barbara Stanwyck sinned the woman who left her small town husband and family for the trap of the Chicago stage. She never fulfilled her goals, and she brought back an inspiring letter from her daughter, who also told her that she liked the theater (high school production). Once again in her old town she is once again against the small-minded and she needs to deal with her nasty older daughter, the confused (and boring) husband (Richard Carlson) and the former lover. This theme is new, but Circus separates himself by creating meaningful compositions, each frame is carefully portrayed and helped by Stanwick as his prominent lady. It runs a crisp 76 minutes, and the material does not go away to the feet.
