"Bye Bye Bird" is not one of the best musical stories of all time, but it's very fun and available to many audiences. Dick Van Dyke rewrites his signature Broadway role, and the original film may have been awesome, but they are confused with the story, so the film is very unsatisfactory. This reconfection, which was broadcast in ABC in 1995, was very confident in the original script and had some of the original songs used in the national song, the film is quite different from Tommy Tune and On Reigning Jason Alexander Dick Van Dyke, but Albert (before his "Seinfeld" , He started in the musical theater.) Vanessa Williams is a perfect fit for Rose . <br /> <br /> This is a great deal from Tyne Dalie from May and Mark Kudsch as Conrad Birdie (a character who played national tour). <br /> <br /> This film is not without problems. Chynna Phillips, however, a bigger responsibility seems just too old to look, just looks and young Kim. <br /> <br /> But George Wendt is a little too soft as his father, and some "children" (many have been stolen by the original cast member Paul Lindh√§). <br /> <br /> But this is a good movie.
