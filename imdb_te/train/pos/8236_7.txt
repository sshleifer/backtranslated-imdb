Because the "Domestic Collar" invented, meat-eating zombies control and become productive members of society; However, they are doing frivolous things. Those who live in small towns built in the 1950s will attend the corpse dead, but unidentified zombies revolve in "The Wild Zone". In the town of "Willard", Teenager K'sun Ray (like Timmy Robinson) lives with parents Carrie-Anne Moss and Dylan Baker (Helen and Bill Robinson). Unfortunately, Robinsons are just a family in their street; Their new neighbors, bottoms, six. <br /> Unfortunately, Mr. Connolly's "Domestication Caller" was hit by an older woman's walker and he eats her; Then, the new and hungry zombies destroy the town. Meanwhile, young Rae Connolly (boy and his zombie TV's "Timmy and Lassie") teamed up and Robinson's family control was difficult to collaborate with "jomcom" officials. <br /> <br /> "Fido" is not too far away in its own secret "wild zone"; But it is a colorful, beautiful, and fun cinematic movie for zombie movies. Ray and cast personally performed well; Sunza Bennett (Tommy) and owner Tim Blake Nelson (Theopolis) are the most memorable pair. Director Andrew Currie and staff, including Rob Gray (design), John Kaiser (photography), Don MacDonald (music), and James Wilcoque (design), have won awards. <br /> * Fido (2006) Andrew Cure ~ KIsun Ray, Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker
