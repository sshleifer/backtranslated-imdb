A forgotten gem called the 'hippies' called 'Hippies', the BBC, was written by Arthur Matthews, though the couple created the sitcom world with the next creation of Arthur Matthews and Graham Linehann with 'Father Ted'. <br /> <p> Set-Ray pirbes in London in 1969, editor of a hippie, anarchist magazine. <br /> <br /> Simon Pegg was excellent as a surgeon but he was a fantastic man, but his friends were his flat-mate, too much back and marijuana smoker Alex, his 'girlfriend' feminist jill and no one much Hugo. He is in all. This sitcom has a sense of 'citizenship smith' about it. Like Ray Wolfe Smith, attempted to dodge the society, but failed miserably. Finally this sitcom will be released on DVD in March, I can not wait to buy. It was in 1999 and was repeated on global television - my memories are not very good of the sitcom, and the two parts are really clearly remembered, so I thought the opener was 'Protestant hippies'. - In protest against Ray Sandpaper, I thought the other episode 'Hippie Dippy Hippies' is Episode 4 and again very clear about the Police. Unfortunately, the sitcom was a negative response from the viewers (I can not think why). The BBC set up another series, but Arthur Matthews decided to make it a negative response. <br /> <br /> The best episode: Hippie Dippy Hippies-Series 1 Episode 4.
