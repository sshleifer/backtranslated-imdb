This second film is not interesting, but there is no suspense. We know what he's going to do, and what's going to happen before the screen is mentioned. Then happiness comes only from various tricks and their legacy. We know that the car is outstanding, we know he will lose a wheel, and the car is in danger and we can just talk about the car. And it happens. Now there are details and details to find them in this picture. It is obvious that some people fear him and come in, but we know he's already seen through her and he finds that he is pulled into a trap. Now, how does he get out? You must know yourself. And do not worry he gets to the main merchants but how is another story. A speed boat does not match our busy surge in the river. We know when he is injured. Bulletproof jackets are not known in those days. Recently it's true that Iraq does not have some GI equipment. But what is the meaning of such a film? This persistence is to hunt traffickers who do not recognize the ban and create this problem. But the film is a stable and precise example, there is no value that can stand in the path of this moral crusade against the forces of evil. Since these items are not legitimate, can they be properly examined and supervised? When something is unlawful or going out of the way, all of them are less fun to use. <br /> <br /> Doctor Jacques Coulardou, University Paris Duufine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Soroben & University Versailles St Quentin Ann Evelynes
