The fourth in the "Dirty Harry" series is one of the most vulnerable, bizarre, unpleasant, unpleasant, unhappy women in the film: "Ray Perkins", Audrey Neenan. <br /> <br /> She is the character of the modern "Diamond" character of 1945, unfortunately, "On Savage". <br /> Her foul note and the gutter attitude is far from me, she has an obscene filter that has shut up ... and some of her at least! <br /> <br /> Everywhere goes to "Harry Calahan" (Clint Eastwood), the violence comes down immediately ..... in minutes! It is often very ridiculous, but with a satisfying ending for a fast moving, entertaining film that eliminates all sagging villains. <br /> <br /> It is sad to say, this is very sororic film appeal to our base instincts ..... and connect. Many of us want to see at the end of these slums, and who's better than dirty Harry?
