One of the first OVA I bought ("Actual Video Animation"), this should be one of my favorite animated titles. A cyberpunk science fiction action comedy is a setback to a dystopia society in the face of the near future contamination (for a comedy). Dominion's "heroes" tank police say, "If we can not cross crime, we get big guns" philosophy, as the name suggests, are petroling tanks in tanks instead of petrol cars and trying to catch more dangerous than any criminals. <br /> <br /> Both are their opponents, the terrorist buck and his follower, equally colorful and entertaining. (wo) men, Twin Cat Sisters, whose existence seems to have always been difficult for the Tank Police. <br /> <br /> Animation is not the state of art, but it is very good; Damnion's humorous climate and the palette and colorful look of the matcha fit. <br /> <br /> The English dubbing is fun again. The English version soundtrack is also very good. <br /> <br /> The Dominion Tank Police is great. The Japanese Cyberpunk SF humor is full of characters and situations with us, which is not always bad. Highly recommended.
