I was surprised at how at the same time both a cinematic cheesy and fantastic. The frisbee flying saucer is unpredictable, especially the landing, especially the special effects, a half-century film that Cravel's attacking film has been amazing! Living in the Middle East I saw the darkness of Islam. JAA Adams suggested that Adams should be more rigid, and was surprised by the imagination used as a engineer, future gadgets, and gizmos. All in all, an entertaining hour and a half, the opportunity to see Walter Pidgeon and Leslie Neilsen for my first time 'young' man
