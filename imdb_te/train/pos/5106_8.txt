Every time I see one of these old movies from the 80's, I keep me back in time, how they look today. This image is good. I remember it as a young child and it's a great movie forever. It has all the heroic characters that want to be a young cowboy. As an adult now, I look back and laugh and still feel sad, but this time I really know what to do. I found a thing weird. How many people go to Houston and want to get married, marry, go to the trailer, cheat, cheat, re-establish, within a month? Only in America.
