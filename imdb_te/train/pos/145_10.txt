The continuity of the "kingdom" is bloody and more distorted. I saw half (I was gone and could not sit all 5 1/2 hours) but I liked what I saw. Ghosts, blood, murder, poisoning, mutated children, voodoo ... all of this is! You're like a stomach and weird movies. <br /> Also, you do not need to look at Part 1 to understand this ... You can find it! <Br /> <br /> Do you know if Kingdom 1 and 2 are available on DVD? Tired of sitting through these marathon movies in a theater. Sadly, there is probably no "Kingdom 3" - a year after Ernst-Hugo Jorgegard (Sig) was shot. But you never know!
