Warner Bros Depression-era music has become very popular over the next two years. Yes, we're in financial weakness (or you're living under a rock) and sometimes faint. But there are always movies as a way to escape from our problems. In the 30s, the film is also popular in the financial gloom. "Footwear Parade (1933)" Audience has flown in such a film. Like the musical "Social Diggers of 1933 (1933)" directed by Lloyd Bacon, it still does not capture social aspects, which still demonstrates excellent talent. We had to wait until the end of the three pictures of the busted Berkley Extravagangza numbers, but the boy was waiting for me. Yes, the little Ruby Keeler is a terrible singer and actress, and she is too early to press, but Busby's magic whisks her "by a waterfall", and a hundred other chorus girls, what appears to be a dizzying water fairy. In fact, Busbay's numbers are not really in a phase (always define a gravitational limit), and they scare realistic, sensitive, non-cognitive music scenes. And James Cognini has all of her little music in "Footlight" (really, what can this man do?). He also gets to pick up from the famous guy, Don sailor cloth and to dress up the sexpot Shanghai Lill (who's really cool ruby ​​in the Chinese-girl wig!) He's co-stars with Joan Blondel, his adorable and cute secretary who is Cagney's favor with some other women Until the final reel, ie). Apparently Blondell is the only other woman who cared not only Cognny from her wife. And you can see each other in the scene.
