This is one of the most deadly films I'm watching recently. This is because it's more like a movie and more like an experimental film. The Kushawa's experiment displays their typical harsh presence to take on different types of people living at their worst dump. Every episode is discouraging and not tough, but overall it's definitely a tone. We see, ... we are raped, raped, assassinated, swallowing, drinking, dishonesty, stinking a fish after a small child's death, scary person), Schizophrenia, a psychologically dirty young man who thinks he is a street car conductor Helpless dreamer, and his movements on his street car garbage piles "Driving" in the middle routes, Bergman is very disappointing to appear almost in the film of the Englishman Ingmar Bergman in Japan, as in most films, in fact, it is very discouraging. Mental illness and life desperation. After the film, Kuralasa tried to kill herself? So, did i like it? Not this is not a pleasant experience. But, this is a very good picture of my attention and as a result, I really wanted to see what happened to these people. It's sort of like seeing a train wreck - you watch all the carnage but you can not help but see! Of all the sounds, I look for everybody and is really meant to represent the old man (he is well adjusted and is living in a garbage dump) presumably intended to represent himself. May be. <br /> <br /> If you have seen all the movies of Kurasawa and have more tolerance to the fantasy films, give this watch now. However, this does not let you see your first movies in movies - it is perfect to frighten most audiences!
