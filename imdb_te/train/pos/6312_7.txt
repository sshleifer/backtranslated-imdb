They co-starred in the film "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" directed by George Kloony, directed by Sam Rockwell. George Clooney co-starred with Steven Soderbergh as the producer in the film, which shows that they really believe in the project. In the potential it also seems like a fine and entertaining project in the same line as film remakes like "Eleven's Eleven" and "The Italian Job" but something is not only successful in this film, or at least it's not <br /> <br /> Some of the characters have played some well-known actors, but the characters do not give enough room to really develop. They were able to become pleasant and enjoyable characters in their capabilities, but now they have roles that contain characters, because most of them have very active scenes in the film. <br /> The fact that they are being played, even if they are blocking all of their roles as a whole boring or unwanted, or something like that. Because the characters are not used for their absolute ability. The original Italian film "I Solitio Agotto" works better than this film. <br /> <br /> It is very fun to see that the film can be quite simple. It is a risky little caper picture, which you should not worry too much about the story. <br /> <br /> "Welcome to Colloywood" is a film that still works and works well for its purpose. <br /> This is a movie that you do not worry about when you're done. <br /> You can make it really easy without the image you have not really seen. <br /> <br />
