The film started with Nick Cage Kick. It is a story full of turns and turns - the picture of motives and movements. Of course, Dennis Hopper is a ham, but J.T. Walsh and Laura Flynn Boyle are the perfect couple to catch the unsuspecting guy who fell on their web. Everything about this film is good - cinematography, story pace and all conclusions. Cage excels at what he does best- it's not an action hero but one person who's caught in the snares of life.
