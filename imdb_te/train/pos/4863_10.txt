<br /> <br /> As a big fan of Vodhouse and Fred Astier, I finally enjoyed watching this movie. Not quite a blend of Wodehouse and Hollywood, but close enough. American Wadeville's humor is not a slapstick witch, and Wodehouse fights the British concept of comedy. <br /> <br /> Overall, American-style banter American characters make it a reality for carboards to satire. <br /> <br /> Some of the prominent performances of dance numbers, including the spectacular fairground with revolving floors and fun mirrors, are due to the lack of top dance numbers Basby Berkeley. <br /> <br /> The absence of Ginger Rogers or Eric Blor does not harm the film, instead they do not allow dynamics of different characters. Emerge. It is also good not to have a clever cracking, to love the interest of the head. Instead we have an interest in the love of a sensitive Head Strong, keeping most Wodhouses' young elite women.
