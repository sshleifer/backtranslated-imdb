I came to this thing together with people who had to give it all the first. 9/11 Such a sensitive issue is hard to make a controversial film about it. Although it is surprising, the film is prohibited in the US is an insult. <br /> <br /> I think this film is excellent with two weaker moves. The film begins in the Iranian section, somewhat reminiscent of the majestic majid's work ("the beautiful" paradise of the children "and" the color of heaven "), the same as the two pictures of what happened to the Afghan refugees' class innocent eyes in Iran. The same goes for Scene Pen's clip which is amazing.While some of the clips beutiful others are completely crew Although Alejandro Gonzalez's Inner Mexican clip and his gut-wandering "Amorus Peros", he makes it a cruel one.The clip has many blacks playing a black background that sounds like a reporter and a second plane crashing their shock, home from the burning towers And the remaining messages to their families, angry ... and He jumped from the towers. <br /> <br /> Some clips are harder to look for Americans, some clips are "suffering". <br /> <br /> Egypt and British cliffs Not to say, tell me how much suffering is going on and beyond the table. <br /> I'm Bosnia-Herzegovina, France, India and Japan (although this is not a terrible place, it's not true). <br /> However, not all clips are great and I am very weak in my opinion, from Israel in the clip. Though the idea is good (there is a journalist in a terrorist attack in Tel Aviv, it is terrible to survive in the war in many countries in the war to survive his story in New York). Clip some entertainment reporter is a witness and he's just a guy and he's just a TV speaking and hoping he's just going to "shout" TV, and just shouting soldiers and paramedics. <br /> <br /> You have the opportunity to watch it If you do not, it's good that you're ruined, but if you do not, many of us live outside 9/11.
