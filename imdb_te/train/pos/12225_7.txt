I've seen this movie and even though I kind of know who I'm still watching it since the start of the killer. I would recommend others. Lifetime movie network comes with a lot of I'm thinking since Halloween is closer they may be playing it more. So please look for it if it is interested in looking at it. I believe that Alicia Silverstone has played well. I really liked her as an actress and a guy. She is very cool and down to earth. Kevin Dillon has a lot for me to show him. I'm not trying to knock him or anything but I believe his brother Matt was able to pull this bad bad serial killer person better. Kevin is very sweet to me. But I think he did.
