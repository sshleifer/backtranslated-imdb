"Panic" is a criminal comedy-drama with William H. Mackay, Donald Sutherland and Nev Campbell. Alex (masie) is a man who kills people living. But the moment he's facing a disappointment and that's why he's seeing a doctor. Where Sarah meets (Neve Campbell) and he falls in love with her. He faces another problem: he wants to leave the family business (murders), but he is not saying this to his father now. <br /> <br /> He has a story of a person at one time with Midlife-Crisis and regular difficulties: falling in love with a beautiful girl and everything that goes with it. <br /> <br /> Good acting performances by cast. Mackie is as amazing as Alex depressed. I have high expectations for this and it is a good movie but he does not deliver completely. <br /> <br /> This story is rather flat and clich√©. <br /> <br />
