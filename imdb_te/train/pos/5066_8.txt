Some people think this film is boring but I disagree. It's a very complex and extraordinary person's biography. I liked the characters in the film and I thought I had captured his humanity with a secret that left Archie's life. I do not think any purpose of a better biography is to describe someone's life but to have the complexities and relationships that make them interesting. What's more pleasing than someone to successfully renew themselves? "Men are dreaming of you - you dream so well." Lord Attenborough's good job. Nathaniel Arcand is truly an attractive actor for me and I hope to see him in more movies.
