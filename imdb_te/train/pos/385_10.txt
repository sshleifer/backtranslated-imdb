A film that tears you with tears of tears and pleasure is considered to be a very simple step in a simple filmmaker's career. In fact, Steven Spielberg, perhaps our great story-teller, has been doing it in many film formats over the years. COLOR PURPLE, at the time, was considered offensive, especially after action classic like JAWS and RAO's of Lost ARK. This is not surprising in the film, because Spielberg gives us the eT. Critics, Purple purported his entry into intellectual fees. It's a lot of entrance. Special effects, a snashbuckling, is a fantastic storytelling story based on a literary tradition by Alice Walker. It is surprising how Spielberg can perform such a moving motion about African-Americans in the deep south. Slavery has gone, but is shot here in the south, blacks are used by other blacks as slaves. <br /> <br /> Spielberg always attempts to add a child's element to sitemapping his pictures or to make the audience happy. This is not the first to say that you can not make these observations in this career. This is the first in a series of films that people can not see or see because there are no foreigners. Sun, always, list of shinels, etc. His superb talent is evident in this particular film because A) is a non-trained, first-acting actress, b) He is very hard to turn on the screen, and c) has a clean drama when the characters grow up and remove the strings when it does not change for about 30 years. It is almost like epic and is in range and it has not received a single Academy Award from 11 nominations. It is a disgrace and an insult. <br /> <br /> Hoop Goldberg's tortured sister, the innocent child, Danny Glover, is an unattractive woman given by her innocent father, she is known as "Mr.". The film goes on with her "Mr." occasionally hitting ways and psychological violence. The PG-13 rated film is great for sexual elements that have grown by the Walker novel. This is not a "burning bed" in Georgia. There is no blatant vengeance as expected. It's done fairly well. Goldberg is the perfect man, the love and the one who deserves to be eligible. Goldberg and her sister, Neneti (played by Acauia Bucia) come at the moment with the most sharp and heart-moving moment in different films. <br /> If you do not move in this order you should check for pulse. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Poor people. There really is something to live, but love more than anything. Take note of the Spielberg's bassers: Guy can make an unforgettable classic without any beautiful aliens. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10
