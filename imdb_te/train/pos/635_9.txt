I had a small screening of this movie on July 19th, and I learned more than some of the actors' names and this is a sort of fantasy / adventure quest. </ P> Nothing really like what I have seen, and now a particular story is absolutely appreciated by all and comes soon to theaters. Although the first impressions can be given, it is not cheesy, gossip, inadequate or ridiculous, and is actually more entertaining and funny. The flow is well done, nothing can be moved or pulled out. The soundtrack adds more to the film, as opposed to the silence of the magic and motion in the film or in the movies. And even though I know what's coming at the points, I can not bear to stop watching the screen yet; <br /> <br /> I do not know that there is almost marketing for my films, and this is not very clever, why you can find it.
