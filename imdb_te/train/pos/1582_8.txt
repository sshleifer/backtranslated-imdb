The vast picture of the Holocaust is another small part of the puzzle about the Rosenstresse protests in Berlin, which I did not know when it began in late February 1943. The details are added as follows. <br /> <br /> In another contemporary story that begins in New York City, the story of the film is in this story. The well-contaminated Jewish woman here was insulted by her husband's death, emphasizing her children and others with a very ritual mourning practice. <br /> <br /> An awkward daughter, Hannah (Maria Schröder), and the second-old relative finds out from an old cousin in Berlin. , Her mother, was then 8 years old, taken and protected by an Aryan woman. Hannah drops everything, goes to Berlin, and this woman, Lena Fischer, now 90, finds. Hannah persuades the woman to easily tell her story. <br /> <br /> The film then focuses on events that took place in 1943, long lasting, in which the fictional central character is 33rd, Ms. Fischer. One of the men detained on the Rose Straussie site is a Baroness and accomplished pianist married Kuttja Rieman, who married a Jewish concert violin, Fabian (Martin Fefel). <br /> <br /> This article will briefly end in New York City from time to time. While the present scenes are saturated, the 1943 scenes are strongly placed on the blue gray tones. The quality of acting is generally good, we are a talented resident in Germany and a former female actress, directed by Margarez von Trotta, a leading female filmmaker of the New Journal Film. <br /> <br /> The story of the protests is simply said. <br /> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> "Rogensstrass" did not play well in many film critics' opinions. The maximum length, layer, sponsor of the gender model, is fraudulent with music: so go to normal rapes. It's too long. But I find a protest, powerful, sudden and totally convincing voice from women who have taken care of their Jewish friends and others outside Rosesstraße in the film. <br /> <br /> Intense violence (no one is burned or physically brutal) has intensified my tension, which has increased as the film progresses. Wait for a few minutes to start any minute. The film's sensitivity remained with me. I watched that night often, watching the movie, my mind was filled with silent, melancholy, confused images and feelings. For me, rarely happens. (In German and English). My rating: 8/10 (B +).

The Jews had Germany's relatives, many of whom were closely connected with the fact that Adolf Eichmann had abandoned them from other prisoners and sent family members to the labor camps rather than the more turbulent areas in Poland. Generally, arrested persons are in detention for two days in trains that were transferred to the east. Before the expulsion of the prisoners in this case, wives and other relatives first appeared in the addresses of Rosenstraße, first and foremost in them and after that and when there was an ever increasing number. Probably six thousand people participated in the protest, not all at the same time. Women demanded their husbands, after a day and a week. <br /> <br /> Gowthale in Berlin (Governor or district leader), Joseph Goebbels, was eagerly anxious to have that city. Holy, has enthusiasm for the people of the country. He was concerned about the possible consequences of women's actions on both issues. Goebbels Rogensstress released prisoners with Hitler's consent for fearing the invasion of women in the streets by inviting more public disagreement and preventing the secrecy of the "final solution", and twenty-five of them were sent to Auschwitz! <br /> <br /> For both Hitler and Goebbels, the decision was postponed inevitable. But they were mistaken. Almost all battles released from Rosentras have also been exposed. Women have achieved tremendous success on the destructive forces.
