I first saw this film in my drama & theater in Tulane. I was shocked at how beautiful and raw this documentary was. It is an honest look into the incomprehensible reality of the life of solitude. The family was lovely and I really thought she showed little ADE at the core. ** My professor also said on one hand note, during the filming, the little Eddie camera was fascinated by one of the men. ** Beauty, I have found, comes from the naturalness of the family's dysfunction. It is clear in relation between the dysfunctional mother and daughter in society and you seek to rehabilitate Little Edi in society. In all, the image is grab its aesthetic quality and it is filming the surprising beauty. Two thumbs way up!
