Larry Fessenden dismissed many comments in this forum. Well, the worst mistake, obviously, is the way film marketing and DVD might be targeted. Obviously, this is not a real horror film, at least, is not for a ghost and anticipating anything that is readily satisfying. <br /> <br /> "Wendigo" is a film that is basically told from the mind of young Miles. The kids do not immediately understand things that remain in their young minds and eventually dominate their fears and the terrible world they can not understand. Kim, mother, a psychologist, but she does not know what is going on in her son's mind. It's also the alienation story. <br /> <br /> Father, George, a distant person who seems to live in a different world, maybe a work. <br /> <br /> Miles fears are getting trapped throughout the country. That part of New York State, with its winter landscapes, plays destruction on barren trees and small children's imagination. It does not help he meets a strange guy in town, it creates more doubts in his young mind. In the end, Miles stirring up the world and stimulates Vendo's inspiration. <br /> <br /> The film looks and plays well. Patricia Clarkson is amazing, no matter where she is in the cinema. Jake Webber is perfect as a distant father who has the opportunity to come close to an unintelligent son. Eric Per Sullivan, as Miles, reveals his inner crisis. I thought he was very effective because Miles owns the whole movie around him. Finally, John Sprudecos is considered a terrible Otis, who repeats the world for the unveiling of the world. <br /> <br /> Instead of retaining this movie, the future audience must reach it with an open mind.
