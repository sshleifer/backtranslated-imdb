A sweet and utterly fascinating film, Shall One Than? I laugh and cry. In the first appearance, Sugia-San was not a terrible attraction - a high-profile employee, dedicated to his family, but was pretty easily faced with a face in a window. The object of his siege is distant and cool. But by the end of the film I am in love with him, his wife and daughter, dance teachers and dance students. Transform and renewal This simple story is a little ornaments that I will enjoy seeing again.
