When I was about 10 years old, I saw this movie. Unfortunately I could not see it at last because it was broadcast at the end of the night. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br <br /> This is not really a horror film. It has some horror stuff but I would rather classify it as fantasy. I liked it but I hoped for a bit more horrendous and scary scenes. <br /> <br /> <br /> When the Anna father comes into the paper house trying to kill him, the scene has some time. <br /> The plot is now. This film is about a young man named Anna. As she needs to sleep in her bed when she is ill, she will change her drawing to her house. As she sleeps, it often happens strange, she is close to home on a big green field. She learns that the house is properly drawn and every new detail will be found in her dreams. One day she brought her home to bring home a boy home. When she forgot to move her legs (he was sitting behind a window) the boy could not walk. Later she was told by the doctor that a boy had a strange illness and she realized that she got her with the boy, and she also got her into the disturbing dreams. She also observes that she is hard and difficult to wake up from her dreams. When her father misses her father abroad, she takes her father home. She was wrong and looked at her father's painting very angry. She tries to rub her but she learns that she has not done anything that has already been drawn. And then she begins to fall asleep frightens. Her father is mad and the egg (as she marks her '* invalid' on her head) and enters the paper and tries to kill Anna and his friend. Her dreams become a horror nightmare. They managed to escape and kill her father and Anna finally wake up. Anna finds his soul in the hospital where his parents are sitting next to his bed. The doctors thought she had fallen into a coma. They tell Anna that the other boy was dead and that they should go into the sea to overcome those tragic moments. Anna had a watchdog and notices that could be seen near the hotel where the watchman was traveling. She goes to the Watchtower and meets the boy (I can not remember and does not intend to go back to the previous html page) and thinks he can be a good relief and permanently forget that terrible dreams. br> <br /> <br /> I do not understand this in the picture. At first this was the end I totally disliked. I'm too long, but the main part of the movie is a bit shorter. How does the boy talk to Anna to die helicopter and die? Why do you put such stupid radio on the wall? I'm scared of that scene. It almost destroyed the main horror scene. <br /> <br /> What I like about my father is the first scene and horror scene with the photograph of Anna's father. I liked the boy. The actor is awesome. He is better than Anna. <br /> <br /> When I was sleeping, I also liked how Anna would spend her father's painting and how she would look in the trash. <br /> <br /> The whole film is good. I give 10 to 8.
