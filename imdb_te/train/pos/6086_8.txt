I saw this movie about a year ago, and it was completely laug-out-loud funny. The real winner, in my mind. It's a stupid comedy's underlining, but it's actually a real plot. Actually the hit comedy, Elf, actually. It has some serious moments, boiled between happiness. Stiller Black's horse is a commonly forgotten moment, when you laugh at him with his foul stupor. <br /> If your friendship is not over, I'm sure most people want to know about a friend. People did not like this film, I was totally shocked. The absolutely horrific movies like Napoleon Dynamite have more ratings than I'm surprised about in people's knowledge of the IMDb. Take my advice and rent. If you are laughing at least once, you have to pay a rental fee. = D
