Around a century ago in Brooklyn, competition between Chuck Connors and Steve Brody and their competitor volunteer fire brigades will jump to the Brooklyn Bridge, leading to Brody's leading race. <br /> <br /> It is a well-known story for many by Bugs Bunny Spoof, "Bowie Bugs" since 1949. <br /> <br /> This is a very entertaining film, a sensational and unsatisfactory scene with some Chinese villagers - a cartoon of Anthivian ethnic attitudes, which gave me great historical interest in my eyes.
