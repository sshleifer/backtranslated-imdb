This is one of the comedy shows I have ever seen. It's really refreshing to see and I have strips several times. I guess this is a social awareness factor which makes it very interesting. If these are white girls they will get the same response? Maybe they are, maybe they are not? The characters have no limits (check my lyrics) and do not exclude anyone from their twisted sense! There are so many funny sketches. My favorites are Bob Builder. It's crazy, it's intellectual. If you want twisted black comedy it is for you. If you like putting shows it isn't.3 but the blonde's yet another hilarious British BBC comedy shown on TV! It's a funny show and unleashed characters for unsuspecting people are laugh at loud funny! It would be impossible to keep a straight face looking silly characters and people's reactions! This series is easily producing amazing comics!
