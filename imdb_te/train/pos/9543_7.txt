Japanese cyber-punk films have never really made me a lot of money, but some of the things I have seen are very interesting and at least entertaining. <br /> <br /> The plot takes over human hosts and regulates their bodies, transforms them into "necroborgs" and causes them to fight with each other. The only motive for eating each other - is clearly a "game" for parasites. The film primarily revolves around a coward and wind, but the romance is reduced by both mutually exclusive, and forced to fight with each other. <br /> <br /> MEETBALL MACHINE TETSUO (Because there are so many cyber-punk movies), and good reason. Although the films are quite different, there are definitely some background parallels. In the MEATBALL MACHINE there are absolutely high point for fun, stater moments and organ / borg fx - a combination of the TETSUO-meets-GWAR mix. Depending on your taste of these types of movies, MEATBALL MACHINE may or may not be your subject. If you enjoy a healthy dose to enjoy hyper-giant cyber-punk films - this is for you ... 7/10
