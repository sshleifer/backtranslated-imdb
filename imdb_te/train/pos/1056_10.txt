Nobody can say that this is bad. I loved this show before seeing it too. For 3 reasons, 1. The story made me curious, 2. Jessica Alba and 3. James Cameron! Please ignore bad comments and if you see the first season, if you look at the first season, you love it and go out and buy Season 1 on the DVD Season 2, <br /> <br /> I hate Fox and I have a lot of "Dark" Angel "fans also hate me. They are one thing for good performances of cunning! Do you all agree
