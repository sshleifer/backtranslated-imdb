I saw this film a few days back when the channels collapsed. My expectations are not very high but it is an interesting movie. In 'A Guy Thing', Jason Lee plays a fellow role of Seattle who is married to his future husband Karen (Selma Blair) as a patron, an unrivaled life of middle class. When we first meet Paul at his bachelor party, he wants not to participate in the typical Bidkeler party-type activities, and his (surprisingly few) buddies encourage him if he is just a bit humble and struggling with his troubles. In fact, Paul knew, the next night the next morning, he was in bed with a naked hula dancer, and his mother-in-law's phones were on the way to Karen. Kean's cousin Becky (Julia Styles) oh and Hula dancer. <br /> <br /> As he grew up with the difficult problems from this little acorn, he finished when he was seen as a good, family-oriented good man who jumped out of frank misfortune and was a stranger about his inept marriages. There are no attempts to convince Karen that he has no efforts to undermine him. He forces the citizen to stay close to the close and pleasant beloved Beck. The film is the right mix of comedy and romance. Definitely worth a watch.
