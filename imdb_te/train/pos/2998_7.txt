Seeing the movie in TCM, the young man William Powell (Philo Vance) enjoyed the role of Detective as he did with Mira Lai on "Thin Man Series". In the 1930s, William Powell starred in the Philo Vance series, and the famous celebrity actress Marie Astor, (Hilda Lake), was one of the suspects in a murder / suicide case) and died in the bolted room of Archer. Ralph Morgan (Raymond Verde / Archer's secretary) played a great assistant role and appeared in Frank Morgan's brother, "In the Wizard of Oz" in 1939. Eugene Palette, (Detective Sargent Heth), in the film, played a great performance in "Robin Hood" with Vance Movies and Errol Flynn. Remember always, the least likely actor could be a killer. Enjoy the great classic from the past.
