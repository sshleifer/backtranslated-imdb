I was great with dts, which is this DVD on DVD in London in November 2006 (I'm not really into the cream so far!) Through a high-end arccom system from this DVD. And I'll tell you this is by far the most exciting music DVD I have ever watched. The work of cream at their age is simply blowing and sound quality is the best I have heard on a music DVD. You definitely increase the music you like.It is a pure illumination of their performance, which makes it look again and again. New musicians do not cut off these days when doing these old rockers.
