<br /> <br /> The Saturday evening has become a general view. <br /> <br /> Sabrina is a young girl who moves with witches and her aunt who is one of them. So Sabrina needs to know how to control the high energy and how to effectively use them. Her school should be treated with a nasty opponent called Libby, her best friend and boyfriend Harvey Kinkel ... <br /> The show is funny and entertaining. It was entertained by a 10-year-old boy on Saturday evenings ... and laughing at him ...
