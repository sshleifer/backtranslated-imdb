I saw the 3000 cleaner for the first time, the film did not have any expectations. However, I do not think it's so bad. The Italian version of Roadrar is the kind of Italian version of Italy, including a silver or vanilla in Italy. The story behind Elisa Bringanti and Dardoano Sachetti are also responsible for the story of zombie meat eaters. You can also see other links in Italian horror movies: Luca Vananti plays the role of Tommy, and you can see that kid in Paran Nellala citta dei morti viventi (the living dead AKA Gates city of the hell) The character of the brother of John Robbins and Kennyball Apocalypse. Very entertaining film, some dull episodes.
