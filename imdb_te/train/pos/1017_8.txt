I started watching the show from the first season, and in the beginning I was pretty skeptical about it. The original film has a kid and I'm looking for some sci-fi show when BSG is looking forward to a new season. <br /> <br /> But after some episodes I became a fan. I'm not too stupid-you think - Jack O'Neill, Not-Only-Smart Samantha Carter, Glorious Teal, Women and Favorite Favorite, and Clever Dr. Daniel Jackson. <br /> In fact, sometimes the stories are sometimes not very serious, sometimes not about technology or space struggles. It's about "we're not leaving anyone behind". When all hope is lost, fight to the end. <br /> Now it breaks the record, will continue in the 10th season and is doing better.
