It's good for the movie, because it is made by people who take care not to make art and just watch movies. It is filled with super-surfer Greg Nol's home movies and the boatload of amateur video from others to combine themselves with his 50-year old hobby. However, it has expanded to a degree of aesthetics. It is filled with artistic talent, and you may think that athletic talent is alert, while surfing athletic. Surfers are not astronauts or test-pilots. Or they are surgeons (perhaps) or Phd's (again, maybe) surgeons. It believes in surfer's quest. It is believed that the beauty of human privacy. It is a great peace gift from the retirement of war. Surfers celebrate war on the northern coast of a Hawaiian island that has been attacked by Japanese zeros fifteen years ago. It celebrates little time with a country that faced a cold war with the Russian socialists - hot war. Surfing ultimate nursism. It's dangerous, but only historically. I suspect Alexander the Great can not celebrate his surfing technique. He had to do a few dozen countries to get the favorable press he received. There are no military leaders in this film. It does not have guns. Only beer-head surfers have a beer stand and a surf shop shop. This is not a problem. Peace does not disappoint. It's the pleasure of breathing.
