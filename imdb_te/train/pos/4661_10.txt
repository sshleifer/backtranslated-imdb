I can only praise other reviews here. It is a delicate movie with a delicate feeling that makes it difficult to cross the line with the simplest feeling. Naturally sweet - not added sugar. <br /> <br /> One small thing: The genius / savant at this kind of pendelton is not clear that the slightest objections about the tendency to walk the Pendleton and lose the system safety. Yes, the film was pretty computer illiterate, but I believe that Pendelton 'studied computers' at his flat and his prizes allowed him to take all his entire rewards practically nightly. <br /> In some scenes, Gannapole is trying to test Pendelton's knowledge and has some basic moments called his Bluff. <br /> <br /> Previously, Pentelton had chosen him and had enough information to make dummy accounts. Perhaps Wallach and Ustinov need to know a lot of their sense of how to work on those days in computers, relying on their own instead of frost feeling, and understanding what details they are getting. Important are important about 'policies'; They felt that the 'smart lite' could actually control its security rather than its state; They did not think they could affect what they could do with the properties of the user terminal (dumb) - and I could not see it with things like graphics. <br /> <br /> Most of the time I have tried to escape as much as possible of actual computer activities, and they did well. Allowing them a bit of artistic license, I do not think they have any errors in their efforts note worthy. <br /> The CD
