The folk that made this magnificent film have done the best of a novel, making it the best fiction writer ever based on human guilty and human responsibility. <br /> <br /> Nodle plays the role of Harder W. Campbell, Jr., and it is contrary to the depiction of Vonneneth's person who lost the ALL (and) for his love. <br /> <br /> Failures in this are good adaptation.
