I grew up in this film and remember that my brother and I play in the backyard and pretend that we're in the Care-a-La. Now, after so many years, I look at the movie with my daughter and enjoy her. If you're a parent and do not see this movie with your kids, then you can hold them in your hands and thrill them by taking care of the bears and caution! Songs, especially "Forever Young" are very sweet and memorable. Parents, I highly recommend this film to all the kids so I learn how to be happy care to others! When it comes down to all the trash on TV, you can increase your children to have the right idea about life with these kids.
