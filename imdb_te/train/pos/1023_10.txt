This show has been avoided in reality for the last ten years. I will sin. <br /> <br /> The final episode of SG1 (at anytime on television) was pretty good when the Atlantis hole filled a small bit. Robert wrote something that felt close to reality. Although trying to explain how it is in a set of appearance. (Up and downs are committed to everyone who worked for such a long time but in years they became a family). <br /> <br /> SG1 is unique and time and time, it takes me in the ways of infidelity and surprise. Wonderful characters, stories, directors, writers. I'm hooked from the episode. <br /> The combination of action, science, drama and especially comedy worked well. <br /> <br /> The show does not have any real words to express what I mean. I am only thankful for the presentation of the show for a long time and entertaining. <br /> I look forward to movies next year and I really hope that most of them will be. <br /> Stargate SG1 - 1997 - 2007?
