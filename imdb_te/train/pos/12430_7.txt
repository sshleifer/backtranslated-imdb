In general, because of the fact that they are usually all pretty because I do not see action movies. The film has a very stereotypical action film scenes, but the characters and the originality of the film's initials make it much easier. David Ducovani improved his simple acting approach, which was great to watch. Angelina Jolie, of course, has done beautiful and great acting. All together is a great cast. People who are bored with the same old action movie must see.
