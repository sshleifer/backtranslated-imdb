The ancient armor is a true poet, the original poetic work. The context / setting with the old navigator is good, clear and non-acting. The artwork of the poem is perfectly suited to the timing / time of work, arrangement and work, and the MTV era producers and much more present in the present work using spectacular still-movement strategies, including the audience still and moves. (MTV took videos from the background, with stable movements, often absurd movements, from background to theme or storytelling.) Redgrave's reading, voice and power all its fear, strife and pain. In addition, the smooth movement of the video emphasizes the novel's sad and horror story of the rare and occasional monot of the author's composition (in this case the positive mood of the story). This is a classic poetry, ocean, long story, almost the rings of the rings, and a love for a story that has a permanent impact on our world and culture. Did not understand the meaning of an "albatross"? Or the concept of "water, water everywhere and not a drop of drinks?" Really good experience. Thank you, Mr. Dasilva thank you for bringing us life.
