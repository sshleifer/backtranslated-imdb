Well, some people say this particular film stinks ... But hey! Not right, not right ... This film may not have the best special effects and may not have the best actors (unless the exception of the Barbarian Bros) Disease Theci is a little fact, one of the funniest films I've ever seen, and I've seen Em AL!
