I totally disagree.i thought that this is a great movie for kids.dawn wells from the gilligans island, and just after the familiar Dana plato.it promised disneylike and for that it rarely fluff.no can disregard it 'is scary and does not intend to destroy everything But it 's complete. This is great for children characters and in the end I do not know what to expect. The plot also has a lot of these kids than you say to the fact that these children are experts fishermen initially.it can also help them with a jam on the end.it side is no longer plasse. It's over 95 minutes
