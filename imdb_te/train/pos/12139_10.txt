This film, though still over 70 years, is still a very moving, strong image. Betty Davis, like slutty, nasty cockney waitress Mildred is absolutely believable. Seeing her acting and spellbinding. She completely hates the viewer and at the same time forgives her. Leslie Howard's performance is not as strong as Felicar Carrie, but I do not see how anyone can manage their own against actress Mrs. Davis's performance. She flashes the scene in every scene, stolen the show completely. The film closed her base and she deserved to win the Academy Award, but lost. It was shocked by the day with marriage, multiple sex partners, and Mildred's vulgar language themes, so it's been a while, but still amazing. Mildred Phillip is really some of the great performances I've seen in the movie yet to see what the thinking is about her ("You Cade, Dirty Pinch ....").
