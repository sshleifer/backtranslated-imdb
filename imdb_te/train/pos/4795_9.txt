Listen to me whenever I read about my movie about sex, violence, bad language, special effects, and so on. Detector goes off. Generally, such a film sentimental Hogwash is panderers who are not surprised by them, but they have a great deal of fairy tale for us. When David Lynch's The Strait Story received these reviews, I was worried because I was not a fan of his other "fantastic" story, Elephant MAN. <br /> <br /> All the amazing pictures and the good acting in the film seemed more interesting to us than to motivate us. <br /> I'm not worried. The exact story is a fairly straightforward picture. Lynch and writers such as John Roach and Mary Sweeney have the fact that most of them are straight and simple. I was able to do without a couple of couples, and the shots of the grain are slightly more repetitive, but they are only quibbles. We do not have any heartfelt message, we have no sentiments to oppose our emotions, and we do not give any satisfaction to ourselves and its roles. Instead, they rely on the story to build its own power, and in the end, we're actually moving through the final scenario. <br /> In fact, Richard Forthsworth adds realism as part of the cast. He seems to have lived through so much, but he still suffers, is still someone who still lives, and he has long been angry with his brother, long time to be angry, unless the desire to get back together does not seem overly sentiments. And he knows he's out of his time, so he wants to have some peace, with his brother, but with his life. Sissy Spacek also makes fine, unmannered work like Straits' daughter. And although I am a city and a suburban boy, the Iowa and Wisconsin landscape is beautifully painted and I want to visit at least a few days.
