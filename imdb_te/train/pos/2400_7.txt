I see what my ancestors saw in the youthful Betty Davis. She is amazing throughout this almost-mad political comedy, which put Warren Williams on her death as a constant political activist. Vivienne Osborne was brilliant as her ex, and I found rooting for her throughout. Williams' character does not sympathize with everyone, he is not even a good idea. <br /> <br /> Guy Keeby is the best of what he's doing. Since the candidate is nominated as a governor to prevent a rival candidate from dragging and dropping from his sleep at a political meeting, the entire mess is borne to an internal political battle in a party called "Progressive Party". If you are in the political mindset, you can probably see a party other than that reflected in the affiliate of Williams and Kibby's fictional "Progressive Party." <br /> <br /> This is a good movie for those who love old comedy. If you ever see anything in the Old Wheeler and Woolsey titles (Sunshine, The Rinskars), you see Frank McHugh as Williams's right hand and see the behavior of Bert Wheeler. <br /> Yes, my wife and I both recommend it.
