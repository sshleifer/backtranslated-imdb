Since I have seen it for the first time, "Pedras" is a personal favorite and one of the few films I could see again. The great screenplay shows some women's lives (connected to one another) with deep awareness and sensibility. రామోన్ సలాజార్ దర్శకత్వం వహించిన తొలి చిత్రంలో నిర్మాణాత్మక చలన చిత్రాన్ని సాధించాడు మరియు తనను తాను సమర్థవంతమైన నటుల డైరెక్టర్గా నిరూపించాడు. <br /> <br /> All performances are not spectacular. All popular among women, they mean (najva nimri) to very good (Vicky pina) have to, but stand serveraku memosini directed by newcomer Monica, he convinces Antonia San Juan's retarded daughter. Enrique /> <br /> The girl's male nurse alsids <br irresistitga as pleasurable, and Andres gertrudiks, fun albaledejo and director Ramon salajarla turns out there are a little better. <br /> <br /> "Piadras" is beautifully written and filmed, and I can not keep thinking for days. I highly recommend it.
