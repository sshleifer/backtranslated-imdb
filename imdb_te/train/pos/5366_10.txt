I'm sitting here in November 2006 and I can not make the film yet. Arnold's best films came in 4-5 years. Running Man, Predator, and Total Recall (1990). All 3 are amazing. Arnold's cheesy one liners make you laugh in more than one occasion in this movie. It is good to act in a case like Predator and Total Recall. They did a great job of trying to make the future of scenes happening in 2017, but you are not a sniper and a sniper at 80 style cuts in men and women in general and regular television monitors outside the Mann studio we know here in 2006, with the emergence of the flat panel and HDTV. 2017 "The Running Man" game show intra's computer graphics will not appear in 2017. The storyline is absolutely fantastic. Once I did not like to get up in the film and I do not care about what's going on with the film today. I really think that Arnold's performance is much better than the credit he gave. Now I have not chosen him as governor but California is for you. Buzzsaw, Dynamo, Fireball, SubZero as well as spectacular "stalkers" and I find the producers do not try to overkill the fight scenes. When Stalker died ... he was dead. It does not last for 20 minutes. Incognito scenes are quick and fun, but they try and do not play too much. I gave 10/10 to this film and these films are coming from those who are not very happy these days. If you get the right actors and the correct story, the future graphical displays you see in 2006 are neither important nor necessary.
