The EUROPA (Zentropa) is a masterpiece that gives birth to a genius of the heroine nearly a century ago. This film is truly unique, and the genius of the genre. The camerawork and edits are very good and there is a strange and unforgettable film experience combined with the combination of stories of alienation used in the film. <br /> The guilty pleasures enjoyed by both Barbara Sukhovva and Eddie Constantine cast in the cast. <br /> <br /> Max Van Sido gave his great voice as his commentator. <br /> One of the kind of cinema! Four stars (highest rating).
