Eighty episode for this fine series. This is best of television. The story takes place in 1968, and it is portrayed in black & white films, almost a film Noir style has its deep shadows and extravagant images. This is a story about two people who fall in love, but I do not like to spoil this. It was a rare show of homosexuals in the US in 1960. We have been moving through their lives, their mutual love and their tragedy, directed by the excellent Tom Pettit, and directed by the great Genet Szewark. Makes this episode more exciting on such a sensitive topic. Our emotions are crumbling and are on the edge. When they played Dylan's tremendous role, Chillis went on my back, "Ah, but I'm now very young, I'm younger than now", as Bairds sang. This crosses 10 and more stars. Beautiful.
