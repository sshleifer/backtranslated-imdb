We have high expectations in this regard. . . Because its zombie 3 is officially directed by Zombie 2 and Lucio Fulzi. . . However. . . Directed by Bruno Matte (Night of the Jumbis) and Dardino Saccoty wrote but filmed in the Films such as Claudio Fagrosso (Night of the Jumbis) and Nightly of the Night, and Night's Night of the Night (The Hell of the Jumbang) is dead too. This resulted as a companion of Living Dead than Zombi 2. Fabiizio Denzelis, who produced Day Rossi with Zombi 2 and its editor Tomasci (?) And Ixx Zion, gave its magic the Zombi 2. . . Zombie 3 is not magic. . . A peanut butter and jelly sandwich without peanut butter. But over the years, I grew up to accept the Zombie 3. I swear that a soldier saw a version where he bitten on the arm and went to the hotel room. . . Fulzi-Cut and Metti / Fulzi-Cut are one of the DVDs.
