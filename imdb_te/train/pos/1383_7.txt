The original title is "The Birth of the Octopus". I agree that this title is not very well understood. English title "Water Lilies". But after writing this, I read the comment by another user: "The title in French is also indicative:" coward "or octopus, which simultaneously refers to a man who deceives many." Thank you for your explanation. <br /> <br /> Basic background Girls are the first sexual emotions when they are diverted to the same or other sex. It is not different to boys. <br /> <br /> Flora and Mary feel that both of them eventually have sexually strong feelings. <br /> <br /> The water ballot for most part of the film. Sometimes the girls are down their heads, and nothing above the water except their feet and lower legs, with which they wave and kick in the air. It's lovely to people like me who have never seen such things before. - Floriana is a team leader of "Water Lilies". <br /> Mary says she wants to see her when Florence is trained. This is their first contact is not just simple. Soon they walked together. Florrie takes Mary to the garage where the boy waits for her, then goes for an hour with him, and waiting for her to come back. I have taken the couple to fall apart. But then we do less than the film. <br /> <br /> I would like to provide some information that some users find. Marie secretly steals Florin's garbage bag. She is an apple, mostly eaten. And the rest goes to eat. ?? There is a parallel scene in another film, "Kozetchi No Gogo" (Afternoon Breese), written by Hoshoti Yazaki (Japan, 1980). It is about adult young women and clearly the lesbian woman in love with a heterosexual woman. She also steals the beloved garbage bag, and finds more or less eating apples and eats the rest. <br /> <br /> Flori later told Mary that she should have her first excitement. Mary said she did not do it. <br /> <br /> However, Mary later said she was ready. And she masturbates in Florian. This scene is not naked. <br /> Maybe a female director may be in such a good psychology or study? <br /> <br /> I would like to play Adele HÃ©nel, Florian, who performed fantastic performances as an autistic girl in "The Little Devils" by Christoph Roggia (2002). ? Very poorly estimated image.
