I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses and I am also working in a very good care facility. I have seen people die from hemolytic reactions to bloodstream chores, attended many meetings on blood borne illnesses, and many patients suffer from illnesses caused by the blood through patients. I have also heard that many Witnesses say that they are dying and die from blood, and I have never seen ever before in England 26 years, "It refuses blood transfusions, or in society Do You Benefit? "The problem of Jehovah's Witnesses is a moral. "You should avoid blood" is not a vague statement. Thank you for this movie and allowing comments on it.
