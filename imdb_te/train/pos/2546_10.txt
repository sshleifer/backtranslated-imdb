It's just in the same league as 'The Black Cat', but I'd rather give it a 9+ than this 9. <br /> <br /> "Invisible Ray" episode is a horror, part drama and absolutely science fiction. Science Fiction items are a good deal before their time in the 1936 film. The mix of horror, drama and science fiction is a perfect blend, but acting in Lugosi and Carlof is not good. <br /> <br /> Director Lambert Hillier made James Wales very often. I am telling you this film is very well and well illustrated. The scenery with the gargoyles outside the lugosi's room is a good example of the mood. <br /> <br /> Why can not I understand them like "The Black Cat" and "The Last Souls Island"? The film is not yet released on DVD. It is very confusing when you consider some of the discharges already transferred to the DVD. <br /> If you have a chance, look at this picture. Hold it fast when it's released on the DVD and put it in the downtown place in your DVD library.
