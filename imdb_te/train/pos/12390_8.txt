Christie Rainas (later TV's "Flamingo Road") was stolen with a beautiful but slightly inconsistent model with a gum smile to pay her suicide by covering the famous faces, but getting her to hell! The scenes with renaissance modeling are very well connected, the mental music is perfect, Deborah Raffin is lovely as a friend of Christina, but when Reynes went into a creepy Brooklyn Heights Brown Stone (inhabited by a blind priest on the upper floor), things really started cooking. The neighbors, including a fantastically bad Burgess Meredith and Kinky couple Sylvia Miles & Beverly de Angelo, have a diabolical look, and Eli Wallach is as great a fun as a duel police detective. No combination of cross-pollination of the film "Rosemary's Baby" and "Exorcist"! Depending on Jeffrey Convitse's best vendor, "The Sentinel" is entertaining spooky, director Michael Wetta delivers a complete, skillful, shaky, thoughtful, shocking look. **** from *** 1/2
