Odd pair is a comic gem. A fictional script that is always committed to celluloid - strangerave, spinal top and lebuskie! Lemonone and Mathou are good friends: obsessive compulsive felix and sloppy, irresponsible Oscar. Oscar's wife left him because he could not live because of his irresponsible attitude. Felix's wife dropped him at the start of the film, and he poked with Poker Buddy Oscar after a suicide attempt. This happens when the fun begins. <br /> <br /> The whole script is fantastic and is filled with excellent one-liners. You already have "F.U." <br /> <br /> When my favorite movements, and Pigeon sisters are very happy when Limon diners try to clear his sinus, This requires a recurring view!
