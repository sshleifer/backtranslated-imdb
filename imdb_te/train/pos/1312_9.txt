Chalk up this one in the winner's column, this is a fantastic picture. Acting performances are great and the script is identical. <br /> <br /> Helen Hunt Riverside Police Officer Gana Pulaski is amazing. Gina is a complex character. She was a rookie cop with the Riverside Police Department. She came into the affair with a colleague with a wife and children, all of which took up a dangerous job of catching a serial killer. <br /> <br /> Jeff Phaehe (Like Roy Leota Alley) The confusion with Jina, often stuttering, working as a police officer. He is a form of praise, but he is quite opposite when dealing with his feelings and his extra marriages. <br /> <br /> Steven Webber, especially from the sitcom "Wings", is a good job quiet, humility, underachieving sociopath. On the surface, he loses an innocent, but lied a cold heart killer under the surface. <br /> Weber took a young adult child with an unsatisfied thirst to kill really little children. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is wonderful. Every scene, every sound exchange let us know more about the letters. If the events of the 90-minute film are not worth weeks, the production team has done extraordinary work with days of freezing. This is a very good example of making the film a little too short.
