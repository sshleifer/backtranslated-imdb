I would like all of this documentary fans to know that Martine Torga is my uncle and I am so proud of him. This mini-series, which has shown a small range of drugs in VH1 over the last 30 years, is very difficult. The amount of time and effort I've put in the documentary and the book that started all over (I can not find my way home) makes it much better for him to watch on TV. I know he loves what he does and he does well. His prominence was shown in interviews, he did himself and was a fantastic addition to his commentary. Between videos and everything between music, this is a great documentary that really shows the experience of drug culture through the eyes of someone who lived through it. I congratulate any comments from those I enjoyed (or did not) and those who love to hear from the fans! Three cheers for uncle
