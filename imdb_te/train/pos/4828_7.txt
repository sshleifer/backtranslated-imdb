Rupert Friend gives an acting, like Prince Albert, "Young Victoria" to an unexpected level. He is amazing. As we know, the dark and deep disappointment after Queen Victoria's Prince Albert's death, I see in the eyes of Ruper Friend, who I understand. The film does not take us to his death but it is an event that can cost his life very well. Love action. I believe, or I say it. I believe he felt real. There is no comfort in the classification of a friend and anywhere near somewhere. Emily Blunt was good but I spent a minute to Victoria. The period is not in real sense. It's not her fault but she deserves the prince's crown.
