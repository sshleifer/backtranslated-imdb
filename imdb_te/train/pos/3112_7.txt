I saw both Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy on DVD before I saw in the theater. I'm looking forward to this before they start filming. <br /> This is very good, but it does not have the first two continuations. Both identity and dominance flourished between adrenaline rush actions for the introspective drama. The film seemed unstable at times. Plots-building down-times have been slightly exposed. <br /> <br /> Camera: When frantic speaking, the trademark Greengrass shadow cam is very annoying to me. I know the message is whined / talked about nausea on board, but it's not relevant. All martial arts related to the training of the actors were completely wasted. Fighting in the funniest camera cuts and wiggling camera image is very ruined. A cheap, student director trick to ignore this movie. I would like to use these techniques in some horror films made to high school students, but not in this classy, ​​adult, action series. Even very intimate. Make some frames. Get some interesting shots. <br /> Story: The story is very confusing at first. They broke up new names and faced you on the go. I gave you the feeling that I know you're getting late into the movie and you will lose some important information. Time was rushed or compressed for reasons. However, the story is good after you've met. It was enjoyed with Bourne. However, I do not care about the final scenario of the supermisy (Londi / Bourne on the phone) in the middle of the ultimatum. This mainly makes the movie half prequel. I think it's awkward. <br /> Cast / Characters: The opening act of this movie. Obviously, only two originals remain. Born and Nicky Parsons. It's odd to me as a team. I thought Bourne would protect and trust someone. I do not even tell you why they did not do anything until I completely lost something. Other murderers in the film are pretty silent. It was thought to be like Gilchroy / Greengrass / not wanting to leave the open ends. Understand but disappointing. Seriously, Superman at the Damn, Identity and Martin Sisokas with Qualwee Owen. Those scenes are exceptional. These murderers are uninteresting like castel (first fought in the Futura Bourne Identity). Usually the actors have been degraded when the series continues. Clive Owen is practically an afterthought. This is the measure of strength for the first cast. Second, they mainly trade with Jones Allen for Chris Cooper ... not exactly equal. The actor Bryan Cox and Franca Potente have been named after 3 actors. There is nothing against David Stratherene, Scott Glenn, or Albert Finney, but they are not the first names to recall for this type of series. <br /> <br /> Even if a couple is finally interrupted, acting is right. <br /> <br /> In total it was successful. They felt like they wanted to get over the series though. <br /> If they were cut or recreated slowly, it would have been perfect, even if the whole of Scot Glene was removed and zoomed away and removed from the camera captured by the camera. <br /> <br /> When the spoiler ends, I can not see Bourne leaving it alive. This conclusion is my understanding. They obviously turned out to be the silhouette motion in the beginning of the series. I thought I thought. Complete circle type of finish. <br /> "At the end of the end of Bourne" look at this .. Look at Spacer Speaks Alert - Quote from the image below. They give you what you want. "I killed the first murderer who killed him, and the last scene was great (except Vassen Straighten, who was shot in Bourne, why does he do so?) If he is murdered for revenge, why not shoot Pamela Landy without faxing his top secret file?
