This image really deserves more recognition than its recognition. This is truly an amazing and great role of blood relations, aids and obedience in the criminal world. The film is beautifully portrayed and enters you as classic crime themes such as betrayal and power. This film is a movie that goes into a movie, which requires attention and awareness and finally completely rewards. This is another wireframe fighting in Hong Kong's Godfather and Hong Kong and China, which plays a major role in the cinema world, a welcome change than martial arts epic. It contains the setting of great characters, actors and development, yet I wanted to see twice what I did with some characters because of some interactions in the film. ALL great plots characters in all 8/10 but do not stand out enough and the music there really is not going for me and at times it does not synchronize with action (the way there is action) so it loses some points.
