Jackie Chan is considered one of the greatest action actors to promote the silver screen by many movie and martial college fans, and Police Story has long cemented his fame as the next successor to the great Bruce Lee. Lee's greatness in the Dragon 70 bared the so-called benchmark, if it entered then the Police Story and Jackie Chan in the same 80s. <br /> <br /> Forget about Rush Hour Trilogy, or in his US attempts, a film that directly illustrates Chan's excellence, high-level kicking, bone-crushing kung fu talisman began his career, his career career, <br /> <br /> Many of my attempts have been made - US Rush Hour, Dumbbell in the Bronx, The Medallion and the Tuxedo M and it becomes clear that most police stories, compared to the odds. In those films, Jackie's little 'dumbed down' version was seen, most of which were unlikely to use his fighting capabilities, and the fight sequences were not as good as any of these attempts by Drunken Master, the police story name. <br /> <br /> The adventures of the film are exceptional and are the best in any action movie. The shopping mall scene is literally one of a kind and can be viewed: glass flying pieces, Chan just gone madly through the streets of the left town of dangling outside the bus through his walking stick, and Chan successfully succeeded in the use of all goods goods and prop instrument as a weapon to fight bad things. His reputation as a kung fu expert is to show that he is harmful to every bone in his body and that he is harming the injury and keeps himself in a harmful way, showing himself as a stuntman without relying on Jackie's footsteps. Especially when he has injuries to show for it. <br /> <br /> For the sake of dialogue, the image of the film is not in the narrative, but with the end-end action and the action scenes. It's not a big deal - it's very interesting to fans of jockey and martial arts films, which are against the story. <br /> The Matrix is ​​in any form of any strings or CGI or computer tactics. The great Jackie Chan epic, Tori is full of epic action, full action and intriguing battles, Bronx, Rush Hour and his other American trials are a mile better than miles. /> <br /> Police Story is a fantastic film and I am definitely a novice Jackie Chan fan I would recommend anyone, but first of all they are not sure what to look for.
