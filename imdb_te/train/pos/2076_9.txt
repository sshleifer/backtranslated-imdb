Good Earth is a great image !!! Everyone should see it ... it's tear-jerking and heart warming. This can be used to improve the arrangement of values ​​on perseverance, humility and love of the family ... This story is particularly related to our life, especially in the beginning of poverty. It is crucial that we react to such a problem, and if a person is not strong enough to face him, he may be defenseless and ineffective. I am very proud of how the young actors supported the characters and their characters ... their emotions attracted the audience. The film is held in black and white, but the story is so attractive that you do not want to end. It makes really great! This should make it back for good image.
