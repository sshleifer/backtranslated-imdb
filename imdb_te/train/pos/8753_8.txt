I saw this movie in the theater and it was very impressive. Then again, when Claire Danes is a good actress, today is not a foolish, proud, Hollywood-based bitch. However, this film made me one of the more raw, realistic and beautiful friendly films. How far will you go for your best friend? In the end I have moved to tears, and now when I see it (still own). As soon as I left the theater I called my friend and she knew how much I loved her. It's a great movie to see with your best girlfriend. However, if she asks you to do something for her, then you need to prepare for a special conversation ....
