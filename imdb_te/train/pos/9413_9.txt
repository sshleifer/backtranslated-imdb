The best of eeling comedy in my mind is one of my favorite films of all time. The theme of workers' management (with a discussion of associations and rights) is probably the subject of bit discussions, and it is debatable, but the "white suit" is a revolutionary new one that confuses the classroom industry Plot about the person trying to create a fabric Do not Warmness, but the spark of the film has mixed fantasy with reality to realize that the original Ealing comedy. Fabric turns the dust and never gets dressed! The nominal white suit wearing Alec Guinness across the second half turns into the center of a very simple picture and scenes, and the Guinness can use his indestructible thread to measure a vertical wall! The script is also dry - "Is he right?" "Yes." "Pity." - And the role of the first rate. I am always surprised by the excellent direction in these films. Later comedy comedy "suggested camera at actors and allowed it to run", but eeling movies have always tried to make interesting lighting and angles and discoveries. This image is not exempt. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is a cast that is lifted on top of the top. Alec Guinness gives tremendous remarkable performance, when it demands a story with a striking, joyful, and crushing story. Straatone ignored except for his work. Such an edge character can quickly bore or bicker, but Guinness undoubtedly makes him want to do so, and end-of-the-scenes stimulates the real sense of urgency. He never worked. Joan Greenwood plays another role in her strong female characters and is a complete pleasure to see what is common, such as Cecil Parker and Slimly Michael Guff; Everybody gets laughing without even trying. <br /> <br /> "The Man in the White Suite" is 81 minutes long, with great plot, great cast, shiny wit and hating health toys. Absolutely top notch.
