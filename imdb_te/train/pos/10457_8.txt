Forget the cameras' religious films that have made a television / film market monopoly ... the film is a real feeling. Although it is considered a film that has cheap emotional drums, it also has a forgiveness message and is a good morality. However, I did not like lighting in the film ... it's very bright for the film dealing with such a thing. <br /> Even though there is an almost unforgivable sin, a notable cast, and their performances are counter to this supervision.
