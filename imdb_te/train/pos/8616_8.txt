G.I. If the Platoon returns back to the feudal war within 400 years, the Tokugawa led to the formation of the Shogunate. Great pitch right? <br /> <br /> Thankfully, writers are not bothered to describe at the scientific mumbo jumbo of time transport, ridiculous in the sci-fi movies. Not how or why. They just did. But if the time shipping time is not trippy and very cute, even if hell is not a bit date. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie follows a Tiki campus. However, if the steam bit loses with various avenues following the arrival of GIs to medieval Japan, it meets with a devastating battle scene. Undoubtedly the day is in the main order. The film was also derived from this simple pitch with the whole concept and extension: the latest in the modern war G.I. What's the fight against the bosses of <br /> <br /> The main battle scene that's more than half an hour is perhaps one of the best of action / war movies of the 70s. It is not relentless and tiring in the pace and length, which is G.I. Excellent Mish-mash of styles and techniques in such specialized campuses as well. Samurai can deliver. I mean, where would you get the chance to display the tanks, can I complete shirikins, helicopters and souvenirs in a single shot? GI <br /> <br /> Lieutenant Iba tears are literally using hundreds of extras, machine guns, mortars, grenades and tanks. <br /> <br /> This mish-mash of styles, is the legendary of the Samurai banners of Kurosawa's Kurosawa or Hiroshi Inagaki, in the epic, other western action and war films. Sam Peckinfa or Enzo G. Costellari has stylized touchscreen (such as amazing slow-motion shots and bloody violence) to look kyuma. Japanese film has been influenced by western and other Hollywood writings and vice versa, and G.I. Samurai effortlessly joins this east-turns the melting pot into an exciting movie. <br /> <br /> Film producers gratefully take the whole thing seriously, and the image will benefit from it. No cheek mentality in the tongue is not entirely absent, it is just not to try to pander to the bad bad-it's good audience that is happy with their movies smiling. Hundreds of extra, extensive costumes (good for a product that does not have traditional Jiddi-jikie) and the budget is likely to be higher as it is clearly visible in special effects. <br /> <br /> Camera work and editing are all top-notch, much better than an image that does not have high artistic goals. <br /> <br /> It is not of course that its flaws are of course. There are many "song" scenes, where montages (a bonding scene, a love-interest scene, a "battle hell" scenario) are all about 70 types of Japanese rock, disco and country songs. These songs are pretty dull and brown and remove from the whole thing. Though it has 140 minutes of clock thrown, it will fly like a bullet. <br /> <br /> This cast includes Sony Chiba, Isa Nutsuayagi (Goikin, Samurai Wolfe). This cast also deserves a mention. ), Sunehiko Wates (The Yakuza Papers) and Hirouki Sanada, all of which hit the right notes.
