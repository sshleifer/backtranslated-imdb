Some movies are ready for them. In 1988, I saw this film in 1999, I O.J. Simpson's defeat (I have very different opinions about the innocence of individuals in each situation). <br /> <br /> Australian media broadcasts, if the film is credited, remains an observer. <br /> <br /> In the case of individuals at all levels of society, it is feared that the malicious and selfish media broadcasts, half the truths of the truth and the lies and debates. The description of the media in contrast to the technical information in the case and inefficient. <br /> These circuses are common, but the lesson becomes more important. <Br> /> <br /> Streep is as amazing as normal, and this is the best I've seen Sam Neal. Aussi voices sometimes get a little thick but not inconceivable.
