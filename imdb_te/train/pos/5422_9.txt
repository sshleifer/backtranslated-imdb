The story of the untouchables who acted as a soldier was told in the 1939 film "Ganga Din" to save hundreds of thousands of lives. Based on Rudyard Kipling's poem, the film was directed by George Stevens and Carrie Grant, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Victor McLogen. The title role was organized by Sam Jafe, known as Dr. Zorba, the owner of Ben Casey, which was removed from the big name, controlled hair. <br /> <br /> In India during the British invasion, three soldiers - two sexy, active dolls Grant and Fairbanks, and big luxury-cut ups like McLagan - are the three majestic boys in reality. Ganga Din Water Carrier by Mugshini (McLoglain), somewhat speech-worded, treated, but he likes Cutter (Grant). He din (pronounce it as Dean) when he handles his soldier walking and salute of unit apes during their maneuvers, the cutter gives him some pointers. <br /> <br /> When the musketeers merry the band, the Ballantine (Fairbanks) announced he was going to marry a lovely young girl (Joan Fontaine) and left the service. However, when Gunga Din and Cutter Thuges, a guru (Eduardo Cianelli) run across a murderous cult, Gunga Din escapes to warn the unit, and insists that the Ballantine retrieves the recuperating cutter. This is a friend's film after all. <br /> <br /> "Gunga Din" starts out with Cary Grant, who is particularly funny, with lightheartedly, out of the shades and spectacular, widespread comedy. He and Fairbank are both pretty, and it's hard to decide first. Many of the action sequences in the film are very enthusiastic. The last part, the story becomes very dramatic and for a long time, the thrilling war has peaked. <br /> <br /> Grant is the showiest character, Fairbanks lovesick romance, mostly his treatment, and McLaglen Ganga Din, like McChesney, the most outstanding character, the elephant spotted his soft heart in his love of his elephant. His softness comes through the end of the movie, especially in the last scene of the tingling, tearful twists. <br /> <br /> Always a gentle and loving actor, Sam Jaf Gunga Din, gives a beautiful appearance like a simple, brave man with a big smile, powerful imagination and imposing dreams. Without much communication, Jaff reveals the soul of the magnificent Gunga Din. <br /> <br /> This truly is the ultimate adventure film, with a huge, good acting, magnificent scenes, a magnificent musical score, and some beautiful movie films. That amazing year, another one since 1939.
