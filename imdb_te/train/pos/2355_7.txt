... but I enjoyed this show anyway. I have read some comments before the critics about this presentation, and I have a difficult time due to the complete removal of all criticisms on my own head (except for the show: this program is old; There is so much money on people about this exhibition: moneyless; Force; Weary; Desperate for attention; Self-satisfied; Not annoying-present description. But what do you know? I really liked it. It's different, it's original, it's really dealt with; And all make for minuses. The performance is bright, sophisticated, quick, witty, interesting, fun to watch ... you know, it's only a week later, I take a week to look forward to it and enjoy it. I will regret it. But I guess no one is bringing back this back to life.
