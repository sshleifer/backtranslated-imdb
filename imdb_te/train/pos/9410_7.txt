I enjoyed this movie. But I'm surprised to see that people are saying comedy. It's fun at times, but really, it's not so funny. I feel like comedy, I was disappointed with the movie, but I realized that without any expectations, it would be enjoyable and attractive. This is because, as an engineer, I have identified with the prophet. I have less concerns about the irony of capital or labor, and more in the basic story of the person struggling for his discovery. He is interested in monetary gain from his invention, which is looking for realism to come into production. He is certainly a hero when he refuses to take a big money and hot woman to suppress his invention. So I'm curious to those who are in comparison with Jurassic Park. I compared the fountain head.
