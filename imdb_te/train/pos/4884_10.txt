Persons of a certain age, W.W. II is the defining time of their lives, and never compares. <br /> <br /> When the film opens, a widow but still gentle woman (Judi Dench) tried to play a street musician with a traditional song "Stardust". <br /> <br /> Almost all the girls' band were also entertained by her memories of bombings during the war. Drummer Patrick (Ian Holm) happily utilized the draft and enjoyed the ladies. <br /> <br /> Patrick and Dench decided to join the band and reunite the band, which takes them in the short-range sequence. Despite the ups and downs, the band is back and successful resume. <br /> <br /> The film is fantastic and poor, in which all participants have excellent performances. The characters are well developed and despite their years, all the people who have left their lives. <br /> It is not Steven Spielberg's pontifics, but a serious movie. The war has influenced everybody and that lesson was not forgotten in a film that was not afraid to entertain when it was taught.
