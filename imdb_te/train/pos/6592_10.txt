I did not see this movie, but I must. <br /> <br /> After reading Thor Heyerdahl's books (Kan Tiqi, Raw and Aku), I'm looking at a copy of this movie. <br /> <br /> Peruvian immigrants to Polynesia are alive. The band feels that there is only one old-shaped valve (tube) radio with NO GPS and 6-watt output, and it is the heroic to say the least of their journey. <br /> Please tell me this video copy of this message. <br /> <br /> I'm interested to buy it.
