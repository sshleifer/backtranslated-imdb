Synopsis is the future as seen from England in 1939. When leading to war on Europe, the defense of humanity will not be seen in the past politics. <br /> <br /> Have a sense of attitudes about your leaders and be careful what you say. Thinking outside the box leads to a bright tomorrow. <br /> <br /> Previously, I saw this movie a long time ago and recently downloaded the Internet (it is in the domain of the domain). It works attractive at many levels. Since it's a story about the future as seen in 1939, it has obvious flaws. This vision of the future is both terrifying and whimsical. This film is cutting for its day. Special effects like storyline are very good. Acting is a bit of performance in the British theater concept, which can slightly shake towards Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Science and technology can solve all our problems, but never know it is always true. Other films of movies include attractive leaders and the curse of human existence and possibly with us. <br /> <br /> Almost all of the films of science fiction films can be found in the film. The technical failure of "Forbidden Planet" in "2001: A Space Odesse", inspired by the dense landscapes / city scenes of "Star Wars". <br /> <br /> The end of the film leaves a viewer perplexed a bit. Although it is positive in the end of the stars for the stars, if we can do it forever, we will be surprised. When we reached, we were trying to get us back. The film's interest in the future will be a bit joked by today's standards. Massive flying machines and guns never happened in the real world to shoot people into space, but in 1939 they were considered to be the next logical step. <br /> <br /> Most brilliant British actors are younger in the film. Cedric Hardwick and Ralph Richardson are very recognizable and their speech skills are obvious here. Raymond Massey is an interesting choice to play the main character Cobl. His character is almost as likely as the new Christ sent by Christ to save his new religion with the new religion of his own. <br /> <br /> This is a good part of the history of cinema. Focus of the future missed the mark.
