It's a great movie, and has dramatically played a while. It has extra jing. I love Vanessa Williams as Ronnie, and Jason Alexander also has a good voice. That's great. The setting is very good. Except for 2 hours and 50 minutes, it will be too long. Overall I give 8.5 stars. They added some parts, but it still looks good.
