I'm tired of people who judge movies on their "historical accuracy". It's a movie authors and directors have to put their own spin in this story! Most films are not perfect in history ... Braveheart, Wyatt Erp, Gangs of New York, Geronimo: An American Legend, The Last of the Mohians ... All the fairy tales are historically incorrect. If you want to see what some great actors do best, then you should watch this movie and do not worry about the accuracy of facts. Only film quality, storyline and one of the greatest actors of our time.
