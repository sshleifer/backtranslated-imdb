Spacecamp is one of the movies that kids love, and mom and dad can enjoy watching as well. In the 80s, I enjoyed this movie, which is the plot and all the actors. I recently bought this movie on DVD, so I have my own children and I am very happy to watch this movie as I did. The plot is fun, the children's team, who landed on an unexpected journey, when they entered space with a burgeoning robot. They were originally in Ahu but they did not have enough oxygen to drown the panic when they realized. After they captured enough oxygen from space, they returned to the ground as good friends and the newly available dignity of life.
