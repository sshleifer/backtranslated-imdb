It is one of the best bugs cartoons, together with "Tan Tonic", which is really one of the best bugs. There are some comments on bugs in this cartoon "basic," ie, I guess he is not fully developed. In fact, this "basic" version of the Miss-40s (Chick Jones' best version) is actually more fun than the rabbit-sized and finally the long-legged version of Yosemite Sam and Duffy Duck. The next day the bugs were very happy and sophisticated at my discretion. Great examples of classic bugs and classic Chuck Jones include "Hair Rising Hare" (1946) and "Rabbit Punch" (1948).
