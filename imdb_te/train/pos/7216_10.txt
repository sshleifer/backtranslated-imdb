No one will spoil good work! Awesome image! Was deftly written by the likes of Ira Levin, and was portrayed as one of Christopher Reeve's best performance and one of Cayne's best performances, just amazing. I wish I could catch a version somewhere somewhere ... maybe something I'm. It is not hard to recognize that this confusing underestimated film is neglected, because it must be a love for any Hitchcakian, Agatha-Filley, or Great Picture. One of the very few films I can not readily or correctly evaluate, and second or third view is not worth, "Deathtrap" gets a 9/10 and earns every iota. We need movies like this and need!
