One of the best movie plays I have ever seen. We do a lot of acting in the church and these actors can use as a source that highlights all the good things in their work. I highly recommend this one, especially for those who are interested in acting, like a "should look." There are many scenes. For one, Hamlet Yorick (everyone knows about that scene by going to just the primary school) is a graveyard scene that faces, and his interaction with the skull is well done. The logic used in this scene is tremendous - shakespeare more than anything else. For the second time, I enjoyed the upcoming dual discussion of the role played by Hamlet, Horatio and Robin Williams.
