British comics come in one of two main types: silent, introspection, general romance and theoretical social irony. Settings, letters and feelings vary but display some of the features in one of the two sections. Butterflies probably the essence of the first type. <br /> <br /> The scripts are very oral, including the long internal monologues by the main character Rhea, an interesting, happy but stable housewife about what she might have missed when she began her entirely traditional life. When she meets a successful but clumsy and emotionally talented businessman (she is most interested in her), she has dolls to find out what she has done in other ways. <br /> Acting and scripts always show cash, the reaction of the show is entirely individually: I have not removed or stopped it. My mother, on the other hand, worshiped this show. I think RIA's confusion is the most important factor in deciding every action for the butterflies.
