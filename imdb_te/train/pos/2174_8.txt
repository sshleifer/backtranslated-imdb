I really like this movie. "Prix de Butte" was initially a silent film but later translated into French in 1930. Although the voice of others is on her, it remains an amazing tour de force for Louis Brooks. The fact that legendary Edith Piaf has voiced his singing helps us to forgive purists about dubbing cheating. <br /> <br /> It is the story of Lulu and we first saw her at a resort with her boyfriend, Andre (Georges Charlie) and their friend Antonin (Augustus Cartini). The lounge enters the frame with a pair of legs: she looks at her in a car that has become her bathtub. Lulu is very free when she exhibits her body. We know that Lulu is not at the end of Easy Street when applying for the 'Miss Europe' title. <br /> <br /> The beautiful women in this movie are focusing on men. We look at the beauty of bathing and the reactions of men. But it's all wonderful Louis Brooks in the middle. <br /> If you look at movies from ancient ages, check this out. Louise Brooks is not a name for most cinematic fans, but as soon as you see it you mesmerize and you want to know more. <br /> <br /> If you find it, check her in the 'Pandora Box'. <br /> <br /> Be careful about the release of the US Kino DVD. I do not know if their projection is correct. The scenes are shown at a very high speed. This may be the way they are shot. I do not know. But this is the only way to see this film, which is worth a little bit of swallowing.
