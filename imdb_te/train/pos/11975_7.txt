Full House Great family performance. However, after watching some parts over and over again I realized they're very boring and they seem to harbor much from the outside world. Yes, there is a lot of humor, but there are times when it's very cheesy. It's not like I hate it, but they do not see them over and over again because they get old quick. <br /> <br /> Full House Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) and his three daughters D.J. (Candace Cameron) Stephanie (Jody Switin) and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley). Danny's wife needs some help when he dies. So, his best friend Joey (Dave Cowley) and Girls' Uncle Jessie (John Stromos) move on with them. When they live there together they can not live without each other. <br /> <br /> The full house reminds you of how important the family and you can go back home anytime.
