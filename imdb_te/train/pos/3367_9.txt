The film is a great acting, great photography and really how you affect your character, how you define your character, whether you agree to play a role or make you think about whether or not you really get free. Excellent comments dealing with these topics. I want to comment on the official background of the film. In general, two people are on the roof. The space and time are unity, 2 prophets, and the radio as the choir. Many directors converted Greek tragedies into the film, with many directors filmed contemporary stories as a Greek tragedy, but the director assumed that Ettore scores succeeded in reaching the purity and power of great Greek tragedies in the story line and the official setting. A masterpiece.
