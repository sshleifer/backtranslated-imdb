The parrot that speaks for a new movie is not a fanciful idea, but a simple idea into a clever, heartfelt picture that pleases the whole family of Paulie. This sets the gap between the worst and brutal confusion of sentiment during the separation of Mary and Poly, and all the events in the film lead to the most satisfying emotional ending. Animal training is well done - everyone is influenced by Paul's first expansion of his wings and flies. Pauli was a great character and the path was more successful, but the film was not a highlight of 1998, save as a private ryan. This hour and half will definitely be enjoyable and you will remember. Following him from the moment you see him from the moment he was united with his original boss, he will enjoy him and learn about the realities of friendship and life. Way. A missed one if you have any kind of heart or emotion. 9/10
