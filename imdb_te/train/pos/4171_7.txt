I walked many years ago when the channel was surfing on Sunday afternoon. Although it was apparently a cheesy TV movie from the 70s, the direction and score were well enough to hold my attention, and in fact I was hooked and had to see it until the end. I recently got to buy and see again (and its amounts) to buy a foreign DVD of the film (whoops, finally noticed a couple in front of a couple) <br /> <br /> I could not fully understand this phenomenon, but It seems to be locked on horror horror movies in the 70s. Some of the 70s have produced some beautifully filmed movies and our permanent horror gestures, but are they really scary? No, not much. Also in the 70s we've got horror movies that have cool, more exciting, good productive values ​​and advanced special effects, more fun, funny, effective "jump" moments and gore, but again ... they're not really scary! 70 is just about the atmosphere of horror films. Granny film quality. Dark scenes scratched by extreme high-tech lighting rigs. The quality of the "edge of dreamland" dialogue is music and unnatural and dramatically EQ'd scores. The odd feeling of discontent and dissatisfaction permeating everything. <br /> In particular, in the film, the silly and intense shots of the Devil Dog are very small when walking people. unnerving. Not only do dogs grow, they are more effective than dog's growth, slowing and open antagonist ("cushion"). Carefully save the dog when it appears in a supernatural way. The effects that occurred during today's scales were literally chilling. <br /> <br /> Human characters in the movie are not as satisfying as their hostility or residence in the world, rather than a more realistic psychic vision. All the actors do a good job. From "Witch Mountain" movies, brother and sister from brother and sister, pairing rather than stunt casting, but they do well. Yvette Mimieux is always entertaining if it's fun. Richard Kreena will grow more and more like a movie film. His self-suspicion is very good in the fact that his family's immortality is truly a psychological story or whether he surrenders to suspicious schizophrenia, but a description of what he enjoys a normal physical revenue is irrelevant <br /> <br /> The End-Question -Mark Time is one of the things I've seen, it's less like gimmick   ుభూతి కాదు, వాస్తవానికి నా గురించి ఎంపికలు ఈ అక్షరాలు తదుపరి మరియు ఎదుర్కొంటున్న ఉంటుంది వారు ఏమి గురించి మరియు వారు దాని గురించి అనుభూతి ఎలా. <br /> <br /> The critics of this film have illuminated retina shots that it is just a feature-length vehicle for some neato, but hey, you could say the same thing about "Blade Runner". :-)
