I liked this movie as a Pokemon fan. It introduces a new epic pokemon (like every image) and adds depth to the relationships between its characters. But I do not expect people who do not enjoy Pok√©mon fans (which has a lot of older people). Some lines are brown, but the movie is somewhat unavoidable when dubbed into English. The animation is beautiful despite a couple of parts that are not visible. And if the type of villain chain, I think a variety of movies have done a good job of cycling through the villains, and I guarantee you that they are not all this one. I do not like it, I say each his own, but Pokemon fans will love it.
