Not a bad martial arts image. Fight scenes are good. Michael Quizy made a good job directing his first film without Van Damme. The story is foul language and works without much blood. Storytelling Jeanette Francessca has a good line of work. It's great to see another from her in the same style. She likes art and speaks to strong women. It is definitely worth looking at. I recommend this film for all drama and martial arts lovers.
