Season 2 requires absolutely little work. Like a virus between Max and Logan, and Ames White, along with his oldest, super cult. Season two, however, is the only thing I can see that Max and Logan Max is looking to get rid of the evil virus without infecting it. Season Two is a good play. But like all TV shows, if it is a little bit wrong, the broadcast company will stop the air. I was deeply interested in the third and last season. Season 2 Unless you read books by Max Allen Collins, hangs down, you know what's going on. <br /> <br /> Dark Angel must retain the air. All original actors are getting a lot to get back. After the show, Jessica Alba's carrier moved to the sky. If that's the case, it should be a cinematic film. Just like a fire fly, the FOX of course has also been canceled.
