When I was at the Hollywood video I looked through their removal of the movies and the DEMONICUS Plus for five buckaroos was off fifty percent! I saw only one time and could not overcome this great deal! The second view is better than the first one. The box looks great and the music is great. If you do not see the demo, I will do it or if you hired and hoisted Demonicus it would give you a different chance to change your opinion. <br /> <br /> Damonicus is a very different but entertaining movie.It is like watching an interactive video game with it or not! I'm sure it's very low budget and actors. I started a video game that I had a guy and a woman in Italy and a cave that looks like a railroad / train track tunnel and what she does not do there and what she does! He did not listen to her! He goes there and finds gladiator artworks and the perfectly preserved body of a glorious gladiator named Armor and Tyrannus! Where was the chair coming from Tyranius, how good was his body and where did the Cildron pot complete each cave with the Khaltron Pat? Drones has his armor, helmet, and has a weapon or two. The great thing that one person can do is he puts on the helmet and tirrunnes through the spirit! <br /> Now, I said before, like a video game. It's very hard to explain, but it's just like this. The music also sounds like video games. Acting is really terrible. The actors are doing things like he's doing, oh he's nuts and fine he's going from home to nuts! As well as the movie is also running during the day searching for her with a guy running and trying to find his girlfriend at night and still still take a break there are some major flaws! <br /> There are a few flaws in this movie but it's not as classic as a verwl but if you like movies with really low budget defective then you see better Demonicus!
