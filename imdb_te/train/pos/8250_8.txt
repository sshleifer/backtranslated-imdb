The film will be held in the 1950s. According to this, the deceased (known as zombies) were born to eat the country. However, a company has developed a collar which, when placed around the neck of the zombies, makes them obedient and perfect servants. Robinsons' mother Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss), Father Bill (Dylan Baker) and son Timmy (K'sun Ray) hired a zombie because everyone in their block was already one. Tim names zombie Fido (Billy Connolly) and friendship with him. But his father hates him and loses control of Timmy Fido and things go wrong. <br /> You look like this - in many other cases - stand up for Takeoff Lassie in Fido's "Lassie" series. Timmy has been named for a reason! Each of the famous lassie episodes is here. Timmy is my favorite when sending Fido Off to help him before eating! Moreover, all of the 1950s Douglas Circk films were sarcastically and colorful - but dark secrets distorted people. The characters wear very bright 1950s (mos always a dress) - decorations, settings and cars, especially in hyper-bright colors in the 1950s. There is something to see even when the script is repeating. The script is good - but there are so many lassey jokes. Melodramatics is kind of crazy, but the cast pulls it out. Here is amazing and target for everyone. Connolly does a good job as an emotional zombie. <br /> This is not for everyone (of course). This irony is a lot of people and gore is pretty. Gore is so casual and it is difficult to take it seriously to play music. So, for some people, it really works. I'll give it to 8.
