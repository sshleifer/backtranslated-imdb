<br /> <br /> "Bleak House" is always the best adaptation of Charles Dickens's novel. One of my favorite novels, I enjoyed this television mini series with great pleasure. Lately, the great DanHelm Eliot was a perfect figure as John Jardis and Diana Rigged Doomed Lady Deadlock. The film binds the essence of the Dickens era and is very confident of the book, making it easy to make small plot cuts that do not affect the story. On a stunning, moving and weather picture.
