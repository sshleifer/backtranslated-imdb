Binny Barnes starred in a 1938 comedy based on a play in Laurence Oliver, Merle Oberon, Ralph Richardson, and "The Divorce of Lady X". Oliver is a young lawyer, who plays Everton Logan, allowing Oberzen to spend the night in his hotel room, which is too thick for guests at Costume Ball to go to London Fog home. The next day, his friend, Lord Mere (Richardson) and his wife (Barnes) spent the night with another person at the same hotel, and wanted to divorce her. Oberman believes that Olivier is a Phoenix. Oberon, who is single and a judge's granddaughter, is a lady who is truly a lady steel lady mere question. <br /> We have seen dozens of these plots or dozens. With this cast, it's so happy. I mean, Richardson and Oliver? Oliver and Oberon, a great team in the Whothering Heights? Pretty unique. Oliver is devastating and is doing a great job with the comedy that he plays the role of the elite, nurse. Obsen gives her the role of Light Light Touch. Fuller in her face with Jean Harlow eyebrows and a different hairstyle for her looks pretty. Although her first gown is a birthday cake, she wears some beautiful street clothes, and she tries to do with the hair in a gown, ready to play Snow White. <br /> <br /> This color is a mess, and it really can be used to restore as others have said. Definitely worth seeing.
