I have not seen this movie in 5 years, but still haunts me. <br /> When asked about my favorite films, I first mentioned it. Some of the films ("Dark City", "Dark City" and "Breaking the Waves") that seem to have touched you are not such a protected and hidden and yet very sensitive, rather than an incident that changes the life of an observer, a serious relationship or a friend's death Like ... when I first saw the film "shook me". It left me with an emotional hangover that lasted long.
