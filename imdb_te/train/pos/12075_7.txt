Nina Foch emphasized that "My Name is Julia Ross", also starring Dame May Witty in the 1945 film Nair and George McCarthy. It is small, and because it is, the film suffers. <br /> <br /> When I was growing up, Focch was a player on television, nervous woman, cheating husband, nervous wreck. She has become one of the greatest actresses in Los Angeles. Here, she has a pretty young role playing the title role. Julia answers a statement for a secretary and will be rented immediately by Ms. Hughes and her son Ralph. <br /> <br /> She will soon find out - A Front of Employment Agent is set up to obtain a suitable woman, a family member and a woman without a baby. Condition; <br /> <br /> When Julia went home, she was drunk, and when she woke up, she told her that she was Mrs. Hughes and did not allow her to leave. <br /> Acting is very good. Some things, especially at the end, will happen very quickly, which is why - the lower budget but still entertaining, which is why I was so small in the movie. However, I recommend.
