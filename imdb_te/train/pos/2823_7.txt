When MGM first entered Hollywood, Garbo did not know how to market. Mayer had a lot of confidence in her and defended her performance in "Torrent". She did not speak English, so Ricardo Cortez did not make it easy for her to work. <br /> <br /> The torrent river of this title is a small village sleeping in Jussar, Spain. Leonora (Greta Garbo) hopes that her voice is something that will bring great wealth and happiness to her struggling parents. Leonara and Don Raphael (Riccardo Cortez) are in love but his mother is under the thumb and she can not get permission for her marriage. Meanwhile, Donna Brull (Martha Mattox) removed Leonara's parents from their home and sent Leonara to Paris, where she had the opportunity to grow her singing career. Leonara sends a note to Rafael, asking him to recall his promise and come with her. <br /> <br /> "Leonara has a new identity - she has become a drink of La Bruna, Paris Opera. His mother turned to the office - he was running for the office and prayed to a "safe" young man named Remadios ("Hogg" Hayes), where Mac Sweenin plays the role of his father Leonora decided to go back to his old home And I agree - why she did not help her mother, her mother still lives in a house and takes it in a skew and washing with Leonora and Raphael, but Leonora is full of ridicule, Gerboy is so lovely and it is hard to believe that he is happy with Remedies. <br /> <br /> The dam burst and the torrent town Leonara's house is on the way to the Raging River but when Rafael tries to save her, they feel very secure. Donna Brull has a "Horizontal" love scene in the film Was harvested. And go and tell Leonora. She meets Rafael Leonara before the American tour. Again he wants to go with her, but again she leaves her. Others spend a lot of time trying to destroy his reputation - "just pull me down what she does for you". The irony is that she has just achieved a top government job if she comes with her. <br /> <br /> She is fresh and enthusiastic as ever before - she looks bigger than her age and drops below normal. <br /> <br /> Lucy Littlefield is doing a good job as Mandio, Barber and Leonara's old and loyal friend.
