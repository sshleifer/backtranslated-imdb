Really enjoyed this little film. This is a movie moving about fighting, sacrifice and especially friendships between friendships (especially the child actor who plays Mikey's role). There are a very large number of non-existent individual films set around WW2, the agreement being said to be the true break from the low storyline and the original one. I was also too far away from this film boring, far apart !! Of course the horses are breathtaking and the scenery is breathtaking. For anyone who really deals with their family of animals, this film is especially rewarded. Recommended for fans who look for a little different ones.
