This film is crazy. I have not laughed this hard for a long time. I mean, it's not "Good Will Hunting", but should it be? I was actually very few in sophisticated screening and was pleasantly surprised. Comedy is hard hit and very stable. Amanda Peet is hot and stunning. The whole audience that I played made me enjoy the film.
