I remember Casper's comic books, but do not remember any cartoons. Perhaps they are not memorable; I do not know but at my advanced age, here I'm looking at this very early Casper animated little. Later, I was surprised to read the user-comments here. <br /> <br /> I do not want to go out to the Casper every night and look like other ghosts scaring C-P all. "He sees no future," says the narrator. Instead, one night he goes to the rural area of ​​town, accidentally fearing some animals and not finding any friends. This will bring tears to the slightest fox, and it will make him tears until he makes friends. <br /> <br /> Both of them have become buddies, but soon Fox is progressing in a fox hunting. <br /> Other reviews tell you what happened, and that's why I'm touching that. The fox hunting dogs (not shown) and Casper lost in the tears "I've lost a friend who's already." But the story is not happy for the story. "Freddie" became a soul-like person like a fox Casper, and when he fled in his lap, his face and storyteller commented that "they were happy". <br /> <br /> The two characters are happy. It's a nice story with a nice, happy ending.
