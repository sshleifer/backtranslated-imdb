Contrary to popular belief, this title is not very bad, at least for me. Indeed. I thought of it as a fan favorite. The differences between the welding series of stories is not well structured when you consider, but all of these things can be very pleasurable. For its day's film, the scenes are very well and the characters are consistently believable. <br /> <br /> The sound / audio track is my personal favorite. Almost everything has the right sound effect and many voices are in harmony with the better characters, unfortunately now there are more replicas than the US dub. Synchronization is perfect for each shot. I have some issues with actors for 'alien' voices (forgive crude naming, after a while I saw). However, the cast was perfectly balanced. I feel and believe in the roles of this film. Not long ago I rarely agree. <br /> I do not think this is the first act that I have ever seen in my life. This has historic value for me, but after seeing the real megasi it was even stronger in my collection. </ P> <p> I personally think it's a big shame. It applies to the right audience, I agree with Roto Tech and not for years. I've been with the animator everyday in my life and thought this film was the best filming title for everyone. <br /> <br /> The holes between the performances to clearly identify the viewer after watching its film. However, without seeing the originality, the viewer can not really notice. With the same style of animation, there is no reason to re-query its day. UK anime has very limited access. Laser discs are very productive medium. Personally, I have the balls to raise Karl at least for the genre. <br /> <br /> Even though people have some psychedelic errors with this movie, the eighties feel in love with me. If you look at Megason 23 now, I believe that you will be disappointed with OSD for its original Japanese audio or new tab. <br /> Get back your mind to the original Bubblegum Crisis Dub Soundtrack and assume the new Eighties audio for the EVE. The popularity of the film is now rarely reduced in the open market. Personally, this created a collection for me. I am surrounded by the world for goods from the three parts that I have made and I am attending Karl Mask and tearing to work and buying a band or crate to get me into the amusement.
