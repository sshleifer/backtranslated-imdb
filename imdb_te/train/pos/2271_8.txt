I finished the narrative of the film's director, and I feel a big thing from it because I agree that the movie, like The Insider, is completely subjective. This is from Howard's POV. So, like Ebert, any review or effort really is really about the character of Noel when considering a set of annotations. If you think, as he did, the movie "will not work", then I think Howard did not work. And, to be frank, you could be right. <br /> Howard's reasoning and personality can not really stand professional psychological treatments and analyzes. <br /> <br /> But, hey, it's the people's nature. <br /> Andrew.
