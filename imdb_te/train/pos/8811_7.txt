Their views and ideas about the WTC attack were produced by eleven different filmmakers in different parts of the world. This is one of the best efforts you've ever seen in any movie. Such images are rarely made and appreciated. The film tries to touch every major center of WTC. <br /> <br /> The story from Samira Mohammalob (Iran), which is preparing for attacks from the people of Iran here, is very important. The teacher is trying to educate his students by informing them about the dying Innocent People in the WTC massacre. Then comes a story from Yusuf Chahain (Egypt), where the filmmaker appears in a face-to-face conversation with a dead hard core terrorist involved in the Dead Soldier and WTC attack in the WTC attack. Then we saw a story from Idris Oiadragou (Burkina Faso), in which five Innocent children's teams are looking at Osama bin Laden, abducting him and planning to win prize money from America. Then we see the story from the Alessandro Gogolz Incorint (Mexico) where you will see a black screen and slowly down the real footage of WTC buildings. And people who are stuck in the building are to jump from it to save their lives. There is another important story from Mira Nair (India), where she struggles to get her respect for Dead Son, mistaken in the WTC massacre! After the September 11 attacks, our heart beat automatically starts sending two names to the world everywhere. First World Trade Center, the second is Osama! <br /> <br /> The film will change our opinion completely and become more of a strong topic. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend this film to everyone who has the types of home DVD collection. Definitely worth every penny you spend. But please do not expect anything further away from the films on this DVD. There are no additional features in the Filmmakers' course of filmmakers.
