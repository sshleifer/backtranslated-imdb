This PM Entertainment Production product is filled with enough bullets, John Woo said, "Already already!" In fact, Wu is delivering and takes about 90 minutes of predatory work. Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is a secret cop in the near future. When his wife used a team-like-cyborg with a group for the murder of the governor, it would be Eric to clear her name. Wilson van Dumm√© takes the task and plays the heroic leadership and his nasty Cyborg Duplegangar. Why the academy failed to make a notice and was beyond me. With a PM production, tons of car tons, exploding cars (4 in the first 5 minutes!) And shoot. I especially liked the dropsy van before touching the exploding truck. In my other favorite bit dawn simulator she participated in a neighboring girl who came to perfect her karate. It is only possible to show some cheap lavamormar MAN effects in 1995.
