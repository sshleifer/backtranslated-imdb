We bought a copy of our home video library, very happy with, like a family, 'The Last of the Blond Bomb Shells'. <br /> Acting is the A1 and the cast has many favorite actors and singers. The theme is exceptional and the script is well written. Music / songs are timeless and our voices sang songs at the top of our young days will take us back. <br /> <br /> The story is to say 'Plot', and it is good to sit back and enjoy the story. <br /> Complete marks for the most fun and exciting production and we want it to be a belly-grin and anyone looking for a lot of music.
