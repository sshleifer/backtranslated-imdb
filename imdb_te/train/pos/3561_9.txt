Was featured by Vivian Blaine (original Broadway performance), Jean Simmons (whose character has an odd comparison to Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday") and two of the greatest celebrities of all time, Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando , Both recently won Oscars as Best Supporting Actor ("From Here to Eternity") and Best Actor ("On Waterfront") and their game.
