You are all hell from Todd Sheets !! You make $ 30,000 movie and see what you see! Guy 735 is a simple cast that works on zombies and free of charge! Acting is quite ridiculous at times. Yeah, that's not what you see. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Zombie Nation with Raccoon Zombies, it's not the worst. <br /> <br /> It's pure good old fashioned film making! Todd is a perfect professional, and a good person around. There are holes in the plot, yes. This plot can be found away. But hell, I still love this movie. I'm hiding tad sheets and I think he's going to do this remake. If someone tries to portray someone, they realize that it's done, and a feat in it.
