I love this movie. It is well written and acted and has a good cinematography. The story mixes the sensitivity of actions, humor, spirituality and great sets and beautiful locations shots. Look at it, buy it, and show it to your friends. <br /> <br /> Acting is good and Murphy makes a good job of portraying a particularly unrepentant / unacceptable hero. <br /> <br /> I am very interested in these characters. Dynamic interaction is very interesting. <br /> I thought what happened to this people, the result was very predictable. Surprisingly attractive girl and protects the lives of the holy baby - who can not see the coming?), It still made me happy when it worked well at the end. Thanks to God that never respected the image of this film never ruined with a memorable sequel. Hold some popcorn, squeeze on the bed, and watch this fun, happy and entertaining movie.
