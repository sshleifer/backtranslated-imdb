I really enjoyed this - I'm a big fan of messy movies with your mind and leave you with a lot of talks and ideas, and this is a wonderful example. <br /> <br /> In the past, Terry Gilliam is good at any time. (Always, almost always do we forget about Zeberbah and The Brothers Grimm?). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> Future sequences have a similar feel to Brazil, and current scenes are also visually compelling. <br /> <br /> The most striking thing about it is that there is not much like Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt, and both of them have made wonderful performances here. Pit is important - I can see one or two movies before he actually learned what actually did actually work (actually contradict what I thought), but this really outdid them. I actually found asking my friends at a time "Are you sure that Brad Pitt?" This is probably the most memorable performance of his career (although not quite acceptable though it is not acceptable).
