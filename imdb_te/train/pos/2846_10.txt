I'm not a writer or a critic ... I saw this movie a few minutes ago. I thank the creators of this film! Too .... but my heart touches ... why I want to understand it ... it's easy and accessible .. is a picture that you feel good after a bad day without any remorse. It's about wasting time watching! About love and caring, about life we ​​have but sometimes we miss it because we stuff stuff ....... we see all the time we have but we miss it. ... why do we make phu * k? We must live as we die ... Take care of every second and remember: Good things will come back to us if we do good things! .And it is a special flavor in New York ... I love this town and the world I live in !!!! Thank you so much for the film and sorry for my mistakes (English is my second language) ...
