When I hear that Hul Hartley is making a sequel to Henry Fool, I have expressed my curiosity (this is a personal favorite for years now), and then I heard what I did with terrorism. Although it looks, he is surprised to learn that it works, but the film is completely different than Henry Fool. Writing and directing has both died and acting is awesome ... The only four are headed down to Henry's son Down to Headley to return to Heart for full cast. As I mentioned, the film is different from the first, but it works: I realized that in the 10 years that I have been able to reconcile with the change of tone and things, the characters ended up in the first film in a very different setting. In this case, an unexpected adventure occurs ... and I'll give it away ... I have to look again to understand what's really going on and how to double again. It's been one of the best movies I've seen for a while, with Hartley planning for the third time and the sequels will end up with the end of the movie as you seem to be hanging. I'm sure I will buy my tickets for part 3 ('Henry Grim') in 2017.
