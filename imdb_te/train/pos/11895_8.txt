Tea Leonie plays the role of Norra Wild, a serious photographer who is getting bad divorce. Although she wants freedom, it comes at a cost. She wants legitimate photography, but she has hired to work as a paparazzi for tabloids. Her bass is an amazing and divine Holland Taylor. The show is very well written. TEA's Nora began to develop a very memorable character but did not support network comedy and they still do not. Although they took out from Cheers to George Wend, they made unnecessary changes in casting and roles. The show is well at the start and the audience has been using it but the network botches it like a bad plastic surgery.
