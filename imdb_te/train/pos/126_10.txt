Gentropa is the most original film I have seen over the years. If you are the only thriller that can be influenced by film Noir, the Hollywood summer blockbusters are the perfect treatment for all these days. Although Van Treers follow-ups like Wayne Breaking the Waves, it's really his best work. It is elegant without a disadvantage and provides a perfect combination of suspense and dark humor. He decided that handheld cameras would be a wave of the future. It's hard to tell him that he is away from the style that he presented here, but he lost everybody's risk instead of his theoretical direction.
