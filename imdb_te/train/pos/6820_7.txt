This film is much better than the other reviewer said. This is a good family image. It's a fun fantasy item for some time travel. The story revolves around a 14-year-old girl who finds a way to travel back to her old elevator of the apartment building. No one believes her when she tries to explain her disappearance. She finds a girl about her age and makes friends and the girl's family can help in many ways. She can also make her own relationship with her father in the long run. Give it a chance and decide for yourself, because it reminds me of a hallmark image. It seems to be pointing towards the kids about 6-12 years (probably a bit older) and it is pretty much a PG or G rated. I'm an adult to appreciate a good "family" movie - I guess I'm not the other reviewer.
