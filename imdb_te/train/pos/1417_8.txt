I saw this movie with my family and it was great! The film is more than just a documentary (not more than the cold facts) with a long mono / dowelog and a lot of charts ... The film's full or "energy" comes from the impressive images painted in the air or the Arctic. By looking at this movie you can learn more about our planet, it shows that when we read a book, we are embedded in a circular stream. The film is not only for "environmental philosophy", but people who want to see a message to see it. We have taught me that this film is not living on earth ... We live and grow on earth and all plants and animals and die with us.
