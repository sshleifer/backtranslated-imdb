Here is a wonderful Barbara Stanwick double bill. The first film - and the lesser belief in both of them - was joined by MGM's "To Please A Lady" (1950) with Clarke Gibble. It is essentially a star vehicle with a gable that is usually dominated by the presence of his screen. Here he plays a macho racing driver who has received a bad press from feminist reporter Stanwick and begins the battle of sexes. In fact after a lot of Ado they eventually end up in each other's hands and it's all coming up to the imagination and the lovely. <br /> <br /> But the second feature of real meat on this DVD is - a wonderful and very unknown little thriller called Jeopardy. The film was produced by MGM in 1953 and is an amazing little gem. When suddenly tragic events, on a whit and remote Mexican beach, Stanwick will play the role of Barry Sullivan's wife and their younger son Lee Aker. What is a decayed wooden pier Sullivan put on a huge aperture and what can he imagine? Yes, the tides come in. The spirit of the mind and the Snawwick can not free him by car for help. Instead of her help - she wants more from her than a change of money or clothes ("I will do anything to save my husband - she's one-sided escape (Ralph Meeker)" after driving a little distance. She or she ?? <br /> <br /> Micra flees with the picture! He turns in a very spectacular performance! Once he comes into the picture of your eyes!

One of the most powerful French artists in the Stanley Kubrick's "Ways of the Glory" (1957) of Stanley Kubrick's "Power of Glory" (1957) in the finest Man / Stewart Western "Naked Spur" (1953). In exceptional, Mike Hummer in Mickey Spillen's "Kiss Me Deadly" The name is great. His performance in "Jeopardy" performed wonders for him, but he worked only in films. He died in 1988. <br /> <br /> "Jeopardy" can now be proud of his classic position as a classic noir because of this release. The glittering, tact and exciting thriller thanks to good performances, a climactic score by Victor Milner's crisp monochrome cinematography and Dimitry Timokin, in the tight direction by John Scorsese. <br /> <br /> This disc is part of the Barbara Stanwick box that celebrates its centenary. <br /> <br /> Jopardy - is an MGM winner!
