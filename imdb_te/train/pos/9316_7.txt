Walter Pidgin Bryly Mason takes a criminal case in "The Unman Man" in a criminal case, starring in the 1951 film On Harding, Barry Sullivan, Kef√©e Brasley and Richard Anderson. The great belief in justice, a young man who was assassinated by Pidon, protects Rudi Vilch (Brasselli) and is acquitted of his innocence. Shortly thereafter, he realized that he was guilty of guilt and found that he had protected savings from his victim as well as other neighboring shopkeepers. DA (Sullivan) advised Ruddy to be a minor change, and to identify a person to eradicate organized crime. <br /> <br /> "Unknown Person" is a small, black and white movie. Somewhat provided. It is really a story of a good man who is prepared to do his god, justice, and in order to achieve it. And the most contrived part of all. I think before people like O.J., Mendente Brothers, etc., when people believe in the integrity of justice and advocates. <br /> <br /> Walter Pidgeon is doing a fantastic job - his beautiful, elegant attitude and declaration of voice show us a successful, self-confident person. The Pidgeon has an amazing life that spans 60 years but never really risen to superstardom. He is a solid actor who can talk about anything. By the time he led, he would enter into his thirties and avoid being a moderate idol; Nor did he have something to do with it; Or whether he started leading a second of a big female cast like Greater Graham. Hard to say. He gives honest and touching performance. <br /> <br /> Good movie with good acting.
