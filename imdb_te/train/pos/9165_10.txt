It should be the best introduction I've ever seen and that I'm very close to this book. Wonderful Timothy Dalton was the best Rochester I screen screening and tragedy, with Jayla Clark a delicate combination of strength, courage, shame and jen. The story (I'm sure most people know it) This is young and plain jane ire in the 1800s a teacher in a charity school, promoting her services as a governess in the newspapers. Mr Rochester is the mysterious and honorable employer of Atlee Young Ward Hall Attendance at the big building Thornfield Hall. For a few months, he falls in love with Jane, and in some cases he knows how Jane is falling in love with her while she is with her. The Thornfield Hall is yet to be discovered and is devastating when it effects. It's a moving and well-acting play with good places and beautiful costumes and plus I'm particularly impressive from Zelah and Timothy.
