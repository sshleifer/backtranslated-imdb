When I first saw the film, I thought it was more like an anime than the movie. The reason is that vampires make amazing adventures. Combats are many of the metrics movements, such as bullets moving fast and jumping too far. Another reason for the film is the adorable anime faces in the film. The way the gackt is his pouting faces or the way they work, is way too long. I think that's a good movie I watch. ^ _ ^ An action in this movie is 10 (gaatt and hyde are not 10). ^ _ ~ If you have Got and Hyde fans, you should see it.
