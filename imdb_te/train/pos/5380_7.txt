It is probably the fastest-speed and most action-packed in the German Edgar Wallace "Crimory" series, crossing the 60th thrillers of the past moves by Dr. Mubuzz films and Batman and The Man from the UNCLE. It re-introduced the worst villain from a previous movie that danced a beautiful monk's habit and breaks the neck of the victims with a deadly whip's knife. Lashpu is a throwback in a posh girl schooled with middle-aged professors, and with cops having cops holding their hottie-to-tutor securities at every opportunity, wonderfully politically-at times. Wallace based movie, then there is a definite link, the amazing giallo "What's Into The Solange?", Which also concerns their adults with corruption (and damaged?) By their students. It is very appropriate for the backyard of the monk, the master mind uses the Bombay-Trapped Bibles to deal with the deaths of the villain, and also maintains a reptile prisoner to delight his captive audience. <br /> <br /> Alfred Wohrer is always delighted and visually attractive to the series directors, and the real star of the sensational color cinematography show here. Monk appears with a raving scarlet caul and cloth, which tastes a lovely white whit. There is also a sparkling atmosphere for smeared students for one of the murder scenes and a Wahir-Friendly Mani Swimming Pool, which looks great as a shadowy backdrop. The trademark "kicker" hidden by the "Endy" card somewhere in the set of the last scene is very memorable here. Retro-music fans have a fine brass and iris score. <br /> <br /> Fans of this series will surely lose the role of ridicule in these next films. Instead, Chief Inspector Sir John Buffoon takes over, convinced he has acquired criminal psychology after taking some night courses. Unfortunately, Klaus Kinski also went to bigger and better things. By this point the Criminers have lost their offbeat curfew charm, and now have a more blatant pop-culture level, which makes it easier for uninterrupted viewers.
