A stellar cast, best script, and a gripping super-slick entertainment in the 1950s. At that time, dozens of RKO withdrew Classic Noirs. But the value of blue lameness is reflected in a war-time mood soon to provide the sunshine atmosphere of the Eisenhower era. Some of the last 40's are more than a decade from the noir wheel or the upcoming consumer over this sassy little comedy. <br /> <br /> Jim Blonds (Carry Grant) Madison Avenue. In his little daughter's words - he sells things to people who do not need them, and they can not get at prices. He is a good moneyman, but like thousands of others, he is tired of living in a narrow urban "cave". So, with their wife Mirna Lai, they will strike after their dream house in Connecticut rural areas. <br /> <br /> In nature's hands, they need to tell them more than bargaining and happier manner. <br /> <br /> There is not a lifeless line in the entire script. I do not know if the authors got an Oscar from Panama and Frank, but they should be. In fact, humor revolves around all the problems when people build the city on a large housing project on rural land. The booms grew rapidly as a mortgage, all of the most vulnerable types of construction work and the grant was difficult. In fact, no one is more ridiculous or disappointed than a grant, so when it seems to have its infernal mind in the lock room, it is better placed after another. Yet, unusually, the movie does not have a high-point comedy. Instead, it is taught that laughs can not reach the peak of any particular time. <br /> <br /> When you look back after 60 years, we'll see how the script views behind you. With their live-in work man, Blonds may not be a normal American family, but post-colonial migration from spacious cities is typical for spacious suburbs. And more suggestive job for customers coming over Blandings as an "man-man" who finds catchier paths to sell more "ham". More than anything, however, is the film's sunny optimism. Oh sure, the falters at times of feeling, yet Blandings have them by believing that if a good future is on the horizon a better future. In fact, life was improving over the course of the upcoming spell, so the film was echoing audiences day. <br /> <br /> The film makes a post-war ad campaign after the war. <br /> If you do not see it, hold it. Next time.
