Oh, come on, learn to have a little fun. When I was a child, Oh, this film was an Oscar-worthy. I felt absolutely silly. One of the best films I've seen. <br /> Now, it's a little stupid, but come on. If you enjoy the "fantastic adventure", you can enjoy the "Bogus Journey". Where's this before Dude, where is my car? This is only funny. As I said, it's a good time. It should not be taken seriously and if you experience the first, you should like "Bogus Journey". It's just a funny movie with some memorable characters. Only for your pleasure, let's go, watch it, and remember that it is a silly comedy. All of these. <br /> <br />
