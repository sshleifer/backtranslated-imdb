The Night Listener is probably not one of William's best roles, but he plays a somewhat odd but very interesting role in a very different film. I can assure you that you have never seen this kind of film before. Some may not like the slow speed of the film, but I think this is a great plus of the movie. This is definitely one of the top movies of 2006. It has an exciting performance in a feature film with great imagery and dramatic feeling. This movie is not a movie. This is not an imaginary image. I think it is a movie that has a hard time to determine what can be the result of it's secrets. It's no wonder film that has everything, but hell, it's a damn good and very original movie.
