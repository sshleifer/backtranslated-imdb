A story about this Shin-A, she moves from Seoul to Miligong with her younger son Jane after her son accidentally dies. Her husband is born here, and she has opened a piano school, but there are hopes of having some land with her earned money from death. If it was about the film, it probably was like the Hollywood film, falling to her local native and happy with her son at their new home. But it's not Hollywood. Her son was kidnapped and murdered because she had cash from her settlement. The grief process, attempts to go, attempts to clear his conscience of guilt, have all been awesome, and the main actress is amazing. The only exception, and this is to say, this is a disappointing picture. You have to know that you are going in. Shin-A wants you to go to his grief and get some pleasure. Again, it's not Hollywood, it's the Korean and Korean cinema, especially the drama, they pull any punches. Life happens to you. Hard acting, but sometimes hard to see due to the movements. If you continue, you will be rewarded. Turn it on.
