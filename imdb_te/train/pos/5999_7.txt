After reviewing a good movie from another writer / director Ryan Jaffrey, I consulted and read me, his film, The Care. I do not review movies, but heck - I love stories and could not see another. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, it is not surprising that Geoffrey does not know. <br /> <br /> The film has immense style and is unusual as it is directed by Geoffrey - especially maker of such a novelty films (this is his first film). The combination of exceptional selections of color created a great sense of atmosphere for music that is well suited for pacing and music. You're really pulled into the movie and it's a credit for making film. However, the thing I did not love is written 0. Though the basic idea is great, it's easy to end up. I really loved the ending where the surprise was more or the unexpected twist was there. However, from anyone who can not make such a professional image that gave his experience to this film, it comes well for his future. Good job.
