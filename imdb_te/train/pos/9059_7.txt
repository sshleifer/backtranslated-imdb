This is a good movie, good for you, a good family image. If you feel that the movie is a word for words in the book, you are very disappointed. "<br /> <br />" I was disappointed because I read the book a few times when I was in elementary school. About a new kid, he wages with a school bully and not a lot of bets.Billy had 10 worms or bully victories in a day. <br /> The acting is correct, the worst part of the film. Excellent on many things <br /> <br /> The storyline is as good as a movie but it sucks as a bookstore. <br /> <br /> Overall, A good family picture with some weak points I rate this movie 7/10.
