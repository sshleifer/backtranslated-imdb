I'm a big Beatles fan. My favorite beetle Paul and my least favorite is John. I already know a bit about the Beatles' music and the fact behind the break, as well as things like John Lennon's family and Paul's Band Wings. <br /> I'm not disappointed by this film. Although the story itself is fiction, most of the references made by the two musicians are very clear. Wherever Yoko Ono goes with him, Always Ono Ono, The Wings song "Silly Love Songs" is one of the year, and concert in the concert from the "Let It Be" album on Apple Studios. /> <br /> Actors John and Paul play a very good job. The voices were probably able to use a little more work, but they seemed to have acted as much as I had read two former Beatles. <br /> <br /> The ending at first was disappointing for me, but the more about it you liked the conversation between them, because you think more about it and especially appreciate it, how it really happened in real life. They also perform an amazing skit from "Saturday Night Live", which will be given $ 3,000 for performance at the Beatles show. (Others are compared to $ 220 million) Overall, I was disappointed with this film. Why Beatles broke up and it really gives a feel to why they never get back to you.
