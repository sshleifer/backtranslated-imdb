The film first appeared on the US cable for the first time since a year. It threw my little head away, I only 16 and it was the first new wave music I'd heard, an absolutely folk, rose to the window of the class. Hezel O'Connor's incredible look and attractive vocal performances, and Phil Daniels strict mysterious but soft cockney manager stole my heart. But I think my favorite character is Jonathan Pryce's socks player stingy. He was so out of place in the band and hazardous and pathetic, he just begged for sympathy. <br /> <br /> Okay, the movie is not Rose! But explaining with its limited budget and rebellious youth looking for a way to get out of Dell Queue, Britain's role of the early 80s is really amazing. <br /> I went to Britain a few years later and found that the weather I discovered was very reflective. <br /> If you get an opportunity, see it. <br /> <br /> It is a great movie with some great performances, and music is away from you. <br /> <br />
