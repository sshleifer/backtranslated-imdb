I was amazed. 428 of IMDB users who voted before me were surprised and feared that the film was rated above 7. - That's a c. If I could give FOBH a 20, I would be happy. The film has a high level of modern comedy Pantheon with Half Baked and Malrates, one of the most delightful films of all time. If you know _anything_ about rap music - you can see this !! If you do not know anything about rap music - learn something! And then see it! Comparisons of 'Spinal Tap' failed to recognize the inspiring genius of this particular film. If you liked Bob Roberts, you'll love this. Look at it and vote for it a 10!
