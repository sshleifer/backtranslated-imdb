I give it to about 10 to 10. Nevertheless, there are some chaos and mis-divisions that cause damage to the flow / continuity of the film. The storyline is great and well composed; You want to see this silently to be sure. The characters are complicated and the narrative of the story, where you expect to give only enough information to stop scratching your head, the picture where it all explained at the end. The animation is great and the fame is composed of a great combination of fatal and film noir, which is unlike anything seen in the animation. It's a black and white image and its silent dark in some scenes so it is better looking at T.V, or plasma. The film saves the song in the English version, but it is more convincing if some French vocals insist that its Paris, I have enjoyed more of French subtitles in English subtitles. Buying on a DVD or BlueRay is worth all its worth well! And you may also like to personally enjoy this movie; Walking Life & Ghost in a Shell 2 Innocence, it's just a personal advice.
