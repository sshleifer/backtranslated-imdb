Finally! Some are a good British comedy that is not centered around the Mockney Bank robbers or a distance from a TV series. The mental tale of a discovery that wearing in John Eyave's film biker gear. These three heroes are sensitive to the failure of one of the failures and the twins in a turn of their lives, the subtleties of the delicate and emotional trilogy together to combine riot comics. The chemistry between the three amygos makes for touching companion with hammering and hilarious dialogue and some classic humorous moments. This is part of the American Werewolf part in London, and part of Quadrophenia (but bike gangs, and Phil Daniels) as part of it. In fact, Phil Daniels's loving cheat Danini Delli Dealer is dell and I remind you with a scholarly and scientific commitment to medications. This film, especially those who have dabbled in psychoactive materials in the past, who will be associated with many moments in the film. Wonderful scene at a personal favorite Welsh corner shop, buying munchies while tripping on 'shrooms. This delicate comedy will warm your heart crows and you laugh loudly. And you do not even like to ride bikes or enjoy them. But you'll do that. Brilliant.
