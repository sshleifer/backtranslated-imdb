I enjoyed watching this movie about the Delaney sisters. I know about them, but that's all. The film opened my eyes for their bravery and courage. What a pair. What are their sacrifices to live in their own lives? It's not only African Americans, but all Americans. It is a history lesson and a sort of documentary and an entertaining film biography. The performance was much better and these two sisters saw many years of difficulty. Two sisters are different from each other. They are very loving and very tough family, high, perhaps impossible standards of perfection. Sadie's father is sad how he refused to allow his daughter to continue seeing her boyfriend due to possible misunderstanding. I highly recommend this movie and I am happy to be on the other day on television.
