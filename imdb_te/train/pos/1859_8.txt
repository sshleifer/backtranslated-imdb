Diesel Washington, directed by Delzel Washington, takes on a true story, making it a difficult story and screen, with the honesty that we look forward to from Washington's acting efforts, but now looks like this touch director. <br /> <br /> Recently we saw some of the worst results of children fallen by the crack of public protection. This story tells of the existence of a nightmare that has left terrible stains, but ultimately indicates the success of the human soul. <br /> <br /> We can not make much effort with so many attempts too close to editing these scenes but lacking the simplicity of other scenes that demonstrate such power. <br /> <br /> If the Academy ignores this film, it is insulting. The film pulls any punches and goes to the tale of the tale of the story, which is generally not beyond the scope of a novel. It's a tribute to the director. <br /> It's a mess, so tell it to see and see your friends too!
