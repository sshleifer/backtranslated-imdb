This film tells the story of history and compassion. The crime scenes are from the detailed descriptions of the main investigator's mental health. Anyone interested in criminal history must see. Interpol relations and agencies work together are great. Did not overdo it. I also recommend it to anyone interested in Russian history. The political party is how it works ... it's really lovely and frustrating. The settings are beautiful. It's been a while since the film was first seen. It does not decrease the effect. It's not overly dramatic or graphic, it goes adequately to the imagination, well, you'll see.
