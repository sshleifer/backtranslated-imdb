I should give her a move to a nearest perfect rating because the content is really great. As a previous reviewer commented, I do not know how this film appeared in the list of 100 below the IMDBs! It's totally ridiculous! Other films - Particularly shared with the theme of dance - it does not hold a candle with a mix of top lyrical, incredible acting and spectacular dance programs. <br /> <br /> It is easy to think deeply, and surprisingly realistic to complete the underlying story (not just winning a competition). None of these are the main characters, however, by 2-dimensional and finally, it's easy to invest them psychologically in the end. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> I would recommend this picture to dancing-lovers, for those who appreciate a sharp and well-played storyline. How Move is not accurate (no picture?), But it is certainly cut above the movies that use pretty faces to hide half-baked plot and / or non-material characters. Actors and settings in this movie make for a very realistic ride thanks to the enthralling equally equally exciting dancers!
