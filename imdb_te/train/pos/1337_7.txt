......... And you are Chori Chori Chupke Chupke. Do not make me wrong, this film is much less obvious than Pretty Woman (or not), but it's a new topic for Bollywood. This item has been approved, but it is far from Jis, Murder, and Julie. To tell the truth, the subject is displayed in a very clean manner. But the plot is the number of clues on it. The film premiered at the "movie" way. There are some very little plot holes. The film was taken while the Queen had her miscarriage. Otherwise the whole family led to the sequence. Acting is not good. Sometimes Salman Khan is impressed, and sometimes disapproves you. Over here he has given one of the best performances. His character is written very well, that you will greet each time that he will solve the problem. Rani Mukherjee is adequate. Throughout the film, you will feel a lot of feelings for her role, but she wanders through her jeans. Preity Zinta is right. In all three, she will give everyone a run for their money. How surprised she is when she is innocent Believe me, Madhubala is very far from your girl next door. This role is one of the reasons why I should raise her. The supporting cast belongs to the hawker family, where the plot does not have any significance, and here I found them to be acceptable. The songs are pretty cool. My favorite among them is the title song Dil Tera Mera Dil (hearts). Mehndi Mehndi (Henna) and Devon Wallon Ne (Look at the World's Site) both films fit perfectly. Preity cabaret number, Deyani (crazy), shortened. No. 1 Punjabi came in boring despite good dance. Otherwise the image is definitely worth a watch.
