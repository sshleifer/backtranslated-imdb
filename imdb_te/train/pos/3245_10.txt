I like this film for many reasons. I have a soft spot for films about criminal crime plot like TOPKAPI. I also enjoy pictures of those movies (such as TOPKAPI and BIG Dale on Madonna Street). <br /> <br /> Carbon Bernsen has met four losses over the years, and he decides that they can use him in a small Montana town in a bank bank robbery. But he did not give any details of the crimes, nor did they really know each other. Shortly after he sent them, Bernsen is arrested two New Jersey police (Ed O'Neil and Daniel Roebuck) who had escaped from the front and had a warrant to bring him back. Four years (Fred Guinney, Lou Diamond Phillips, Reuben Blades, and Will Russ) are in their captivity, as Bernsen is planning to do something. <br /> <br /> With the use of four cons of the first twenty minutes slowly, they have to trust each other because Gwynne and Phillips leave their own suspicions. At the same time, Bernsen is patiently waiting for us to wait for Ornell and Roebucks to wait for a moment - not the brightest existing bulbs. ఈ ఫలితం చలన చిత్రంలో ఒకదానికొకటి పరస్పరం పక్కనపెట్టిన రెండు ప్లాట్ ప్లాట్లు: బెర్న్సెన్ యొక్క పథకం ఏమిటో గుర్తించడానికి మరియు ఆపరేషన్లో ఎలా ఉంచాలో గుర్తించడానికి ప్రయత్నించిన నాలుగు కాన్స్, మరియు బెర్న్సెన్ అతని దురాక్రమణదారుల నుండి తన స్వంత స్వేచ్ఛను నిర్వహించడానికి ప్రయత్నిస్తుంది మరియు తన క్యాబిన్ తిరిగి (మరియు అతని ఆదేశం తీసుకోవాలని కోసం ఆశాజనక తన ముఠా కనుగొన  Nduku). <br /> <br /> There are many happy moments in the film, including the local sheriff Hoyt Axton's growing anger and angry third and small plot against the idiots from New Jersey. The scene of the Plain's Plain of Bronze Police that the Benson Police was fighting and frauding miles from places that he thought was at that moment (by MegaPhone, "Come out, We Were You!"), By Aklston and Roebuck, a house in the town, The switch is by our old four cons There are moments of unfortunate events that are not guaranteed at any time. Even if they do not start their car at a time, they will have to ride through the truck. Unfortunately, it carries a vehicle. <br /> <br /> The exploitation, including successfully disabling all police cars is a difficult time (Philips Specialty Cars) is a gem of timing, suspense, and comic results.The film is very entertaining That is, and is definitely worth looking at.
