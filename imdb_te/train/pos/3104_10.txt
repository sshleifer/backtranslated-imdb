This film is amazing. I did not expect to live up to all the hype but it did. Action like all Bourne films is fast, realistic and intense. You will also love this one if you liked the other two movies in the trilogy. The plot of the film is straightforward and there are plot twists that are not very unrealistic. Well, Julia Stiles's character in Italy's safe house is very distant after what was especially in Supremacy, but Bourne would be the only person in her "treadstone" who knew she was not dead and was probably the only person to be credible and driven to the right direction. Action characters and their reactions are what is happening around them. Born Bourne Kumar Butt, who I always loved about Bourne's films, but he has done so much as he struggles with good people as he does. They never never have audiences like idiots. <br /> <br /> All actors are proud of their performance. I believe that Damon will play Bourne in his sleep, and I believe that Jon Allen will receive his support from Supremacy, David Strattirn and Scott Glenn. I recommend this movie and trilogy. I will miss Franca Potente though.
