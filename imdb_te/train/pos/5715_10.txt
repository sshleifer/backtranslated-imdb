Karen goes to Emma's Japanese nurse as an alternate nurse, a nightly and nightly nightmare for a sleeping night. When she encounters a frightening ghost, Karen walks upstairs after hearing the sounds. She learns the secret of her home. <br /> <br /> It is very scary! The scenes are scary and scary! The characters are good. The settings are creepy. I love the whole plot! The end is astonishing! I was surprised at the scene where the little boy had been very louder to the man who disappeared from his sister. This is the most horrible film I've ever seen. I did not see the Japanese version. I recommend this to fans of horror. 10/10 and 5 stars!
