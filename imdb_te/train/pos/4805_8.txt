When I first heard of the film I thought it was like The Duchess (2008), but when I saw Young Victoria's first 30 minutes, I knew it was not just a solid movie. Almost everything in this film is great, the clothes are really amazing and the settings are also beautifully portrayed. <br /> The only thing that really let me down. Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada), starring Victoria's life and shows that she is a great actress and shows her the first Oscar nomination for her performance. Rupert Friend is a very fine Prince Albert, but he has a great chemistry with Emily Blunt. Paul Betani, as Lord Melbourne, was also great, but I imagined him much. <br /> <br /> Jim Bradbent and Miranda Richardson both support the characters but do not forget. <br /> <br /> This film is incomplete. <br /> <br /> I do not know much about changing the script in the script, but how would I feel about this film? <br /> <br /> Overall Victoria's early years have been a great show from Emily Blunt.
