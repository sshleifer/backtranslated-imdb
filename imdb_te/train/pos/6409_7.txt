I did not hear about Brusher before I saw it. He was his story and trainer who helped him become the first African-American Navy Navy. The story of the will power. The plot is well written and well developed throughout. What it looks like, is the simple underdog thing, and it does not have too many surprises. It's also very Hollywood, but hey, I do not know the actual man, maybe it's close to how actually happened. However, it is working with dramatic scenarios and disasters, and it is an inspiration for anyone to hear the words "No, not you" to talk about their lifespan. All of the acting performances are fantastic. Dinero and Gooding Jr. are always shining when they are on the screen. Rapaport is amazing, as well. The letters are well written, credible and consistent. It is well edited and has good cinematography. Product values ​​are high, which makes it very accurate for us to ship back to the 50s. The director and author of this movie I have seen, I see it more responsive now. There is a moderate amount of strong language, otherwise the attacks do not hurt. I recommend this to anyone who found interesting topic, and / or fans who have done it. 7/10
