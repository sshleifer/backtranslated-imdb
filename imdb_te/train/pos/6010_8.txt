"Zabrisky Point" (1970): It's interesting to me at a personal level, which happens in the same situation, with the same colleagues, in my own life? Counter-Culture movement at campus and at the end of the 60's. We follow the different stories, the two unrelated young people who are slowly put together. A young man in a Los Angeles tired of his ultimate, fake-revolutionary jabber in classrooms and dining rooms on his campus, and a young girl driving a Phoenix to see the other father, the owner, and the "establishment" job. The film is directed by our Italian directors (Michelangelo Antononi√≥n), and the self-righteous confusion of the era, psychedelic, "We all know us well, we will change everyone's good". Who is "revolutionary"? What does it really mean? Would you like to wear it like that? You want to "fly under the radar" but give notice in advance of your arrival? Are you planning your plans, and about the business of change, without needing group approval? "Zabriskie Point" is definitely a "period piece", but it's more - apples, uniforms, somewhat surreal film moves (after all, this is a movie by a man who gave us the amazing "blow up" of 1966) and the masterpieces of the era. This gives the choices for the Cultural Revolution and the Antonio (as it is supported), has a lot of anxiety to see what is needed for radical success. Because of this, it becomes a powerful, scary image that applies to anyone, anytime, anywhere.
