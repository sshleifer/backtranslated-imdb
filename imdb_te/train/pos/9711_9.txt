Well, I learned that there is a very frustrating and surprising performance than "Little Britain" and I like it! "The League of Gentlemen" is a sick British comedy of all the awful, frantic and disturbed small town in the UK. This place makes Dubly and Craggy Island (from "The Vicar of Dibble" and "Father Ted") beautiful! The format of the show is very much like Little Britain, all of which is centered around towns of this western town. These two episodes have the same episode and the episode again and some clearly inspired "Little Britain" (especially the job in the job class). But the show has a sick and ruthless quality that separates the show from all shows, although the show is different because it is quite similar to "Little Britain" (which is not a performance for children). In particular, there are themes recurring in cruelty and serial killings. <br /> If you do not guess, it is not a performance for children, easy or afflicted people, they liked it. Of course, you really need a love that is too thick skin and max awesome to enjoy this. Believing is ridiculous and very abusive - you have to look to believe it.
