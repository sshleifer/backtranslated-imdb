Well I'm not as personal as rap, but I still found a black hat fear of fear. I'm sure some of the jokes did not come in, but I know some people, and it's a lot of fun to laugh at me after laughing. I'm a big fan of the backbone tap, obviously I should check it out. It is sometimes derived from the spintal tap, sometimes blatant, but the film is still on the original, intelligent, and funny satire. My personal affection: "In the back of slaves, there were no hats to protect them from the sun, so at the end of the day they were very tired of the rebellion and now we have hats."
