Domino is a great movie. It's about a young lady named Damino Harvey (Keira Knightley), who becomes a bounty hunter because of her frustration with her lifestyle. She begins with two fellow hunters (Mickey Rourke & Edgar Ramirez) and adventures. The script is good. Most down-to-earth and tone of realistic film. <br /> <br /> The problem I had for the film was to focus on a variety of things they could do, instead of the Domino character. </ P> <br /> Kiera Knightley has acted badly. She shows proper anger and dedication at this show. Mickey Rourke follows his Oscar-winner performance with another harsh-man performance in 'Sin City'. Edgar Ramirez does not do anything except Spanish to speak and stare at Kiera. Delroy Lindoi gives a good assistant performance. Although she surprised me in a special scene, Lucy Liu has a great chemistry with her scenes with Kira Knightley. <br /> <br /> But the best thing about the film is to direct it. Tony Scott's fast-paced style really brings life to the film. Cinematography is great, I have never seen it. It takes a regular movie and puts it on acid. All blacks are black, whites are brighter, and it has a kind of green glow. <br /> <br /> If you like Sin City and Fine On Fire, you'll have a Domino.
