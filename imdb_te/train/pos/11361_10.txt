Years ago I saw this film, its impact did not leave me. Stephen Ray's depiction of an inventor is deep and moving. His deaths in deaths are touching. Each of the cast members is trying to provide a way to provide a great deal of excellence from Sutherland and coordinate his efforts to provide x to the problematic citizen. Every day we blow up with stories of mass killers, I think of the tiring work of the movie and people trying to find the killers.
