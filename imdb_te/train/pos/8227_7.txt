An interesting thriller featuring Paul Winfield as a detective in a murder case. Paul Winfield is an actor who has cast out his roles with such a convenience, which is difficult to say about man acting. Perhaps the voice / commentator of "City Confidential" is familiar to young audiences, Winfield ends his life with a lesser image; But as always, Winfield shines. A treat to watch. <br /> <br /> Erica Eliniak is fine, Erica Eliniak, looks nice but leaves a lot to want in the acting department. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Paul Winnipield is a breathtaking thriller that should not be missed by fans. A good telefilm to help send Paul Winfield into celluloid. No actor. He misses.
