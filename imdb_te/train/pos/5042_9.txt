It's great when describing what's captured for this movie. This is a good thriller. Well shot. Some shots appear exactly as the Storyboard version, while the performance of Bill Paxton is strongly believable. <br /> <br /> There are some shots that really look good and show some realistic imagery of Paxton. <br /> <br /> It's a great story with some great twists at the end, many of them, all believable, all the fun and the best, and they are obscure to make real twists. <br /> <br /> In the film, the child actors are very great. <br /> <br /> Nickelodeon is often cautious with children who have played with the characters they have played, but both of these children do a good job. <br /> <br /> This film is not painful. It's not too horrible. But it is very creepy.
