Love Trap Independent film "Watch". When I sat down to watch the movie, I met low expectations, but I left a blessing. The story is poetic, genuine, and creative. Each sequence of the writer revolves around you and is associated with real characters that each scene can be identified with each other. The film was reflected in my life and I loved it. This film is really expressive of emotion, not love, action. I was impressed with the quality of cinematography and the soundtrack of the movie. Overall performance exceeded my expectations. I give the film two big thumbs up and recommend it to everyone of all ages and all backgrounds.
