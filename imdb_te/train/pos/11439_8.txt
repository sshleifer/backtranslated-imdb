OK - up to 2 versions of this image. John Corti and Bill Cooper (George just producer - he really did not have such money in such a film - just helped with the money) 2 people were involved - the 'Adult' version was made possible by Bill Coater. John Corte did not like or approve this version (which was backwards backwards). Thanks to Ladd's films, they did not promote the film and threw their advertising cash for "The Right Stuff", hoping it would take over; And that did not happen. SO, this film is not really possible. When "Twice" changed it to the cable (HBO) - they showed reels with the bill's version and threatened to claim if John was no longer showing (did you see that 'adult' version was not too long?). Showtime got a 'clean' version. The version on video tape and laser-disc was passed by John (having more power than an approved bill). If the 'adult' version is really good and makes more sense, it's really pity. But it is very suspicious that the DVD (or any other format is small bootleg) will be released in that version. Sorry to disappoint everyone. I know this information since I was twice the head of the Times Fan Club Time Fan Club (and still has a lot of stuff from the film - it has a letter-boxed version of the 'adult' version, but it's stolen - it now has a partial HBO copy). 8 stars for 'adult' version - 5 'clean' version. Any other questions, just ask.
