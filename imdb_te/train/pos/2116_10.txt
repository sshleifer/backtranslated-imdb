Have you been so beautiful The reason that everything works well is that one of the actors group feels really interact and has an impact on each other's lives. It is a "love" of James Stewart and Margaret Salvann, who is an unrelated person who is anonymously interacting with pen friends. But there are roles supporting and romantic comedies (including a recent update of "You've Got Mail", "Shop") but they are not just whipping up in support of the two leads and their needs. Everyone is a critical part of the attractive attractive part of Ernest Lubitz. Frank Morgan, who is one of the most heartwarming scenes in the history of cinema, usually searches for the Christmas feast and searches humblely. Must see! **** out ****
