I'm not a fan of watching this movie, but my gem called me and I had a free Imperial screening pass and I just tagged it for Eva Longoria and Jason Biggers's antics. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's like a hybrid of how to lose a person in 10 days and look like a paradise. A romantic comedy with moments I expect. The film is too small (about 85 mm) but it is enough to tell the whole story, build some character development and have a happy ending. An interesting plot to follow the whole idea of ​​a ghost haunting its former husband. <br /> <br /> All of this has done a good job of putting the sarcastic and Paul Red and a supporting cast (especially Jason Biggers). If I give this film a low rating, I have a good amount of laugh. Hey is a chic movie and I am reviewing this film from a man's remorse, if Adams has reviewed this film and given ideas about it would be more of a fair fight.
