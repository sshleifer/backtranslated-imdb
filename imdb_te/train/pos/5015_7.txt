The original is a masterpiece. Not so well. Beautiful cinematography I think not. The movie is terrible, but it is not better than average. Because the main story dealing with the most unethical teens is more focus on the romance and why this is ... because we have not really said that we should have had to scrap the surface instead of primarily with it. " Some parts must be omitted or more important for the plight of the two main characters. Couple times I was wondering if the author / director was a fan of George Lucas's classic American graffiti. The movie's fan is not wrong, but I'll come to make your movie like this sometimes! The worst part is that Madsen Amik has such a small piece, and I am doubling it !! She is one of only one or two lines that attempted a southern slang. (Listen to a good deal, even though her character is from California! DOH !!) Maybe her star might have been on others and we would have a more mildly noisy movie. Oh well, what can you do when the director is not just a director and an artist? Very bad. Overall I give this a B- and it's a little generous' cause I'm partially amy mim.
