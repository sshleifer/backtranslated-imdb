I usually love these 1930 Mystery / Police Charlie Chan films, which is no exception. However, something is wrong with this image. One last attempt to switch from the cerebral holo movies centered around the plot contrivances to a salad bar spoiled by comedy relief as a throat-foot relief. There is a kind of typhuff buffoon somewhere in a monstrous English role playing the detective, and other characters appear to be a source of humor. This plot may seem odd or bare to us today, but back to the epochial archaeological finds is not unlikely, but the general existence.
