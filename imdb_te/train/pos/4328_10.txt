I purchased this version of the DVD to match the current BBC 2005 version (which is good). In 1985, Arthur Hopecraft adopted, Tinker Tyler Soldier for Spy For TV and this year (2005). I remember a great performance, especially from rig and eelit, and music. (The music in the 2005 version was very low, but most said.) Just a few points to pick up other commentators: Richard Carsten is not Esther's, Ada Claire's boyfriend. Esther was not. Charlie Drake Crock has never been played in the eighth edition or played Toby Estheres on TTSS! Crock appeared in the 2005 version by comedian Johnny Vegas. <br /> <br /> The two versions of Dickens are a respectable and admirable adaptation of the great novel. Now read the book! It's not perfect, and at times of pity you can wince, but I do not cry You heal - and laugh!
