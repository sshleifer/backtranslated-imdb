I am very surprised at this movie. The great acting (especially John Cassini), the great comios, the interesting and special direction - the great writing (some of the "inner" jokes I received, others I did not - perhaps because of the actors who spoke above). I rented to see Jeffrey Make (he's a little disappointed, a little time, blink and you'll miss him!) But this film is extraordinary entertaining. Before returning to Netflix I'll see it again. I think the actors and the wanna-actors will enjoy this film completely. The ending is somewhat predictable but they wish they'd done something different (and more positive). This film is not good except in the "Festival" market. I suggest to anyone who loves acting biz.
