Cognitive beauty is a beautiful young woman who treats wildly through her wicked stepfather parents and steps. One day, the prince will manage a ball to honor, but it is not possible to go to Cinderella because her stepmother and staircase do not allow her. With the help of her fairy godmother and her friends, she went to the ball with a warning to return to her midnight home. At the ball meets her handsome Prince Charming. When the clock stops midnight, she goes home, she leaves behind one of the glass slippers. Her true identity is revealed with the help of her friends. <br /> <br /> 56 year old Cinderella released a huge success at the box office, which continues to this day's attractive audience. It contains a well written script. The letters are memorable. Songs like "A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes", "So Is Is Love", and great "BBBD-Bobby-Boe". This is my favorite movie growing up, and it does not lose its charm. True Disney writing! Recommended. 10/10 P.S. The best way to appreciate this movie is with the latest DVD releases, movies, deleted scenes, music video, vintage radio programs and the restored prints of the film!
