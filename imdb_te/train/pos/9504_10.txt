In the late 90s and early 21st century, the Mexican film was very poor after Mexican film's golden age, with great films like La Le de Herods, Bazo California, Amors Peros, You Tuu. Mama Tambin and, in fact, El Coronel No Taine Quien le Escraba, appeared. El Coronel ... is a fantastic film that rebuilt the classic story by Gabriel Garcia Marquez who replaced the magic realism elements and replaced it with the crude reality that lived in Mexico, not just people like Colonel, but their pensions, but more than half of the Mexican population, who live in absolute poverty .
