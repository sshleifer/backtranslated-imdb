Prior to this, the flawed "Slaughterhouse Five" was the best. But this screen adaptation of "Mother Knight" is very truthful and keeps the intention of comedy, mystery, and tragedy. Fortunately it is the "breakfast of champions" of the Hollywood-Dude or Idiotlate The Law film. Another good thing about this film is that the book does not need to be followed (I think for Slaughterhouse for Yourself). It's also probably not true of the champions of breakfast but they have done such a bad job that they're just better off reading the book and seeing the movie! Nick Nolte has done a wonderful job in this movie.
