Kurishi was certainly not blessed with films that would support the quality of his work. Recent habits have destroyed great writing like 'intimacy'. But the mother overcomes his previous incarnations, my beautiful laundry also covers. A middle-aged woman overcomes the widow-hood through her dirty relationship with her emotionally weak daughter boyfriend. You believe that it represents the quality of acting because it is a limited gift of writing. And in Daniel Craig we deny the audience to question why we always think of a sagging grandmother with a young stud bedding having a stuffing, brush, anti-throat hero. Beautifully filmed, the film has failed in a weak picture of peripheral characters, but the unexpected lust is a study, a winner.
