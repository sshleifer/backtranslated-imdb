I have personally seen several Disney movies in my life, yet no one of them agrees with bad snacks and broomsticks. Although I personally did not live through the live-action with animation, it was an improvement in trying to wear people as animated characters. The film removes three bodies from two world wars sent to the country to remain silent and socially inconvenient. I have to say that casting is brilliant. Angela Landbury made a perfect Miss Price, and David Thompson liked the amusing lover of great interest. Endings always surprise me and this is no exception. I do not know if it's deliberate but it is not happy or sad. The dialogue is not great, but it's designed to be designed with a kid image, it's alright. Overall, I have worked with ten out of four, ten dialogs of ten, ten nine castes and ten dresses.
