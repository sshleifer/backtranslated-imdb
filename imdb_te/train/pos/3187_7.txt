A few years ago, I purchased several $ 1 DVDs that each had two movies. One of them has three Broadway Girls (The Greeks Had a Word for an Alternative Title for Them) and this is one, Happy Go Lovely. It's basically a musical comedy that concerns mistakenly involving one of the hitching dancers who is riding in Scotland and riding a millionaire's car. Vera-Ellen is the dancer and wow, no legs! Seeger Romero takes a chance after her producer, the original women's leaves, because I mentioned her millionaires. And while looking for David Neven Vera-Ellen, she was mistaken for a journalist to interview, but was stopped by Romero. What I mentioned may be confusing, but if you're ready to check your brain when looking at this charmingly screwball comedy with sensitive musical numbers (mostly) makes sense. Exquisite Mrs. Vera-Ellen performed. Romero is a bit insane here, but Nwend is ridiculously smoother throughout. The print that I saw is of age and examines the fact that it is in the public domain. And Vera-Ellen makes her lines pretty well because she's not really an actress. So in that note, I highly recommend the happy lover go for the old buffalo movie buffs of old-fashioned music.
