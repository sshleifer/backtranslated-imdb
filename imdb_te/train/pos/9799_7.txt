Enjoyable Batman animated film. Not equal with "Return of the Joker" or "Mask of the Phantasam", but not solid. I liked how the movie was like Bathmoon. There is a good twist. Good action scenes. I always thought that Batman cartoons were good after the Batman live live action sequels. Here the trend continues. <br /> 10 to 7.5
