It is very often a movie can literally laugh at the whole audience, and five minutes later tears fill their eyes. Most movies try to do this, but some of the emotional effects of the film are presented to some people. Adam Sandler practically puts you with his hot and often violent expression, but you can laugh even when the shadow of his past is not pulling him off. I am going to destroy anything, but a scene must be watering your eyes and iris. Many men do not feel normal when watching this movie. Don Cheadle is another great performer, but outside of Sandler. Liv Tyler and Jada Pinkett Smith offer solid performances, but none of the two most popular characters. Sandler's humor is still there, which really saved this image from demeaning the line line. <br /> <br /> Many people have to laugh, but do not think you're staying for a long time, because it comes back hard without warning. <br /> <br /> Every emotion that has a human body, but I will cut this small. I feel that I do not need to tell anyone else. Help me to see this movie and take the time. If you wait until you get on DVD, it is 100% worth. A deeply moving picture is sure to lay tears in your eyes and a smile on your face ... unless of course you are a soul that is heartless.
