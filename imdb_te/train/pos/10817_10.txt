Well this movie is one of the humorous scary movie I've seen so far is probobly one. The effects are great for you to laugh, and acting, let's say its no Mel Gibson. But Gary Browning, who plays police officer, is very bad, he is good. I do not know how to do it but he does this movie with self movie. If horrible and slash movies are at your same time, you must see it's bloody and funny. The killer image.
