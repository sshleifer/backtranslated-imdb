Although the main story is thought to be in Morocco, the film was filmed in a very hard budget in Rome for 18 days. But they can break their cards, actors and crews play them with a brilliant skill and commitment so that as a result I have found two of the toughest and endearing results. Nicolaus Coaster-Waldo offers a great presentation as a bad guy. The script and direction provide some gems. If you like the movie or not, the title character depends on your judgment on Alexandra Stepden. Other critics have suggested that Staden's errors are modesty blaze. They may have a point, but I found her commentary is the happiest and most fitting. Moderation to overcome terrible imbalances by discipline, underlying talent and courage. Staden looks to be doing the same here.
