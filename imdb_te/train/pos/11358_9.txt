Poor DVD Video Quality I replaced the film with 9 instead of 9. It may be very good, this film is worth it. <br /> <br /> It's the cinematic simultaneous themes that really covers many people. If you do not like movies about serial killers, but fascinated by the shocking official culture in the former Soviet Union, this film must look anyway. <br /> <br /> I've called it "Lambs of Silence" for many reasons. The way the serial killer was shot, was very well on Citizen X. You see many details of his personal life, because you are "traveling" with the killer, the source of his constant anger and sexual despair. <br /> <br /> "I told him I was a portrait of Henry-serial killer". If you are fascinated with that image you should definitely take a look at Citizen X.
