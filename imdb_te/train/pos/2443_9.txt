The film may not have a Catholic church in good light, but the story is based on real events. Unfortunately everything in life is good along with religion and Rossi. Sometimes people and groups can do the right thing at the time, but they will not be able to repeat as they once did. "Love Divided" tells a family story, yes it has religion, but really the story is about a family and the ability of the family to happen with them. This story by Sean, the scene is real, but it is not true if you see news stories from that point of time and what events can not handle any events. Helpful side of the family is a way. There are two churches that are incorrect, and the Protestant church and struggle do not have to speak to the mother to respond to the violence of the Catholic Church and the violence and to her husband and his priest to keep the rest of the family in the first place. In this case both leave the family down. I believe this film will do a good job of showing this fight both in the church and in the family. What shape or form does not separate any Catholic skin, only shows how a person can influence how the ideas of the religion of an event change and how a person becomes more effective.
