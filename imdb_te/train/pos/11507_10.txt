I remember the original series because it was the reason for an extraordinary mix of humor and horror stuff. Kolchak is a strongly stiff newspaper from big city reports Ben Hugh School, and his sandy decision and wise-asset behavior make it the most visually appealing episode. My personal favorite "Spanish Moss Murders" is the original storyline. Louisiana Buuu participates in a sleep research experiment for poor, problematic Cajun youth from the country. Something goes wrong, and he dreamed of a mammalian life in the dark folklore of his youth. The evil manifestation of his dream is that the dreamer kills those who have done injustice and cruelly kill them. Police Captain Joe "Mad Dog" is too much to investigate and obscure the Kolchak, poorly understood of Siska (in a grumpy Keanan Wynn article) and the head of the sleeping researcher who played the second city's sophisticated founder, Severn Dorden, was poorly understated. The unfortunate humorous, ragged finish takes place in the Chicago sewerage system, and highlights the range. Kolchak never got any better. Timeless.
