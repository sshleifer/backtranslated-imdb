The film is like the 1950s version of Ettore Scola's Bretty Sporty e Kattivi. Less sex and less realism, but a story with great humanity and warmth. I can not call this new-realistic picture. It is very sentimental and is a fairy tale, and it is classified as funny, although it is seriously ridiculous (like Chaplin or 1930-comedy). It is difficult to resist, except for a simple Italian, very emotional, and a stone cool guy. Centimentalism is discouraging, but this film is not a realistic play. It is not an artwork like an Amber de or The Bicycle Thief. <br /> <br /> It is a lovely, delightful comedy with good music. <br /> <br />
