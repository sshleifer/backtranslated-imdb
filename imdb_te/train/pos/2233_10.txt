I first saw this movie in the 1980s and now in 2006, this film is still one of the best movies I have ever seen! I would like to see someone in this movie. You can not forgive. It has acted well, so real and never dull moment ever. Acting is amazing and the place looks like you are. From the beginning to the end, this film is kind of you will lose your attention. The actress does an amazing job featuring the girl who escaped from this terrible plane crash in Amazon and shows how she managed to survive in amazon alone. It is unbelievable that such situations can not survive. This movie is very beautiful. The fact that this true story makes the film more interesting and thinks that a little girl can survive from these tests. I can watch this movie again and see again and I'm never tired. This is so much fun because I have hundreds of movies! I would say this is probably my favorite movie and the best I have ever seen!
