In a poor village in Mexico, Colonel (Fernando Luzan) resides in an old home with his Osamotic wife Lola (Maurisa Parades). Shortly thereafter, their son Augustine's death mourns. Colonel was recovering for a war pension in the war against the Catholic Church for nearly twenty seven years. However, for political reasons, the current government wants to forget this old war. Without any possession or money, but without a worthy gamecock, they struggle to survive with the assessment of the receipt letter from the government, payment of recognition and delay pension from the law. This slow and touching film reflects the social and economic situation of large retirees in third world countries. In Brazil, most retirees have survived 80,000 dollars per month. Colonel commitments in the story have to pay for his son a cemetery, otherwise he is rarely buried. The spectacular performance of the cast in a very sad story that is reality in poor countries. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): (`Noo s escr O Coronal ') (Do not submit to Colonel) <br /> <br />
