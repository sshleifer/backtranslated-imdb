This is one of the best movies to watch in the River Runs Through It Theater, so the credit for cinematography is really valuable. Every gesture and smile and meaning is acting amazing and poor. Brad Pitt gives a brilliant performance and Tom Schckert is a powerful writer. The river moves like a river, and you have to be ready to follow it by ebb and streams, but eventually it's worth it.
