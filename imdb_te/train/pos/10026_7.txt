This project is not complete without Kirsten Miller. However, I would definitely recommend the awesome beauty and talent called Miss Miller. Other actors seemed to play only for her strong performances. Wagner's dismal attempt to honor the film was a bit disappointing, but some of his scenes were not removed from entertainment. Most of my criticisms are written and story lines, and the meeting team has a heroic task to save what a disaster needs. Attractive Miller delivery and time are impeccable and reliable. She plays a fine line between assertive and biscuits, but she is a constructive engineer who is never objectionable. I wanted as much as I saw on the big screen, but I had to rent a while before it was lost.
