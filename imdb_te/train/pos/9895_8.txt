A group of prominent high school pupils make him a ruthless joke on the nardy marty (a sympathetic performance by Simon Swatchmoor), which makes him secretly awkward. Five years later he returns to a high school that is now inferior and abandoned for the gang reunification. In fact, Marty, who is angry and vindictive, appears to have dressed a young woman's dress with a terrible vengeance on her harassment. Writers / directors Mark Ezra, Peter Litton and George Douglas trot out all endearingly corny clich√©s that make this 80's slice'n'dice body count a lot cheesy fun: fake jump scares, prodling steady shots, a severe storm, an overly group , Nice smearing of unsatisfactory female nudity, is totally ridiculous "what hell?" The supernatural climax, the fierce make-up f / x, and one of those lovable bloated "it's just a terrible dream" fake out but endings. Furthermore, extensive assassination parts epitomize delivery of gargantuan goods: the topology of the crystals includes the poisonous beer, an acid bath, the crushed under a large tractor, and the jealous sex between the two people. Third British Cult Horror Siren Caroline Munro was the first American film to be the most amusing act of American teenager. This cast offers a great performance, especially as stand-out like the foul-pumpkin yellow stella like Carmine Ennaccone, Smartlake Rinkler Skip Pollock, Billy Hartman's depleted Maco Muffhead Frank, and Donna Yeger. Co-producer Dick Randall has a comic comic as Munro's terrible agent Manny. Harry Manfredi's mood and ratling music rarely recycle from his "Friday 13th" scores. Alan Pudnini's slick cinematography makes the trick. Good, good.
