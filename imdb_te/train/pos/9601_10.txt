Darius Goes is a wonderful documentary about a teenager (Weems) with his 11 friends taking him to a cross-country expedition to see if West Duchen muscle weakness, and "Wheel of My Ride" repelled out of his wheelchair. I have seen this film recently at the Sun Screen Film Festival. It played twice during the festival. This film is an amazing story about the human soul, and the spirit of Weim's friends. I often do not say about these movies, but after looking at this movie, I'm thinking of something to do with the reason. Each festival was involved in the film, which won some kind of award. It is at Tribeca Film Festival, going to London and Athens, Greece. I'm not surprised if the film goes all the way to the Academy Awards. It is out of control. If anyone has the opportunity to view this movie, go wherever you go! Take as many people as possible and go! It went to New Orleans for a Film Festival, later Atlanta and Palm Beach, FL. Darius comes from Georgia, so I think the tickets will sell quickly for Atlanta performances. Please see this movie! DGW (talk about this) <br /> <br /> Kish
