I was a little girl (and my father owned a video store), which was one of my favorite films. I have never heard of it ever since, and in the background of Dan Bluth's other good films I forgot. I was able to track it a few weeks ago, but I was amazed again. The animation set in New Orleans in 1930 was delightful and songs were memorable. If you have enough attention, there are some chaos in the sequel, but they usually do not get rid of the storyline, which you will smile (and even if you love the animals it's even slightly smoothed). Characters are believable (as well as for younger viewers who have grown up too). Two feet, and for those who have not seen for a while, you're definitely worth a watch.
