In the same shop (James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan) warm, sweet and unusual attractive film about two contraindicators, one of which is carrying a romance through the mailbox without any knowledge. Ernest Lubitz has a syrup centimetality and calls for his low-key, useless performances on his actors. As a result, you almost fell in love with them. <br /> <br /> This is a bleak weakness I am grateful for. Loneliness is a major theme that clearly represents the role of the owner and manager of the shop, and Frank Morgan is a brilliant actress. He finds that he is being stabbed by his wife, and he finds that the successful life he has created is not enough to stay alone when he is not a partner to share. This is more difficult between Stewart and Sullivan, since they are approaching other non-invisible people, everyone is considered self-aware before they meet. In fact, I know that we'll be doing everything right out, but if the film is not realistically realistic, you do not forget the tedious feeling. <br /> <lbwitchfo completes his film, filling it with a crackerjack cast containing chemistry's boatloads. <br /> <p> <br /> </ p> <p> /> Grade: A +
