When I saw this film, I was amazed by any great movie. I think this is a 10 star rating. I'm sure the film will always be in my Top 5. <br /> Acting is amazing. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are their best. I do not think anyone would have a better job than Kate. <br /> If it's a rainy day, you can not tell exactly what's going on for rent. You all love acting, special effects and much more. <br /> If this movie is not rented or bought now! <br /> <br /> Do not worry. <br /> <br />
