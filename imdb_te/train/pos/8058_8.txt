Many people here, I started trying my patience through this movie. In the end, I really have some tears. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ Older aged people through old age learn to overlook old times. But it is not very accurate. Do you see what the main part of the story is for the audience before you, "slow parts"? They looked at me and found the parallel and background interest there. Modern audiences, post-Spielberg, are in a constant state to look forward to two climes shortly after seeing the old images. This is the inflation issue of modern films. Well, this is not going to happen. These films do not need to apologize; When you see them you have to adjust your expectations and personal rhythm. At this time, the difference between avatar and informers is the difference between Euripides and rented travel. Think about it for a minute or two. <br /> <br /> The "exciting part" for most modern audiences, begins with the IRA tribunal scene and will arrive in the last two minutes, if you are at all or at the time of the board, your heart will be torn out. This is not some high-tone universal abstract plea for apology; It's a plea for a little grace, since it's a smooth, and feel sorry for the big lummox. It's personal, and that awkward naked appeal. Being mad at Zipo, he was bored, thinking that it was the most brilliant character of all time, and eventually you won him with a scene of a girlfriend who begged you to ask another woman to run easily. <br /> <br /> The film may be sentimental, but some are not guilty for pushing the charges here. <br /> <br /> There is one thing related to life and death here, and as long as it takes a lifetime proposal for a customer, it is intense in very serious matters. And if you read that it's not 10 in 10, it's yours on your own and in some measure. We have more than anything done to us in 1935, and even more rapidly, we have more demand - just yesterday, really - we can do it as easily as possible.
