I really enjoyed the first episode and I was more excited. Before the offense was a little too soft (it's almost astronomical and terribly breathtaking or not flat) but the romance angle was superbly beautiful. Definitely will be watching again! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " The actress who plays the role of assistant / waitress (very sweet and bubly) is pretty cool and looks great and it is nice and painful. <br /> Check it out.
