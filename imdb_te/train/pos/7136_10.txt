Before I read the Michael Magorian book, I saw the film and I enjoyed both. The movie is much closer to the eye than this book. The film touches the deepest part of the human soul and never goes. Many people use this masterpiece as soon as possible and I encourage you as soon as possible. I will give you ten stars.
