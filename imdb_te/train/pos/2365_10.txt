Jeff Wincott is not a hunk, he can kick butt! This film is some of the best martial arts moves I've seen in a long time. Well, so perhaps BridgeGate Nielsen was not the first person I wanted to appoint as a brutal politician, she did a great job! And do not forget that the film is played by Wincott Marshall Arts / Stuntmanman Karen Shepard. So she is not Cynthia Rothrock, who cares ?! She is not good, otherwise it's not good! (Just check out her fight scenery at the end of the movie, one word: OUCH !!). My view is to buy the film as soon as possible, because if you do not see, you're really missing out on great martial arts action.
