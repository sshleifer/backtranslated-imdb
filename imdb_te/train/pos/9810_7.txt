Albuquerque is a picture that contains all the elements of a class except class, which necessarily belongs to a class B or C. It is acceptable at the time of the making of the film, the color in the west, but now it looks just too old. However, it is fun for those who love old westerns, the original color and sound are put on the DVD release recently. Gabby Heis is a good follower, Lone Chaney always understands, and Randolph Scott is a bit more happy than usual. In Albuquerque you can see something reminiscent of the city, but the town shown here can be anywhere.
