The film may be silly and unusual in the hands of fewer actors than Claude Colbert and Robert Ryan. But, along with these two experienced nominees along the way, I found "Silent Fury" a very exciting and pleasant little mystery. Stranger, who argued that Colbert had already married, had been disturbed by their marriage and that he was the best guy at the wedding, and that there was some plot against her in the work. Colbert, Ryan, and her lawyer went out to condemn marriage's claim before strangers, which further strengthened the allegation that she was already married. Although it is not the most difficult to identify the person who is the main "badie", it is very fun when the heroine's intensity and speed increases. In all, two well-known actors have a good supporting performance with fine performances, a great mystery film and a good alert, Paul Kelly.
