In 1943, a team of RAF officers, including Eric Williams, decided to escape the campus using a gymnastic woolen horse from a POW camp. In 1950, he decided to portray his account, which began the fantastical British Film Zener - Military Prison Camp story, which reached the Apogee in Danger Wilder (1959). <br /> <br /> Wooden horse is one of the silent films I have ever seen. There are no great dramatic movements, but the stable storyline is not ultimately the way the story is more susceptible to drama, jump cuts or jacked (about what's happening!) Because a climax builds up with more tension. <br /> <br /> Leo Glenn, Anthony Steel and David Tomlinson leads to low-level key characters extras and (I suspect) non-actors. Without exception, all are constantly mono-tonal and silent. They keep emotion from their characters. <br /> <br /> For a long time, until recently, I suspect the former service will revitalize their combat times as 'officers and gentlemen'. <br /> <br /> This illness does not remove any dramatic tension. On the contrary, unlike most wartime films, the story did not end the hedgehog: and lastly grabbed me alone.
