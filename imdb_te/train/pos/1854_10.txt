With the development of a crucial eye for the film and with the love for a good film, I went to see my breath symbolically Anton Fischer. While I am an undefeated fan of Denzel Washington - his expertise as an actor and his role in the government; I am an honest enough fan to accept (too few) times when he does not hit too much mark in a movie or two. And I might be wrong about that - after all, I'm not an actor. But it's different - Denzel loses his career experience, and is a film - a child misuse of the guide, one of the sensitive issues that man has known. By directing, less. And it improved the image to indicate that it could successfully deliver a man's success. <br /> What I have seen is that, with a different audience, the viewer lives with a brief but honest eye as a young man, the youngest of which is a living hell, but it's all succeeding. The film did it - and the dry eye of any color on the theater proved that. Someone will take to know the stuff in this movie to know when the truth is provided. When you do not experience it, you can act as a talented filmmaker to tell you the story. And if he did not attract the audience and emotionally react to the audience, the filmmaker did his job without compassion. In any movie. Black, white, purple or polka dots. Makes a good movie. Bravo, Denzel Washington, Derek Luke, Joy Bryant and Anthon Fischer - you've really won.
