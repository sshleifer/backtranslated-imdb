I usually think that film festival comedies are usually "aggressive", and I think any intentional comedy will be summarized at the cost of simplicity of characters. Unusual about the Big Bad Swim, the director managed to maintain the integrity and development of his paintings when appearing in the scene loudly in the scene. Part of the sharp work of the DP is also a sophisticated, rarely seen in an indie movie and rarely in a comedy. Special Note Here: Paget Brewster's Amy is a math teacher. After seeing this performance I can not understand why "not found" by Brewster's big audience. She brings a mixture of anger and fondness to the character that really helps the film to reach its potential. Excellent work to deserve this big audience. I'm looking for director and more from this cast!
