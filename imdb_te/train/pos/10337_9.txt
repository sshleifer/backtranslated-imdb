The film was a lot of fun and I wanted to see this list again for my 1970s collection of my vintage collection again, I know about these characters, I've met over the years and this comedy, unfortunately, did not hold this DVD or VHS. Redd Foxx is always a comedian of comedy, Pearl Bailey is a great match for his wife witty and sassy, ​​if it is out, if Dennis Dugan is a crazy funny man if he's in the future a Norman son with a secret. Miss Dobson Hooker heart and small conscience. Love, Lust and Wonderful Family Relationships This movie is a must for the upcoming show, the situation must find its way to the situation comedy and remake with mix, I think it will be impossible to find, except for Jerry, finding Seinfeld's role as Dennis Dugan, and the Sinefeld episodes are taken to Norman as a pair. So it is impossible for you to keep them close, because it is impossible to suddenly be satisfied with a hooker girl friend and dishonesty. This film reminds me of a wild ride advice for a cabbie and the episode that advises her cadre on her attorney. (Episode from Seinfeld) The pandemic moment was fun and fun.
