This film surprised me in a good way. I got the impression that I was an action thriller from the box, but it was a thriller, even though it was breathtaking. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of good jokes and funny situations here. This film and James Belushi is born to make Bill Manucci, he does a great job. The rest of the cast is not half bad and is especially a treat to Timothy Dalton. <br /> <br /> When new stories appear in the film, this story can get very confusing. Things get more complicated as no one rarely tells the truth about things. <br /> <br /> Louis Mooru is not known to everyone, but he has done this perfect job. <br /> Made out is worth checking out.
