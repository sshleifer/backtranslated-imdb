If you like CB4, you will not know what you are doing if the film is not yet seen. The film is crazy and connects more about the hip hop industry than the other parody film ... It's unfortunate that the film was released on DVD because it has always seen and loved a copy for everyone I've seen. If you really want a good laugh and like hip hop and if you are familiar with some old school artists, be sure to rent this movie. There are not many video rental sites with copies, but if you come across you will not be disappointed.
