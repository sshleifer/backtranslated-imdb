If the heart and soul of the sport can not be frozen - a pure lifestyle - its perfect form of surfing, the documentary made it. This documentary is not about life waves, but it is about people who have been carrying a larger wave of armor, pioneers and modern vanguard. Stacy Perraulta - A fictional myth from my first 80s skateboarding days as a socklot teen - revised the version of the magnificent essence and summary of the interview and was not just a documentary, but created a masterpiece. And when it's in the subject of his heart and soul - and apparently it is here - his intellect is filled with glimorize, hype, or the pure sight of his subject sentiment. He respects the Surfers and Surfing / Beach lifestyle, but does not turn it off. <br /> This surfer is about, surfers, the earliest history of the sport, and the big wave surfers that can be said of the profiles. . Greg Noll, the first big wave of personality, was the pioneer of the game; Jeff Carter, an amazing man who has almost run for almost 15 years in the big surfboard of Northern California's most dangerous Maverick; <br /> <br /> Lang Hamilton is the current head of the Messiah's current day of big wave surfing - a brilliant heart and warmth between the two men - in the camera. Surfing and a deep and powerful love for the sea that comes through every word. I found the story of how Hamilton's adoptive father met him and how Hamilton's 4- 4-5-year-old boy was compelled to make his father particularly heartwarming (and again, removed from the syrup worse). <br /> <br> If you'd like surfing - or if you did not - you should have viewed an amazing documentary, the art of being the most appreciative of a student or simply the most complete writing.
