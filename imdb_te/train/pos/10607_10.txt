Henry Thomas is "great". His character has caught my eye. "I am" in the story that I forgot to be true. I want him to keep the baby and see what he is a special person. Other people in the story are important in the decoration of his character. The way they stay together to help one another is really exciting. I love movies that show you the true side of human emotions without having to hit you over the head, that's not smart enough to figure things out for you.
