<br /> <br /> I have seen this film many times. At least a dozen. But unfortunately not recently. However, I never know my memory that Mickey Rooney in my memory - "Killer Mears" knows he will be executed and the moment of truth, he dances, and cries, and laughs, he is delighted with Hesteria and drives emotion gambit. I am such an amazing performance by any actor living or dead, past or present. Then I know for sure that Mickey Rooney, yes, "Andy Hardy" and great genius actor. Even though I kept it up, my mind thinking years, I must be alone in this view. 15 years after I saw the film for the last time on television, I had to read the old Q & A section of the Los Angeles Times. Lawrence faced Olivier's question and questioned: "Mr. Olivier are you considered one of the greatest actors of all time, who are the greatest actors in whom?" His answer is, "Peter Finch and Mickey Rooney" I was surprised, but not surprised. I instantly lost back to his "Killer Myers" and I thought it was very good for him to see this great potential, and now I admire my impression of others .. Then the moments with the course "Bill" and many other great Mikey Rooney. The film, "The Last Mile", must be seen by all acting students. Frankly, I do not remember much about this film, but Mr Rooney will never be in the film. If someone remembers this movie, I'll be interested in hearing from you. For the film, I stood 10 in the face of my performance in my heart.
