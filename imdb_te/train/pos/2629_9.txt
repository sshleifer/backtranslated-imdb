I'm not sure when I hear about coming. I'm thinking of how Disney is available. I made a mistake. I am very good. I'm not the Lion King but it's nice to look from one particular point to another. It's very funny. Also in the Cartier Disney sequel, animation sucks are not like The Lion King animation. I liked the whole movie theater in this movie. Nothing is giving way but you'll know what I'm talking about. I am very much fun to have a good return from the original to the cast. This is a very good movie.
