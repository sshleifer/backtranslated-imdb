While the story is sweet, the main part of the film is the dance and singing of the film, the specialty of the film (and it makes a masterpiece) a scene. Kelly's glamorous ballerina (his unique "Pass de Dukes de Amour", really a unique style), the glamorous beauty of French fairy art, is really a palette of colorful American music (Gershwin) color. The growing music and visual explosion with those dances is a creative genius and the real work of a great artist.
