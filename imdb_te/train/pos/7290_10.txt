After giving ratings to the SUPERB's point, I enjoyed a lot with the movie. The film is dark, moving, anger, pain, guilt and the most trusted ghost. <br /> I initially wanted to see several special effects, with its subtlety and its right. Brian, I'm telling you the story again and your art of special effects with your artistry. You go too far, my friend. <br /> You certainly will be president of your fan club. <br /> <br /> Eric Eatberry, Best Actor Award, First Choice. You saw Jr. Lopez as a child compared to Cassia. <br /> <br /> Overall, acting, protagonist, high quality filming and amazing effects, it's amazing. I've had a long time. I'm worrying too high expectations.
