"Shore Leave" is an average Star Trek adventure. Nothing wrong with the episode. I think this is not the best thing I can do for the fans. It is light and fun and nothing more. However, I'm glad that a TV show of this type has a good meaning to take a break from serious galactic conflicts. In this episode, Kirk decides to grant his staff for a short time, and a landing party will descend to a planet that looks like the perfect place for a vacation. As always, this planet is not peaceful. There are some actions and sharp movements, but most stories play to laugh. Good, but unpredictable.
