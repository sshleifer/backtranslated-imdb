When an actor is an actor, fictional or realistic character, the character becomes more difficult to play a role. In double life Ronald Coleman portrayed himself as Anthony John, a tortured double personality. He portrayed his talent and impeccable role. Interviews, habits, walk and attitude Anthony John spoke fluently while playing at Othello on stage. Coleman has done well as a Shakespearean actor in small scenes such as Othello, a part of this gem. The end of Coleman's face as Othello was tortured by doubts about the credibility of Desdemona, with whom they were looking for valuable scenes. Only in the desperation of its character and the deep understanding of Coleman can only be accomplished. It looked like Spencer Tracy as Dr. Jekel and Mr. Hyde, a double character that is very deep and sharp. Shelley Winters looked very sweet, tedious and gorgeous at the same time and added her talent to the film. Others like Ronald Coleman's role in the film, and he won an Oscar for Best Actor in 1947. I will watch this movie repeatedly and have a boring feel.
