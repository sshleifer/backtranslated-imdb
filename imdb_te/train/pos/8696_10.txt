One of the missing gems in the 1980s scenes, scenes ... Rainer-sharp satire and Annequie Walker (then how did she get tons of characters?) And from Wallace Shawn. It is well understood for class struggles and those in those communities. The writing is fun and the characters are nuanced, though not subtle. And sorry, but the Asian continents should not be "social values" if one of the other characters ("Japan" is called a Japanese man). The value here is to make fun of the film and make it vulgar in lightning. I found it creatively, funny and unique.
