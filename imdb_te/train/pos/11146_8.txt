The man in New York City was forced to live in a condemned building with a disabled canman who was hit by a visionary about Hustler. The modern moral and social decline was the most bashing test, directed by John Schellinger (he did not hold his job on top) and performed well by Jon Voitt and Dustin Hoffman. Overall, most punch packs, and "fantasy" scenes - some of which play for a deep shirt - "Mode" as a drug party, are slightly apathetic. The relationship between the two men is sentimental, and the filmmakers can not be soft, and the film may not be less than Shelselinger. First in X-Rated in 1969, and the best film Oscar winner; Screenwriter Waldo Salt (who adapted the book by James Leo Herilli) and Schlesinger also received statues. **** from *** 1/2
