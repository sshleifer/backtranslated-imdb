I heard about one of the motorcycle mags, I saw a preview of Freibert at iTine Man TT. I've mainly seen Phil Daniels (yes I love Quadrophenia like everyone) in a motorcycle movie, for racing, be sure to get away from the lure beer and parties. Finally! We're done! The British is indeed a great motorcycle film (and it's not like a torque), which is the best of British comedy. Identify my words, this is Phil Newell's best screen presentation, and as Jeof Bell is concerned, his new name is a new British legend. I liked Gare Stettche in Shane Meadows' Wonderful Dead Man's Shoes and here he gives a silent touching performance that proudly adds to his growing film glory. This film is not bikers for us, but everyone (I like my sweetheart). I hope it gets the same intelligent response on the mainland which came at Man of Man. I'm going to take a look at some of the classic scenes in this movie (see for the shop), that it will ruin the fun, but I say, watch, enjoy and be the best of the nights in the movie. I think it could be a cult classic really. They are speaking at TT ... C'Mon Freebird!
