I need to disagree with other comments about this film. Visual Effects Fill out the supernatural themes of this film and do not remove it from the plot, I like how to use this move rather than a crouching tiger, because knife actions do not have any strings at all and you can see the work closely. <br /> <br /> I think Western viewers are very confusing with 2 scenes, one of which attempts to shoot alive and tell villagers that the end of the world. These scenes have been derived from some interpretations of the Mahayana Buddhist text (Mahayana Buddhism can be seen in China, Korea and Japan) and other scenarios of the scenes with a nicker in the Japanese calendar ... until the end of the world that people come back to the end ... Gozo action, story and visuals have to dazzle any viewer is. My previous complaint with some skill modifications in the US is in the last fighting scene (sorry - I can not give anything away).
