This film is absolutely amazing. Pre-partition time and culture are beautifully recreated. Urmila gave another amazing performance. I really admire the film, not to the predominantly Pakistani-bashing in Gadar and LOC. With the partitioning in the background, the film does not lead to political problems or focus on violence or what is right and what is wrong. The film is always centered around the tragic story of Urmila's life. Her brilliant relationship with Manoj Bajpai was superbly portrayed. In fact, the fact is that Hindus and Muslims are suffering from this division. The fact that there is only one religion is really dominant in the film.
