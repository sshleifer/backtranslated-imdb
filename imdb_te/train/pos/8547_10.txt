Many people hate this movie, but I blame the two facts - 1 - they want to be a lot like the first couple of American Pie movies. And 2 - they are trying to take it very seriously. <br /> I found this one out of six, and I love Dwight. Plot speculative, I will say, but what is a teen comedy? Road Trip, Dirty Deeds etc etc, all of them are very predictable, but still goddamn funny! I think it is worth watching this, I love it, I find happier. <br /> <br /> Naked Mile and after watching this one, it's all about American pie films, and only about becoming stiflers. <br /> <br /> Enjoy. Love. XD
