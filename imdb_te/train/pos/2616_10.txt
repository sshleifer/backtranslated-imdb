The Lion King 1 1/2 The Lion King is the most beautiful story to go with. It mainly follows the original story of The Lion King, but with a couple twists. In the picture, the bricks are described in the eyes of different characters. This story is still the original plot. </ P> <br /> As long as the sequels go, Disney is not all about making a worthy value. The film, the third part of The Lion King (Symba Pride II.) Was originally a fun but actually original idea. Travel to Timon and Pumbaa in addition to looking for the right place to live. After looking very wide, they will find the "Hakuna Matata" space. They meet a small lion named Simba, and will go through many things that parents go through today. <br /> <br /> I think this film is very good.
