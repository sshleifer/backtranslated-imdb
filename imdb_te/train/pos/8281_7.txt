From the first scene, I was really excited. "I can say it's awesome!" I thought. This performance is very good, I'm throwing on the lives of these people. The music is amazing. The plot started with a sudden incident, and then some went forward (could mean one) to the fateless fate. Build is slow, but I personally love that kind of thing, periods of quiet tension, and are not getting raped before the ready to pay off it. /> <br So everything's going to be fine and then start with fireworks, and before you know, credits are rolling. "What ??" I can say my and my movie-night mate. If you understand the director's intentions, the blunt end feel (lorry pesendon at filmcritic.com is the most fascinating and cheerful interview inspector that already has seen the movie) but I can not help tell you pull off the right. <br /> <br /> This may possibly be solved for a little ten minutes of material before the climax. In any case, it is very bad. That ten minute created all the difference in the world. (But you do not have to write or paint a picture of yourself in the right story, a story arcade is a big pain in the butt and I certainly did not make this criticism from any pedestal!) <br /> <br /> Like a masterpiece that Wendigo gave up I feel like that. But hey, I'd take a more commentary with an unwritten writing any day over-the-dog-poo an overly compensated piece with over-digital effects (these days like most horror movies) <br /> <br /> Want to take one other comment. . I'm confused that I'm afraid or laughing at monster scenes. I do not know how to explain it, but there is a distinct monte Python who is about to feel this monster in his blatent "monster" forms. Although this sounds like a terrible criticism for a horror movie - I do not know, it still works for me in some curly way. I do not see deer horns again! :)
