The real horror of the plot, the atmosphere is really disappointing, for such a low-budget production and at least for a German production. Combined with a combination of Indian spirituality, mystical thriller and slashish films. Plots and characters development is great, with no studio-atmospheric sits close to reality. It may be accurate, but unfortunately some things are a bit frustrating, they are not necessarily less-budget movies: <br />) Casting is not more than average. Almost every actor appears as a layman. Some of them are good or do a very good job, but some of the juggling German acted as court-performing actors! But I was very disappointed about Matthew Carey's performance! His performance (his performance in his older films is good) is below average! <br />) Dialogues are sometimes soap-opera-level. <br /> <br /> The bad sound is sometimes very difficult. I saw on DVD and am happy to rewind and hear again. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ' , Commercially beyond the movies, it's terrible.
