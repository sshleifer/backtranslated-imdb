There are some wonderful comments and observations in this movie. I am happy to notice the "M" comparisons of Fritz Lang (forget the remake with a lightweight David Wayne 50). The real villain was not a violent murderer (an exceptional good performance by Jeffery Damon), and his sexual frustration on his victims - mostly children. He is the target. The real villain is an official Soviet system that sinks and sinks into its own incompetent inability. An easy pragmatist (Sutherland always succeeded in this role), a hesitant, psychiatrist (incomparable Max Sydo), a prosecutor (intelligent) who is an uncompromising person (Ria in his best role from "The Crying Game"), Brit actor John Wood) and driven investigator (delightful supporter, Ima Lda Stanton), the quiet, supporting the man's wife, busopu officials. This is a horrible film. Its dark and dark support is through the filming of the corrupt and inefficient system that works against success. There is no need to drown into the gore-laden slice 'n dice sensationalism that has the most recent films. Gore is - it's a terrible story - but it adds to describe a diagnostic man. The success of this story is perfect: These are the actions of man or man like you. You and I chose our frustration out of reasonable ways, and we are very innocent and vulnerable to our children. The amazing premise of this story has been manifested by an amazing cast of amazing actors. - However, I have noticed that our Australian friend does not like this speech and nobody thinks that the Aussie dialect is talking. Well, very bad. This fine film definitely talked to me and everyone I saw.
