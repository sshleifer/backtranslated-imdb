I did not see all the films released in 2002, and I can not say it's the best film of the year. I can say that all year is the best movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The American races in black films include "ethnic relations" on American ethnic relations, or the inner city of the wealthiest ghetto, with each stereotype with imaginable sounding ibicic-accented accent. <br /> <br /> Fisher is proud only in this case: the race is not irrelevant, can be saved in a fight, or may be provoked by a race slur. <br /> <br /> Echo the fisher story is any empower person. He portrayed Derek Luke very well and thoughtfully. Denzel Washington, strictly using his star power to construct the film, sticks in the background, and allows the film to be a story of Anthon Fischer. <br /> <br /> BET, and popular culture Usually a large number of Americans (and Canadians also know you) is a film that speaks humanely. I think black-audiences look for the film for humanity, rather than avoiding it, they feel that there are no roles or actors in the film. There is a sad commentary on the ethnic-relations in North America. <br /> <br />
