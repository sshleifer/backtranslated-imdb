This image is so great! I love the young man, and I and all my friends love the series, so these films show the attention of people of all ages. I recommend to everyone. When Logan Bartolomie says "Rosie Cheeks" is my favorite line in this film when he talks about his daughter's daughter. He is a great actor, as well as Erin Cotrell. They are very well attached, and have a great chemistry! I hope I can really work together again. They are attractive people, and good actors. I finally found the good films that see the end. It is difficult to find good movies, manners, and Christian values. But at the same time, these films are not cheesy.
