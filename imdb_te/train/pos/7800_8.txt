I first saw this film at the age of 13. It has since wiped me out and in many ways it is still doing. But I'm less inclined to see a definitive historic piece now. There is a valuable little effort to watch and interact with racism - so the most powerful anti-racism weapon fails to understand what is the key on it. <br /> <br /> Previously, we have a dichotomie - Woods in a Rainbow View with a side, beaco and 3D variation - the other, two dimensional characters are painlessly portrayed unexpectedly. I am concerned that the film's story, but people see 'perfect' role.
