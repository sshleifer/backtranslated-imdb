I saw it more than any other times. I have seen an average of it since its release every year. And every time I see it, it's equally amazing and always reveals something new to me. This cast is probably the best combination of Yine cinematography. This film should be perfect for any self-respecting film lover. In the same league: Maratonzi Trace Pocasii Crook, Balcanski Spizuun and Vote My Szbabenom. It's the poker of movies for everyone in his personal video collection.
