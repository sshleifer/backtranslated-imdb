A great idea: 11 stories about 11 September. 11 directors from diverse countries with diverse results. Ken Loach is talking about an immigrant (usually) just amazing (normal). Burkina Faso's film is a good surprise but French does a good job. However, the image of Israel is a bit boring, and the Mexican man, well, he should direct in a Mexican restaurant and leave the job. 8/10
