In general, the film may be one of the most enchanting designs made by two Scotts (Ridley and Tony). <br /> When it comes to disgruntled tragic heroes, Denzel Washington and Tony Scotts really make a perfect duo. The film and Deja Wu are the good things you both expected. Washington's really moving cameras and every execution scenes in the film came in very comfortable. The emotion of his character is easily associated, so all the murders are enjoyed on the road. This is the success of a Super-Dark Mexico City, which takes place very rare shots. It is easy to get to the extent of corruption described in Man on Fire. <br /> <br /> I do not know what Mexicans think of this matter. It is the best of Death Wish's style, but it also encountered widespread violence. It is a bit annoying to justify a vigilant act by the movie very realistic and let's play the "missing lamb" type of Denzel Washington's tragic hero. In the end, they also filmed his kidnappers in his swimming pool like his documentary. I'm checking on IMDb if it is based on real events for this movie ...... So if you find the movie's thrill nutritional concept for your consideration. <br /> <br /> <br /> The art direction / editing / cinematographic / denzel Washington 8/10.
