This is the best version you can see (so far) and the BrontÃ« work is very real. Dante is rigged as a racaster, declaring Jane Eyre "not beautiful". But his performance is beautiful and overtaking this and Gala Clark, which is absolutely and believable Jane Eyre. This product is a long watch but well worth it. Almost live quotes in the book are in the script and the way to see it is the first true 'romance' in literature. I have a copy of this movie and I read it again and read it again. The filming of the film may seem a little over time but there is never another.
