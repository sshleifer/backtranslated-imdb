I grew up in Brazil and I was surprised to see the beautiful coastline of the movie. The area is known as "Paradise" and is part of the Rio de Janeiro state "Green Coast". It is about 150 miles from the city of Rio de Janeiro. <br /> <br /> The film brings back the 16th century Brazil into the world, where Europeans are unable to explore the sea shore and the population of various local tribes is low. <br /> <br /> The French and Portuguese territories and brazil combined with each other at the top of the timber trade. He is allowed to live in a month of relative comfort, even to the point of being killed and to eat in the practice of vengeance, "he said, adding that he was a" slave "of the chief, according to the customs of the tribe. <Br /> <br /> <br /> I would like to say about this film In the beautiful garden of Eden, life is outrageous, violent, curious and full of strange customs. Coming to trouble and more violence with more weapons and greed <br /> <br /> The people here are trying to survive in the harsh world. </ P> <p> <p> <p> This film is not unsatisfactory to the locals. , That adds a specific wind to the project: How many movies have you seen about the lives of Brazilian natives and their early dealings with Europeans?
