This is my first comment on IMDb website, and the reason I am writing is that we're talking about one of the best movies! 'Oh Gory!' You laugh and cry at the same time, you fall in love (if you're still not a fan!) With Georgian singing tradition, and maybe you'll feel better after watching and watching the hardships of your own existence :) I'm very much interested in the movie Create clear and memorable characters and find interesting in the main character And are important. The film is featured in Wahatung Kikabia (The Greatest), but you must remember every face around him. Housewives became known for Russian-speaking people. A picture to live. Simple, yet deep, and want to see again.
