Let me set the scene. It's absolutely nothing at school holidays and movies. I'm going to see my friend. "The Grinch" comes in for a short film. We will buy tickets without expecting it. <br /> <br /> Grinch (Jim Carrey) is the best film of this Ron Howard. Apollo 13). The way the movie is made, the scenery, the actors, the clues and the music are just amazing. It really brought this childhood film to life. <br /> The story is based on the story of Grinch. We all know Grinch is a terrible man who just can not stand Christmas. He lives high on whoville and does not mix well with the town. <br /> <br /> A little girl is going to change the life of Grinch and change the drastic change on others. <br /> <br /> Cindy Lou Lou (played by adorable newcomer Taylor Momsem) meets Grinch straight to him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you have not heard of your parents, barrel. A SOLID 10/10. <br /> <br /> <br />
