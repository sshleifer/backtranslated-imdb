My only minor feature with the image is the fact that I grew up knowing as the STAIRWAY HEAVEN, the fact that the excellent RAYMOND MASSEY inquiry was relegated to the last twenty or so in the scene. <br /> <br /> David Niven and Kim Hunter cast fantastic young lovers, but Roger Lewes's Livelywist and most reliable performance. He is also a heavenly messenger who sent him to re-enter Nivi when he was not aware of the death of his war because the French hardened Marissa Goring was an excited (he also received a comment on technicolor). Goring has some innovative lines and provides them with taste. <br /> <br /> For the first time in twenty years or so in TCM, watching this tonight was a fantastic year in 1946. <br /> <br /> Technicolor photography is somewhat oppressive and embarrassing, transformation into the B & W for the glorious and heavenly scenes is made with great imagination and effect. <br /> <br /> A viewer in the fantasy aspects of the opening scene story - and the period of residence with Revin Operator Hunter is that his plane is heading towards Earth and unexpectedly causing romance. From the beginning to the end there is really a fantastic film, Michael Powell and another success for Emerik Presbyger.
