Again, the 27-year-old McQueen did not qualify for the age group, but maintained a hot-roding attitude anyway. The film was a success at that time, with the radio game being a very strongly lit text. And except for the unfortunate final effects, the film is still very fun, no drive-in or disc-in. Meanwhile, I'll say the refrigerator water, I'm waiting for the back of the Blob now that the polar iceberg will turn.
