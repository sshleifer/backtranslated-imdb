North Africa in 1930. In a small Arab town on the edge of Sahara comes a beautiful woman looking for her life and a beautiful trippist monk flees from the crisis of his faith. They meet and desire to move, but the sand diver also knows the wealth of Allah if they find happiness or grief. <br /> <br /> This plot is a pure hook, but the picture is still very pleasant & beautiful. Marlene Dietrich & Charles Boyer is an excellent screen pair. She was, simply, beautiful, and kept, and Boer gives a highly effective, poor performance, letting her feel more like his acting face. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is excellent: Basil Rathbone, in a sympathetic role as the Count of the Desert; Joseph Skidrrott is a friendly, talkative guide (all "Arabic" he and others speak in the film) Lolly Watson as the supreme mother superior; Alan Marshall as a respected young French officer; Tilly Locke is a dangerous dancer; Henry Brandon as comic porter; John Caradine as the mysterious sand divine; And the excellent Sir C. Aubrey Smith as a brilliant priest. <br /> <br /> Film mavens will recognize a sage Helen Jerome Eddie; Marcia May Jones & Bonita Granville (see on Sun's should) Convent Girls; Gant as Nigel de Bruyer as a monastery; <br /> <br /> Color films in the 1930s appear rare and lovely, and the film is no exception - the cinematography is colorful as the desert. Allah is the first techikolar film to be shot in the Garden City. Yuma, Arizona gave all the film masks they wanted to filmmakers, but the drinking water and the 135-degree heat contaminated company immediately rebelled. When Boer's face burned a bright tomato red when a daily firing was made, producer David O. Selznick finally gave up. The rest of the film was shot in the Hollywood sound stage.
