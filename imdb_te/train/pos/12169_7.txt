On her bachelor party night, Paul Coleman (Jason Lee) meets Becky's cute dancer (Julia Stiles), who drinks a lot together and wakes up on her bed the next morning. His future mother-in-law calls him and tells his future husband Karen (Selma Blair) to arrive at his apartment and he asks Becky to leave his shelter in a hurry. Earlier, she finds that she has crabs, and then finds Becky's karen relative in the preparation of her wedding feast. It started with a very funny comedy with happy situations. The first attraction of the film is the central trilogy of actresses and actors. Wonderful actresses and very cute, and amazingly funny Jason Lee, Julia Stiles and Selma Blair with great performances. I laughed too much with the story, but some scenes were really fun. For example, when Paul discovered Becky in his bed; When he saw his colors; His imagination in many cases; In the drugstore, trying to get explanations about crab medicine and getting; Many neighborhoods of his neighbor, minister; Calling Karen Dept. Story; Or when police found a suspect who attacked Paul. I have many other scenes, but the reader has rented off or bought this movie and have fun. <br /> The title (Brazil): "Laugh Pour Elias" ("Their Crazy")
