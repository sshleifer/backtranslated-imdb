I started telling me that it was long since I saw it, but it has seen 5 or more times; A fantastic little love story that is obviously a spectator with inspiration for new or depressed stars with music / comedy pairs. The secrets of Kay Kesar are a good example. <br /> He and his band play many tunes and support a part of action, the best part of the Spike Jones Show. Hugh O'Brien plays the role of Buddy Hawk, which was given to Lou Costello and Abbott and Costello were replaced by Leeds. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a fun movie, but it's important to have a lot of Spike Jones and his team in the movie in history. It has not seen or heard now in two decades, it was released. Hope it is not lost
