"Stairway to Heaven" is an exceptional discovery in the making of the film, probably never duplicated. I rank with "The Wizard of Oz" and "African Queen", but it is a completely different type of "African Queen". "Stairway to Heaven" uses mental-drama, performance feelings and technological effects, and is absolutely unique to my knowledge. <br /> <br /> In "Oz" - B & W and color footage is a combination, but the contrasting significance refers to the effect achieved in "beautiful" rather than the simplest. <br /> <br /> The purpose and effect of the difference in "Stairway" can only be described as powerful. <br /> <br /> Another thoughtful factor of "Stairway" is the concept of "time" and how it is used. How has someone ever derived a good way to stand on time? Literally? <br /> If you have imagery, you will agree with me. "Stevie to Heaven" is a real gem.
