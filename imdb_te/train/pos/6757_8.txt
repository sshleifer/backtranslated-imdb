Dana Andrews is in the 1950s "Side All End Ends", which also refers to Jean Tirne, Gary Merrill, Carl Malden and Neville brand. Andrews plays New York City detective Sargent. Mark Dickson, a policeman who is furiously faced with the difficulties of hitting the suspects. Sculis (Merrill), a man who was murdered by a Dickson and his partner in a zoo club of an elderly man. Sculis blamed murder on Ken Pine (Stevens), who is now a victim of leaving the club after fighting with his wife Morgan (Tearney). Dickson sufferer won a lot of money and was killed as a result of the men of the big bully. He goes to see the pine and does not realize that there is a plate on his head in the war, pushes him to the ground and accidentally kills him. Now he must cover the murder. More complicated, he falls for Morgan; When her father (Ken Tully) went to Pine's apartment, Pine saw his daughter beaten and arrested for the crime. <br /> <br /> It is a fantastic horror hero who has some good performances. Strongly beautiful and atmospheric Andrews is convincing as a tough yet nervous detective to stay one step ahead of his colleagues. The film reunites him with his amazing "Laura" Castor, Jean Tirne, and apparently looks like a bad taste in men who used to deceive her. She knew, she got something else. Ken Tully performs a brilliant job as his father, who denies his innocence despite some insane testimonies. <br /> <br /> My only problem with this well directed, fast moving and absorbing image is endless. Pure Hollywood and, putting me in the place of Tearney, I suspect he responded the same way. Directed by Otto Critic and Otto Priming for the film by Ben Hugh. I could not get awe-inspiring as "Laura", but there are some things in this world. If you want a movie noir, you should see.
