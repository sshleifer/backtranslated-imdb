This is one of the first grace films I've ever seen ... I was about 5 years old at that time. It feels good to me! But that night I put chewing gum in an eye to be a monster ... and my mother was very disappointed. She had to clean my eye with alcohol and the next day my eyes smelled like a double MINT! Now this is a picture! Hey it's a great picture of time. Head sitting on the lab counter was real. And your 5 it is very affordable! Kids are now being spoiled by special effects that show a lot of days and leave nothing for your mind imagination. You can imagine that your mind is more boring than special effects! (IMO)
