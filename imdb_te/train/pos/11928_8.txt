This film is still a great film, released in 1951 by MGM and starred in the film Janet League. Danny Glover was one of his best performances, George Knox, who brought his luck to baseball manager with his little luck. The film was "Stacked" by Christopher Lloyd (his stage experience, through his amazing performance, with amazing actors), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (third rock from Sun), Brenda Fricker (a beautiful (also in the film), Matthew McConnake (He stole the show in Dodge and Confucius and his role may not be crucial in the film, but he was revealed), Some of the greatest actors like Adrian Brody (Daddy and confused), Adrian's Matthew McGogagg, McDonough (Wit Boss) and his last appearances, Ben Benson, include Taylor Negroon (David), Tony Longgo (Mesmer), Jay O Saunders (Ranch Wilder) (Hank Murphy, an employer of California Angels), and the other cast is a great mood I'm looking for disappointment, and I see it today when I see it I need it on DVD.I recommend it to any parent looking for something their parents did not see, and for everyone .
