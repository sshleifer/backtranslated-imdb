I and my girlfriend, Annette, it's gone together and we'll make two comments. <br /> <br /> Despite having some freedom with the work of the deacon, both of them really enjoyed it. Many of Deacon's works are somewhat dark and frustrating (including Oliver Twist), but the film has changed everything. <br /> <br /> Trevise: In general, I do not care much for musical and dancing movies, but tunes in this product <br /> Annetty: Really really feels like coming from Travis. I do not stress how good the dance numbers are. <br /> <br /> Travis: Three actors have really revealed IMO; Nancy (Shani W.), Bill Sikes (Oliver Reed), and Artful Dodger (Jack Wild). Man, Olivier Reid could really make a good villain. A scene where you see his eyes e-mail slot gave me back cool ... miracle. And that kid is a perfect artistic cheat by Jack Wild. And Nancy was amazing (man, I thought I was bad when she died). She can sing a lot! Kudos section of the casting on their options there. I hate Oliver Twist Kid Thon. He's just too whiny and whimmy for my taste. <br /> <br /> "In addition to three stars that Travis has mentioned, Ron Moody (Fagin) He was very funny, and at the same time was very bad, and the supporting actors were very great.Harry Secombe made his Mister Bumble an excellent voice and had a great voice.I was another movie called Mr. Sequie "Davy" I played the role where he played an opera singer with amazing performance. <br /> <br /> Endy: Travis watches are a musical film that can be found absolutely anything. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is in the rating 8.5 (in this case we reach 9). Travis: Oliver Twist Kid (Mark L.) I was bored and his songs hurt my excessively sensitive ears because I rated this 7. <br /> <br /> Endy: My rating is 10. It's better than movies. And you can say that everybody who is involved in this product really worked hard on what it made ... a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this stuff ... Music is not what you normally do not like. It's really rare treatment.
