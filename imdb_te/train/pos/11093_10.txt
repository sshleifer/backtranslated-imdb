It's a great "little" movie. I say "small" because there are no guns or dozens of guns, like in the film John Woo. Roy Scudder and three "bad guys" are great performances. John Frankenheimer is more fortunate with smaller productions these days. The film seems too much easier to watch, more of the yarn than the washing machine - instead of everything around and around, things seem to be as badly as though the plots are thicker. Excellent end, very positive. I have never read Elmor Leonard's book ever, but it is not very different as Elmore Leonard is watching the movie because it is very different.
