The first time I saw it back in July was the "California" show for the fourth time. The recent wave of serial killer films, "California", is not worth mentioning in some of the previous films. Perhaps it would be more successful if the film was released between 1996 and 1999. In my opinion, "California" is very different from most serial killer films released in the late 1990s. It is almost entirely different from today's serial killer films such as "Seven" or "Bone Collector". Several serial killer films show the murderer, but the guy is always behind the mask or can not see enough to find anyone about them. "California" actually tries to break through that barrier, and actually understands the criminal brain. "Why do they do the things that they do? Why do they feel that they have a higher or more powerful feeling, or they want to kill a killer?" There are some things that this "California" is trying to answer, but we have a room to find things leaving. Brad Pitt continually stamps as Early Grace. When we meet at the beginning of the first film, see that he is definitely a disturbed person. When we see him the first time, it's late at night. Initially drinking alcohol. We will pick him a rock, quit a bridge, and then find the lands in the car's windshield. Pitt is serious in this movie. It's always good to see him when he plays psychos or really bad people. After this he feels funny that he plays a real lawn like in "12 Monkeys" and leads him to be at the other end of the spectrum in David Fincher's "Seven".
