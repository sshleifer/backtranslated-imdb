This presentation is beautiful. When it comes to first I do not have much more than a light family comedy with a very good one-liners. It seemed that most families were very well expressed, with both the parent and the child's different concepts, however, as I mentioned, I always thought it was a good watch anytime. However, my impression was portrayed by another window, when the tragic death of the grotesque funny John Ritter grew. The program's playground and really appreciated the life of the characters in a very delicate way that John Ritter, Nothing talent, struck in the heart of all worship ress. When the ritters broadcast the show after the pass, I really wanted to give my father a hug and let him know how much he meant me. The breakup of the three children's acting, especially Bridget's character, was horrified about the last words she had said. I know that my father does not understand what the tragic things are, he is very important. Great show
