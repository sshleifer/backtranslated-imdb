Comedy gem. Loud moments are laughing, shop and pub sequences are in my stomach - they are laughing inanimate. The characters are recognizable and the conversation is well-observed - I know people like this! Humor is surprisingly sensitive and the film (this sounds strange) keeps in mind an animated comedy. It's a quirky little picture too. It definitely takes many views. I've seen it a few times (I've shown all of my friends) and every time you see something new - a bit of speech, which I did not choose before. I'm not going because I really get a picky and find a couple of errors in the picture but I feel this is really a watch and it's a great fun, which one can enjoy with a sense of humor. It finds friends and I hope there are so many people out there. Oh .... and it's a great soundtrack.
