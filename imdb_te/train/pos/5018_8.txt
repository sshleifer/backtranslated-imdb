If you are like me then you'll love this great upcoming teen movie. All great movies set in love / high school USA / Shout / calendar girl / crybaby / Lot 50 is the beginning of the Azchie / 60s and it has excellent soundtrack. Most of the songs in this kind of movies are still great but it is very fun at all times and has great love. The youngest cast was great. All of these amazing movies have more time. Marty mcfly gos back in these fantastic films, although it is good in the Farm 50s (early 60s) in 1955, it is not many.
