Leslie Howard's performance is enjoyable though. Mr. Howard plays Philip as a flat, uninterested character. Sorry for this man. However, I respect Bettie Davis Mildred. Ms. Davis gave her the best performances (she received an Academy Award nomination). Thanks to her performance she brings this rather cynical picture of her life. ** Mildred should not be missed when he tells Philip how she feels about her.
