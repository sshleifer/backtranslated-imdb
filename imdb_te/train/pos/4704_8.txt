This movie is very fun. I have seen a couple of times, but this is something that always reminds me of something. <br /> <br /> "Ducks and Bunnies" car scene is one of my favorites, and I still quote the versions of Morone some words! <br /> <br /> There are so many running jokes that it is amazing. But I love Michael Keaton anytime!
