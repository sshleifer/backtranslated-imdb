This film is one of the most sophisticated films of its time. When looking at this movie, when you're full of your action, and some people do not really hap, humor does not make sense. Bright writing for a film that has been to give us a bloody mix of criminals competitors, and a near future who have a thirst for common public blood. Also Arnold does not let us down some of his best liners. I do not want to spoil anything for you, but Arnold will tell you when his "I'll be back line" gets he gets the best reaction of all in this film. I hope you enjoy this gem as long as I do.
