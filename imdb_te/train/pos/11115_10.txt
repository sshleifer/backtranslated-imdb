I believe in an incredible performance because sopranos all supporting characters in it. I have purchased every video so far and are waiting to release the rest. The best of all 42 episodes so far is Episode # 3, Denial, Anger, and Acceptance. This episode deals with the most favorite part of my time with The Sopranos. His name was Brendon Fillon. He was hijacking the wrong truck and was accidentally killed for killing a truck driver. Brendan is a miracle because he is actually one of the few roles that Tony and his gang stood against. Finally, he ended up passing through the eye while bathing, and this was my favorite scene in the history of Sopranos. Brendan Filon # 1 and my # 2 most favorite character is Matthew Bevilakua, who was killed after Christopher Moltisanti tried to murder. Tony and Pussy shot him in Hecklenburg Park and shot him after being tortured. Sean Gismonte, who was killed after Christopher's filming, is my favorite character of my favorite character. Ultimately, one of my # 4 favorite characters was Chakki Signor of Uncle Jr. Servers. Tony was killed on a boat. All the amazing characters have died. It's just a bad thing about sopranos. All cool guys always get killed. Do you know what you need to change about Sopranos? They all have Chris, Tony, Uncle Jr., Silvio, and Paulie, the whole episode where they are trying to bully, because they show all the dead supporting characters in hell and they all need to get their revenge. Brendan Phillon will strike again !!!!!!!!!!!!
