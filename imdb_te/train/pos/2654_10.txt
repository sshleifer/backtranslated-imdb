Everyone should watch this movie altogether! It's scary, but dull "things-you-you-to-surprise-you-and-pass-it-off-scary-like-scary" things are not overlooked. It's really great. Look at this wonderful horror movie! Director Stanley Kubrick, great director who lived easily. Each of his paintings is also a masterpiece. Shining is a family that runs guardians of winter for a hotel in the Colorado Rockies, and it is cold, chasing the house. The kid is moody. Husband easily influenced by bad-hoated hotels, and ... well ... fidelity happiness !!!! Not really. This is a grip thriller that is thrown at the viewer from all different directions and it is scary. Not just classic, "It's Johnny" scenery. It's memorable, but not all the movies. It is one of the things that the words do not adequately explain, and you should see it. So go Netflix, and get it! GEEEEEETTTTTT ITTTTTTTT !!!!!!!
