When you compare what you do in the 80s when Brian D'Palma is going for entertainment today, his films are looking better and better. "Blow Out", "Blow Out", "Body Double", "Scarface" and "Carlito's Way" are all fantastic works of a cinematic handicraft at the peak of his energies. This is a pure hitchcock of a 80th stage of delicate hypocrisy, a love story, a huge contribution to the stories, a huge contribution to style, a fantastic pinto dogagio score and a garbled geo-inspired story. Camera work and luscious, scenery is unique, as Daniel Franz, Keith Gordon (a good director in his own right), Nancy Allen (at that time de Paula's wife) and Michael Cain's spectacular performances helps to overcome logical holes. Bring you a confrontation in the virtuoso, scary, romanticly charged Odyssey and enjoy each frame you have "cut with kilt".
