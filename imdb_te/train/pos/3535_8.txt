** Warning - Spaniers have! <br /> <br /> First, I said I really liked this game. Two months after I came to my parents it came for Christmas. <br /> <br /> I want to say that the first single player is very good. The first level is probably one of the best in the game, when you're at a party in London, and some bad boys destroy it by kidnapping the daughter of the prime minister. Of course you have to protect her, and it is a very large level, but perhaps at least five minutes you should take. The best part, and I also feel the combo part, when you're in jet pack, and people are rappelling down Big Ben. Simply jet-pack's most reliable rocket launcher, and clock the clock faces and enemies. <br /> <br /> The rest of the levels are good, but beautiful. There are four small levels that you can unlock, and the first two of them are only fun, and the last two to unlock are just 25 'enemies because the targets kill, I mean, c'mon! <br /> <br /> We have got loads of points to unlock these games and the last two bonus missions are really bad! <br /> <br /> The multiplayer player, for me, some of my friends agree, bots. Halo does not have any bots but still some fine multiplayer games! You will have a load of bad guys, and you can go against each other, and you can even set the traps, which is the best way of killing people without going to the view of their character. <br /> <br /> The gameplay - 8.5 / 10 (levels are well repetitive and bonus missions are better). Graphics - 9/10 (odd is bad graphic, but not too often). Multiplayer - 10/10 (it's not good to drive yourself, jet-packs and vehicles). <br /> <br /> "There may be a slight improvement, but it's still nice.
