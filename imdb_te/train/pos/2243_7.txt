I thought the whole movie was pretty good by the latest pictures and interesting cinematography. The actors were almost perfect at the back of their character and looked great. Music is lush and thoughtful. It also got a good turn for an end. So what did everyone vote for? This story is not entirely up to date (considered a remnant of "running man" with the idea of ​​a whole television show), but people's view of Christianity and Judaism is precisely what their messiah has heard. It was put in front of a modern group and his chance was to put him on a platform because he understood to follow this one person. <br /> <br /> The film is likely to be chosen by Christians or other religious people, but the word "god", but shows what filmmakers are trying to do, which is a more acceptable and forgotten world of Christianity, <br /> <br /> I've given you 7/10 stars here in IMDb. Every ounce in the film was very fun and original. If you look at an entertaining picture from Madrid and Spain, do not worry about the possibilities of a modern messenger coming to you as an angel coming to you.
