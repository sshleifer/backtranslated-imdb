This is a road movie, with a killer on-board. Brian Kessler (David Duchovny), a sophisticated etiquette writer, wants to research in the field of American serial killers. But neither he nor his girlfriend, Carrie (Mitchell Forbes), has been spending money on cross-country tours, so they are campaigning for anyone to share travel expenses. Those who end up with, they are two good examples you'll never find all of the movie, a young couple, a young couple, Early Grace (Brad Pitt) and his girlfriend, Adele (Juliet Louise), "The Poor White Worst". <br /> <br /> In fact, the film and the Adele are entertaining what they do, like anybody else, chicken, duck, maiden confide, steady drops, and other ways that I do not see from the "Beverly Hillbillies" again. Early California California: "That warm climate, cold weather stupid people," people can think faster there. It is enough to persuade Adele: "I will explain why there are so many stupid people here." It initially responds proudly: "It certainly does." "On the account, it's all for the trees that you never have to buy any fruit ... and they have no speed limits, and I hear the state law free of your first monthly rental," as they walk into the desert and its pretty stark nature southwest, Four passengers move on west across the US. <br /> <br /> But the poor start begins to look like "California" more like "The Hitcher" (1986), with Brian and Carrie becoming more clarified, some of the better, mental problems, and initially the hilarious hitchhiker of everyone like John Rider , Its fear appears to be unstoppable. <br /> <br /> "California", acting is unequal. Duchevny's performance flat. Brad Pitt is surprisingly effective, and sometimes he boosts his time. Mitchell Forbes is a fairy-artist, photographic artist. But my choice for the best show goes to Juliet Lewis. With her nose voice and heavy duty South slang, she is amazing, like her innocent, most animated, child Adele. <br /> <br /> In the end, our passengers enter the Nevada nuclear test site with a ruined old house filled with the test manikinvins. <br /> <br /> Overall, "California" is an entertaining film, a brilliant concept, great scene, especially shocking. Second half, good cinematography, great dialogue, Juliet Lou's amazing performance.
