<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am cinematography, I am impressed with the frames that are close to perfection and that I was built with a frightening bore on the sound of a frightening bore. </ P> <p> Two commentators, one unseen, have an invisible. They are trying to explain the painting range that has caused a long time back scandal. The film is about all theories and opinions, but the end I have to say is very surprising. It concluded that it deserves more than 171 votes. <br /> <br /> For 66 minutes, it looked like full work. Excellent direction! I have to say better than a bloody poet for some strange reasons. <br /> <br /> You might think that you can call it via the accent term "anti". It has a lot of professional discussions about many theories and excellent visual effects but staff and Ruiz does not pull it off. At least me. Wonderful picture.
