Multifacre is pretty much done with the viewer in its bright atmosphere. Almost the entire film revolves in a jail cell, which is the way Marquis with 4 characters and his small retarded boy become the stranant. Soon the prisoners find a prisoner's diary of a brick, which deals with the invasion of the occult and black magic themes that led to his escape from his cells. This book deals with everything that goes out of the jail, with the expulsion of the mystery and its characters. <br /> I honestly think that the story is good and the last twist is good but the end of me is pretty loosely bound together. At any time I was amazed until the last moment because the image's atmosphere is unique with minimal arrangement and cast. The killings are raw and strange ... take the gore to cool its spine and the occult themes are well done and remind me of hell themes in Hellraiser. Malefique has a claustrophobic and cool dirty feel with green color. You wonder if the truth or the wandering world is shot here ... When the retarded boy loses his fingers and marches on the breasts of Marcus, it is normal and the sparkling gates of liberty are bizarre? With its budget, the film creates a unique atmosphere and makes the viewer cooler than most shockers in the genre. I wish the story led to a more stable end. Many things like you with the camera, the other inmates with the books and the toy toy are not tight enough in the story, pointing to the obscure end. However, I will keep my eyes open for director Valett and other movies, but looking to see the Hollywood remake of the already worn-out "One Missed Call" of Hollywood remake.
