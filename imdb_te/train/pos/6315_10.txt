<br /> <br /> And I know, the film is another image. <br /> <br /> When Hollywood goes, this decade can rank among their most authentic products - and it will do for me. <br /> <br /> The film is full from the beginning. <br /> Here are you. <br /> <br /> There is not a bad performance in the picture. Funny episodes funny. The sharp parts are brighter. There is no disappointing moment of dialogue in this script, cinematography is fresh and yes beautiful. And it does not adhere to the Hollywood Rule (I see what you mean when you're watching the movie) <br /> <br /> When I was a kid I was looking for ads for the movie. The film is in radar without having to pay much at the box office, and this is not a cult classic. Transformers 2 is considered to be acceptable by the average movie audience, because they are used to see Transformers 2. If the film is original and funny, it's often multi-million pieces ** They can not see 'they' and 'they're not welcome to Collinwood'. A fun, short-acting copper comedy that refuses to compromise. One of my favorites.
