The film is a fan of John Candy, Richard Lewis, Ornellah Mutty, Cybill Shepard and Jim Balloons, in Monte Carlo, some other beautiful European locations. The problem that everyone has brought lies to protect themselves is good, and I saw this movie, it's very valuable! John Candy is at the top of Mr. Apan A Crime, like everyone else! If you and your family are looking for a great family image, this is your ticket. Not everyone is stellar performances, great acting, great comedy, and great timing, these days movies are rare. Great plot, great mystery, (which I love it anyway) and overall, the value of the money you spent. So get kids, grab some popcorn, juice, or tea, or soda, and enjoy the show !!!!
