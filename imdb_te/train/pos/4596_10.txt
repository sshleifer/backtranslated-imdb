This is Jackie Chan's best film, and my personal favorite. After disappointing the 'The Protector' directed by James Glichenhas, Jackie took up this feeling and clapped into Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> This action is fast and Furious, Jackie and his crew have not really worked hard on the design of the fighting. <br /> <br /> This script is a simple cops and thieves affair, nothing special, after everything is written, the bones are broken and blood is read. Action. <br /> <br /> In the English version there is some canister dubbing, but it should not be too frustrating. <br /> <br /> So, get the freds round, open the beers and enjoy it. By the way, the 'Glass Story' nicknamed the film stunt crew. Why? I'll find you!
