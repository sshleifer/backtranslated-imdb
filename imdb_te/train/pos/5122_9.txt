John Travolta's cast was third in Blackbusters. He makes dancing to the disco, rock and roll and country. He goes to Houston to find work and love. Gille's hot spot, and it's time of mechanical bull. I did not overtake, I bulled the bull at a club in Nashville. I recently watched this almost forgotten movie on television and I remember how good it was and how good it was in the 1980s. I wore a black cowboy hat that year as Travolta. Debra Winger is her prime minister. She is amazing in the red top. There is plenty of charisma. Bud and Sissy feel they are the ideal pair of trailer trash. They split just because it feels good to get back together. Urban Cowboy is an amazing soundtrack. We come to hear Love Lin Eyes by Eagles and Lookin for love through Johnny Lee.
