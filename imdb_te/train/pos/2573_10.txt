When my 14-year-old daughter and her friends come together for Movie Night, they have a look at them again and somebody else's catch: K-911, the third installment of the most successful K-9 franchise, a favorite TV dad, Jim Belushi. <br /> <br /> Folks, I know I can not wear a VHS tape, but the DVD ?! It was often played because it started to skip; No joke! <br /> <br /> In fact, thanks to Tom and Hanks for introducing us to our loved cop-dog lines. Turner and Hooch; <br /> <br /> Some people believe that Balusi's escape from the third film of the film is out of place. Popeyeak, I say. <br /> <br /> When looking at the film, you have to prove that you are wrong. Give the plot, but I will say Belushi and his panting partner will still give their best performance - the one you will have hauling with laughter! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] Do not forget the puppy chou!
