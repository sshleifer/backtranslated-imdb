The film is very well played in 1932 and probably does not work well today because its style is a bit old fashioned and contrived. However, if you paint a person like me who likes old Hollywood films, it's a bit slim and it can be fun - a very interesting soap. <br /> The problem is set in a ward for pregnancies. Half a dozen beds in this big room are waiting to give birth in women - but doctors are concerned about potential problems (such as the chamber - moms are really mothers!). And, like the episode of "Love Boat" or "Fantasy Island", each mother has a special story. Very fierce and silly stories, you have to suspend disbelief. <br /> <br /> There are a few stories here: one will have a father. You can not see Mom, but he is very, very nervous dad and it is included for comic relief. <br /> <br /> Lauretta Young and Eric Lyndon are a sad case. Loretta is sent to jail from jail - she has apparently killed a terrible man. You do not know exactly what happened, but say he's trying to force himself! Nevertheless, she was sentenced to 20 years - and her husband was dedicated to her and to her. <br /> <br /> <br /> Glenda Farrell is an awful person. She is a rodent's mother's instincts - a really, really bad and alcoholic hamster! She is very funny and very worth seeing through the movie. She loved her when she learns she drinks from a hot water bottle filled with gin as well as she can not make money selling her twins. The delay in this film has a heartbeat heart beat change - I've compiled it. <br /> <br /> The woman who gave birth to the baby still born. Surprisingly, afterwards, women put the lady back in the same ward as they wait to give birth to her !!! A silly woman who wished you had lost a baby some time ago wandered from a psychiatrist. She insisted that she had a baby. Later, she will escape again and actually takes one of the children <br /> <br /> There are more stories than this but what I say is important. As I mentioned, it is sophisticated and very fun - very sad in many stories. Especially in the end, heartbreaking and unusually well done. There are some good performances in particular as Farrell and Alyn MacMahon's head nurse. I do not know why it's a very good movie - and some years later (it's typical for Warner Bros.) I thought I'd remake the film.
