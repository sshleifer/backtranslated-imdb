There are a lot of errors after the science fiction masterpiece started in 1936 after the editors left it. It is very surprising to see visually, but the script allows many intellectual speeches about war and progress. Many times the most inspiring messages are read. Royand Massey and Cedric Hardwick, both of whom are great actors, and many fans. Ralph Richardson "The Boss" is very good for a megalomaniac warlord. The assumption of World War II was very strange that the world was the most devastating controversy in human history. I'm sure the war did not happen as I did in this film. There are some panoramic mattezem sequences between different episodes of the film. If this is not as entertaining as I hoped, it will shout in the mind after watching it.
