There are not too many reviews, so I thought I would add one. <br /> Do not go through other reviews! <br /> <br /> RKS is one of the few Indian directors with a very good picture. <br /> <br /> AB and Akshay have greatly given another example. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not think we should be able to do it, <br /> <br /> The longest film, <br /> <br /> The Akshay film that will be waiting for the next RKS and the next AB, <br /> <br /> The theme is very well played and If she continues in the same manner in the future, she will have to do well.
