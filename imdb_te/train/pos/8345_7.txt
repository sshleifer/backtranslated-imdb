I recently watched. And even though I'm not the kind of sexy romantic comedy, I think it's just a nice and sweet movie to watch. My opinion is very true. Do you know when you're watching a movie and you think you will steal it for taking anything from the story, and as the director looks like it's trash? The story between scientists is a sweet and funny one. How they stuck together and tried to help them become the role of Tim Robbins. It's simple because it likes the story of love between Tim and Meg and it's simple and brings a good point when it comes to love, "Nothing is what it looks like". I would recommend it on Sunday morning. <br /> <br />
