I wondered when I heard about the Ralph Baki version of "The Lord of the Rings": What is 'Rotoscope' Animation? Well ... I finally found out ... three years ago I saw this film without thinking of Ralph Bakshi ... and I liked it a lot ... very good story ... it also improved a small character which is great for a cartoon Is ... If you're bored with contemporary animation see it ... can not get me wrong ... I'm not telling a nice cartoon ... it's a pretty good movie ...
