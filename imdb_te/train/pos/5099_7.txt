<br /> <br /> When I came across this film it was in the LITTLE MISS marker DVD and I do not recommend watching it though you do not like the well-known image yet. <br /> <br /> We are Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard a Can Man and his colleague. The film starts out very easily, but his daughter using his daughter is forced to take a lot of money from his brother-in-law, rather than to meet the girl and see her with discipline. <br /> <br /> Cooper and Lombard are good and Shirley still steals her inner scenes. There is little music and Shirley is the only song. This is fun and it is worth looking along with the LITTLE MISS marker.
