For the last 28 years (my first exposure to the show), I can say: once you get it-it's always with you. <br /> I saw two parts later and did not seem to suffer. A year later I was able to get the whole series from the very start and quickly surrounded the story of Pittersweet of human error and perspectives on happiness. Yes, the exhibition has a style that is not for everybody, and I'm sure the dated product value is now hard to fix. <br /> <br /> Previously, I thought about the show at least once a month. A show for these women)
