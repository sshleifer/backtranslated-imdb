The film about this life, the triumph of trials and the wonders of the human soul. I am telling everyone to not tear the end of the film. It's more than just a tear-jerker, its attractive, thought-inspiring drama with great performances in all castes, but especially in Luke and Denzel Washington. 7 years later, I'm still surprised that Luke is still a real unknown and another film directed only by Washington. Nevertheless, it is the story of this promotional child tests and difficulties to build up slowly, and how it still affects you in a younger age, after watching you for a long time. Like many faux searchlights, this is a big part of a sleeper hit and has not received critical acclaim for it deserves. Antwon finally filmed for me to meet her mother, there are many ways to do it and it could be all scouting or it could be dubious, but Washington correctly hit the right tone, his mother never said a word and just a tearful clown, antowne when asked why. She can prevent her from committing any high crime, and how can she tell her how to save herself? One of the most feature film scenes I've ever seen.
