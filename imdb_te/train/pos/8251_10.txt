And this is me for someone else. And not only myself, I can see here at IMDb or leave the theater. Why did people like it? It's obvious: everyone knows the signs now (at least the horror fans heart and others "Dead of Dead" innovation or Resident Evil Movies etc) <br /> Everything about zombies ... until this film came along. And you will see zombies in a new light (maybe). It's not a horror film, it's a comedy, although it has some violent scenes. A sarcasm is accurate. And it's not out of steam! So I made it up. It's incredible, acting is very good and there are no (obvious) mistakes in the script ... On the contrary: It's a gem and if you're interesting to zombies, you should see it! And even if you do not like them, see it! Because it's a great (comedy) movie!
