I love this movie! The animation is great (for the pokemon image), cgi is very awesome. I loved music in this movie. <br /> <br /> For the story: Its great. It's a great feeling of friendship. Celby is very beautiful and powerful Pokemon. Ash is very good in this movie, and I like his friendship with Sam. The only thing I do not like is Suicune's performance, he suddenly goes out, helps a bit of leaves & leaves and leaves. <br /> <br /> But overall, the awesome movie! You can not wait to have the USA version in Dvd!
