Based on the preview I saw, I went to "shower" looking forward to a sweet little comedy; I found a deeply touching play of family life mentioned in some of the most lush photographic films I could ever see. Additionally, the following reflection has given me an impressive cut in the past scenes (in the rural villages of North China and Tibet): how does it work? <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie, but I put between the two. <br /> <br /> Another Asian comedy "Shall We Dance"? Was released in the United States. (Japanese). With just "shower", it was not a slight reference to the depth of the film, it turned out to be a micro psychological study (though funny moments were full). Is there a fear to film "important" or "deep" films to appeal to the U. S. audience as part of distributors?
