I really really love this show! I always liked the Ghosts 1990's Ghosts! The show is fun and I can not believe why this kind of funny show in the cartoon network's adult swim air. I hope they put this show on DVD or something. Show Broke (from Space Ghost Cartoons, SGCC and Cartoon Planet) spends his everyday life with his best friend, who loves to leave his mother and Dad and many of them! My favorite episodes have not given him any money because Zorak gets this good singing and his voice Zorak is all singing. Braque and Jorac did not close their home and then they would go back from Sunday to Friday and they just jumped up and they went back home the day they went home and then they did not have the current homework! Brock's father and their neighboring neighbors, Thunderouses robot entered this profession and they could eat through a huge worm. Another episode that I liked was that Zorak stood on a bully and some new man took his stand. I like other episodes too! Zorak is a thing that never fails to make me smile when hitting up, blast and jap!
