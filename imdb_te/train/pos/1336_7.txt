This is usually a good film with good story, good actors and great songs. Cinematography is unfortunately bad. The weaker points of the film are the unpleasant chain of sequences copied from Pretty Woman. Why? Does it hurt some realism, Abbas's effort? Mastan? <br /> <br /> The film is about the newlyweds couple, Raj and Priya (Salman - Queen). Priya had a risk of her pregnancy during the last pregnancy, and eventually decided to use the surrogate mother to carry their children. They chose Madhubala as an abusive prostitute who played Preeti Jinta. The image is not really realistic, I mean, is not it easy to adapt? And even if they choose a girl, does it mean that the man is sleeping with her? Did you hear about miscarriage? <br /> <br /> I think the authors have heard it all, this film is not made, so this concept is clear. <br /> <br /> Salman is very good. It is good to see him play a big role. But his role is to know his wife how to sleep with another woman, suffering from unwanted and inexpensive dialogue about his great love. Come on, it's cheesy and unreal. Queen is just okay; She is generally effective and tries to do something with the character but the prettiest jinta is completely covered. <br /> <br /> The film stole a large display with its flawless performance and was fantastic. She will transition from a big prostitute to an easily and naturally sensitive woman. She lives in the film, loves her and loves her and at the same time her role is partially worshiped because she is due to magnetic and positive personality. This is one of the best performances of his career. There is no doubt she has more expertise than the industry's contemporaries. <br /> <br /> The end of this film will just highlight what I say above. It's tear-jerking, exciting and well-acted. <br /> 7/10 for this film! 10/10 - For Prettiness!
