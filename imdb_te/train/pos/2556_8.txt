And the movie is also made for TV movie. It's acting and the plot is just too great. I thought it was turning my mind into movies I saw because after seeing it, the repar was afraid to kill me through my computer screen. <br /> <br /> Antonio Sabbato Jr. has played a magnificent role in the film, along with Janine Turner and Robert Wagner. I had never thought that the film was just too complicated and the low-budget TV movie was very powerful because it wanted me a lot. After watching this, I have read this novel (four times) the film is great. If you ever watch this movie on TV, I want to see it. The effects of this film are beautiful, and I honestly do not know what the live calculating human looks is, but the FX Team made this film so I'm impressed and it shows all of these TV movies where low budgets are not very bad. It's great, really it's not!
