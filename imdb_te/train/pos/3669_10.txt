The film binds the abusive summary of a repressive American patriot actor - believes his work (and politics) is crucial for the president's views to the American people. Allen Bates definitely conceives this view as Michael Bates, and I remember the role of Bates in the role. This is a single image for Canadians and Americans. It portrayed a valuable piece that allows viewers and producers to make audience through magic that makes it easy to lose control over actors and numerous out-of-the-wills. Strangely, "Hollywood North" does not have this image: Peter O'Brien directs with precision and complete control, and the film 'The Flight to Bogota' with a serious 'back-scene' episode and film-in-the-clarity and intuition. If you are interested in the wit and strength of the Canadian cinema, "Hollywood North" is a great place to start.
