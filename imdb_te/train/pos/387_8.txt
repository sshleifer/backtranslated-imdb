This image is good. It's not the best of the great CG Kung Fu Flix but its pretty good. First, the story is good. The whole idea of ​​the dealings with the fallen gods vs gods with super powers is very good. My problem is that many characters! They got so confused when the scenes changed! Special effects are incomplete! Combat scenes are very fast and complex. This film has produced practically all computers. Acting as anticipated from such high-profile players is always amazing. Ekinen Cheng plays an amazing role, a lonely character. Zhang Gai did nothing to me in this film. I thought she would have a bigger piece but she made a fighting scene and climber. The bad guy, the entire skull army and the whole blood cloud thing is very frightening. The music is awesome. For me this story deserves at least a small-series and not just an image. Cram has a lot of story in 2 hours. Perhaps if there is a book or something, I would be able to keep all the letters and details. The story sacrifices the integrity of the story for action. I'll storm riders today.
