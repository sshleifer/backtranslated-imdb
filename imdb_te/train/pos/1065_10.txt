<br /> <br /> Dark Angel, a genetically enhanced young woman from her creators, focuses on Max (Jessica Alba), a future science fiction series set in post-apocalyptic seattle. <br /> <br /> The Dark Angel universe is an interesting and incredible set of sets (like Buffy, but not absorbing). Definitely, it's not for everybody, but those who give time will find themselves in a very happy series there. Dark Angel was criminally neglected, underestimated and canceled unfortunately after 2 episodes. This is a great shame because it is capable of this great series, although its 42 episodes run only the BBC Science Fiction comedy Red Dwarf. Dark Angel is incomplete, so seek it out, and if you want more, lobby fox needs to make another sequence.
