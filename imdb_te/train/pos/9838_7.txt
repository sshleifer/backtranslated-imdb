Born Again is the episode of Season 1. The rebirth bit, in my opinion, is good. The more I'm looking for, the more I like it, the more it's 'pretty cool' forever. Though it's very memorable, I always remember it as a rebirth episode. Anyway, I'll tell you that this episode is good and bad. <br /> The Good: Ooragam. <br /> That fish tank is great. <br /> <br /> When thrown out of a window. Very classy. <br /> <br /> Bad: Get married to your best friend's wife! <br /> <br /> Why did the man who killed his scarf be killed and tried to take his scarf? <Br /> <br /> Conclusion: Okay, the episode is not very memorable. 7/10
