This is one of Disney's first five animated features in my opinion. Cinderella has a full-length feature animated film (as opposed to 40's extracurricular images) and a return to expensive depth by multi-level camera. If the story is somewhat simpler in the story, you will collect the medieval idea of ​​dressing and stylistic styling - a clear story story. <br /> <br /> Cinderella is more mature than Snow White, and the multi-dimensional character. Actually, all the characters are somewhat better than the prince - we have left a lot of flat - we know he has a sense of humor and a great smile, but it's all there. Like Snow White, Disney has a lasting effect on the story of popular culture --- In most of Cinderella's style, the stereotypes are attractive, not just like Cinderella, and their character takes away from their pretty-looking appearance. <Br> <br /> Favorite Disney additions: mice! Moreover, the continuation of the sequel - Cinderella always loses her shoes in the film. Along with the gown in the house, the following attacks from the stairs were always awful - I showed the viewer with a black background and a big red light on it! The broken slipper shows the aversion of the evil Lady Tremine to Cinderella's defeat --- all Disney villains in Adly Sleeping Beauty, Satan's witch loses Maleficent's most vicious character.
