This is a very good movie. I do not know if this was a spoiler comment, but I did not want to take the chance. However, at the end of the film, the prosecutor has read a Scriptural poem, and then refers to other feelings from memory. He does not read the first reading, but the second is Genesis 9: 6. He says in Genesis 9:12, but in fact, verse 6 says. This is a common way many people use to defend the death penalty. It is very bad that the lawyers today do not quote the Bible. Will anyone ever hear any of the first Supreme Court Judge John Joy in this country's history? He said that the Bible is the best of all books. It's very bad that we missed that opinion in America.
