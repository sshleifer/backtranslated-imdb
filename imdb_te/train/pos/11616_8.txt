I have read greatly about my earlier comments in this film and I have a better understanding of the previous user's comment on the film: From the perspective of Israel, if the film touches on the most closely related issues and the lesser the details of the director's picture, Have importance Imagine well. 'Distortion' was screened at a Film Festival in Geneva in November 2005 (Festival 'Sinema Tout Irran)', where it won the Audience Award (French 'Prix du Publin'). I would like to work with Mr Bouzaglo, the 'nervous camera', which, in my opinion, is very seriously portrayed the atmosphere of extreme tension and dissatisfaction in the film, and I think this is very appreciated by the Swiss audience. However, this view can make Israel one of the viewers 'alien', but it is not surprising when it comes to Swiss audiences, because Switzerland is not subject to any terrorist attack. It judged viewers in Geneva with a more 'separated' view of the audience in Geneva. When I interviewed a Geneva newspaper (translated from the French) I would like to quote what Mr. Bogaz said. "We have been here for 50 years and after all the violence here, we can ask if it is still possible to be usual and sometimes we can think of suicide rather than a lifestyle." We look like the roots of my movie. The reason is that he is somehow a personal detective called 'Yiyur' in this film, because he takes the system of thanks to the system and takes advantage of the situation. The main thing in this film in the opinion of myself and the Swiss people is that we did not pay attention to some irregularities in the role of the previous film criticizing the film with great accuracy and humor. So, it's a different perspective with different countries, but I feel that this movie is good because it feels like it's going to affect the film's future, this is a 'unique' formatted 'way of thinking.
