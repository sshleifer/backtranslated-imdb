I watched the Perfect Sun three times. I can not see how this film is a homosexual, I'm not homosexual, but I can not see it as homophobic. I can not see why a film with a gay character is a movie about a gay character and every film is definitely gay. I find that the movie is sympathetic to the death study, and your cousin is death. I want to change her life very soon after Theo's rehab, because she can repeat her life by seeing her brother die. Ryan reveals that when he found out that he was moving too much to Theo Ryan, I found the dialogue in the scene, and he wanted to know who he was not to watch or share with. That's not terrible and sad? I recommend a lot of movies.
