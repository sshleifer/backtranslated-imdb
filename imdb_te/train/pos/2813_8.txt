This is a complex documentary showing many things about early gay life. The term used for homo-sexual revolution in Gay, and the Gaye is not just a feature. Or is it still used today? <br /> <br /> I believe that the film has come from 1968 to 1989. It was released in 1993, so it is roughly the same. <br /> <br /> I love one person's love of another 20 people and documentaries year long. Love is the only expression of true love. There are many scenes of wonderful empathy and pain along with the scenes of happiness and happiness. There are scenes of life as a homosexual-sex and life. <br /> <br /> At least one person will get out of the film to understand the devastating impact of AIDS in the film. I'm thinking of how long it will take me to this picture when I write. In the medical, political, and social sciences and culture, the film's development has been amazing (15 years ago). However, apparently, in case of AIDS's disease, we have not done yet. I guess we did not do all the fields. <br /> Anyway, it's pretty. I'd encourage anyone that they do not understand much about gay life, gay problems, or the devastation of AIDS to watch this movie.
