I'm very much in love with this movie, I'm never sick of watching. Riff is perfect for everything else, except for the only line but not really the stomach when she calls a young lobotomy. I have never been a fan of PJ Soles and she did not help anyone to hear Ramones until she filmed this film, but I did not care much for her too much. This is a lot more people to see and over Ramon's fans and really .. The only reason I love it too. I'm never tired of hah-hah, over his pizza lines or Joey mentor's name over and over the dilemma. Are you one of the best parts of the film, would you like to dance at the high school's halls? I loved them. The special edition DVD is a good repetition, surprisingly PJ Soles is not it. Perhaps she worked on another project * Laughter * Anything great, even if you're a Ramones fan.
