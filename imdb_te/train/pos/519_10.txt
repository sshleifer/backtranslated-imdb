20 years ago I first saw this film and never forgot. It is beautifully filmed and the story keeps a riveted for the entire time. The story is still fresh, it's hard to believe that it was made in 1946, and really makes it. Even though the film is special effects, I do not know much about the film technique. In addition, acting is amazing, and the use of English and American actors is quite believable. I bought a DVD now and can now see whenever I like it. I would recommend anyone interested in post-war British films to see this.
