Hanson Brothers - Andy (apparently his action) and Hank (obviously does not have his act) needed money. <br /> <br /> Andy comes with a plan to get some flour that has the consequences for the entire Hanson family. A layered, full-blooded roller coaster ride that knows exactly what it does. As a criminal drama / thriller I am happy that it is not 'the country for the old men.' While the two films supply plenty of character play and thrillers, the 'devil' is much more towards the thriller at its fastest pace. 'No Country' is a cold and bloody picture, you really worship, the devil is a bit more pleasant. There is little violence in the 'devil' than "living". Acting as well. In the past, sometimes wooden Ethan Hawk, jitters, sweats and deer-headlights-invade hanks. <br /> <br /> Philly Seymour Hoffman as Andy has the hardest scenes of the film and you become a fast actor, you believe that you can do anything. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong in this film. It jumps back and forth without confusing. Programs are not out of control, but the film does not always - the first timer directed by Kelly Masterson (the famous Sydney Lumet) and editing are tight as a drum. In many disciplines, the award belongs to California, although films such as 'The Departed' and 'No Country' have revealed this. If you liked that, you'll like this.
