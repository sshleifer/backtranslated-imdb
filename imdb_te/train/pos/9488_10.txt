The most memorable, intelligent and breathtaking image from Henry Vernule, a true maniac in French movies. This plot is the perfect parallel to the JFK murder and it takes place in a detailed, fictional country. Image, visually and plot-wise, razor-sharp. Henry Volne, who portrays himself with the precise accuracy, follows the prokarner, who takes her to revolt. In many ways, this is a very disturbing picture, not least of its cool and analytical accuracy, called the modern state internal performance. The atmosphere and the characters are all reliable, and Venuevell did not give a chance in its tight plan. On another level, this relatively low-profile film has the head-start of 15 years at Oliver Stone, the only "JFK" film that has been praised for its film, although it is low-quality in many areas and is less reliable ... It's a masterpiece, a cinematic lover, It is preferred in its original French version.
