If you like Roman Polanski's "reluctance", you will probably have to consider the "tentent" from the same feeling that "Pontent" comes to Poland and plays in Schizophrenic Waco. Secondly, "Rosemary's Baby", secondly, is one of my favorite of his movies - and a straight forward journey to the mental collapse of the person moving into a suicide victim's former apartment. Other residents of the building are as haphazard and stickers in reducing the level of sound - the slightest 'deaf' can also become a big deal and a polons, he is more disillusioned and surrenders to his folly hallucinations. He comes to the point of dealing with dressing and former tenant and finds it's just time before he decides to pull back the window as he closed it ... If the film is a bit slower and daval, but if you see the movie in Roman Polans, it ends with a bang And this film is disappointing Adani you need to know. If you do not quarrel with the intricacies of the mantle and are madly taken to a descent, it's best because it's pretty tripy surrender at times. Polans is a daring, good-looking resident, attracting many Isabelle Ajayan. We also get to see it running in the drag, at the same time worrying and hilarious! Damn, he does for an ugly chick! So, Polanski fans - in fact, his thirty-year pedophile allegations can be seen last - should enjoy "rented" as an entertaining mental head trip ...
