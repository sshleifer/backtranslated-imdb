Steve Biko was a black activist who tried to prevent the white minority that ruled South Africa as he tried to prevent the British Empire's immigration in India. Richard Attenborough's Cry Cry is not about Freedom Bicco or apartheid, which concerns Donald Woods, the editor of the White Liberal newspaper, who has suffered his life trying to tell the story. After the death of Becho's death in South Africa's "Police", the film is the jarring point of the visual switch. Woods, played by Kevin Klein, must decide whether to do the right and to publish books about biko or to leave the country to pressure his wife, who played Wilton in the piano. In that case, Bayco was not in vain. The life-friendly friendship between the beaco and woods becomes a standard by the numbers in the border yarn after Bicco dies. Oscar-nominated Denzel is a good American film as a biko, but something wrong in a movie trying to portray the struggles of apartheid by focusing on more than half of the white families efforts in the film. Attenborough further improved his material by focusing on the importance of biko rather than the beginning of a friendship with Boto Woods. Probably the main actor in a 2 1/2 hour movie, the black actor did not help the big box office, but the film was immensely overwhelming at the box office. Besides film politics, the film still sends and sends a message or two messages in PG-purified fashion. *** 4 stars.
