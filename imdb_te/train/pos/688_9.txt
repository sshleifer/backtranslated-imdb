I had the pleasure of seeing this film at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and was very impressed. Tess Nanavati is clearly a great story writer and I see more about her movies. If she could do her work with the budget of this film, I am very worried about what she can do in a big film. Their magnificent performance is the cast of the cast (the little girl is in gold), and the music is composed. Fallen "Roe Your Boat" fell away from me. A very creative movie all around .... I really hope it'll come in the video or DVD because it'd buy it in a second. If you get a chance, definitely watch this movie.
