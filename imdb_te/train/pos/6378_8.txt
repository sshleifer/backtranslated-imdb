Atlantis: The best movie of any Disney movie I've ever seen in The Last Empire is the smoother animation and intelligently written conversations. In the first 15 minutes I persuaded it. I especially love Vincez√£o Santorini and Joshua Morrison's voice work on Don Novello's voice on Phil Morris. Exactly in the first film - exactly the same picture seems to move at least double pace is very bad. An important aspect of any Disney movie is the satisfying villain - it does not provide Atlantis. He is better than average. The film is half a simple twist. That's it. This is a great movie. Everyone should check it out.
