My friend Peter Jackson came up with the idea of ​​seeing the animated LOTR after seeing The Return of the King. So I finally purchased it, and thought it right from the beginning. Actually, I was not really as bad as I thought it was. The animation is good for its time, they use a unique technique of blending live action with animation to create some interesting effects, and a voice alerted by Frodo who is a voice alert was somewhat alert. <br /> <br /> A great follow up of a book, but trust me, I've seen it far worse. It skips a lot of things because it is compressed into a two-hour film in both Fellowship and The Two Towers. Definatley is worth a watch, kids preferred, but still, no match comparator absoutley with the Peter Jackson trilogy.
