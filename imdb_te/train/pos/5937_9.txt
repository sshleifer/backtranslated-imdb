After watching "Batman Dead End", I do not know what really matters from the world's best. Of course, Superman and Batman. I have the best comic books team up in my world. <br /> <br /> When you've seen this 3-and-a-half minute trailer, it made me want to make someone a serial fan movie for Worlds Finest. <br /> Definitely, Superman is some cheesy , But the movie trailers in the theaters give you only the specific items of the whole product, teasers are not always a true full-length picture .. it's a wealth This looks like a whole product is required. Other than achingly poorer Perry White who plays a relative of director Sandy Collera <br /> <br, the actors do not have much. If Nina Kaczorowski is a good Louis Lane, the actors are going to appear to fit the bill to this film, although the actors believe that I was particularly close to giving the character to a close-up character. <br /> <br /> Clark Bartram is dressed in Batman dress from the Dead End, but it should be a bit more updated and we are in the middle of us not like 40 batman with 80s leather cape and mask. His attitude is like Batman, but I'm still surprised by the reliability of white contact lenses instead of allowing his eyes to be visible to the eye. I believe it's close to the comic role than the goal personality of the goal. /> <br /> Michael O'Hearn Superman, can not play for a long time. He stands on the face of the goofy on his face, "kill me." And line delivery seems to be a problem with him. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would love to see the full story and movie based on these ingenious things. It is rumored to be the world's financed film, and with the correct additions to the script. More hope to do this.
