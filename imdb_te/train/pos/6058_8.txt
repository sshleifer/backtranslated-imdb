This is a well-documented documentary in the exciting world of indie car racing. Photography is just outstanding. The scene was run by Mario Andretti, an old racing highway on New England Street with old maps, flying to the speed of the car, and amazing. The film will lose its beauty on the small screen, but if you like to see the cars that run their limits, watch this movie.
