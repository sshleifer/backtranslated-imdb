I saw Broadway music by the same name, but never seen the Gray Gardens. Friends warned me that if I did not see the film, it was not musical. It did, but it was inspired me to rent the movie. First, I thought it was a train wreck, strange, shrieking characters, and it was very hard to see. But to stop it, make it realize why Gray Gardens will be considered a memorable documentary to digest and go back to go back to it. <br /> <br /> Big Big Yeti and Little Edy are both unforgettable and full of inability to self-conscious. Both of them are beautiful despite their aggression. They are cooling any woman (and undoubtedly some men) and they have to relate to your mother to review your own affairs. <br /> <br /> When reality television and cinematic are commonplace, it is pleasurable to see the work of Malleys about three decades ago, and understand what the film is like. <br /> <br /> How are their family allowed in such a shirt? But in the 1970s how can two people escape the reality of reality? Or do they feel very crazy to help? I would recommend watching this comment very well, which gave me extra insight into the film.
