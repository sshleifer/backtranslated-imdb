I realized that all people hate this movie, but it should be a one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> First, I do not give people credit for the story, but back to the future, time. The movie is a time travel and a spiritual journey. <br /> <br /> I have seen Kean and Alex in this movie, they are cool, but they are cool, <br /> <br /> The design of this film is also awesome, these sets are very comprehensive and are very heavy at times and It is difficult to believe that the sets are made for about two films. Young buds rarely spell ... but the intellectual of the entire franchise, Than life characters who are responsible for the amount of umi utopian future is not bigger than these two idiots. <br /> <br /> Clothing design assom is similar. Bill and Ted are really good in the Bogus Journey, they see it as spectacular stunts, they put it, <br /> <br /> The music in the film is rare, especially. I can say about this movie, I loved it. But one of those movies I grew up with and I was more interested in it, so I can understand why people hate it or what it means when compared to its Bagos Bags adventure (which also I love). <br /> <br /> With the help of your clothing self!
