Telemundo should definitely consider making the novel Xica's DVD collection! I know the tons of things I like to buy the novel Xica! It's the most entertaining novel in Brazil. The costumes that the actors wear are beautiful and the town where the novel is beautiful. Xica has a long history of that period. I am going to telemundo again at 2 o'clock in the morning. If I ever show it again in Telemando, I would like to see XICA. I again made a million e-mails of telemando again, but my petitions fell on deaf ears. The only warning statement about Xica is that it does occasionally have some tough scenes so I recommend not having to watch Xica Children under 14. Overall Xica is great for 10 to 10!
