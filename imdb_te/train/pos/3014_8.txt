This fantastic hoodwink was soon the first model to become the most popular painting. William Powell is delighted to see a detective story with a charm and charm and a silly attitude of his character Nick Charles (from the "narrow man" range). Although the story is good in its own, I really think this movie makes fun of Michael Curtis' fantastically predictable direction. From a visual perspective, it is a richly designed movie, showing the amazing command of Curtis Medium; From Split Screen Images, Kurtz demonstrated that he is one of the best Hollywood directors, with strange camera angles and predictable past. If you're a fan of this kind of movie then it's fine.
