LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT I was the first film I saw in 2000 and I doubt it will see a good one this year. This beautiful tragedy by Belgian filmmaker Benoit MÃ¡rhez is located in Wallonia's industrial belts. Benoit Paulwevde's father wants his son to win for a car (a Lada!). To do this, the son must break the record opening doors. He wants his son to have a son because he has never been more to a newspaper than a local newspaper called L'Espoir (Hope). Of course nothing works without planning. The film is better compared to Aki Kourismaki's drilling clouds, yet it is more dramatic and humorous. Similar to the film, the tone is cheerful and cheerful, rather than a discouraging and endless surge. Humor is irrelevant, the plot finds amazing pictures in cool settings that never seem to be unbelievable, and courtesy seem insidious. The best thing about LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT is acting by Poelvoorde. The actor is known for his incredible cult-classic C'est Aurewive Press Dee Chase Voice, in which he portrayed Ben as an attractive assassin. Since then, he has played two minor roles in the Netherlands, because he does not convince himself of his own acting capabilities, and that all the characters he has given will lose the role of Ben. There is no doubt about his performance after the lead role in the LCA. He's just smart enough to be bad enough to put his family into a family stupid and misery, but smart enough to realize what he's done and torn by it's remorse about it. Must see.
