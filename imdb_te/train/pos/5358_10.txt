This is one of the greatest films of the 80s in the MY collection that I think of all these days. <br /> <br /> Running man is also one of Arnold's best and most diverse films ever and I first saw The Running Man and I'm excited to see this movie. I adore all the battles and this is really a special image. It includes Jesse Ventura, the legendary Professor Toru Tanaka, Sven-Ole Thorsen, the beautiful Maria Konsita Alonso, Yafeetto, Kurt Fuller, Richard Dawson and Thomas Rogers Jr. He was killed in movies including Universal Soldier, The Lost World, Robot Cop 2, Predator 2 and others. All Arnold fans prefer this film from the beginning to the end because its action pack is star-studded and one of Arnold's best!
