The best comedy of all times by Koe to Tomo Pew. I have seen a lot of movies and comedies, but every time you see, tell me to make you smile. But the truth is that the humor in this humor is special. It is caratherisic for cerberia. And all well know the former Republic of Yugoslavia! So I think I'll enjoy the rest of the audience (for example: in Europe). Because subtitle hole is destroyed by the subject. But they should at least try !!!! Yes it is contradictory! This is the best film in Serbian history and it does not understand the world! :-) If you had the opportunity to see this one, do not blow up OK!
