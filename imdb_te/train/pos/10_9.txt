I'm a male, not given to women's movies, but this is a special story that's really great. I do not have a personal love for Jane Fonda as a man, but when she is Diniro's typical amazing auto, she does a good job. Everything is well done: acting, directing, visuals, settings, photography, cast. If you enjoy true people and true love story - this is the winner.
