<br /> <br /> When I was about 6 years old, I saw this film, I see the movie for a while, how big it is to find out on the DVD. And I'm very impressed. It was shown before Wang Disney's Jungle Book! <br /> <br /> I need to remember this film. I remembered that an Indian boy made friendship with an eagle. This is a great impression to me. For some reason he was thrown out of his village (the reason is unknown). When the other boys threw stones at him, he climbed up a rock and jumped. At that time he became a hawk and went with his eagle friend. An eagle was still wearing his turquoise necklace. <br /> <br />
