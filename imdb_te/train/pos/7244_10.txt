This is the full length movie about the bridge world. I found the first 10 minutes a bit slow, but after that, the film is perfect enough to describe how to describe professional bridge players and how they live. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are very fun. I do not think the non-bridge player will get this movie attraction. <br /> <br /> Some dresses are very beautiful, the film is black and white - I can only imagine how to look in color. The way the media portrayed is absolutely delightful. There is no way of land bridge. <br /> <br /> You can see it as soon as possible and tell your friends about it.
