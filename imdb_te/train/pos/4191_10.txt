The 1953 Sam Fuller film has some of his best work and its tragedy has not been able to continue to support his major Hollywood studios' support. The story line goes something like this. A tough hard wide (read on adultery) subway is riding a hot summer day, and she was chosen by Pocket Book Skip McCo. No Skip (and Dame) is unknown, and she also has some thumbnails that pass the spy look. This early shot without a conversation, and a lot of hard on the ups, is pretty much used throughout the film. Babe known as Candy Jean Peters, who is always looking good or better. She forgets how beautiful she is, and she handles this character well. Richard Widmark, a pickpocket, made his mark and was shot dead with a kiss of death with Kiss of Death in 1947, and he was still scary even though he was a little "soft" here. These hard edge characters are here and there are soft spots, but its noir and nasty all the way. The standout show belongs to the wonderful Thelma Ritter, who plays Stoolie Mo to save her dough up to pay her own funeral. Ritter received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for her performance, but the B girl in "From Here to Eternity" (as read as prostitute) lost Donna Reed's boring but popular appearance. Hollywood loves it when a good girl is bad, and Oscar loves them, even if their appearance is usually awful. For example, in the "Elmer Crane" of Sheryl Jones, set the docks and jumps of New York City, with a crisp black and white photography by great Joe MacDonald and some very good art direction. The powers of the river and nearby VidMark are built at the height of cold warfare and red scare, the villain of this episode played by a typical criminal, Richard Kiley, a loyal American trying to make a country of crime and make all of the above.
