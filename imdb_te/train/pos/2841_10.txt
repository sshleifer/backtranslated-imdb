As a Paris jitime fan, I went to see New York, I have high expectations. I was happy with all the expectations I met. It's funny, sweet, fast and entertaining. The film starts with two cab hoppers (Bradley Cooper & Justin Barta), trying to get to the same area and argue how to go. It's funny, and then goes to the movie in the best scenes I have ever seen. There are four miracles from all the good ones. I'll start talking to that four. Shia LaBeouf is a bellapse in a hotel where love is found in an older woman. The next is Orlando Bloom, a musician doing business with a woman played by Christina Ricky. Anthony Yelchin and Olivia Tirbyi are promoting two people, the role of Tirbyi has disabled. The best includes a Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman as an aggrieved old couple. I will bring you to the attention of actress Portman, who is directing and directing a caregiver about a caregiver, and as a flirtatious and sexy hunter of Ethan Hawk and Maggie Quik. New York, I Love You Is Good, 2006 Paris is not better than Jitime. The sketches are well displayed, and the film will show how the movies really look. The film does not have a number of well-known directors like Paris Zetime, so it's wonderful to live up to its merit. If you want to laugh, look at some great dramatic effects, see the magnificent amount of great performances, and just go to New York, I Love You, along with just fun entertainment.
