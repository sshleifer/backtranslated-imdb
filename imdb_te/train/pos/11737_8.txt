OK, this film is stupid. I mean it is a good way. It was deliberately stupid, and one of the good "stupid" movies I've ever seen. Jokes and gags deliberately bad, but it's distributed in the way that touches all the right notes with me. Supported letters are pretty shallow and mediocre. <br /> <br /> Here is the sight of Elvira's character. She is lovingly and adorable. Cassandra Peterson has a glowing acting talent in the film. The acting talent has her own obviously physical features. Some men did not agree with that. <br /> <br /> I have ear smile from the first scene to the end. Comedy is recommended for fans, and for lovely women's fans. I wish they made a dozen more LVIA movies.
