This is my favorite classic. In Philadelphia, PA I was shot in 1957 at the age of 13 and the following year was released. Then in the 1970's, I found myself working in the same county as a rookie PA state soldier. I have always experienced a lot of different scenarios where the scenes are filmed. I know the owner of Downingown Diner, and he has this road signing out, which says all commuter motorists are "home of Blob". The theater scene is located in Phoenixville, near the Valley Forge Park and is still showing images still!
