The film has taken a lot of stick. It was decided by critics when it came out and caused the destruction of Nicolas Cage's career. The thing I do not think people do is not mean that it is an epic, an image of an Oscar Contest, it's just some brilliant "Bruce Buster" action at its best. Fast cars, quick edits and great soundtrack - it's right on the tin. Also, to anyone who likes cars a pure treat. It is everything: Ferraris, Mercs, do not forget a Hummer and Eleanor! I want you to be a good action movie, and personally, to bring back a better movie! Then again it's me!
