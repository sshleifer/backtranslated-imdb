I saw Red Eye fun. It is not a masterpiece, but it is well directed and constructive. Sillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are good at character. Yes, this is an old old story with a different setting but Wes Craven gave a good pace. Not at least another scream with a general college killer. This is good when you can see a pure, unified thriller even when realism is not the main character. In particular, Craven has brought a lot of new ideas to the generation of thriller and horror from the filmmaker, and now he gives a good TV film to bring home at the theater. Good job!
