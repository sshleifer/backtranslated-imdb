The film is one of Tom Cruise's finest films. He captured the audience's imagination in the role of David Aries. His role is associated with everything. The story line is very clever and puts the audience on the edge. I saw Cruise movies a lot of time but after seeing it, it shows me real talent. My favorite part in the movie is that it all comes to a big end and the end where he finds the truth. If you do not see this yet, you should definitely try it. This is one of those films after you start watching, you look at the end or you keep thinking and you regret it. In my opinion you just have to buy it and I have to go and take the risk it has become one of my favorite films of all time. This is A * 10/10 if I promise to see you once, it will keep you along and you will always love it.
