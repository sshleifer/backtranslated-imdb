Some good location shooting in Ohio Power in this good TV movie about the worstly discouraged script by Peter Strauss and Pamela Reed and some of the best low-key performances and hard times in Ostebold. The mills close and union jobs disappear, blue collar workers threatened everyone: maintenance, owners, their wives and children. Strauss is absolutely reliable in his role, and Pamela Reid is as good as ever. <br /> Heavy Metal Score - Does anyone have a pun? - Sometimes, it's overly annoying, but cinematography knockout by Frank Stanley, especially the mill scenes.
