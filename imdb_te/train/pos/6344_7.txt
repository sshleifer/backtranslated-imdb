I'm engaged by Jim Carrey's work. I keep this film stuck in my head. Grinch in the Christmas Spirit, tell Grinch's childhood (very funny!), And all about Martha May, Cindy Laou (she's very absurd, her sweet innocence) trying to end the weak. I felt like babies and babies laughing, smiling, and going out of the theater, but the film was long and full of Dr. Esus's short film and is for all ages.
