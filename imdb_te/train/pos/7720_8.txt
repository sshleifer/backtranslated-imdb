Rabbi the Robot only knew about this movie I had seen. My first step in the 1950s is the one in the long line of fiery flicks of the popular cheesy cycle. How wrong are I Big studio, Big Budget and Big Production values ​​make this strong contender at least glaring to the outstanding sci-fi movie out of the era. <br /> <br /> "The war of the world" is much more bright and scarce than "Forbidden Planet", and possibly molded to go to foreigners' landscape. Immediately, a colorful presentation of cinematography, followed by Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidzion), describes the discerning and scope of the home and laboratory. But the icing is the only thing on the cake, the labyrinth underground that worked as a castle. It appeared to be more modern than "Star Wars", more than what Kremlin technology said. When the audience returned to the film, it was similarly feared for 1977 with SW, or to the theater with "Aliens" in 1986. Seeing in a big screen TV in my room gave me the same effect and I'm unhappy with exaggeration. <br /> <br /> It is not a story to imagine a "forehead planet" as an ancestor of the Star Trek 'TV series; Jean Roden Berry stated that the film had a great impact on the film. The followers of the short lived series immediately recognize the used plot elements here that have turned out in 'Star Trek'. When United's Planet's Cruiser C57-V's men went to the transport room, the element that used at least two or three times in the double series was confused by Robbie who made it impossible to respond. <br /> <br /> The film is essentially associated with the whole idea of ​​'monsters from the id' where the cerebral turn is taken. Morias used his first brain to save Altair IV, exactly as it was in 1956, when science fiction was dealing with each other Martians or other extreme space creatures. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/ " <br /> The calendar year is not 2200. The film is actually enough to explore and live on other planets. I think that though, they will have to come up with a sleeker looking version of Robbie.
