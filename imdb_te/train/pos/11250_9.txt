Compared to the pure masterpiece when compared with other Le Carres Minis about Smiley, nothing can do anything with Duff's hat, but it has many smiley features. <br /> <br /> About Smiley In Minis, it's Alex Guys, Smiley, steals the show - the rest of the actors support him, one can say. <br /> <br /> Here it is both collective and important, the main actor, Peter Egan in the final episodes, is not attractive to everyone. <br /> <br /> Egan likes a bigger and younger person, who is just like a magnus pum, a person who is crazy and willing to hear. <br /> <br /> Only his check handler is the person who understands his spy as Alex. <br /> <br /> The spy, and / or abusers' mechanism is not mentioned better! After learning about his life from a very young age, we fully understand that it allows him to be a traitor. His lying and fake everything is his ability to make him a 'perfect spy' because his check handler calls him. <br /> <br /> By following his life, we realize how difficult it is to go straight and narrow path. He also trundles on, even if he does not get anything out of the economy, unless promotion by his MI5 spy masters. Happy to everyone, if the flow of erased information continues! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> MacNay's father Ray McConley is a brilliant performer who does not have good money and always dreams schemes for people from their money. In the following years his son will have to bail him again. But his father and uncle, his father appointed as a savior when he goes to jail, and his mother is sent to a shelter, and Magnus quickly learns the beginning of the way of lying, not telling the truth. He first climbed up a bit, but learned to stay tuned, straightforward and stable over time from time to time to tell him and his dad to hear about his father. <br /> <br /> German inspectors who work actively in the UK during the war and during the war will create, with the help of his Czech handler Alex, Rudiger Weigang, British MI5 years British MI5 years, and a network of Magnus, which supplies British MI5 for years - After sending fake information to Das Wetland, agents turned themselves up, Liquid or Limited or just MI5 men Was on fire. <br /> <br /> In the youth years young franchises playing Magnus are awesome, and many of them are older, slightly more hateful, and more exotic than those played by Pim, Igon. <br /> <br /> You often buy the difference as you change from life change, sadness to sadness or indifference.
