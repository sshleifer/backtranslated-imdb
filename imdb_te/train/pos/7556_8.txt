Well, it's pretty good episode. <br /> <br /> Camera work is amazing. Best yet. I love the last shot. The atmosphere is amazing, the dress is great and guest cast (minus helpless victims) is strong. <br /> <br /> I do not know what I do not like about this episode. Why should I change sex? What is the purpose And are they aliens? What kind of? <br /> I've given this episode three stars. One of my favorites, but the plot holes trouble me. Still ... it should not ruin my entertainment.
