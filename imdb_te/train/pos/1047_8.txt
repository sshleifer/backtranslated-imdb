This is only the first time I really checked this movie (or not) the best actor Oscar (I still gave Oscar to Bogy, but Paul Lucas was great Job and at least nominated). Well, I'm glad I did <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was a little bit of teaching, but I did not care, I enjoyed the lectures and were bored with them. <br /> <br /> The character is great in this movie, Paul Lucas Betty Davis (wrongly nominated), George Cowauris and Eric Roberts, who plays the middle child, I really enjoyed his role : Odd-looking boy (Bodo) who sounds like a sort of feels funny. <br /> <br /> In g, it works for me as well, forcing me to do something he thinks is wrong when doing it for all the right reasons. I understand that, and I understand why he describes it. The message this film makes is a good and noble one, the scenery (meaning house) is beautiful, and acting is amazing. Watch this movie if you ever get the chance. <br /> <br />
