<br /> <br /> I first loved these reviews. Adventure, action, comedy, drama ... I think it's all good. Anderson, Topping, Shanks, Judge, Davis ... I love them. Davis appeared as the fifth most important figure in the cast. Not a big thing. But when his role (General Hammond) left at the end of the seventh season, when the departure from Anderson's role (Colonel O'Neil) Field went off, the quality of the series suddenly fell on a hill. <br /> <br /> After Seventh Season, Hammond has changed the series **** after seven seasons, although I have found it or something important. <br /> <br /> In the first seven seasons, however, are awesome. For the first time I saw Stargate film, but this was not an original intention, it was a wonderful setting for the series. I first saw the movie, then watch the first season of the TV series, and then watch the movie again (it's the second time around me messenger, trust me), and the last three seasons in the <br /> <br /> series are not nearly as good as the first seven, but Not that they are not good. <br /> <br /> When you finish this series, watch the Stargat: Atlantis series. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I found Davis dead a few weeks ago. This is a great loss.
