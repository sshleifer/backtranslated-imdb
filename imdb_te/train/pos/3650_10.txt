Sometimes, Lady Luck smiles at me. I actually did - and copied over - a VHS tape of this amazing TV show. <br /> Recently, when I subscribe to digital cable and searched through the upcoming movies, it was surprising that the film's schedule was broadcast. <br /> <br /> At this time, I have copied it to the DVD so I do not have the chance to repeat my mistake. <br /> After eight years I had to look again and again, when I first saw it. This story is mentioned in my first conversation with "Pandora Clock" when reading the book directly on public radio. I tuned to the home of my home for lunch, from the first installment, I was hooked. <br /> <br /> When I learned that I'm going to broadcast the movie a few months later, I made sure to clear my movie. Schedule for that event. <br /> <br /> First, I would like to say that this film is quite true in contrast to what another reviewer has said about the film. That is rare achievement for TV movies. <br /> Second, I agree with others about casting. I can not imagine Captain Holland better than Richard Dean Anderson. Literally, the film may have crashed and shot without a proper cast for this crucial role. Anderson was never better, and we were a shame that we did not see him more. In fact, all cast members did a great job. <br /> <br /> My only complaint with this film - And book - A private business jet arm "terrorist plot" air-to-air missiles and its pilot stalk and shoot down the painful plane. Usually, we are talking about less than 36 years, to implement and implement a plan like this scheme, which is not true for all participants of all players. <br /> <br /> Aside from that beef, I enjoyed building suspense and very negative <br /> <br /> If you have a chance to see this film, do it all.
