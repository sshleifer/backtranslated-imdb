A few days ago I realized that the makers of this film put words into its title. <br /> <br /> The film is not primarily the act of "riding giants", but mostly about the game's giants, riding giants, people who change the significance. <br /> <br /> In my teens I am from Black Wedge, one of the hardest-breaking and best bodyisurfing places in the world. I'm on the 15 to 18 feet surf, and in many cases 10 and 12 feet wavelengths are driven and driven. I'm so full of surfers in this film. The idea that Jeff Clarke could not get away with Maverick's BY HIMSELF riding for all shows, for a decade, is beyond my grip. The first safety rule of any water game is "You never ever surf / dive / swim." He was not where the people of Sen, and lived to say about it. If 75 degrees of water and sharks remain, I can not go out there. <br /> <br /> In the world of warm water: the first shot of the waves at jaws tears my skin on my body. These are not just scary waves, unrestricted-intestine-move waves. When we look at the remaining Layer Hamilton from 40 to 60 foot waves (I can not type those numbers), but actually I work out the faces of the day in Rinkan, I'm away. Anyone in the world has dedicated and focused on comparable large-wave riders. <br /> This is a great image. I think the Hamilton / Culma crew has the greatest wave riders in the world, and I think they will be mentioned because it replaced 10 instead of 10. Outside Log Cabins and Splice 10 in Ken Broadshaw!
