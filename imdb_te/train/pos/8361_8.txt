I have mixed feelings for "Les Valessas" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blair, but I like it. I call it obscene ("Dumb and Dumbler" is obscene, "the sweetest thing" vulgar and unforgivable stupid); I call it shocking and dangerous. I can understand why a lot of viewers, especially women, do not like or hate. It is the essence of evil (or so), and it does not mean that every woman they meet can not treat two opposing hearts. But the more I think I realize that it falls off as something a happy little gem. I am fascinated by how Blier could get away with it. The film is very entertaining and most enjoyable: it's well written, everything is the first class of acting, and the music is sweet and melancholy. In fact, when I thought about it, the two friends made the best of the women who came to them: they made a woman on the train (lovely and courteous blonde Brigitte Fossi began her film career, with Ren√© Clement's "Forbidden Games" (1952) at the age of 6) For two months she did not see; Eventually, a caterpillar materi-ane (Miu-miu) was abandoned and found to be a satisfied person; Isabelle Hubpart (one of her debut screen shows) enlightened and educated young and most loved. Those who met with Joni Moreau grew up with this comedy to a tragic level. In short, I'm not going to meet Gear-Claude and Pierroot of Gerard Dorardy's real-life pearroot and invite them for dinner, but it's good to watch the movie and go about two hours - it's not boring.
