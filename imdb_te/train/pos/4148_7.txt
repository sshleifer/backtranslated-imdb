Let's set it straight: This film is not redefining the genre, it is not Dr. Strangelove o Young Frankenstein. Amy Pohler, from Rachel Drach and ANNL and Indie Rani Parker Posey, is always lovely with three great female leads (no other comedy with similar characteristics). The story is fundamentally: three galley "losers" in college, and even after wards. Poehler is a helper for a dog trainer (who can not even get a date with a blind guy), Posey is a senator (he is an assistant for "not struck a man from the Clinton office" ... I'm a few minutes later ... I'm a bit slower !), And the drachma is a homosexual (SNL from Seym Meyers, funny). They should avoid the daughter of Senator's "uncool" (always the beautiful Amber Tombin from the TV series "Zone of Arcadia") to confound her during the spring break. So they have to go to see her, some more happiness meets. All in all, a light, simple comedy, very small, and very enjoyable
