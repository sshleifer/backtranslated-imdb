A good picture of a dawn! One of the least underestimated. The songs that children have played in this movie have hurt me, but there is hope for the future. Hoop Goldberg performed well here, but the actress who played the role of the best actress in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> This image should have a higher rating. I give 10/10.
