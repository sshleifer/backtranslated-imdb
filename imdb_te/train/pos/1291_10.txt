This is a good movie. Looking at money is ridiculous at a super rate, especially from a child's perspective. Take what it takes, a fun little picture about a kid's dream truth, and what a kid can do with $ 1 million dollars. Do not like it, it does not see. They make movies for viewers, and people who do not want to do so will not complain about their lives.
