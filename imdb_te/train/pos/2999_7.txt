There are times when this movie appears to get totally complicated than it needs, but I guess it's part of the charm of it. Detective Phileo Vance's powers of observation appear to be more than all Oriental officers in the era when the downside to the ultimate analysis of how the murders are committed. The kicker for me in the Chinese jad is falling down. I mean, did not anyone delete it? <br /> <br /> Vance (William Powell) had a line in the film about Archer Ko's 'mental impotence' to kill himself - for a while I had to think about it. I was surprised if I had some scientific evidence for the fact that I did not study psychology. <br /> <br /> The Doctor of Star Trek got me kicking from the caroner (Etienne Girardot) who was concerned with me. You know, McCoy said, "I'm not a doctor or a magician" and "I'm a doctor, not a detective". <br /> Once the killer's identity is revealed, it does not seem to be a big surprise, but it's really up to anyone's assessment. But next to Archer and Brisbane Co., the answer to the central question of the title of the film was not answered, and what was I really killed - who killed Sir Thomas MacDonald's dog Gilli?
