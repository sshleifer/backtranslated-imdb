At the age of 8 I saw the first time in this theater and it still cracks me. The Muppets are very good and they review the show business as innocent and refreshingly. Mice is my favorite scene starting a whispering campaign on behalf of Kermit at a fancy restaurant. This is a smart and funny movie for kids and parents. Kermit, Miss Piggy and the rest of the gang.
