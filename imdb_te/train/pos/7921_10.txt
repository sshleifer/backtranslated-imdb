It's just funny, look! <br /> There they need 10 lines. It's unclear of Wolf Movies with 50s / 70s. Many irony, some politicians. The early Clouseau movie (probably due to Alan Arkin), but with a low slapstick. If you want Naked Guns movies you'll love it (once again a little slapstick). <br /> Actually, there is a ridiculous social-political sarcastic joke from the sexual orientation (not in the teen comedy). The transition to the high school of the Moon from 50 to 70 is really funny. The sequence with changing presidential portraits is amazing! OK is probably not brilliant but still hilarious. 50 years of cold war are mental illness and tons (hysterical) fractures from the last 70 inflation. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, look at the movie!
