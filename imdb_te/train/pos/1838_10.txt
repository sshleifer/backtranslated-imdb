WAQT is exactly the perfect example of a chicken soup for your soul. <br /> <br /> The WAQT is surprising and frustrating because it comes from a visitor away from regular clocks. His first venture was the Hindi film, but in both of them, all the stereotypes of film principles. He failed to induce life in the entire package of WAQT, which was considered to be in the father-son relationship, while believing Vipulshah in the eyes of the blind men who steal the bank in Aankhon. A Gujarati drama received from Awaz Vala Fari Malisu, WAQT Backup has a brilliant storyline with a social message. A mature form of father-son relationships, a father is responsible for his son's love of love and responsibility for his son. Ishwar Chandra Sarawat (Amitabh Bachchan) owns his own kingdom to his own position and leads a wealthy life with his wife Sumitra (Shepheli Shah). Their only son, Aditya (Akshay Kumar), never had the need to fight, because he made everything in life and spoon flourished. <br /> <br /> Aditya dreams of becoming a superstar but did nothing to fulfill her dreams. Meanwhile, he married his Ladylive Mitali (Priyanka Chopra). Aditya marries a more responsible person but Ishwar thinks he is disappointed. <br /> <br /> When Aditya expelled Adity from his home, the end of patience would end. His favorite father's attitude towards him is a sudden change in his attitude and his now waiting wife Aditya. His wife and his unborn child did not have any choice to fight for livelihood. He starts to become a freelance but the conflict between his father and his father will increase. <br /> <br /> The storyline is very simple. They are easily recognized and relied on by the trusted characters of the father and the son. If you are not one of the two, you can see people in real life somewhere. </ P> <p> <br /> Direct handler of Vipul Shah With such a family affair, according to the Bollywood family drama film laws, no other director in his place was included in the film Tone in the film, which transformed the film into a compulsive tearjeker. <br /> <br /> A clear-cut example of his unmistakable directive is that the father's father expelled the son from his home before the break. In a rather tacky manner. Without a stab in the audience's brains, the scene's purpose was achieved. Ditto in the second half is now having a flippant conversation with the father's son separated. This separates WAQT from a KABHI leukemia GHUM or an EK Rhesata, and in fact it puts a level high level of treatment. <br /> <br /> WAQT still fail after all the differences? The problem is that WAQT is distinct from other people in its league in its treatment, which gives glitches in packaging. In the first half every now and then with what the director with the song-n-dance director. A Johar is a song song, a chopra kanta holi song, a father's son disco dandiya song, a dream song and a dream in the eyes of a viewer. The film ... The father just removes the son from his home and the son dreams of a song in the mountains of Morocco with his wife. No place! Because of the reason! <br /> <br /> The film moves in the first half and the original story begins in the second half. The director wasted much of the WAQT on unnecessary issues. Most dog talked about chase order is not bad but neither redeem. Akshay Kumar's taandav dance is just ridiculous. Imagine he deserved this movie (unintentionally) with the stunning hysterionic star Hunt. Add to Climax set at Star Hunt's Final, where son breaks with emotions. That's ideal! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The editing model is being shifted as a hiding factor for the change of attitude towards his son. <br /> <br /> Ano Malik's music is good. Santosh Tundyayil has enough competence to work on camera though. Atish Kapadia came up with some good dialogues for dramatic movements. <br /> <br /> Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav are the most influential of the light movements in the film. Rajpal Yadav has been dragging his comic histrionics in a number of films lately, when he shows little of his role and completely restrains. <br /> <br /> She is convinced that she is the mother of the mother. It should not be taken as a censure, but she is 'flawless' in her role and is flawless in both. Priyanka is brilliant and well maintained her role. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan are the main characters in the role. Akshay specifically, his father was deliberately appearing to him in the scene, intending to know about his responsibilities. <br /> <br /> For all, WAQT is like a soup, whose ingredients are tasty and nutritious, but the last recipe is not something that is very appetizing.
