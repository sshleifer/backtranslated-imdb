Drifter looking for a job may be a mistake in a small Wyoming town that leads to all kinds of problems. The cage is perfectly hoping to make a quick buck and hoping to get out of town but finding it unlucky she schmuck finding the title town escape. Hopper is playing a psycho known as "The Lail from Dallas," a true hitman, what he does best. Walsh, like a crooked sheriff and boyle, surrounded a Femme Fatale from a fine cast. The brothers John and Rick Dull script have delicious twists and turns, and creates an amazing "neo-noir" atmosphere in the direction of John. Witty and very entertaining, it never sucks the viewer in from the start and never.
