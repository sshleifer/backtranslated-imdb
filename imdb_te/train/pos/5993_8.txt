Cure uses the voice to create a serious mood. VO accounts for all images can not be omitted from Visual Story. The use of multiple film stocks adds a lot of text to the story. B & W and color combinations work well to maximize the choice of time. The result will jump, even if you can guess the result. I was particularly thrilled with the film suspense. The closest-ups to the love scene are also fascinating and a tasteful eye reflect. The piece is very small but has achieved a lot. Stiff editing can really help show what a short film can do. It's worth watching more than once!
