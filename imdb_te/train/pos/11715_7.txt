Cassandra Peterson El Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, this beautiful little horror spoof / comedy featuring all the most infamous horror hostess of all time. This means that the pilot vehicle for LVRR and it was a successful choice by the NBC network. They portrayed a pilot for a television series to display a black-cousin, but unfortunately the sit-com had never been on stage for the pilot because of its sexual references. But this film is very fun. Elvira is the modern-day Chesty Morgan and the queen of one-liner. The film was supposed to be a takeoff of older Roger Korman films through a series of continuous "Elvara's Hantat Hills", but flat on its face a few years later. Watch this movie instead for more entertaining experience!
