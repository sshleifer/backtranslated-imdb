I'm really watching this movie because it's being promoted as a movie that people love movies about nature. The film begins at the North Pole and shows the animals in different environments and associated with the film from the sunset to the south. The footage from the movie is very exciting and I have seen no shots on earth or in the sky many times. But beautiful, I already mentioned in the TV series 'Planet Earth' is a big part of the footage, narrated by David Attenborough. I found Planet Earth's Attenborough explanation better than the planet's description. 'Earth' is a movie. Attenborough skips a lot of scientific details covering his 'Planet Earth' series. For example, a tropical ocean for Earth Humpake whale is an ideal nursery because there are some hunters. Planet Earth says that a tropical sea is a good nursery, water is low in oxygen and does not have enough nutrients to support larger animals, larger sharks, and I have a significant difference. This creates a good documentary with Planet Earth, more than Earth, with AtonBroe's very high voices. Still, though, I think the fact that it's worth looking for beautiful footage of land and makes it even easier for kids to understand it.
