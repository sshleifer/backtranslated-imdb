I have to admit - the only reason I bought this movie is because I'm a big fan of Gate and a huge fan of Hyde. I enjoyed the feminine eye but I am very happy with the little cheesy story. I mean, the summary really sounded there. And now I have finished watching it - the world of its brilliance is necessary to say! Both Hyde and Gasket gave heartfelt performances, and my eyes were still hot from the continuing crying across the film's last half. You sucked into the story, and you really feel for the characters in the end. The element of vampire - it's my love, but it's easy to ruin the exaggeration or the movies - deftly combine with the storyline to make it simple and usual, rather than a random unnecessary addition to the story. I first gave a place in nine of the 10 ... After that I went back and tried to think why not giving up. Nothing. So ten ten in ten. After all - I'm not quite a critic - the fact that I am either really bothered to hate the film or write a review by all that really love it. Tell me where I am with the Moon Child.
