We are here. A man seems to be in pain and people want to help him - in different ways. Finally they have to let it go. You can not correct people. <br /> <br /> This story is not about Charlie Finlayman (Adam Sandler), who has gone from the 9/11 aircraft to PTSS almost into the mental state with his wife and three daughters. It's about Charlie Allen Johnson (Don Cheadley), his roommate in Dental school and his tragedy, about spots on the street and a Charlie's dentist in New York. Charlie revolves around a small toy motor scooter - a beautifully fictitious instrument for discussions to Manhattan Traffic - with big headphones with unruly hair. Sandler's main prop up to show that he showed up with the hair. <br /> <br /> Charlie is a catastrophe, but contrary Alan is sitting with a regulating wife (Jada Pinkett Smith), soon begins to envy him. Charlie lives as a nutty teenager with a trust fund (insured money from the tragedy) and Allen "log out", "Chinese eat" records, or Mel Brooks Marathon is a representative. Charlie's a big home living in a bigger apartment, a kitchen back and over, collecting Springsteen's ancient vinyl, huh, etc., and playing a video game called Shadow of Colorado, on a big screen in a big game. The aunt is very concerned about him, but we are somehow angry as we learned later. Alan has a new patient. Charlie's disappointment makes us look Alan's. <br /> <br /> Charlie and Sydler are an odd couple, but it does not matter, because it attempts to partially allow Charlie to escape his own styling realities. They convince each other that they need each other. Charlie's disappointing friend, who never knew his family, was desperate because he did not play any one to avoid his loss. So why is a roommate Charlie nude and sleepy and have a terrible musical taste (any motown)? Alan wants to escape from his coolest, lost life. He was not just his wife but was under the thumb of his dental partners, even though he was in practice he was Lord to him. <br /> <br /> There are also a vicious pedophile from the severely damaged hell to the teeth's office, but when Charlie arrives she begins to look different, babe. His libido seems ready to be restored in any minute. <br /> <br /> He also helps a psychiatric chest in the same building when he tries to treat Charlie, admits that he needs help. <br /> <br /> Sandler's insane scenes are a little theater, there are plenty of plot equipment (actually this movie feels like a game at more than one point), but there is so much monologue where he expresses his distress in the deeply touched ways. <br /> <br /> Charlie's merely delusional and sad, dangerous and violent, and his efforts to help him backfire. The film is admirable to understand that people can not do it properly. Sometimes a touching one - this is a very interesting movie - and it was the first time that 9/11 survived. But there is an element of comedy that seems to be tasteless at most times, many people have drawn so extensively, and the overwhelming grand Hollywood interior is terribly decorative; Manhattan streets are only true. There is a vigilant courtroom scene, and Donald Sutherland is a very good judge of honesty. The Alan family problem was resolved quite easily with a phone call. It is still worth looking for acting - Cheadle's control and subtlety and sandler P.T. Anderson's 2002 Punch-Drunk Love, but it's a good movie, it's very good.
