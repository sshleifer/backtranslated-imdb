Thelma Ritter stole the picture. I ended watching again. I could not help emotionally in her last scene. She did not have an Oscar. That's why Oscar should not be too confident. Richard Widmark has never played a good role and is not perfectly cast as a 3-D, flawed man. Jean Peters is a great street street and she is in the best role as a tough girl. Richard Kiley needs a lot of good; Why do I hate him? Yes, it was heavily handed over patriotism; But, without it, you do not have much picture. See their faces! The first three stars do not really need much script. I see this movie without dialogue. If you ever see Ray Milland and Rita Gom "The Thief", you probably know what I mean. When I was younger in my first trip to NYC in 1956, I went to the feet of South Street looking for my Bronx uncle No. 66. I know Hollywood is not trusted. <br /> I do not give too much story because I know it. If you see it, no clarification is required. Probably anyone reading these comments can not see "pickup on the south street". You like it; Do not look for 66 South Street in New York City.
