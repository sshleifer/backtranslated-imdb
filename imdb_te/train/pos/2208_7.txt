College girl Joanne Murray takes the inappropriate job of preparing a student housing building to become an apartment, which sells unwanted furniture, which takes place during the break, so the mysterious Psycho camp is almost empty in campuses. "Blood" is a much less amusing movie. Acting is very bad, plot is imaginative, but gore effects are very good. The movie UCLA film students did not place anything by Stephen Carpenter and Jeffrey Obro. Dreamy atmosphere is very similar to Jeff Lieberman's magnificent "Just Before Dawn". 10 to 7. It has been introduced to Daphne Juniaga's car for some time since "The Initiation" fame.
