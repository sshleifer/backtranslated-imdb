There are many reasons to watch this film: Latin America whips about the subject of kitnancing, police corruption at the Continental level, we see reality among many facts that live in Latins. <br /> <br /> Denzel Waldton's performance is good, this guy continues to be a wonderful actor and continues this way. Dakota Fanning is just 10 years old, has become a wonderful actress and I congratulate her. The rest of the movie is awesome, it's in my collection. <br /> <br /> I feel that they have been to Hollywood producers to make a complete film in Venezuela, where they will lead our reality to a majority, drugs or political issues. <br /> <br /> They also have a few films of Venezuelan lands (for example Arachnopafia, Jungle 2 Jungle, Dragonfly), as well as their preparation in Mexico. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My vote is 10/10
