I saw this movie as a child. I do not remember where I saw it. I was about 14 years old. I thought the film was fantastic and felt. This once came on Kung Fu Channel, but I missed it. I was really bummed. It is the best special effects I have seen on the date Kung Fu movie! I highly recommend it, and now I have found where I have been, and I can enjoy it once more, to spend years. I'll have to look back and repeat this topic, some of them talk too.
