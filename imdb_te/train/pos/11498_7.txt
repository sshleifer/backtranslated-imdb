"Cochlek: The Night Stalker" is a highly entertaining TV series in which a pacifist, satirist and forty-reporter is repeatedly taken into a mortal struggle with supernatural (and occasionally extraterrestrial) troops. Depending on the popularity of most popular TV films that feature Kolchak, the series has been the fastest in the mid-1970s due to low ratings, but it still maintains a strong culture today. But will the modern modern day viewer meet after the death of Colacach and his weekly conflicts? <br /> This is a very complex question. Critics of the series argue that the formula and helpless are dated. On the other hand, fans argue that it's smarter, well-written, and sometimes genuinely spooky. And me? I had a step in two camps. <br /> <br /> I recently enjoyed watching all of the 20 episodes of Kolchak in the series, but I can see clearly that the series had major drawbacks. <br /> <br /> I first solved the colloquial question of "Formula" fiction. Now, I agree that more TV programs have principles - every episode of Colombo is done according to the same pattern. Repeat is not necessarily a bad thing; In fact, critics have noted that the audience is often experienced and actively explored recreational recreations. However, the problem with Kolchak is very strong in its principle - it can also be repeated through very generous standards. <br /> In almost every part, Kolchak is some form of the monster that investigates a murder. He tries to publish a story about the monster, but his editor Vincenzo hinders him, and there is no evidence to support his arguments that he is always working with supernatural powers. And, alas, the police also blocked Kolhak. So, ultimately, Kolokk has done independent research on the monster and tells how to kill it ... and then kills it. Without a ceremony, or a gift or a big story about it. <br /> <br /> Can you get a tough formula tiresome from time to time? I'm especially chaotic by Vincenzo - if demons always raving about monsters, and Vincenzo never trusts ... well, then, why does Vincenzo fire not, or obey him? No ordinary boss will do. But the series abandoned the originality, preferring to make Vincenzo and Calcus as comical opponents. As a result, their sequences are very confident - they are also very fun. <br /> <br /> They are kind of the best parts of the Khalchik, unexpected twist on these formula limits. These selected episodes are very good, they are contrary to the series' criticism. Some of my favorites are: <br /> Horror in the Heads - An episode that brings horror, inventive and socially aware. The Kolchak dialog is an exceptionally sharp and cynical edge. Although it is closely adapted to the Kachak formula, the script (written by famous Jimmy Sangster, Hummer Studios) is a remarkable literacy, and it penetrates deep into the hero's hero. <br /> <br /> Devil's Platform - "Omen" Movies, this episode villain because Kolchak tempts with a very young Tom Screat - full of goodies, a satanic deal (and so, revealing too much about the role of the reporter.) <br /> <br /> "For these three parts alone, I tell you that most of the stories are at least entertaining, for the sake of appreciation. For the money, there are only two full turkeys in the 20-episode run: the primate Scream, which includes the predominantly monkey-men in Chicago, and the smoother-looking creature decorated in recreational recreational history, and this assessment comes from a lifelong doctor <br /> <br /> At the time of the weak episodes, Carrine, Darren McGuin's amazing performance, the world is a good repetitive, perhaps a little cheesy, but it's great things on the balance. The ill-fated, infinitely funny Kolchak really shines, for example, Sarah Mitchell Geller has never been performed in "Buffy", thus the series up Took the initiative. Mac Gavin is a great actor, and this series is worth watching only him.
