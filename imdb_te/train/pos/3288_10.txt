This is a cool fantasy movie. One of my faves, it really looks great. Director directed by Bernard Rose is directed by Candyman, who made a great start with the film. <br /> <br /> A movie about a girl named Anna is suffering from a throat fever on her 11th birthday. She attracts a house on paper in her workbook and the house comes into the real dream. Each subsequent dream has changed with the desire to add her picture. In her third dream she meets a boy she has created, called her mark. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Burke is an amazing actress who plays the role of Anna and this is very strange, she should not be the only one after the same motion. Be something back anytime. <br /> <br /> Hans Zimmer's score is also ace. Like a broken arrow, the music is spiritually and mysterious. This is a real shame that the soundtrack is no longer available on CD. The DVD is only available in R2.
