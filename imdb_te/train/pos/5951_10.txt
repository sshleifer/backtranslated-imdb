Beautifully directed films, photographs and brilliantly acted? Crosby's interpretation is correct, and Hardwick has always played his best role, while the benzix is ​​quite a treat? The yankee's appeal is universal and irresistible. <br /> One of the main joys of the film is the songs. As expected, Bing is in good voice. And although hardwood's solo cut, we still hear him in his popular novel, "Busy Doing Nothing", singing heartily when he is so dancing with Crosby and Benjix. It was also a treat to hear Rhonda Fleming, though she was rarely given a chance to listen to the film despite her extensive stage and concert career as a singer. <br /> <br /> She mocks most of her Mary Kay Dodson dress. <br /> <br /> Director Toy Garnett gets a lot in his luxury budget, with resources owned by him to demonstrate each spectacular scene as efficient as possible. <br /> <br /> As the trailer is actually describing, fun pleasure begins.
