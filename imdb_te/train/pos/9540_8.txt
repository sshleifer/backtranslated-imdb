The Meatball Machine is very mixed with the very feedback I've heard about. One couple also say that they "suck it". Well, I say to you, get some f @ ckin imagination and f @ ck yourself. <br /> <br /> The story starts with a mechanical bug, which changes its hosts as wearing this gourm-dress called the Nemroborgs. Eventually you will realize that these mechanical bugs attach a small parasite to you, and then you can control your actions because of the hot-wiring in your nervous system. Unfortunately, for two love-seeking single young men, they are going to cross paths with mechanical bugs, and before you know it's transitions and blood spills. Is there a way to stop the transition? Perhaps this mechanical bug is a way to stop the threat? Why are nicroborgs fighting with someone else? Should two disappointing singles express their feelings to each other? Only one way to find. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Some unanswered questions, sometimes average acting and a little confusing end is the weak points I can imagine. From anime feel, parasites can become small spells and feel less budget, this film hits a lot more right mark than miss. With a very interesting story asking all the questions combined with cool makeup effects and blood commentators, it should check a lovely fan of Bizarro / Horror / Tessoo / Spotter fans. 8 out of 10
