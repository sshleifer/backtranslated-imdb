What's not always with the Matrix story, how the facts come in the real world. Because this part of the story is covered by many bases, tell us more. The truth is that it's political, and there is also a short shot in the current presidential administration. Only human beings can think of fascism and violence in the fight against a robotic group that has nothing more than human servants. I'm also curious about the use of fear and it's perceived by unknown thinking. People often fall into the trap like the logic and lack of thought, because people can not believe the opposite. Well represented and together, this is how true intellectual humans are.
