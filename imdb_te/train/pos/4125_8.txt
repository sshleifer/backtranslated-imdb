I love watching "Sea Hunt" in the day, I'm in gymnastic school and my home is home and by 4:30 I'm ready to see the sea hunt and Mike Nelson's underwater adventures. I loved it! He took you to a place that was not very accessible at that time under the great blue sea. The predecessor 'Thunderball' or the Early Cousteau is common, Mike Nelson has created the imagination of kids .I am willing to share their hobby for science sciences from more than a few children or from sciences or science sciences .Underwater photography has also evolved, The attraction is easily stimulated thru watching this program. Watch and enjoy!
