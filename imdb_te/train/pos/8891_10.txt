I agree with other commentaries that the history discussed in the film is not so big, but this is not a documentary! <br /> <br /> <br /> When you feel like you do not know what you are doing with them, <br /> It's not a repeat of 60th decade light brought into very large and important landmarks.I found it very entertaining and worth my time to watch Edu.
