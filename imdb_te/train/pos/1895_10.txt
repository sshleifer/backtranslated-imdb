I saw it in Christmas, I do not know why but I remember Christmas, I saw it, so we're there. <br /> Arthur is a large mute smile on my face and a special script with specials, great fun music and compilation script and charts all the way through the script. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore can easily play a role (bad, richer, lazy apologist) but becomes a person you like. Linda Minely Linda Morolla is a fine servant of a queen, who carries a tough / soft person. John Gielgud gets all the juicy lines and polishes them with flavor. <br /> I can see Arthur again and it always feels good, check it if you want a lovely image lift.
