Only ten years after the original events, and set in the bunker under the Reichstag, the pub's image is completely gripping. It refers to the sulfur death waiting for the criminals of World War I. For three decades it has not been seen, but it is strong in my visual and emotional memory. The characters look forward to laying walls in their cave. The dialogue between the two generations is a bit of a bit: "Is God?" "If he did, we would not." Toodle Jung, "Im Toten Winkel" {aka "Blind Spot: Secretary of Hitler") and interesting to view and compare this documentary about "Downfall" with Bruno, Gange.
