Tom attempts to dismiss Matt, who has a meteoric professional climb in Mike-Zigtek for his agent, but not with Matt Offer. He then becomes acquainted with the director of Jessica Jones (Susan Lucy), a friend of Patricia, and persuades her to join the club with her children. Matt Changing When I See "Hell Invitation", <br> Feeling in the behavior of his family and Jessica decides to investigate the club, finding a bad secret about the members. This film, partly reminiscent of "The Stephan Wives" with people who changed behavior in the suburban composition I liked in <br 80s. I have seen it today, and I found a great metaphorical message against big corporations, who sell their souls to the devil to earn people literally positions and higher climbing salaries. I'm not sure what the author intended to give this explanation, but I believe it's perfectly complete. <br /> The title (Brazil): "Conveyite Par√° O Inferno" ("Invitation to Hell")
