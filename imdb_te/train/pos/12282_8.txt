I did not do it first, but I did not. They did not include the third True Generation, the love between Blanca and Pedro was well described and some actors were different from what I expected. <br /> <br /> After the film I realized that the book is more reliable, it would have been five hours and it was bad. I like it very much now, because my favorite characters are when I paint them. Clara really looks like an Angel in Live, and her introduction to the story is fantastic, reliable and younger. Glen Close Ferrula. I portrayed her as a whole, not the whole thing. Esteban is adequate. I really did not like his role, and though I was interested in him, I hated him especially when he hit Clara. <br /> <br /> In the book, one of the most exciting of the last episode, and it also has a real history. <br /> <br /> The film is great, especially the Gringo film book of Latin America. How many amazing stars are there, do not you think so?
