I would like to see Sarah Buffy on the big screen, so I bought tickets for the first time and checked reviews in IMDb. I was worried about seeing a bad movie. I am very fun watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Some people are just as scary as in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It's very ridiculous. It's not a great movie. Just a well-made horror movie. It does not rely on special effects, but camera angles, acting, music. In my opinion, acting is okay. Sarah did a very good job and was very persuasive. <br /> The sets are nice (and do not care that the sets are the exact ones used in the Japanese original). <br /> <br /> Scary moments are often imaginable. But not always. I saw a lot of horror, and did not expect to be scared now, but it happened at least twice. Nice. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Sarah in another Buffy episode, it is quite different from her work on Buffy , Because it's more serious. If you want to see only those films that collect Oscar nominations, do not go. This is a good horror movie, enough suspense. I gave up 7.
