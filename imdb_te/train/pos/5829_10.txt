This is one of my two or three favorite stooges shorts, and undoubtedly the best performance of Christine McIntyre with Trio. Her other shorts are great, but here she is definitely brilliant. It's not fun to sing, actually it's pretty beautiful, but singing this song is more than just getting rid of humor, rather than removing it. We listen to singing a song three times less than a total of the voice of Spring, but it does not get old because we can not make her tire in tone and partially mixes it with the pulpit of the stooges. The use of operatic soprano in a comedy is reminiscent of Kitty Carlisle in Marx Brothers's "A Night at the Opera", but performs his own humorous talent that Carlisle never made in the show, except "Opera," and perhaps more than Macintire, The Stuels' buffoonery, McIntyre's singing, and well-plot plot combines for 5 stars 5.
