Last night, I received a BBC mini-series "Jane Eyre" (1983) from Jimmy Eyre, Charlotte Bronte's gothic romance novel by Mr. Edward Rochester with Timothy Dalton (my favorite James Bond), a poor orphaned 18-year-old girl , Mr. Rochester's Estate, Governess at Thornfield. When I was 11 years old, my friend told me that "this book is amazing", "This book is wonderful" is "one of my most beloved books," so I have read dozens of I have not yet tired. Many of the filmmakers have fascinated by its beautiful language, refined, fragrance, and surprisingly fresh, dialogue, and above all, two main characters, and their impossible love story. According to IMDb "Jane Eyre" has been adapted to many TV and large screens, [18]. Jon Fontaine and Orson Wells, William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsborg, George C. Celebrities and magnificent actors like Scott and Susanna York, Ciaraan Honds and Samantha Morton differ from society, laws, religion, age, backgrounds, experiences, and lacquer errors to hunt for many years. For all these films, I have seen the BBC version of 300 minutes since 1983, which closely follows the novel and is often featured in the dark and brooding roles of Timothy Dalton, whose name is Edward Rochester, not brilliantly and classically, Mr. Rochester - the brave, powerful, power of nature, powerful, , Sexy, and tormented by Thornfield Roadster. <br /> <br /> Added to September 17, 2007: Jayla Clarke was convinced of a sweet, delicate, intelligent, and strong Jane. For the past two weeks, I've seen five "Jane Eyre" movies and it's a wonderful experience. There is something to admire in every adaptation of "Jane Irrey", although they are not completely unsuccessful. This version is still my favorite "Jane Eyre" film.
