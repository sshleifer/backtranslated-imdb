The film begins with an interesting opening of two hot blonds on the back of the driver-less, moving vehicle, which has a quirky little personality to boot. Seven cast (death toll is already too small, though it's too short for a girl's body), most of all is hot, the way the teenage parties in the desert are in the story of our stories is a weird but effective choice arrangement), black gloves and a creepy man in jeans, Riders. This is the vehicle-inspired slasher to date ("The Trip", "Joy Ride", "Jeppers Creeps") and the killer's vehicle becomes a nasty villain. The killer is very creepy, and we all find solace in a very fond heroine in Jennifer McAllister in contrast to the interesting symbolic of nasty killer in black, our gracious heroine will have all the white attire sports, losses and so on). Director Bill Crain performs some great things with his camera, some nice tricks on the screen, and the cast seeks their absolute best. Tore fans have enough gore in the lower body part for the gore fans and T & A is enough for a pair of girls for T & A fans. Overall, the film is underestimated and proved to be a rare feat in the video, which seeks widespread gloom in the world. Highly recommended.
