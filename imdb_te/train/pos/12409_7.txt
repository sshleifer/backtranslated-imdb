The best eighty horror movies do not raise jails during dialogue, because this is not a good reason because it's good reason ... but when you've spent a decade of classic films, it's definitely the best of the little known movies. The film has some connection to the blockbusters; Initially it was an early directive for Renny Harlin; Most of the action movies including Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger and Deep Blue Sea; And secondly we have a starting role for Lord of the Rings star Viggo Mortensen. The film is not exactly original but the plot line is interesting. We are concentrating on the prison that we had reopened after many years. It was a prison sent by a jail governor, Charles Forsyth, to the electric chair. Obviously, the spirit of the dead does not rest on peace. When the old penalty is reopened, the spirit of the dead robbery escapes for vengeance. <br /> <br /> This movie is not exactly the Shawshank Redemption, but it does pay attention to building its various characters and the main point of the film is always horrific, behind which the jail play makes for an interesting base. This is a good job, because in the primary premise, the film does not really have a 'plot' and we rely on interaction between characters to keep things interesting. Strange at the horror of the film, but it is never over, and it is indeed a reason for the film to be reminiscent of a decade. These killings are good and predictable, and provide some important highlights. As the film continues, we have begun more delays in the back story of the ghost of revenge and when it's so interesting, some things do not make sense and it will kill a little bit of the picture. Still, boils down to an exciting climax and the whole thing I have to say is worth a track worth the track down.
