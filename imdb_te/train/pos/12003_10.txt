As I changed into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, I will try to understand my new religion's history. My sons & other teenagers & women and our ward have invited their families to attend the show's appearance. <br /> <br /> A beautiful spring evening, we went to the historic village of Christ Church, Ohio. We have reservations in the Victoria Center to view this movie. I was amazed because my film view was limited to some church documentaries. <br /> <br /> The full length of the Church I saw was motion pictures "Legacy" and "My Best to Years", both written and pre-built. <br /> <br /> Missionary Interpropor came out of the tissue, and many people have been tears in the film. I thought "okay ... but it takes a long time to move me to tears." I'm surprised when I'm surprised! This is really a moving & encouraging clause to the prophet Joseph Smith. </ P> <br /> Look at it and believe it's a powerful message!
