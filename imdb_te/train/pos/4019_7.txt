As an actor I'm not a fan of Snoop Dog, it's a matter of worry. He reminded me that he was under interview in "Jay Leno" and that he rejected the role in the big-budget Adam Sandler comedy "The Longest Yard". So obviously, Snoop has a serious mission to prove that he's acting in chops. I'm going to surpass Snoop for his performance "Tenants." Good rapper / actors like Mop Deaf are definitely able to do with his role. But point snoop has done a "good" job. He does not seem to break down his trademark body movements and vibrations, but it is also the problem Jack Jackson is doing. The character has a tension between him and his character and the attractive character of Dylan McDermott's character. By McDermott, the film will be the best performer, though his subtlety is mostly overshadowed by Snoop's subtle miniature acting. As a big reader and enthusiastic writer, I could not help but find the characters and somewhat fascinating plot. Snoop's character has continually questioned McDermott for reading his work and intensified me to criticize him and criticize him. But what do you know? I'm sure the writers are very similar. In McDermott's own way, his role was flawed. My distinctive criticism of this film is going to end. For some reason, I was clearly apparent, but the clarity was clear and inspired the characters rather than the plot.
