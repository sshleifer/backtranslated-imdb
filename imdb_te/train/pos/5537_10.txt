The first episode of the first episode that I said was not as good as it is, but I still remember it. I became a fan of Dick Francis. I would recommend if you are interested in horse racing and secrets. <br /> <br /> Sidekick, Cockney Barnes's cocky slap, Bell's is the most entertaining for us who's never heard of Bow's Bow, but Leeds is attractive and performances are interesting. <br /> <br /> Sid Holly is one of the more interesting characters of Francis, and the show actually reduces some of the problems with his hands. Interestingly, the electronic hands that are used in stories act less for users than after World War II.
