I saw this movie on Sunday afternoon. I absolutely loved this movie. Mammy Gummer (Lila) is not married to her parents and she is not really in love because I loved everything from the sensitive moments of parents and daughters to the scenes that were crying out of her poor decision. I loved these moments because they are just right. First I was terribly scared because it was not Bobby, it was a great cast but a real meatless poorly written movie. But in the middle of the film I felt different. You smile and you cry, but in the end you want to see again in the evening. Trust me when I see it!
