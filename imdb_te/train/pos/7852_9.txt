The curiosity of Ladislas Starrakec, curious with insects and movies in a small movie about the love triangle between Mr. Beetle, an artistic grasshopper, and Mrs. Beatles. The simplest narrative of an immoral beetle couple who seeks to stimulate outside of their marriage is similar to the short name of biography or time. The use of embalmed beetles with wireless wires in the twist frame-by-frame animation of Starericz in the story. This story was created by Mr. Beetle unaware of having a night out in the camera with a drunk from a local nightclub. When Mr. Beetle brings his wife into the hands of his artistic friends, he chases her with anger, but eventually she forgives her and takes her to see the film. Nevertheless, Ms. Beetle learns about her husband's infidelity, the film they watch is Mr Beetle and the jealous movie of Dragonfly. Ms. Beetle thrills Mr. Beetle with his umbrella, Mr. Beetle jumped into the screen, and they both fall in jail and project the projector in the fire. Insects are placed in human settings such as the house or night club and give human qualities of envy, anger, lust and vengeance. Insect vessels wear briefcases, drive motors, and boots, and they also open their worms and open their jaws as virtual insects. The novelty of this story, despite having many scenes, does not wear itself, but as the fluid like moves, the film slowly moves. Action takes place with complicated details, but in the fast paced speed of shooting and shooting. Despite the pace, the film is an excellent example of the first handcraft of Starericz and is highly recommended.
