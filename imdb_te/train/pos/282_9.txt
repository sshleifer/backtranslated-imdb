This is terrible game I've ever played with undeniable. It's not the kind of average shoot-f's (I'm usually more concerned), but acceptable graph, interesting weapons and magic, great surround sound effects ("Scryeeee, scryeeee ..") and all the cool weather above. I love the shree that can help you to see, hear, and play some of the events in the past. The only game I have to take regular breaks after just a few minutes due to the intensity of the atmosphere. I am a great horror fan, especially in Clive Barker's stories and movies, and I love to play more games that emphasize the atmosphere and the more active storyline in participating in this horror story. 9/10 (-1 I'm no fps fan, and perhaps because the game is a bit too small?)
