In Barbarian and GEisha, John Wayne plays Townsend Harris, the real representative from the United States who is truly responsible for opening up Japan for international relations at the end of 1850. In front of him, Commodore Perry was primarily pushed into gunbots in Japan and forced a settlement in Japan in 1853. Shortly afterward, Harris worked on details and helped to ensure compliance - many in Japan respect the first deal. It is true and shown in the picture. Romance between Harris and a Japanese Geisha is largely fabricated and this romance is the focus of much of the film (hence, title). <br /> My first response was the first thing I saw was a surprise. John Wayne as a diplomat? When he was diplomat in most films, please he thank you and thank him he will eat people !!!! So he played a dude, playing the diplomatic game, he could not really get out. In fact, I was unable to think of many actors in 1958, which was very unusual for this role. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the story has a lot of freedoms with truth and strange casting, I have seen photos of Harris and Wayne. It is still very desirable. Color cinematography is good, this film shows some good ideas in Japanese traditions and culture and performance is not bad. In all, it's a preferred and watchable movie despite odd casting. <br /> <br /> PS - Read through trivia for this film. You know about the real life characters as well as the unexpected struggle between a little weain and director (John Huston), where Wayne has clearly knocked him down! Based on what I read about Houston and he came along with the actors, this is an event I believe. And, it's also a good example of John Wayne's "diplomatic".
