As a group of boys at school we should give this a thumbs up. Even the Grim Ripper made us smile. The two alien things laughed at me, and the Bill and Ted whole movie was fools and more ridiculous. It's much better than the first one. And for some reason I feel that it will miss something. Something big. Important. Improved house and make friends. No, I can say good villains. <br /> <br /> I've given 10 to 7 for those two robotic doooks. <br /> <br /> Grimm Ripper, he's not terrible. When he fell from the sky I divided the gut. Split, I'm not sure about those aliens. Where are they Scientists? There is no chance.
