He now has a name, identity, some memories and a lost girlfriend. All he disappeared, but still, they can trace him and he hardly destroy the world built. Now he wants some explanation, and to get people's ride on how to do what he's doing. <br /> Yes, this movie does not have the world's most comprehensive script, but its themes are very clever and ask some serious questions about our society. Like every Hollywood film since the late 90s, "The Bourne Supremati" is a story of super heroes. Jason Bourne is a Captain-American project, who is totally mistaken. In the first film, the hero invented his abilities and he accepted the second. He is now fighting a man close to him (he's his girlfriend in "Suprematy") after he feels as bad. <br /> <br /> Previously, superhero hero is a part of the story of the superheroes (he is real but impressive: he is almost invincible) super powers. (Bourne's films do not have any boundaries, the characters go from one continent to another), in the best seasons of "24", an American enemy, his country full of beliefs that he struggles for good faith. <br /> <br /> Along with those interesting backgrounds, the film is not flawless: Nicky Parson's feminine role is absolutely unrealistic when it comes to dialogues scenes for now completely. But it really does not matter, "The Bourne Ultimatum" is an action movie. <br /> Everyone here is talking about "Waterloo Sean" and "Tanger's mask" and everyone's right. I especially enjoyed the fight in Tanger, which reminds me of my exaggerated and dazzling Sushi Hark. Visual discoveries, intelligent action episodes and a good reflection of America's contemporary themes: "The Bourne Ultimatum" is definitely the best film of the series and a very interesting and original action movie.
