This amazing stand-up DVD! Eddie Izzard is a funny guy I have seen over the years. His routine is fun and makes for a great conversation with others. I highly recommend this. A little bit about the history of Europe, but the closing jokes in French are very good because you do not speak French to get it (if you do that, it's still fun). Moreover, parts of a sex transplant are good. The first scene (about San Francisco) is not great, but funny the first time. Skip what you can. It's almost not worth looking at. However, this is a really funny and funny stand-up show. "I was dead at that time!"
