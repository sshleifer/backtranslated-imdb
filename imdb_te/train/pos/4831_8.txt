I did not like this went into expecting; <br /> <br /> It is very valuable, rigid, and planting and dull. <br /> <br /> This is better than what I really enjoyed. I do not know much about Queen Victoria, who knows a lot - a young man married to Albert, and she will always be sad for him. She is so lovely to see her grown up; <br /> In fact, I would like to see more of the story. I thought that at some point the sequel would be seen. <br /> Visually the image is fantastic. The sets and dresses are very much luxurious over and without grass. <br /> <br /> In a word, it's great!
