I saw "The La Wave" in my Schools Fine Arts Library. It's all as intriguing as Peter Weir's aspects, but it's not always the attention-holding that I liked. The thoughts that threw me attracted me. Because they were well-managed by director Veer) but at the same time I did not stimulate them enough. <br /> <br /> The plot surrounds the lawyer of some primates, who reflects him in the Aborigon group. It begins with a severe weather sequence and has all of the most wonderful psychological effects (particularly the bizarre, "cord" sound design) and in the strong direction; But it did not entertain me as Veer was doing movies later. <br /> I need to look again. <br /> <br /> A good picture about the siege and the secret. Finally, the mystery between the whites and the ancestors has very serious consequences. <br /> <br /> God blesses Peter Weir. This film is worth watching him alone ... very organic director. An Aussi response is like Malik! I'd give a 7 because it got great ideas enough to overcome its boring moments.
