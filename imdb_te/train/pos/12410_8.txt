This is an excellent example of what can be done in a small budget movie. This act takes into consideration the excellent script and the overall atmosphere of the film is very soon. Gore is done well and is used less (see for excellent barbed wire-wire death) & action when used. At times, there are dodgy lines in the script, but it is hardly noticeable compared to other movies in the same (or big!) Budget. Overall, this is recommended. Trust me, it's better than it looks! 8/10
