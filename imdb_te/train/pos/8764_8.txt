Alice (Claire Danes) and Darlene (Kate Beckinsale) have always been good friends and they decide to go to Thailand after graduation. Because of an incident, they meet a young attractive stranger who invited them to go with him to the Hong Kong weekend. But at the airport, Alice and Darlene drug smuggling heroine misinterpreted and they were sent to prison. Now it's time for ultimate survival and true friendship. This is a good movie, I have seen sometimes and after a while they notice that there are some holes in the story, the film still keeps you entertained. Claire Danes has done a great job as she is a great actress. I will give the Brodden Palace 8/10
