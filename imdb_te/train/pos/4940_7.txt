The film is about human relationships. Beautiful, funny and well written, with meaningful text. It seems Morgan Freeman has a pleasure to have a set. Good music too. Paz Vega is a beautiful and intelligent woman. I really enjoy her acting. A good inspiration for learning Spanish is a woman like her. Morgan Freeman meets the beautiful Paz Vega from the motion Take a close travel with two strangers learning to care about being led by their lives. About 10 items or a passion of low life. If you enjoy it, see the movie Will Smith and Happiness Pursuit with his son. Action is not a movie or nude comedy. It's all about human relationships.
