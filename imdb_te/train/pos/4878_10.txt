Kabi: Our Mother (2008) poetic and amazing beauty from Japan. A real weeper! I listened to great reviews for this film and hired from Netflix. I enjoyed it! In many ways, the film reminded me of the old style of Japanese classic film-making from the 1940s and 1950s, and I loved the love as seen in the Azazro Ozu films - title credits also begin the same, with Japanese characters (characters) from neutral color burlap material. I immediately thought: this director likes Ozuni. The same style is also used: Indoor sets with mostly outdoor scenes. Roger Ebert called them a "pillow shots" even a couple. <br /> <br /> The story follows a Japanese family, and after World War II, and later the movement of life. If the mother cares about her married daughters, her father (University Professor) is better off after her arrest for anti-war sentiment. He was never released and he had only brief meetings with his wife in jail before he died of hunger and disease. Meanwhile, the professor's former student's mother and two girls are helped to look carefully. He falls in love with his mother and is an alternate father for two girls. But the battle begins and he drafted and they have to say an avalanche farewell. Will they express their love to each other at any time? Will he come back from war? <br /> <br /> The main actress, Serio Yoshina, has a very hearty and gentle spirit. She is almost like Madonna, she is beautiful! Big soul eyes and flawless skin. The actor who is also a student is also exceptional: his name is Tadanuo Asno. No delicate performance. All in him is macho; He is gentle and gracious. I want to see both of these in other movies. I will check to see what's available to them. <br /> <br /> The film was just released on the NTSC DVD for American audiences, with English subtitles very easy to read. I gave 10 to 10 in IMDb. I almost drank with Japanese film Classic Twenty-Four Eyes (1954). Do not miss this movie!
