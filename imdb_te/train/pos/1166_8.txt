Snow and deadly ace Hitman-Tony Arjenta (divine and commanding performance by Alain Delan) seeks to exit the assassination, but he does not allow a dangerous gangster who works. After killing his wife and children, the Urjanta Open Season was announced on everyone responsible for their deaths. Director Ducio Tesri describes the story that absorbs a constant critical speed, thus maintaining a tight and no-nonsense tone, inspired shoot-outs, and a vibrant rip-scrolling breeze in the exciting car, explosive bloody violence. Delaying the delightful and attractive presence of Delon adds additional class to the trial. The film became more productive by acting by Sterling through a bang-up act by Richard Conte, with Argentine's loyal lady friend Sandra as Carla Gravini, Argentine's loyalist Paul Domenico Maggio, Anton Diflering Wrightless as Mark Porrell, Coco Gruvald, and Lino Trocei Gangster Rocco Kat Ttaga counted. Silvano Opposite Glossy Cinematography has many lovely pans. Giggs Ferrio's funky score gets down to groove spot hits. Erica Blanc and Rosalba are briefly popping in the Nifty Bit Parties. Better still, no filler to talk and we also get a good dab of delicious disgraceful male nudity. Prepare the average and hanging walls to the gut end closing gut. The solid and satisfying winner.
