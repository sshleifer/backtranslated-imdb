Sunday Sunday is not a Sunday without action film, and if you want a serious fight, you come to Tom Berman (Platoon). <br /> <br /> Here is a sniper in the forest after the rebels and drug traffickers Lord. Life is a bitch, so he receives the Green Office type (Billy Jane) to assist in the mission program. <br /> <br /> The film is in the hands of Louis Lisa, who shook Anaconda. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's a long time - it's a long way to go in the forest, but it's good, sharp act when the time is right.
