Well, in the beginning it was like "Shrek" - a lone constantly following the comic relief. Then it becomes truly priceless, because the guntet is set. And the result is an enjoyable image, which moments agree to be a little too dramatic to watch the kids (for example, Manny Past,). The campus has been working for a long time, so they can succeed in creating a movie with almost different sets (ice roofs and rocks) and three characters. It's a good thing to know that they are successful in doing something emotional out of them. As I mentioned, it may be tears-jerking a few times, so children are alerted. The real useless animation. It does not read for Toy Story movies or Shrek, and it shows. Humans are dirty and we have seen the good examples of CGI first. But this record does not let the stain: a solo effort, "Ice Age" is commendable. And it will collect so many fans, I have no doubt. Oh and yes, moments with little mouse are invaluable, and show-stealing.
