Everyone less than 5 is not clearly clean, tongue-cheek humor fans. Keaton is this amazing - as much as his work. This is not a blockbuster, lifetime affair. This is a slapstick comedy by Campi, the best (and many versatile) actors of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> If you ever want to see the funniest attempt ever made, you will see that Dimitri will make his piece as a mommon. <br /> <br /> I gave it to 7.
