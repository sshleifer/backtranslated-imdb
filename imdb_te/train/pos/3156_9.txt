Like the characters in this show, I was also teens in the 70s. The producers were really a youngster in the 70s, and the whole enthusiast had really waited. <br /> <br /> In this program, the mesh has a very talented ensemble cast with all mesh in the camera. I really like the special, psychede-style film scenes. The other display is similar to the camera. These cutting-edge film sequences really help to inform campy hippies of 70 years. <br /> This is a very funny sitcom. One thing that makes me worry about this show is to make it laugh and more dependent on rude humor. In this way, I feel that this show is trying to get married with most children. If married with children, there is a great sitcom in its own right, and the creators of the 70s are trying to imitate it. <br /> I recommend the 70s show, which is mainly the nostalgia factor. This is a much better performance if the writers do not adorn the witty dialogue, obscene, unpleasant jokes and pranks.
