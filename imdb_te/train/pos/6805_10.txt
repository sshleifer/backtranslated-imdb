I liked this movie. This is well done! Great acting and drama and historically accurate. I love Romy Schneider movies. This one is not as great as stones, Sissi but still rocks! <br /> And Scorpiolina, she commented and said French dubbing. Well this was not the first German film. So yes. The second one is a storyline, which is not well known to your history. Oh and her mother is part of her teacher, she is not a teacher. <br /> <br /> But the history in this film is great, I love the historical movies and Queen Victoria is very fascinating, and the storyline is not actually Cinderella but Queen Victoria. ! I love historical things. Like the guy who is trying to monitor her mother. When she fled and met her future husband, she showed her a "new kind of dance". When the waltzing is new, it is considered a very scary because the couple is so closely dancing. <br /> <br /> Today, the styles are great, the hoop skirts are amazing. And of course Romy is always very beautiful.
