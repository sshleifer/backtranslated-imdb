The film was not seen after the first release, but it was memorable. The Rip Torn and the Konda Farell performances are awesome, the photography is amazing, the moving story line and the highest standards for it. <br /> <br /> The UK is an extravagant market because it is probably not seen in the sad TV or video. <br /> <br /> Has it been the most successful historical drama in America? <br /> <br /> The good news is that 50% of the music is music, the title theme is a simple but moving clarinet solo "What a friend we are in Jesus". The film then declined! Am I right or wrong?
