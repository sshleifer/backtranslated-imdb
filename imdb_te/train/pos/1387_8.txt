A bit slower (like a sophisticated Coppola movie) but still three young girls are very attractive about the discovery of sexuality. The magic of the film is capable of bringing back many memories that are thought to be in their age. The chaos and insecurities are portrayed quite simply, but are very real to life. The music is perfect and acting is amazing. The camera works beautifully. I highly recommend those who are not afraid to look back at this particular period of life when I find our sexual impulses and our desires. I also say that I am a good film for young people of that period. Most movies are adolescents, but it really binds the true essence of finding romance and its complexities.
