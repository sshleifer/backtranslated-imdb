Perspective is a good thing. Since the release of "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace", the second and third episodes of the episode have come to light from the "real" Star Wars films, instead of the separation of old and new images. The latest images on older movies allow a new perspective to be kept in older movies. This new outlook is considered to be the weakest of the original trilogy, allowing us to be more appreciated: "Jedi Return". Often ridiculed for its overly 'beautiful' factor, the ROTJ is stronger than the original "Empire Strikes Back" and is slightly less impressive. In fact, ROTJ's 'beautiful' item, they have been a weak link in the whole series. George Lucas put the Furry Midgets entirely for merpandizing opportunities in the film? <br /> <br /> The beautiful item next to this film is the evolution of the perfect circle and saga. After "The Empire Strikes Back", Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) relinquished his Rebel Alliance Friends by Han Solo (Harrison Ford), following his home planet, Tattoo, the space pirate Rebel hero, Jabba the Hut Meerin debts. <br /> <br /> Skywalker Betel is a man who left Tattoo with Ben 'OBi von' Canopy (Alec Guys) to fight Opia. Now surrounded by blacks, his origins in Luke's origins are confused and torn by him. His psychiatric doctrine is not as strong as its external appearance. When he always tries to help his rebel friends, Durmaard destroys him for another opportunity to reunite Vader, even if he is either destructive or ultimately entering Wader on the Emperor or finally fearing whether he will turn to the Dark Side. An intensestine living in the sand - early sequences in the Tatan from the cave of Jabba, to its floating palace and the 'Almighty sarlak'. Lucas's CGI enhancements for the film in 1997 actually depleted Sark's overall effect, making it fake and overwhelming. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes on Totoine are great and this is the most memorable saga. <br /> When Luke returned to Degabha's approach to visit almost the full-time sick Yoda, the viewer gave up. Yoda's absence of chaos. <br /> <br /> Tara's role of "The Empire Strikes Back" was removed from Yoda's story but the progress of Luca's fate was displayed on the screen. <br /> <br /> ROTJ is really the image of Luke, the original one. His journey continues to his confrontation with Darth Vader and his fate. Other rebel characters work perfectly in his shadow. Unlike the love "empire" between Leah (Carrie Fisher) and Solo, the rest is not. In fact Lee's role was developed in the ROTJ, as the character of Solo played an important role in his first personality, the importance of his personality increased greatly. <br /> <br /> Their characters have been appointed to work with the rebels. A new death star has been completed. At this time the emperor oversees the final stages of construction. The empire was intended to suppress the rebellion, and the emperor had plans to bring Darth Vader to work with the now powerful Skywalker (or at that place?). The Emperor is a different type of sculptor than the Emperor Tarckin (Peter Cushing) from "Star Wars". <br /> <br /> The Emperor, who played an awesome act by Ian McDiramid, is one of those characters you love to hate. <br /> <br /> All other actors are well-engaged in their roles. Hilly was more surprised by Luke, the role of his character, a whiny young man who became an enlightened warrior in the development of some true character of the impatient student lineup. Ford's role was bold in the first two films because of his attraction and attraction - the real star of the first film after all. Fisher's Lia is not about the end of the movie finale that she's never sure about her ... at the same time as Canekie, Yoda and Alec Gianis, C-3O Poe. <br /> <br /> The image of Ewoks and Empire Despite the worst forest battle, it ends well and has a three-way battle range: In endor, space and death star, everyone has the most impressive special effects. The music is always excellent, and every case captures perfectly emotional. John Blue's score was "Star Wars" folklore as Light Sabers and Force, as "Blue Danube" worked perfectly for "2001: A Space Odyssey". <br /> <br /> Lucas had earlier opened an explanation and created more episodes. In fact, science fiction fans episodes VII, VIII and IX episodes have re-created their heads in their own forms. ROTJ works when a chance is given, and cruel beauties are a good end to the side. <br /> When all six episodes are watched together, this saga is best done from time to time. Is it already In addition to the episode I changed the territory of the series. That is why "Jedi Return" can now be seen in a different light and can give the whole new compliment after 20 years of release.
