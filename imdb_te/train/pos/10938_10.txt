I rarely encounter the film, I should talk about it soon. This film is definitely the best, it's very authentic. I happened to see the dubbing version but I'm on my way to grab the DVD remaster with the original Chinese dialog. Nevertheless, the dubbing was not on the way and sometimes offered some serious humorous humor: "Poison Clan the world rocks!" <br /> <br /> The story-teller is a Chinese conspiracy, suspense, and inter-personal relationships. <br /> <br /> The 5-mark signs are exposed and you can expect turns and turns as an expert pace. <br /> <br /> Marshall Arts Fight is a choreography that belongs to its own class and is believed to be believed. It is realized by their own mysterious martial arts forms, fighting the real animals with each other. <br /> <br /> This combination provides a serious dose of old Chinese culture and I recommend it to the real purpose of telling Marshall the art history and mastery of its implementation. ... My guest, if you want to crush each other, along with the raw materials of Chinese torture!
