"The Grudge" is the reconstruction of Shimizu's own Japanese horror films. Shimizu knows he does not deal with anything new, so he makes no wise man in his place: he forgets logic and concentrates in giving viewers a fun ride. He uses commonly known clich√©s that are associated with ghost stories, but Shimizu plays a fictional approach with these elements. The Ayodhya story is not just a gimmick, but an interesting way to show the sequences from different perspectives. At the end, all I can say is that if a horror film is the only benefit audience (as well as a funny people is to make a smile), this film is a success with flying colors. I viewed a movie with audiences and it was fun to see the audience in this regard. It probably did not play in your room as well.
