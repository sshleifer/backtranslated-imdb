While I wrote this review I did not believe Johnny Dangerously about a low 5.6 rating in the IMDb and I thought I would do something to encourage that comedy comedy. Seriously, people who have voted to have a low level of humor, should not be too bad to keep the rating low. If you do not like ridiculous ways, do not see them! The film entered my DVD collection with a mix of fantastic pace given the absurd humor, very good storytelling and other running styles. And it does not mention visual fables embedded here and there and using "clinic de oils" and "cliche" based on our favorite organized crime movies. <br /> <br /> I have shown this film to many people and are introduced without any specific expectations (unless it's probably comedy) - I have to look at any movie in my opinion - they liked it very much. It happens well, it's not too long to see and any slowing down in the story's evolution is really straightforward. It's not perfect, some gags come a bit short, but it's perfect, especially when considering any other view of yours. That's why I rated this movie from 9 to 10. The film is in my opinion "top secret" and "spaceballs" in the absurd but well thought out comic field. These days are even more absurd when reducing on the side of ideas and expertise. Sometimes people want to be able to understand that many people can understand it properly. Finally, I want to say: see it for yourself, do not tell the average Joe and if you do not like it, then you know it's not good for your taste, but it's possible in my opinion.
