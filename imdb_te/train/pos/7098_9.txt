"Twelve Monkeys" have come to become the best work of Terry Gilliam. Outstanding screen play, a persistent rhythm, intelligent sometimes sometimes ironic dialogues. In addition, he has a good nose about the cast. "Twelve Monkeys" was also the first film that Bruce Willis retired from the role he used to play in his previous films. Here, you are taken from a fearless and invincible hero with a frustrated and hopeless character who is nicknamed as a prisoner (which was in "die hard"). How he is trying, he is a prisoner of time. There is a very thrilling ending in this movie. It has a real dramatic power. But this miraculous picture is also a reflection about the man, he dreaders (especially those that are causing the end of the world and the ones that cause it, these are the virus that can create illness). How long does it take, "Twelve monkeys" will have to assess its true value: one of the masterpieces made in the nineties.
