The bogus travel of Bill and Ted is the most spectacular film I have ever seen. Acting and scenery are poor, though who cares. The story line is brilliant and the jokes and words they fall are incredibly amazing, the ideas are great. I recommend anyone to see this classic. The best part is when Melvin died, I cracked in 10 minutes and lost the next part of the film. It's good, the first one is great, it's great. Perhaps the funniest movie at all times !!!!! While Bill and Ted are amazingly fun and playing guitar solo, the film is the best episodes of the movie, but it's so happy. Let Rock, Ted and Eddie Van Hollen tell the 3rd film !!
