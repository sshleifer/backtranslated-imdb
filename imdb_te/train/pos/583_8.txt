Two brothers grew up in a small town in Montana. One of them is Norman (Craig Shepher) and Paul (Brad Pitt). Their father grew up with Reverend McLean and lessons of religion and lessons of fly-fishing. This film refers to fly-fishing life. <br /> <br /> This story is good and keeps your attention, but you need a few moments. Perhaps this movie has these moments because it's not about events that happen, but about the message. Some things did not happen. Norman goes to Dartmouth. Six years later he came back with a nice girl named Jesse (Emily Lloyd) and was invited to teach in Chicago. Paul Reporter and called it "Fishing Reporter". <br /> <br /> The film is very well directed, it has good scores and actors. Good. Cinematography is the most beautiful thing in the film. All the mountains, the woods and the river are very beautiful. It is good to see if only the film is made for these things. Fortunately there is more.
