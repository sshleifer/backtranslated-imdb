Wow, I loved this movie. It may not have the funds and advertisements available for the latest Hollywood blockbots, but it will prepare an emotional punch twice. The story revolves around the story from Uta and has connections between the people in the family who provide the film with its punch. The main leader (Giovanni RBC) plays his role, and I believe he is acting at all times. This was his brother (Elias Kutais), although I stole the show. When both scenes together, they left each other behind their lines and gave spectacular performances. Great cast, great movie.
