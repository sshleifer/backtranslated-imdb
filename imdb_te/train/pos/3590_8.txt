I watched this film when I was mirroring it and I thought it would be another movie with a girl trying to prove a point, but Diane wanted her to be boxing because she wanted. I thought this film was good. I gave 8/10. How nice it is. Plus a picture with Michel Rodriguez is always good. Even she is just six.
