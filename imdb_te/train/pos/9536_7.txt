Japanese about deranged and graphical gory taking people on the Japanese picture and engaging them like necroborg-zombie - beat it and hack each other apart so that it loses the winner. <br /> <br /> The technically super horror comedy (?) is only for those with strong stomach when flying out of blood and body parts. Good tastes me to explain what's going on here, but let's say it's pretty gruesome. See this movie if you want to make this kind of look more stable than you do. Personally I do not normally enjoy movies like this any one but how sick and twist they go level. Here I am really interested in the people who know the people of Ghari movies can be able to suggest it .. So I want to see again and again with a picture of myself, and finally revealed - I went back and wanted to see what I was holding. There are rare logic in these films. <br /> <br /> For 10 to 7 million people who love blood and severed organs, zero or more accurate runs and are alert to everyone.
