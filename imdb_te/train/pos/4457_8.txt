Yes, this is one of the great musical films I've grown into great entertainment like Frank Sinatra and Jean Kelly, not to mention Catherine Grayson's petite and fantastic voice. Music and dance is amazing. I took lessons from Frank Kelly; And Kelly is dancing with Jerry Mouse, this is a very special time. Betty Garrett plays the role of a waitress in love with Sinatra. She is one of Hollywood's lowest stars. I saw again on A & E TV and it had my old VCR tapes. Nobody should be tired of old music. What happened to Hollywood?
