This irresistible is a great fun and technologically made movie! <br /> <br /> The movie '30's' featured some of the great looking sets you see in the movie, although it is clear that the sets are much better than the real ones. Often a character drops or a doppost is moved very aggressively, and the whole set moves clearly. <br /> <br /> The best movements in the film are silent, more old fashioned, applause kind of movements. It shows that the true heart of René Claire is silently filmed. The overall humor in this movie is great. Music movements are great too. This is really enjoyable light and simple fun early French music. Though the best moments are silent movements, this film is not meant to be filled with some great humorous dialogues, it is well-produced by actors, and I am acting as the most actress in this stage for the overall style of the film and the pleasurable noises for the weather. <br /> It's some great innovation with camera-work and some great, it's a technically great movie. The album is fun to see some fast and pleasant scenes. <br /> <br /> René Claire is a brilliant director who knows how to construct and plan comic movements in movies. It still seems to be hollow out of entertainment as a completely realistic and deliberately constructed film despite its simplicity at all times. <br /> <br /> The last half an hour is particularly unforgettable, <br /> <br /> The movie is filled with a very pleasant character, and they are very grotesque and stupid. And clearly cast because of their looks. It adds all the pleasant light to the comic atmosphere and cropping of the film. <br /> <br /> You are one of the most pleasant pictures you see <br /> <br />
