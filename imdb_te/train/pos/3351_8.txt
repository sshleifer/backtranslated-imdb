Very good Western. This was the first film directed by Richard Wilson, the first producer of Samuel Goldwon Jr. It is nice to see a very young and beautiful Anzi Dickinson as a saloon girl. Robert Mitchem is dominated by the bandits in the town and the town is appointed as Tamer, but he feared he would go too far for the damage to urban businesses. There are some similarities in the story with "Warlock" created in 1959. This film puts on a fast and exciting pace, which really keeps the edge.
