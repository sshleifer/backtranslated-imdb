I watched this July and with the Christmas theme, it was touching and sensitive. It is not for a reality-minded person who is sometimes filled with fantasy and lovely moves that are not really meaningless. William Russ has done a great job as a hunk. I only saw him in The Long, Hot Summer, where he played a weak character. But in this regard, the expression in his view, Hank takes into consideration the things that have happened to him, is amazing and mild. Valerie Bertinelli is the simplest and most believable in this role. Peter Faulk as Max was always a smile when he appeared in exciting and most important scenes. Mack really has a number of special scenarios that Hank finds in his life. It's not for everybody ... especially those who are not in 'feel-good' films and this is definitely one! If you want everything to be perfect and make sense, avoid it. But I think it's good to look back, so I've tapped it. (Yes, some of us still have VCRs.
