Well, I see this episode for the first time. It's important that my finger was missing. At this time the Costa Massa shooting on TV caught my attention - and I'll write an article in Inferno! <br /> In a TWOP review, a broken elevator stated that Tony had gone downstairs to the 7-step staircase. Yes, 7 is a significant number for many reasons, especially religious, but here is one for yaya. In a hunch I contacted Wikipedia and what was broken in Dante 7 levels? Purgatorio. Excluding the worm and paradise. (The bottom of the stairs and the stuff ... what do not get Tony) <br /> <br /> "random" monk-slap scene. As soon as the socks appear, it is perfectly complete with Tony, who tries to get out of the purgatory. You can say he's afraid when that Christian trade (death, disease, and sin) comes and he is more disappointed with the Christian paradise being very happy with him. By the time he said, "Can these guys help me?" It is surprising if you can contemplate other religions (eg Buddhism) and the other way to reach "salvation". Tony is not necessarily thinking about literally becoming a Buddhist, but it's tried by Finnetti (and in confusion). Slap in the face is basically a quick fix to Tony- such as, you suddenly embrace Buddhism and can not get from here. <br /> <br /> Tony is very concerned about getting to heaven early. But at the "Conference Introduction", he finds it is not easy for him. First of all I saw driver's license issue, Tony was sleeping with people who had been killed and kept secret from a lot of people, leading to a dual life. He thinks he has a relationship with Kevin-Melfi because "Kevin Finnetti". He would betray some individuals with KF cards as if they were hotel receptionists, but could not get him out of the purgatory. <br /> <br /> When reading all the theories in "Infinhert", KF's identity is a reminder of infinity. Different ways Tony could have taken in his life. Along with Infiniti's involved car joke probably makes sense to me otherwise. At that time Iand and my brain would go out.
