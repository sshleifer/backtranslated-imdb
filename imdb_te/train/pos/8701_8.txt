This may be unpleasant surprise for everyone who is expecting a traditional superhero movie. It's definitely more of a play than an action movie. It mainly focuses on emotions and is a bit like the Greek tragedy - the main character always goes wrong if something goes wrong. <br /> <br /> Like Sasha every super hero, society did not greet it in his hands. Sasha is illegal. <br /> <br /> When running, he meets a cute girl and falls in love, so he gets more complicated. <br /> <br /> You can see, the plot is really dramatic, but this film is not in dynamics. Ram Gopal Varma recently reminded me a lot in films. Everything happens slowly. However, there is a serious scene before it comes to knowing what will happen when there is an action scene. But the director does not impress us with elegant and showy action. The most important here is the result of Sasha's actions, which are very intense. The score is quite a bit, which makes it more difficult to focus on the film. This is basically the most patient you see. <br /> Is it worthy movie? The answer is really a question. I do not think this feeling will make me happy, but I'm thinking about this film and I want to see again. Because of the atmosphere, it's really dense, but it does not have any expectations for Sasha and Kathai. After all they are young people, who have all their lives to live. So no matter how hard it gets a little happiest tune when they're together.
