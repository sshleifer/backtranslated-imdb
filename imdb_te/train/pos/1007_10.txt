Okay, let's make it clear. I'm not really science fiction, but for some reason I love Stargate SG-1. <br /> <br /> Jack O'Neill takes his team SG-1 through a stargate. A round device that creates a wormhole. It provides the ability to travel to distant worlds. It's sound like your simple science fiction-series, but it's not! This plot is not set in some distant millenniums, such as many other science-fi-series. I was great. It gives you things, events, and you can do this, and you can enter this series anytime without learning new norms and names of all gadgets. Many thanks to O'Neill, who love to keep some of the course but simple vocabulary of course. <br /> <br /> The series has a good mix of action, humor and drama. If you have loads of special effects, you can not see it here. They do not use many bad ones but do not limit limited special effects.
