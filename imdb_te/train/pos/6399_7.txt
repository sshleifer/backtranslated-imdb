Although this is not exactly the best film I have ever seen, it is definitely worth $ 8 (not many movies today). <br /> This is a fun account. Many details of the true story are distorted, (i.e., the role of Billy Sunday in three or four true stories.) Robert Denario course is good, and Cuba Gooding, Jr. , Also impressive.
