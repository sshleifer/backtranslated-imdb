I started looking at the show until it came in FX. I was bored and there was nothing to see and innovations were made so I wanted to see the reunions of the show. I was not able to see the presentation when I first broadcast on the TV show. I loved the show very much! Finally everyone is a show to enjoy. I remembered the full house and family matters and step by step, and they were not fair but funny enough. They make dumb jokes and smile over things that are just plain stupid, but that's not the 70s show. That 70 show is hilarious, smart and real. I think it's the best show I have ever done and I'm sorry. Although I love this show, I think Eric and Kelso left when the season ended in the seventh season. Last season is not exactly, Eric should be out of the lead role and the show is out when his character leaves. I still love this show and I hope TV is doing more like this.
