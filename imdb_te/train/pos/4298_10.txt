The film has made me look at me once a year. Sometimes I'm uncomfortable. Sometimes it gets empowering. And I always find the characters human and true. It is a film that shows the gritty reality of life in LA, beginning with scanning recursive helicopter search lights for lurking lurking close to normal lives conducted by the characters. It is also a picture that shows how a stranger can change your life in kindness and make a difference. Grand Canyon has all the action you take, if not intended, or potentially resist. I have found this film in many ways to Robert Altman's film Short Cuts. Both have full cast and actors and actors and actors of both films and give you permission to see how the two films are related to each other and whether it's better or worse than anything else. The Grand Canyon has done a better job to provide a cohesive message (hopelessly in reality) than the film, but both of them are kicking in their own way. This image must be perfect !!!
