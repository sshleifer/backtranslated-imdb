These years later I think this series is the best example of a second World War documentary film making. Many interviews from all countries are separate from other projects. This is a contemporary documentary (Ken Burns?) That will look great on this topic and try to collect information from the veterans before losing everything. The old excavator footage produced by The World at War since 1974 and the innovative version of the series is welcomed to improve advanced information technology. The History Channel has made some fine performances in many aspects of WWII, but the vast series like World At War did not successfully succeed. Do not miss this series if you are interested in this era. Requires viewing.
