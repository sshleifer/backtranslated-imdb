The film premiered at Austin's Paramount Theater last night as part of the SXSW Film Festival. The film then took the audience questions in the presence of director Mike Binder and stars Adam Sandler and Don Chead. This is a great and powerful movie about losing yourself and starting to look backwards. The performances are exceptional and the story deals with tragedy and funny as being very rare. (The trailer of the film is a bit hard to emphasize the comic strips. <br /> <br /> It is a breakout role for Adam Sandler, who began to switch to more dramatic roles with Punch-Drunk Love and Spanglish, a role that makes him a dramatic actor Step, he made Tom Hanks and a more dramatic path as Jim Carrey did He has been awarded an Oscar nomination for the transition to the Dustin Hoffman Channel in Rhineman, although it is different from Sandler's painful role, despite the fact that he is an unmanageable human being, for two reasons, the two characters are alone and confused in their own world. Don Cheadle's performance is less surprising, but not just  ంతే మంచిగా. హోటల్ రువాండా మరియు క్రాష్ తరువాత, మేము చీడ్లే నుండి విశేషమైన ప్రదర్శనలను ఊహించాము. అతను ఈ పాత్ర ద్వారా వచ్చిన నిజాయితీ మరియు నిజాయితీ యొక్క లక్షణాలు కలిగి ఉంది. కానీ అతను, కూడా, విచ్ఛిన్నం మరియు పోరాడుతున్న ఉంటే సాండ్లర్ యొక్క పాత్ర వంటి లోతైన మార్గాల్లో. Chedell faced difficulties with a dentist in his marriage and his career. Characters played by Chadley and Sandler in the role of true friends (Matt Damon and Robin Williams remind me of the good Mart Hunting). <br /> They're looking for their part of the seized and trying to find them again. <br /> This is one of the best studio films released this year. Soundtrack is another character in the plot. Filming on the streets of New York - a city that has suffered a great tragedy and also healed himself - is also very beautiful. <br /> <br /> Jada Pinkett Smith, Liv Tyler, Saffron Burrows (in a very odd role), Donald Sutherland and Mike Binder are very good characters. <br /> <br /> The author / director Mike Binder is really the story that the story will be able to connect with many levels too. This is a story about grief, family, medicine, mental friendship, mental health and love. Do not be disappointed to rule over me. The film is almost hypnotic, because you can attract the lives of its characters. If Hollywood has made so many nominally attractive films it would have a very good name.
