When I agree to leave Bob's and Tammy's baby Jesse, and there is something I never did, trying to make the baby better. The way the film is written, you look around in your story and see what you really believe in all the different things. Patty Duke? Villain? I do not know almost, most of the time I am concerned. But in the film, she really convinces you that she is mentally or at least badly mistaken with her. Her character is "emotionally disturbed." This film is over, and leaves some unsettled content. But other than that, this film is really great. It really makes you think. It's not a movie to watch when you kick back and want to relax to see something beautiful that you'll laugh. But when you want to challenge your own beliefs, look at things from other people's perspectives and get a good picture of yourself. Warning: You can even grow up when watching this movie! And in the end it is worth it.
