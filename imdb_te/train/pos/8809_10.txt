This document really opened my eyes to what people did outside the United States about the September 11 attacks. The film is innovative and this disaster is under attack on the US floor. This catastrophe has been previewed from many countries and perspectives. I believe this film should be distributed widely for the film. Helps in therapeutic process to look at other events rather than news reports on terrorist attacks. And some of the pieces are actually funny, but abusively so. The film is highly recommended by me, and I have passed the same feeling.
