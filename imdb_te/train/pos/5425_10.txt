This is a great epic, 1939.I come with a certain slightly popular South Soap opera-named Hollywoods great year, give Jr. excellent comic shows not clear Cory Grant, Victor McLaglen (who is a Bengal Lancer), and Douglas Fair Banks can not reiterate. I would like to see two more lesser lessons of this work. Magnificent final battle sequence, excellent Sam Jafe is just grand, as his bagle blow and labysly climbing to the pinnacle of the temple to warn the regiment. It never impressed me. Eduardo Sinell√©'s performance is another lesser element in the film. This number is Fu's snow satire, but a well-drawn, articulate, historically informative ("Can you ever hear the Changruputra Maurya? He defeated left in India by armies Alexander the Great") villain. In fact, the parallels between this spiritual, evil nationalist and a prominent person in the thirties (German, not an Indian) can be seen. Ganga Din, Nazi pulp? Almost. But still, a wonderful, funny, moving epic.
