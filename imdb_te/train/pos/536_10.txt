Some films can be seen almost 60 years later, and this ends up as one. Technical development did not dated with this classic love story. The special effects used in the 1946 film are unusual. Acting is amazing. David Niven, Kim Hunter and most importantly Roger Lively are doing the best job. The use of black and white / color adds to film creativity. It did not see television for 20 years, so some people also learned about their existence. This is my favorite movie. The wait and expectation of the film's release for a long time is "A Matter of Life and Death".
