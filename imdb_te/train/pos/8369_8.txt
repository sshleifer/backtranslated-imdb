<br /> This is a dumb image that has been translated from some of the languages ​​that are not fully understood by the translator. Here's the tip: Any movie that starts with black screen and text reading "in the future ..." is fun. <br /> <br /> In this case, instead of the "future ..." wars, nations are climbing guys, giant robots and duke to find it, well, never terrible, but it's probably something really important. <br /> <br /> "There are plenty of cheap looking interior scenes, and then a big space fight near the end." <br /> Now, after spending time, if the clock is deteriorated in the fight (and I do not make this up) two guys hitting each other with sticks. <br /> <br /> This is good when I say <br / This is good as I said Bring to a bar by the final scene to be repeated. So I bought the tape.
