A beautiful picture, especially if you like horses, WWII movies and tough Hungarian plateaus. The story of courage, compassion and credibility that overcomes generations. <br /> <br /> I will buy this film. I'll see again. It is a family image and it's very good. Good Family Fat Night. Despite some violent scenes, Hungary's Nazis invaded. They also came to the ground when a local Nazi officer faced some death from a Nazi officer who had his personal reasons for hunting Brady. A haunting beautiful picture.
