I had the right to watch "Holi" at Edinburgh Film Festival last week. What a powerful and moving story! Halley, a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl, sells herself into prostitution by her own family and lives in a brothel's home in Cambodia. Patrick (an American) enters into Holy life and decides to help her. When Holy is sold again, Patrick searches for her. We follow that they are traveling through Cambodia and hope for their reunion. <br /> <br /> Holi is one of the millions of children selling and having millions of children every day. This movement paints the picture without crossing the issue. I want to know more about the child smuggling issue and how do I ask for help? This film is viewed by everyone because it's a beautiful story and we will no longer disclose the problem.
