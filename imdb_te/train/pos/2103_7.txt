I do not know "Largo Winch" as a comic book (or is it a graphic novel? I do not actually know), but when I hear about an agent / hero movie, it's good to see this move while struggling to see it first . It's never really going to go anywhere (some turns are in advance, but usually, you're never really sure, it will continue). More than a stellar performance from the lead actor and a really good support cast, make this enjoyable watch. Some people do not take the initiative or hope for the movie, but it's a good mix.
