I liked it very much. In fact, if I look again (and I'll plan) I'd like it. I will resonate with other reviewers saying that when you look at this film you will actually grow up. It starts slowly, but the way in the breasts is very natural and has a mood. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the summer climate of the film and the whole movie is very well tuned. The characters are realistic and have a spell weave the picture very slowly and gently to get involved in the various interactions between you all and know how it can eventually change and take the characters. <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you feel like you do not know what to do, , But I did not see some of the film that was a little less estimated (almost never seen almost every movie in my movie) and it would not appear too much message board but I liked it and visual , The weather and an unhurried languid pace are all those who love family drama, especially for those who love South in South Carolina (such as me) and it's a gem, that is a gem, I'll make some of my vote and I recommend a familiar movie.
