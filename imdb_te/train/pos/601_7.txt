I am amazed at the low rating of the film from viewers. I saw a midnight on TV and it hit the spot - I really think back in 1989 when it first appeared. Yet I remember pretty well, a good turn or two, and an interesting atmosphere on a windmill farm. Michael Pollard does not appear to fit in his role, making it the predefined promise of his career, and everyone is pretty straight forward. Contemporary "edginess" is often considered just as a required marketing tool, although it might seem a signal now, although some of the themes might have seemed a bit overwhelming in 1989, however, I definitely recommend just as a rental, get sort of just sort of sort.
