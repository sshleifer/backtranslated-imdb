The story is well known in the long-running Tom and Jerry cartoons, especially in the 1940s, that the only difference is that they threaten two cats instead of one if they do not hold the mouse. Tom had a nameless nicknamed Bubdi ("Butch?") Living with him, so it really makes a "Mummy To Shoes", which does not believe that they have a mouse in the house despite two cats. <br /> <br /> Anyone holding a Jerry can stay while he's another, so the competition takes place! <br /> <br /> Although it is a familiar territory, the cartoon has an original scene that makes it entertaining. You can not compete against everyone but cats, so if you're a Tom & Jerry fan, it's good to make sure you're good.
