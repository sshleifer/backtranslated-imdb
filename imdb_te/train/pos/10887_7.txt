A horror film is filmed and things are not going well. It's about a mask killer. The director tells the killer before the cast and crew. He goes crazy and kills two people. He killed himself and the film was not finished. Twelve years later a group of filmmakers decides to try and finish - but there is a curse. Try it out and people who have been killed have been killed. Students do not care that. <br /> If this plot is an old hat it's not bad ... it's a low-budget slasher movie. It is well made with a young and very talented young cast. No one is great but nobody is either horrible either. This removes the mandatory (and unwanted) feminine nude scenes. It moves quickly, Gore is good and the bloody and scripts do not insult your intelligence. <br /> <br /> Molly Ringwold starred in the film, acting as a bit deteriorating her life. <br /> <br /> Great shakes but not bad. I will give 7.
