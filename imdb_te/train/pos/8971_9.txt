Generally, I'm not a huge fan of stop-motion pictures and the first RUKA is not caught up in my attention. However, when I realized that the film was created in an authoritative Czechoslovakia in the Soviet-dominated era, I realized how much innocence it was to see the movie. This subtitle really gives life to the film and gives it the real power to both work and political advertising. <br /> <br /> The sad little picture is done without dialogue, but this is going to be very clear. A beautiful little wooden man made a crockery and suddenly has a lovely time when an intermittent animated hand looks and destroys the pot - instead making it into a hand sculpture. Well, the wooden man holds his hands again and tries to do his own thing again. However, over time the hand becomes more severe and eventually increases the man. Finally, in the hands of man and hand, the true hypocrisy signals the dead man to give human funeral! <br /> As I said, this film is a clear attempt to criticize the brave Jiri Trinika over his dominant government. Surprisingly, Czechs loved this picture and gave it a critically acclaim, the state (ie hand) banned this little parable. Sadly, Trnka did not see a little more freedom after two decades of his so-called "Velvet Revolution".
