I never seen the 'Next Action Hero' presentation and did not know that the film was 'reward' from the competition until reading other comments here. <br /> Yes, the plot is full (a very dangerous game, etc.) but I was hoping, and almost received, 'gotcha' - how the protagonist beat the hunter at the end. <br /> <br /> This loses this high-tech technology (GPS) and gives me the rider's cold-sweating past night, but it's not too high. <br /> <br /> The primary problem I have with the film is the SOD (suspension of distrust) that the viewer needs. Can anybody who flies in a helicopter can investigate countless incendiary bombs on a public bridge and NO COPS? Can a limousine do countless donuts in the Las Vegas counter and NO COPS can be shown? Pleeease. <br /> <br /> The ultimate solution is good, but the end is disappointing, the evil Star Trek episode. <br /> <br /> Previously, I understood why acting was too much - except Jen, he did not get much effort for the IMHO role - they were winners from the reality show. <br /> Let me know.
