I participated in the filmmakers symposium, which was shown as a great film and after a 40 minute debate. Although it's too late, we are tired, the whole audience is very happy. <br /> <br /> Personally, I felt that the film was enjoyable in all the right places and liked the quirky cast of characters. They really grow in the picture you want.
