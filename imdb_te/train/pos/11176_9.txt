Well, at first I was just nine years old. If I see this two weeks ago for the first time, I realized that this was some of the most well-made cable-TV horror films with some well-made scenes. But you do not care about those facts when you are nine. It scared the hell from behind me, especially the Zelda-scenes mentioned above (and they still do). I just hugged this movie. I have to watch this once in a month, every New Year's Day I see with a 12-pack beer & friends group. It's an appetizer for a good party! I agree with those who say that acting is so beautiful. Midkiff and Crosby seem to be like Luis and Rachel, but these two faces do not see much devotion or feelings. Hughes and Gwynne make a lot of scenes "credits" legislation. I really want to tell you about this really nothing any other movie that is really similar to any pet semester and I'm not a zombie thing here. This film's ATMOSPHERE is definitely a lovely and a kin. Honestly, how many times have you seen a movie that looks like a surface-level cable-TV one, but cool when compared to the best horror-chillers there? I correctly busted a few balls of the cast a minute ago, but I did all the pieces of that level complete the performance. But tell me if you really know some people who are similar to Pet Semetary! I really want to know ... and I do not understand the dead man's death here ... comparing it with intelligence compared to this.
