Directed by Govind Nihani, the film is the perfect cop of Indian cinema. Police & Politics should not be the first to portray the true reality of corruption, which has no effect on how a young police was prevented. A police force forced his police to join a police career. Many of the good cop / bad cop was seen watching Hindi movies but it was different. Watching Dark & ​​Realistic Movies like 'Satya' and 'Company' can be produced in comparison with the current generation, but at the time of its preparation. The film did not produce any beaten tone in the film, but people did not pay much attention to this kind of movie, although it was demanded by the class and mass audience. The first performance of Om Puri in the main Hindi film and the class acting as Inspector Velankar. Cap is more than character, he is very intuitive which is something original in acting. His hatred hates his father, who loves Smith, who loves him. Smita Patil continued to the dignity of her role. My God has taken no natural expressions !!! If Shafi Inamdar really gave me a discovery and a chance he was an amazing role actor & here he was some of the outs of OM. This film was introduced to the Indian screen by Sadashiva Amraparkar as 'Rama Shetty'. Dharmendra BR Today he has not played an unforgettable role as a loud villain of action movies. Om is the first to see a scene with his father (played by Amrish Puri) and the two share the wine together. Internal truth reveals two characters how to confront the feelings of love and hate each other. Two Police Indian Police Force - Massaclity and Imputence and in Lings of Apos - Half Satyam (Ordha Satya)? Kudos to the touch of specimens. The film won 2 National Awards for Best Film & Best Film & Best Film & Best Film & Best Film & Best Supporting Actor Award at the Om Puri & 3 Filmfare Awards. <br /> <br /> It is good for those interested in extreme movies. <br /> Ratings - 8/10
