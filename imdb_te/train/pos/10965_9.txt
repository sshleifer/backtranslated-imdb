Little Eddie and Big ADs are the most compassionate characters. This means that their home is dirty, considering their mental illness. Writing in a poster on the message board, "Little Eddie has struggling skills at the age of eight." In this dramatic 2009 version, Big Eddie reminded me of Little Eddie, "If you're stuck, it's only with you!" These women have everything; Believe in aesthetics, talents, intelligence, their opinions and actions. If Little Edy was not the first time on her, she lost her hair, her job, and the love of her life, and she did not work. I believe this is something mental illness: her inability and good times to pick her up when the Times are difficult. <br /> If any of the unprotected women can not understand this, she does not know what happened, if she did not listen to her mother's heart. Intelligent, heartfelt, and lovable, in their very filthy house. These women are exceptional, and interact with each other. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <br /> <br /> "
