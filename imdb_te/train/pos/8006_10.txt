It should also run well on a specified PC as a volunteer. The story has acting from John Rice Davis, George Tiki, Jennifer Hale (she appears in every computer game). Stick with the story, this is fine and good. There is also a race section where you and your spaceships race around a course of opponent (which you will be going through the rings).
