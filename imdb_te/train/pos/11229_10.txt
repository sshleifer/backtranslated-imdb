The total number of actors are working on the project, they have a variety of cast. Nice starship CGI places but need some work on their green screens. Anyone who knows after effects 7 should buy a good key to anyone. <br /> <br /> Stories are well thought out. But the idea of ​​kissing two people sends me the episode. I'm not homosexual, but I can not find men who kiss fun (I can not keep women in mind). Anyway ... it's a good thing for a fan series. Brush your performance with small improvements in their green screen, and some guided ratings make this range amazing. I recommend this series that I have never experienced TNG and DS9 anytime.
