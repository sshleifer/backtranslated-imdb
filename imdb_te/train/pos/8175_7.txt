Before we begin, I am afraid of dentists. This film gives me creeps and makes me afraid. I love this film. The film is kind of boring. <br /> * Spoiler alert * <br /> This movie revolves around Dr. Alan Feinstone. He learned that his wife is cheating on him. <br /> As soon as he begins the hallucinations and begins to harass his patients, colleagues begin to kill, and he killed his wife and killed a man with whom he is related to him. <br /> * End spoiler * <br /> <br /> The film is very bloody and very hot. <br /> I'm Dr. Alan Feinstein Not Your Normal Everyday Dentist!
