Sarah Silverman is like a completely manic Zooey Deschanel and I'm already in love. Yes, if you love Jesus is magic, you love it. If you do not, why is heck wrong with you? Kudos to the comedy channel for this shoving in my face. My life is finally understood, and "the smell of your car furs" is my comedy. I'm a happy man. The first episode laughs at me and I look forward to starving next week. Grease meets South Park. Completely outrageous. Sarah Silvanmann is someone I can see reading the phone book. Her delivery is accurate and very fun. She's never flip a beat. It is not what she has to choose for her. It's some really good things by the way, the way she chooses to deliver it. Thanks to Sarah Silverman! Thanks to the Comedy Channel!
