Ah, Talespin! What can I say about this great performance not already mentioned? Nothing! This is without doubt one of the most well written written shows of live-action or animation I've ever encountered. A lot of new things are dumbing down for my taste, and some of the "adult" stuff I will shoo out of the kids in the room. But not Talespin. <br /> <br /> These stories are drowning and are very acceptable. Some of them can be extended for one hour or two hours for an image. Stairy Weather and Dream She is a very dramatic episode, and kids and adults still enjoy. The emphasis here is that the purest comedy episodes like Bale Blades, and postponing it on you. <br /> <br /> The theatrical aspect is very small in most of these days (especially those not particularly focused on it). For example, in the Star Study environment, Kit Cloudkicker decides he will join an air circus, but believes that this is very dangerous. In this episode's biggest fight, the ball shouts at kit to stay away from daring don, Kit says, "Nothing! You can not tell me what to do! Your * NOT * * MY * * DAD *!" And in his pillow he kills his face. The next day he leaves for the circus. This kind of play is rare in the cartoon and is very happy with these days. <br /> The characters have a lot of depth. Balu is the best way in The Jungle Book, plus or minus some degrees of laziness. Rebecca is a fraudulent businessman, her ideas are rarely good in practice, even if it is good in theory. Molly is a beautiful little girl, but you can not let that cheat. She will sometimes be a real hellion. Kit Cloudkicker is a darker character than the rest. If elders do not appeal to him, he does not believe in the elders, and he has a tendency to break relationships. <br /> <br /> Previously, it was a drama with a real chemistry in the middle. This book makes # 1 in my book. The relationship between baby and kit is almost father and son. This was well demonstrated in Almeus Whale at Wales when the kit's word for the ball was taken, and Seymour was abusing his animals at the aquarium instead of giving up other adults. Bale and Becky's relationship is also realistic, as Bale's inspiration for the bill seeks to re-purchase the Old Sea Duck, which does not require Rebecca's desire to help. But something tells me that he'd still like jobs for Rebecca if he could get me back duck. <br /> <br /> Sea Duck, not to mention all the other planes in the series, is pretty realistically designed. The duties of the aircraft do not change once (such a sequel is difficult), and other "super-planes" of other cartoons, there is only one weapon on the board (if you do not count!), And instead of getting out of trouble it's a fraudulent pilot great skill Depends on. Gun turrent, laser mortar, or somewhere on the board is hard to think of as a hero without vehicle. And the fact that they use their heads to get out of trouble is hard to find in the cartoon of the day. Plus it's just a darn cool design! <br /> <br /> It is definitely the best cartoon. Ever. Period. Definitely worth ten stars!
