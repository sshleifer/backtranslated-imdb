An outstanding description of the more unpredictability of the period. <br /> <br /> I would like more to the story linked to the Hong Kong novel. <br /> <br /> I thought that Tom Hanks was so great in this case, he did not choose himself completely) but still needs a normal life for his family. He makes the best he can to see that happen. Do not spoil the plot - but you have to watch this movie if you want to get more of a movie than a simple shoot 'Em Up Action / Gangster format. (It's violent.)
