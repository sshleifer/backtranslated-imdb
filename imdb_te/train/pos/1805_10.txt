I saw this movie, I first saw it at age 7, and I remember about the end of the day. I see, 10 minutes ago, and (I can feel like a baby as a 12 heck heck) I started crying in the end, I'm sad. I felt very sad to Anne-Marie because 'I love Charlie' and also: 'I'll miss Charlie', I'll call you hey. It should be one of my favorite movies of all time, it's good to watch a movie. <br /> <br /> "I loved this movie, its a true classic. <br /> xx maverick xx 10/10
