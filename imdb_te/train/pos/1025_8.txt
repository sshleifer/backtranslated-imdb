My ratings first 4 seasons stargate represents SG-1, which is amazingly fresh, creative and addictive. When the cast is entered by the gate, you never know what's on the other side! <br /> <br /> The series has regularly attracted a different look - still good, but different. <br /> The series regularly follows the adventures of the team (and alien) who are moving to a planetary equipment. "Stargate". The series's story relies on the characters and events of the film "Stargate" found in archaeological excavations in Egypt. <br /> These parts are light (naive and easy looking) and very creative. Most creative stories have not made their own science fiction films easy. It is unimaginable what will happen next. <br /> <br /> The characters in the show are well defined and displayed in a magnificent manner. Their voice is intense, but the dialogue is bloomed with excellent intelligence and humor. <br /> <br /> The series, which started somewhere in Season 5, is a continuous storyline based on the same foes (Govald, then Ory). The plot became more complicated (most politic / strategic) and mutually funded. <br /> <br /> These stories are still very great, but this exhibition is different in nature. <br /> The episodes of the 100th and 200th episodes are to be seen. They just can't-miss shows. <br /> If you're a sci-fi fan, look at some episodes of the first 4 season and hook you up. If you are analyzing the storytelling between the two opposing sides, the performances you have come have 10 seasons.
