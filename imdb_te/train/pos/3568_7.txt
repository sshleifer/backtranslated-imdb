The film moves the story of Cinderella in the early 1950s and makes the background of the epic of Einmann's good in the background. Ugly Sisters are widespread glamorous high-level English girls, and together with Kathleen Turner they are the stepmother of many stunning dresses. The story shifts slightly from the traditional version: the "King Lear" plot initially mixed up and in the later stages Cinderella is more rigid than ordinary. It looks amazing and works pretty well, but at times it does not go over.
