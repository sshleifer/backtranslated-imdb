While on a flight, flicking through a large selection of movies, I came across Live! Almost unexpectedly. Oh boy! <br /> <br /> I saw a trailer a year ago, and I never saw another cheesy nonsense in the stupid reality show. Now I can easily say this ride is a hell. I'm very happy, I did not remember the last time I was terrified. <br /> <br /> It is not at all high in my perfumes, but by suspense film slowly, where you turn from the backstage, literally sitting on the edge of your seat, with the rest nails you <br /> <br /> If you have a personal moral assessment You go first. "Why not?" By thinking, "Why are you grieving for a man?" You will not be thinking. Then learn about competitors, their intentions and start guessing. <br /> <br /> If you're the first candidate safe, the contestant will pull the trigger one by one and look forward to enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> * Spellers * Couple I have changed: <br /> <br /> Contributors of competitors. I was really moved by the farmer and we had a little bit of him. The idea of ​​a great writer who wants to become a celebrity is a bit stupid, considering you are concerned about some competitors. Although it was deliberately done, I think the audience could compete with the majority. <br /> <br /> What happens when the 5th Day of Contest is not killed if he breaks the Trigger? You seriously pull the trigger of the last stand person and think he will run !!! <br /> <br /> If you are in 5th place, no one will die. <br /> <br /> This bad point is that I am not very worried. Time is good. I wish I had some popcorn with me!
