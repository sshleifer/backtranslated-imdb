I remember this movie. An 11 year old is very serious. Good editing, I felt terrible for St Bernard. I can see again if I reboot, but when I write this I send the signal pluto. Robert Culp. The theme of his career. I'm happy not to live in that neighborhood. O the 70's. No decade. If they remade it, I'll be very violent and bloody. So what are they waiting for? An impressive picture for the early Pubent Suburban Boys. It's very serious. I think I was shot in Los Angeles. Lodi did not perform in NJ. The film shot with Saint Bernard came from the best and most obvious movie ... After that they left the body. Rotten kids.
