Even though I do not think this is the perfect 10, I agree that it's over 6 here. No, Brockdon's Palace is not perfect and yes it happened several times before the plot. If it is done correctly, I do not want to repeat it and I think this film will have some strong moments. Claire Danes's acting is already Kate Beckinsell and is flawless, and Bill Bielnan is absolutely awesome as I support supporters (Pullman's wife, curly relative, skip or whatever). <br/> <br /> <br /> Cinematography is beautifully portrayed, the film is very good, and there are also some disadvantages (the three main ones I found). <br /> <br /> I do not like it here - the friendship between girls - in fact, the girls' own personal personalities - are not deeply developed until the end of the end. This is not an inevitable possibility to lose interest in, because, despite positives, more character development has happened before and some scenes, such as when the girls are first arrested, while the character and the scene are not adequate for this kind of film. That's not my main problem. <br /> <br /> AWFUL ending dozens of dozens already. It's awful both ways. First of all, although it's speculative and very Hollywood, I'll be happy! Yes, it's an emotional and powerful ending but like this film, there is a sense of justice being served and I do not sit through to watch. I finally saw at the end and it was all the best but I think two girls should come out or at least guard him. I did not do anything bad guys, they all got away with. <br /> <br /> I can not understand the blur of the end. I thought about it, but it's not a mystery or "clue" image of the movie we're looking for, and what I really wanted to know is what was happening, guilty, with this conclusion <br /> <br /> We're really excited about this film, and Acting is definitely at the top of the list, I would rate this one 7.5 and say it is definitely worth a look.
