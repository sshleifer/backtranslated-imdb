I've read some reviews and the story looks pretty much glassy. <br /> It's not a book, with a picture and a lot of it in the movie- US or Canadian-or anywhere else. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Playing for 'Friendly Neighbor' Gay Man, just like me with "F @ g-hug" for at least one recovery, is a great job - but play sick. I mean, the man can not really get more pale! <br /> If you are weak, there are some skunk films you like. <br /> <br /> The daughter of a renovating Alchoholic, druggie brother {David Cubitt} is the trick for me. I'm going to give him credit, he grew rapidly - I believe it's good. And, as an amateur writer, moimeme, I can dig a lot of his thoughts and overview. <br /> I am grateful. A nice story is pretty well put together - Canadians, quelle surprise. It's just a 'weekly movie', which is missing by being missed, greatly appreciated. And it is rather cleverly portrayed.
