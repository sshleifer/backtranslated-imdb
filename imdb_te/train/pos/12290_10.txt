Hotel du Nord is a gripping play of guilt in which Marcel Carne filmed an entertaining story of the unfortunate love of a rebellion against the brutal world. The film has added to all the lovers who are not weird. They believe that Pierre and Renee misinterpreted their suicide by ending their crime. Health Dude Nord has its own unparalleled charm after its residents become an important part of the base. Etc. Marvel Carney was original to the soul of the films produced in the 30s and 40s, and the Hotel Door Nord had a kind of memory feel. Korn gave a distinctive style for his unique poetic reality as a black and white dance reviving the life of Parisian roads. The 14th July Ball of the St. Martin's Canal remains a marvelous sequel. Mense's popularity was declared as a national monument by Hotel Du Nord.
