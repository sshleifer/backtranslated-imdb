As one of the earliest commentators has said, it has the basics of the great movie, but something has led to delivery. And Williams is believable because such waste is the wonder of Callett's performance. I look forward to being good. I do not think it's bad editing or another director, it's just a movie. It came across a Canadian film, like the first few seasons of the X-Files. Not cheap, just hokey. Moreover, a little need for suspense. Something you jump off from your seat. That moment deteriorated after that moment; Kind of like a bad climax. I can see that he's taken from the "reality" of the story with much enthusiasm, but when Gabriel was in the hospital looking for the boy I reached that point. The film must have a director cut, which tries to solve these problems.
