It's a powerful image. For the first time I saw it, Scottish voices were hard to understand me and ruined the viewing experience. I gave up on it but earned the DVD and I used the English subtitles when I needed it and realized how good it was in the picture. It's awesome. <br /> The widescreen image makes some splendid harsh scenes with some amazing harsh scenes. This story reminded me of Brighthart's good memory. Here, it's Liam Neeson (good) vs. Tim Roth (bad). <br /> <br /> The two actors were disappointed as Roth. Man, you really want to smack this proud, irritating puss this guy. (He is a very scary and unhealthy critics prefer his role more than others). Nielsen in Gibson Braveheart is a man's man and a solid hero. Jessica Lange is strong here as the female leader. The film attracts you and is fully involved, so it has an emotional feel.
