This is a good little shocker; The imagination is not perfect by any stretch, but stiff, competent and upset. An excellent example of a simple idea has been developed into a comprehensive 90-minute script. <br /> <br /> Setup does not require any bells and whistles, no long description or a story behind the words; Kate (França Pontent), a German German businessman living in London, faces confusion while waiting for the last tube rail. She wakes up to find the place in the desert, but she is forced to realize that she is far away. <br /> In fact, she encounters many lovely roles in her quest to survive including a lovely work colleague, homeless couple and a caged. The dirty worker, the plot of this is a pace and ingredient. There's somewhat awkward gear change somewhere in between the movie when the tension is transformed into a groove fest, but there is nothing brilliant to slow down. It's a frightening ride for those in you with weak reorganizations; <br /> <br /> Although the film is less successful than the mainstream of the film climax, it is a punctuation. A good moment with an unexpected social commentary that provides a satisfying ending. </ p> <br /> Some feel that some have cheated some of the obvious nature of the nature and history of the threat that Kate and her colleagues faced, however, for me it was not the case. For a horror film writer I reflected everything and I do not need to think that I was crossing each tip, as well as a politically breathtaking writer. There is enough evidence to give you a clear and clear idea of ​​bringing this evil into being, a detailed and complete solution is superfluous. <br /> <br /> We welcomed and retorted us to retain a mysterious concept that the ride could always be more important than a perfect destination. Budget for this film At least in this case, to say the least, our appreciation for this British horror should be loud, no time to cut or fail in the corner. <br /> This is probably because of your kind of image. Buy a ticket and move on to it.
