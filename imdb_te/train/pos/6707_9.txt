I really know its really really corny ... but acting is amazing and Melissa Jon Hart is as beautiful as a button. I loved this presentation very much, and I was almost as embarrassed to be a b / c show representative. To be really cool, but it made me feel good. My only problem is sometimes a very low budget - sometimes actors change and you have to face it ... Sabrina's father, like the movie, has 2 different people ... I mean, can not they say that he is uncle or something? However, I can not love this presentation. Harvey and Sabrina make a really beautiful couple and Salem is absolutely hilarious. I would definitely recommend if you are looking for your light and funny entertainment ... my favorite episode "Pancake Madness" ... a partial episode. The best season is probably 3 ... I'm not really a seven-season turnaround ... when you come to college, Morgan joins the group and her dialogue is painful and much less ... plus she's so funny, so jokes about how she looks good I'm lost ... But I thought the eighth season was good and something of my favorite shows It's really sad to see one!
