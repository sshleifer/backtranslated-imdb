Siblings grown in Dev Anand (or Prashant) and Zeenat Aman (Jasbir / Janice). Jusbir (that sister) grows in the richer atmosphere but leads her to deny her life and eventually she leads her to the drugs in the hippie movement. Prasanthi (brother) grows in the richer atmosphere on the other side, but he is a mature adult. This story refers to Prashant's efforts to preserve his younger sister (who is constantly trance) from the controversial hippie environment. The film retains the test of the Times, hinges and hippie groups referring to losing their lives as a place for them to stand up and count on the background of difficulties. The different musical compositions of this film mean different things to different situations and different people, and the director brings it strangely.
