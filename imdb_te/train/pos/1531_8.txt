When I was ill with school 10 years ago, Diagnosis Murder was shown on most weekend afternoons in BBC1 - I know I should not really enjoy it. "But I'm totally addicted and DVD box sets for both .... I'm sad! <br /> <br /> Dick Van Dyke Doctor Mark Sloan Doctor in Hospital General Hospital in LA, a police consultant for LAPD - his son Steve (Barry van Dyke - Dick's real life son) is a police officer, most dad mysterious needs help from his father. <br /> <br /> Dr.Amanda For the first couple of residential pathologist and seasons at the Gentleman (Victoria Bentley) Community General you have Scott Boyo playing Dr Jack Stewart, who was upped and left in 1995 hoping to go big and good things ... where he was, he did not do anything of the note. .. and his only stage appearance for many years is Baby Geniuses 2: Superbabies <br /> <br /> Anyway doctor Jessica Travis is replaced by the younger Dr. Jessie Travis Charlie Schlitter in the shoes of Bio's shoes.> The series is not quite inescapable, but is not the Whodunit series? (Her murder is - Jessica goes everywhere, someone ends dead, or the nun with a murdered nun with a murdered nun in the nun's father Dowling Mysteries <br /> <br /> The series was fairly easy until 1997, because Dellor The assistant cast, including the bailingling hospital manager Norman Briggs, played by Michael Tucci with Nols & Mark's Secretary Dolores, Secretary of Nurse & Mark, is no longer included and the series has become a tough affair with the budget that appears to be much larger. <br /> <br /> It is Van Dickey's Family The district is because Dick's sunscreen, you're also Dick's Daughter You are a show in various episodes of his grandchildren. <br /> <br /> The series is a bit silly in this series, an episode recalling that Dick Van Dickey played his entire family, which is a bit common, but the Hole 'Diagnosis Murder' is a good TV show with very good guest stars. <br /> <p> <br /> This show was followed by Dick & Barry the Harmark Channel's 'TV Movies' since the very end of 2001, and is still enjoyable. Dick in his mid-80s feels he can not change a great deal, and he seems to work until the bitter end. <br /> TV Show **** Out *****
