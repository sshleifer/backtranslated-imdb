Robert Sioux is doing an amazing job with this B Noir starring Ella Rhinees, Francon Tone and Alan Curtis. And he did it, I add, without much help from his male actors, that is, Curtis and tone. <br /> <br /> Seymock has never used a sex, light, shadows, and music for a reason or another. He was really great for overcoming this genre. Shadows, lighting effects, and camera angles are all efficient. But the highlight of the film is Elisha Cook coincides with an excited Raines, which takes place in a nightclub to ring too sexually drum. <br /> <br /> Siadamak's commitment to this term is only enough by Ryan, and she has acted honestly as a woman in love to protect her. Francht Tone refers to this. Alan Curtis does not seem to die and he does not seem to be happy with what he lived. <br /> <br /> As the Second World War progressed, interest in psychiatry increased. But these words are often incorrectly used in films such as "Possessed", "Spellbound" and "The Greatest Show on Earth". Tony Thomas is suspiciously known by Gomes - Tone has some mental disorders in relation to his disorder, but he looks closer to a mental illness. <br /> <br /> The Phantom Lady does not have a great plot, but it's good to see it well.
