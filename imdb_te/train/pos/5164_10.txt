I attended Camp Cesspipe. It is at the head of Chesapeake Bay on the North East River in MD. This is a kind of summer camp with cabins. It was founded by Kottsville, PA YMCA. I started as a young camper and later became junior, senior councilor and waterfront director. If the camp continues, I have done something in my power. Vaiemsie Powers decided to close the camps and sell to the MDD state. I visited the former camp by boat a few years later, fearing neglect of MD and natural devastation by Mother Nature. The 350 acre space has worked with all the benefits associated with nature aesthetics. Curtis Ford is a black man and his family residents and guardians of the property. Mr Curtis is my friend and teacher. I made him clean every living thing. He is a waterman who can not swim. If I ask him when the fish is biting, he suggests that the spot, and I have the ball. Thur is also a family camp at the end of summer. These memories are eternal with me.
