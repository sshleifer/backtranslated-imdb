Operations at its finest in its Hollywood imitating Diamond Soup! It's fun we have not seen. Great characters and great lines. Wopi is happy ... Sally Field topped .... Gary Marshals lines riots. I love this good comedy. Sets are great .... Wardrobe Point and Backstabbing "Montana Morehead" is a ghost happy. Although Terry Hochher does not have enough lines as "Dr. Monica Demoniko", the screen is no less beautiful and fun. I want to know how the idea of ​​this film came from. I never saw people cast a lot of fun doing comical things! Sodody should be one and I'm waiting for the DVD!
