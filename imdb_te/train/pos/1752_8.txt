Spies sex? This is one of the most important parts of human life. Still, do we take that seriously? All people are always on a daily basis, and if you're unfortunate, there are potential (changing) developments in the potential life. It is hard for people who are ridiculed to get a point like virgins so that all people are sexually young and young (although the Victorians are married, even though they have children in their early teens). On Steve Carell's first big screen, he played the man who had earned up to 40. The usual plot of the film, and the principle is not funny to sound, treating us with countless lying and intense sexual events, without mentioning more vulgarity than an episode of "Eurootrache". <br /> <br /> Andy Steitzer (Kreel) is a good guy, it's a very pleasant surprise, so all the inappropriate, unsuccessful jokes, a huge number of surprising touches the mark, have a good job and fun. At the same time, he takes his life very seriously, and after being invited to the Poker Games as a fifth member, Andy's friends can find his secret. At 40 years old, Andy is still a virgin. Now, for many reasons, but mostly pity, Andy advises three men (Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen and Romney Malco) all with a goal in mind. <br /> <br /> One of the few good things about "Anchorman" is that Steve Karel is going to be a bit short of the time before he heads. Own. Improvised, he is disappointed in "The 40 Year Old Old Virgin". <br /> <br /> Kerlle is not alone in his performance. Rudd, Rogen, Malco and Katherine Keener. Rudd is very fond of being a man named David, who falls apart several times and shares a great scene with Rohan, who argues against two gay people. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise jokes about this movie hit many marks, but in fact it's the clever way of throwing the message on the head. Naturally produced for a conservative America, the whole tone has emerged from a simple story of sexual encroachment of sex and sexual abuses. Virgo does not need sex to complete his life, he just needs faith and true love. <br /> <br /> It is very unusual to watch a continuously funny and well-shot crude comedy, but be less and behold, "40 Year Old Virgin". Throw in a delicious message and you're well on the way to a high class comedy. Surprising joy.
