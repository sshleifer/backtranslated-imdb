It was seen at the 2003 Vancouver International Film Festival and is a hell and a bit surreal. In Toronto, the two losers live in the runway down the middle of a freeway system. David Hewlett (Pin, Cube, Cipher) and Andrew Miller (Cube) are as great as two losers who want to just go away in the world. Acting, dialogue and writing are very good, the whole movie is good for a low-budget movie. When director / writer Vincenzo Natali was present at the show, he was intelligent and down to earth. This person is so inventive with these great stories that work well within the small budgets, which puts the big Bollywood Hollywood garbage shy!
