The plot is a bit sappy at times, and even though the director has run out of his determined time and has been hurry and finished the story, even though VERY has rushed late, the whole-it's pretty good-made-for-backed-genre. <br /> <br /> However, the actress, who played Babyso, Mariana Klaveno, is very good! I hope more of her around the movie Earth. Music is also well done to get every possible cool out of Da-DUH-da-DUH (think "Jaws") Type the ups and downs of music based tension. <br /> I do not think 'I'd like to see "again when the child is sleeping", if I do, it will focus on talented Klaveno's performance.
