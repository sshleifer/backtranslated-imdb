I am impressed with this film. It has the basic aspects of depression, grief, loneliness, depression, hope, dreams and companionship. It's not about a genius who's hit the bottom of the rock but about a genius musician but just caught up in the dramatic grief trying to find solace in his music. He learns as a companion with his own problems. Claire and Des were able to provide each other with friendship and affection, but most importantly the ending of the events that hung their lives. <br /> <br /> Des role is a rare character in today's rock star's standards. Yet he is musical genius. He had an incident in his past, and the things around him literally go to the ruins. His vision creates his whale music, in fact it is an invasion. <br /> <br /> Clair State Street needs Kid State. She finds her hidden talent while in the company. Accepts a mutual friend who accepts her. <br /> <br /> In both of these, you will love each other. The mind is not blowing, romance is kind of inspired, but friendship and understanding is more in love. They will get together for two people who hurt.
