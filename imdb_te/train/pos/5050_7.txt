<br /> <br /> The simplest story of simple Attenborough fashion: We really enjoyed the Gray Owl, with a little more-intuitive, slightly more-intuitive, simplistic and optimistic perspective. The pace is the true story of the Englishman who moved into the local Indian, living in Canada and went to the trail. <br /> <br /> The solid performances from all makes it easy to see the message. <br /> The two stars of the film are without any doubt that we have never seen - and the message is good with its Ecoleanings. It must be great to meet or read Gray Owl in the 1930s, a unique character.
