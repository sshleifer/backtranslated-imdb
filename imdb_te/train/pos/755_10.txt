Dirty Sanchez's Jacques is more intense, with four boys (Pritchard, Dainton, Joyce, and Pancho) in British version reaching great length to bother and humiliate each other. This event is much better than Jacques, because most tricks make reaction with much reaction. There are 3 rows in the program, the first of which follows and their lives are eg. There is an episode on their love lives, jobs etc.. The second series sends boys to try different occupations. The third follows their European tour. As the series progresses through the series, the boys are more brave. The third series in my opinion is the best, but if I do not watch the stomach a week, it's easy to see a fair amount of blood and Puuk in every week, trust me when I say.
