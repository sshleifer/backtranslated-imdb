The wonderful film about Things Relations About My Folks - the first son of an adult and his father, but his wife, his sisters and his mother. Paul Reiser wrote a semi-autobiographical film about his relationship with his father. The film is funny, sharp and thought-provoking. This has led me to analyze my own relationship with my now deceased father and my eldest son. Peter Fall is as amazing as Paul's father - the character could not be cast better. Faulk and Mr. Reiser both feel that they have been recognized in the film awards for the next year for their efforts - for his script for Faulk and Ryazer for his work.
