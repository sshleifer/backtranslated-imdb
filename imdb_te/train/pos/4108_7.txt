Kurosawa, fresh in color, realizes the truth and originality of its common themes and discourages Tokyo's slums. Kurosawa has, in my opinion, extended to his contrasting style-that is, I think Kurosawa wants to make a film. Poorly paced, poorly evolved, is a rare dad in this movie. While Ikiru, while still mundane and discouraging, is still interesting and well-liked, and Straig Dog is portraying Japan's slums and social poverty, do not be too heavy or boring, do ka den <br /> <br /> This is not a cinema to say Kurosawa.
