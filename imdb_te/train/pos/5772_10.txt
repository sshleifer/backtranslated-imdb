I saw this presentation as a child, and I loved it! I saw it when the Tonamier YEARS arrived .... Sheesh, I was too old! When it comes I should have 13 or 14 years ... But anyway, it has a great plot line, and one of those girls and girls in Sailorman I've enjoyed. Animation is not the best ... in some episodes is very fun, in fact, and voice acting was very slow in the beginning, but it was a good watch and I sucked it the day after day. <br /> <br /> Samurai Troopers / Ronin Warriors is a classic, and one of my faves is one all time. GO RAI !!!!
