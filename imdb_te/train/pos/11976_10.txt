There are three children in this program. (D.J, Stephanie and Mitchell) are killed by their mother's drowsiness driver, so that their father, Danny, invites his brother (Jessie) and his old friend (Joey). So the whole presentation is about life. Girls learn through life's problems and life lessons. They develop crushers, boyfriends and more. The whole program is basically going to go with the flow. You have to let it go. I think this performance is really good and fun to watch. I grew up watching this show and still see today. They are still happy to air this show on television. I'm almost every day looking. I will rate 10/10.
