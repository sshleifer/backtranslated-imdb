The film is also entertaining, entertaining, entertaining and interesting. It was made at the end of the Soviet Union, but it makes Soviet psyche fun. The story was set in the early days of the Soviet Union, and questioned the reason behind the revolution in the cultural and practical methods. In fact, by the late 80s and 90s, the immense commitments of Soviet society were already relaxed, but ideology and psychology were still better and ready for some well-desirable construction. Happily, all this deep philosophical commentary is wrapped in a funny and entertaining package!
