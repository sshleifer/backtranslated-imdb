<br /> <br /> This film has made me frightened from the first day I saw it. <br /> <br /> When my mum saw it on the telly back in '92. <br /> <br /> When her dad helped her down the stairs, she rose through the tear ramplings in the middle of the night. <br /> <br /> "She does not allow me" or something like that. <br /> <br /> I asked her that she was frustrated and she said she was looking at her blocking wool. <br /> <br /> I would definitely like to see and she did not allow me even though I was eleven. It scared me out ***. I'm immune to horror films from watching!
