Richard Wilmys is an animation god. The producer will direct the film. The final product is a very uneven film with a very convoluted story, but some amazing animation animations (like Emery Hawkins' "Greedy"). Joe Raposso's repetitive music does not help. It was made on the wide screen so it does not show it in its glory in VHS, let's hope for a letterboxed DVD someday. Still looking for some eye popping animation.
