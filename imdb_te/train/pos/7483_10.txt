Vanilla Sky is the 2001 remake of the 1997 film Abre Los Ozos (Open Your Eyes). And in my opinion, more human and emotional version. Tom Cruise plays David Aimes, a selfish emoomic who sees his emotions, and feels only himself. Jason Lee portrayed Brian Shelby, David's best and only friend in many ways. Penelope Cruz starred as Sofia Serrano, Brian's sweetheart, whom he had accompanied David's birthday. Cameron Diaz played Julie Gianni, David's occasional bed friend. Kurt Russell is Dr. Kurtis McCabe, a psychologist David interviewed. Vanilla Sky made one of the most emotional and intricate thrillers for all of their interactions and their consequences. The plot is no longer explained, it's very compelling, you know less. Ignore all who call this movie. If you care, you will be confused. The picture is very complicated, but not confusing. And in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made.
