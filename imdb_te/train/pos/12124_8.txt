The 1934 adaptation of Somerset MauGame's novel was kept as a film actress on Betty Davis. She was able to win an Academy Award for her performance, but the films were made on loans, so that her studio did not hit her. This performance does not come well with today's standards. Philip, Zirx Phillip, a sensitive medical student around, almost destroys her life, and Davis is almost a devil. Director John Cromwell was able to get good performances from his actresses, perhaps one of them. Davis is certainly not visible, but it is rarely seen as humanly similar to being rare and exploitative. I guess the role of Milli is less than Davis and the role of the male. <br /> <br /> Davis has a strong, instant presence of her without any mystery to have her the attraction of Felipe. <br /> <br /> Philip, Lesley Howard is wonderful. His wan, looks somewhat wilted, is perfect for this failed esthete. As Dirk Bogarde did, he did not impose a personal explanation of what he said, giving his work a rare clarity. He can not handle or be totally satisfied with a person who is in the emotional emotions, and he is completely under control as the object of his love moves him so that he can not understand. Howard is a good actor, he often starred in classic romantic episodes, which forced him to pull back the charm, which he does not use here. <br /> <br /> I read the book and do not feel comfortable commenting on the movie's honesty. I am very close to the story of the story and I'm in a perfect Philip Carrie in Howard. Sexual attacks are muted, and sometimes Philip behaves deceptively to behave, and if there is no strong sexual feel, a wonder about the character's integrity is not exactly Mr. Mum's intention. Thanks to the performance of Holliday, Philip is firmly in his attitude, looking at his many responses and anxieties for Millie, reasonable intelligence will go on to understand the irrational meaning of himself and others. <br /> <br /> Overall, a good image, slightly aging at times because of its age, has evolved quite well for London, and most of it has acted well.
