How wonderful this picture is! I've seen it all over and over for years and I'm always enchanting by it. The film is very easy to look at, and arresting Betty Davis. She only steals every scene in herself, but her home studio, Warner Bros. (So far better than any of her films in the film, and better photographs (not about sexy) made by RKO Radio Pictures). She wears a very attractive make-up and very attractive hairstyle and oh, those lovely big eyes (in particular, in London's Soho restaurant scenes). Her body was very curvy when she was younger. Get a load of cheap negligence she wore to her big explosion with Leslie Howard. And boy, she is a perfect platform in that scene. Howard is very small throughout, but he captures the hero sensitivity. Frances Dee counts a sweet, pretty young solitaire that really loves him. Max Steiner's score is lovely and sharp. Excellent performances and thirty flavors make it a must-see version of the classic novel.
