For this film I have apologized: too, very, very close to the wide cone, and if they irritate you with patience, it's fair enough. They surrounded me for the first ten minutes. But after that I made a kind of a cinematography with terrible cinematography. And long before the end of the film, I stopped taking care of it. It's so easy to do that comedy is so easy. It's funny, it's witty, comic delivery in all the castes is not flawless, but Usher has a cool, fish-eye lens in his roles - he does not care much for them - he makes them warm. `Mystery Men 'is, of course, not more intelligent than anyone, but rather deeply, not as credit to anyone. Jokes in Austin Powers' films, for example, are less teaser than jokes, not too dentist. It's no disrespect to any old thing when the irony of "mystery men" is peaked and gently slow. <br /> <br /> Some people (I thought I would not alert them) critics say it does not always come out of ideas. <br /> <br /> The super cute bunch of 'super' heroes. Sure, they have a second rate, but they are not just a second rate. For example, The Blue Raja does nothing to cut swords at people, and he is not good at it. On the other hand, he is also jokingly funny. He is better than most people in his limited field, and he has done diligently. He is not a buffoon, it makes a much more intriguing role than him. If Superman is Christ in Cape, in mystery men cape, all the little godfathers from the mountains of Mount Olympus. Very ridiculous; Even the most fascinating.
