It deserves 12 to 12. A completely refreshing show with real characters and true stories. This program should come back, I saw every episode and this is a real quality. <br /> <br /> A couple of New Yorkers have demonstration centers around six degrees division and disrupt their lives intelligently. Bridget Moyannan and Jay Hernandez are excellent, so adorable Cassman. "<br /> <br />" Six degrees seriously missed.
