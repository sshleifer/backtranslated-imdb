When I was small I saw this movie - it called "glacier fox". I was totally damaged! It follows a small little fox family around. The start was so great and I've attached a lot to the little foxes. I also remembered that my mother was taking me from the theater while I was in Hysterics. Tell me what happened, but say that it is not as good as foxes. Animals were used for natural images that were not really dead. What happened. This film is lying for hours. It's a good movie ... I think - I really said a bit and the truth - I'm happy for the jackets and then one of them is going to die. Rent it if you can, but do not show your children!
