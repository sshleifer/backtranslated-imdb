The city of Boston and Fenway Park is the most beautiful picture of a great backdrop. As a baseball fan and light film addict, it hit me a homerun. Laughs and realistic baseball scenes with real references to real bulleppers and past bosoxo failures. And how awesome Overview, Over the Hill, self-serving Kevin Costner is watching a movie with a baseball theme without having to endure trying to make a complex audience believe? Jimmy and Drew have done a good job as a young couple who suffer from Jimmy's Bossox "Jones". It's a bit whacky and in the left field, but there are those passionate and soaks fans who really make their lives through their beloved team luck. Despite the momentum, the film is fast and durable in the film, but has the appeal of many other popular films and pity, excessively laughing. <br /> <br /> Willie Garson is also happy to be back on the screen. I will miss the popular "Stanford Bloc" from Sex & the City. He's always funny, even when he's doing or even less so. <br /> Get yourself ready for two boxed seats, some popcorn, and a fun time. "Fever Pitch" winner.
