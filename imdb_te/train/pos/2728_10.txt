Just one of the best! The simulator of the fictional novel of Richard Brooks's Truman Capote is truly an artistic practice. A stunning black and white cinematography (winning the Oscars), a haunting quincy Jones score and Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are spectacular performances by unusual-matched killers. At the Academy Awards, the film was nominated for 4 to 4 and Doctor Dulitel for Best Picture. Go and find! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you feel like you do not want to be alone, 10, 10. Best Performance = Scott Wilson at second with R. Blake Highly recommended!
