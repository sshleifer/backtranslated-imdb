This is a very low budget (some scenes appear as they are recorded with a home video recorder). But it's good plot, and its easy to follow. After 8 years of acting in her sexual abuse stage, father Amanda was released from a psychiatrist who was released with the help of her doctor who was secretly associated with her. The doctor hires his home and buys her car. But in the first 20 minutes Amanda will kill him and kill him in her backyard. Then her neighbors Richard puts her eyes on him. She was innocent but after another neighbor Buzz Amanda tried to kill the doctor and kill Richards's wife Lorry (after Amanda and he gets it in a hot tub). She then loved her and cared for her to stop Innocent's acting, killing Buzz and trying to kill Richard. And if Amanda dies, you have to rent the movie. I know that the whole picture, the fall of the neighbors and you have nothing to stop him until you participate.
