Rated NR (rated for strong language and R for crude sexual humor). Eddie Murphy Deliras Eddie's first stand-up comedy routine. Released in 1983. He then starred in the 48th film. hrs and trading places and he starred on Saturday Night Live. Eddie has come up with two of the comedy films. Delirious and Raw. Raw I like because I have found something more ridiculous. Deliveries are fun when talking about Eddie with a very funny childhood and celebrities like singers like Mr.T and Michael Jackson. Any fan of stand-up comedy movies should see Eddie Murphy's Delirus.
