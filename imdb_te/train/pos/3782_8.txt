When I was a child, I totally liked both Bill & Ted Movies. The other night, the Bogus Journey I have last seen for at least 5 years, I decided to tune it and I loved everything again! This film is funny even after all years. 'Excellent Adventure' is good, but this one is just the same for stones. Sure, perfomances are some bit cheesy, but hey, this whole movie is cheesy in a cool way. Plus it has always been the coolest personality of Death in a movie! Conclusion: Completely Non Bogas Movie Dude! Way is amazing! STATION !!!
