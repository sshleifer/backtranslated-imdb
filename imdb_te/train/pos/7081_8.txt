The story of this movie is really great. One virus was loosely cut and only 1% of the human species remained. Now that we know is that the animals are above the earth and posters are everywhere, "twelve monkeys did it." On the right, the human race had to cover the underground from the illness that killed 500 billion people. Clearly animals do not adhere to this disease. Today's scientist has sought to understand why the illness caused the day; How was created; Nature made it or just man created it. They learned that there was a group of animals running around the city above, in 1996-1997 the deaths started and twelve monkeys had something to do with it. (Or at least poster). The current coach, James Cole (Bruce Willis), was "volunteered" to get some of the above mentioned samples. After his "volunteer" work, he was asked to return in 1996 to find out what had happened to the world. Cole agrees and the story of twelve monkeys begins. </ p> <p> <br /> </ p> <p> When the story was completed in the 1950s, the Time Machine was made a few times since the 1990s. (In the middle of the battle.) During the time and passing forward, it starts up messing up the mess over the head and twist up the story. The entire story is very well done and I have not been able to finish it but I've given it to a higher level. I do not personally like the end of the film and I was very disappointed. I'm exploring what's going on then, but not everyone who thinks this way. I gave it an 8, but if everyone has the same view, I give it 6 or 7. <br /> <br /> I will give A + to the whole act of the film. Bruce Willis is good for this role and he does a good job, but Brad Pitt is absolutely 100% amazing. His performance is great and he gets the better of the character. I never really cared for Brad Pitt until I saw him in this and the Fight Club. The film has characters or similarities, just a little more in the film ... fainting. Overall, I think this film is absolutely valuable. It's a great science fiction film for most people, I do not think it's a masterpiece.
