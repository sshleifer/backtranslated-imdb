The Titanic movie makes a lot more then just "remember the night". It always talks about and will write a tragic history event that will never be forgotten. Why criticized? I do not know. They can make a movie like a titanic or touch every time it looks. Can they replace such an epic masterpiece? It is almost impossible. </ P> <br /> The director has no doubt. An ordinary disaster movie (boring to see) is transformed into an unbelievable romance. Yes I'm not the type of romance, but you do not bother, because you will not see a romance like this. Guaranteed! Excellent effects everything, music, excellent performance. <br /> <br /> The film creates a spectacular visual and exciting concept. Everything looks very real and live. Legend has her "Thitanic" very beautiful in all classes, and is very much accommodated. This act is a real influence. Dicaprio and Winslet are just good at playing the roles. No one can do better. The reason why this film is so great. <br /> I'm not too much to talk to. The plot is linear, acting on the basis of true acting, and possibly sharing half the tears of users watching the movie, not forgetting to the predictable end. Are you unable to see this film for the movie that is desirable for Hysterical, and Hollywood? Is it better? It is not. The most moving picture of all time, listen to the people, look for you to understand. A milestone. (Do not be surprised if you cry too)
