<br /> <br /> Sydney Young (Peg) moves from England to New York, and struggles to gain a lasting impression with the intention of leading his dream of celebrating Charpette Sharp. <br /> <br /> American business about survival based on Toby Young's book, has received mixed reviews from the comic drama critique. How to make friends with the absurdly funny but the actors charm, how to lose friends Enjoy another culture comedy with a run of mill fish from the pond, but it is not. <br /> <br /> This 2008 film works with its actors account and simple yet sharp story. We've been in the past and have been working on our way to look forward to how Young has made its mark in one of the best magazines in the US. <br /> <br /> Peg (Hot Fuzz) is the most fond of words. The nature of the law, which strikes the zombies with a cricket bat or his scene brings English charm a charm and a light heart for every scene. Here, the scripting is good but from most of his own standards, he brings more power to the film and he is only worth watching. <br /> <br /> His parrots with "Babe 3" are unforgivable, and he is a breathtaking dance, just like a breathtaking dance, but he pulls out wonderfully. <br /> <br /> <br /> Bridges and Anderson Dunst is a fascinating love interest in the stereotypical magazines. Megan Fox, who stole transformers, reminds everyone she can act with her stereotype film star's funny hyperbolist. The fact that her character Sophie Miles starred in the film about Mother Teresa is as ridiculous as the antics of her character in the pool. <br /> <br /> As a British adaptation of American Lifestyle for Young, he has a dog and pug rounds in a true Brity comedy. And look at the different approaches to the story we say. Young down right wants to dirty American craftsmanship. The modern tabloid stars will soon make the film dated, but the film's looting concept gives this edge. <br /> <br /> The first film of Vid√© is not perfect. The plot is very thin with an awkwardly clear twist, and there are flaws in concentration and there are many required characters. Physical comedy is also over. On one side note, the noodle in the DVD are half the length of which are some of the best you'll ever see. <br /> <br /> This funny drama Simon Pegg is again looking at the brightest form and the mass story and reach the sharp comedy.
