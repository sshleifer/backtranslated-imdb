I do not understand why most IMDb users do not like this movie. Why would they feel bad? It's not worse because there is nothing there. <br /> <br /> The reasons I liked the "Soldier": Kurt Russell, Connelly Nielsen, Jason Scott Lee, the script <br /> I also said that I was the best work I had ever seen from director Paul Anderson, think. "Mortal Kombat" and so entertaining "Event Horizon".
