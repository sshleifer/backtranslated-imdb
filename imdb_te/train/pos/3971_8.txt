<br /> Do you ever feel like you see? Because every move you make is placed on the tabs. Remember before you break the law, the FBI will always be there. At least that gripping but slightly mellow crime play, the FBI has the feeling you get after watching the story. It recognizes the company's roots by telling the story from a small bureau to the world's most modern facilities (in 1959), one of its agents, in the story by Chip Hardesty (James Stewart). <br /> From the chip day to the FBI, and occasionally all his family happily placed his work above all in the world. The FBI Story tracks his life by describing how his life has been an agent and how it affects his personal life. The film will do an amazing job of showing what kind of cases the FBI is and how to manage them. The audience helped the Ku Klux Klan to see the riot of the Chip stop, go secretly to solve an Indian murder / estate scandal, take captive, captive the guards and fight in the Second World War. He also helped bring communist intelligence to justice. <br /> <br /> Stella (as usual) is a very narrative agent who likes his job freely, complicated and complex. One of the best episodes about this film, we are looking at the chip family life and work inside his jobs. The death of his best friend and then his son. We have a miscarriage of his wife, and his wedding is during rocky times. Almost his personal problems come to his job. Vera Miles will give a spotty performance, but it is very convincing, none less. She has never been a brilliant actress, but she is something very attractive and impressive about. Maybe it's me alone? Sadly, there were no other shows, but the attention-gripping story made me very keen. <br /> <br /> The film's cinematography is especially impressive in the South American wilderness. All of the colors really got a structure that set the atmosphere of the image. Perhaps the greatest part of the film is Mervyn Leroy's excellent direction. Every scene is fluid so that they are injured together to tell a fantastic story. This is the full capacity of intelligent camera shots, some have a Hitchcockian feel. <br /> <br /> In all, the FBI Story is a fantastic but neglected movie. Cliking in two and a half hours may cause some viewers to be intimidated, but if you get the chance I would recommend it to jump. I enjoyed Jimmy Stewart's spectacular performance and glamorous story.
