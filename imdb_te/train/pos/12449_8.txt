Finally, a good Modesty Blaze released the film, not a story, but actually a "true" story. I admit that it is a bad movie if you expect an action thriller, but if you stop in your track and delete all your expectations. Then you can see that you are a story close to the reality of Peter O'Donnell. Modesty has just one cover story to tell her how wonderful she is. It's not a movie to attract new fans, but a movie to tell the true story. Some things are good, but it's a fantastic picture when you can not forget the ' So if you're a fan then sit down to relax and enjoy that with just a cover story to make modesty just tell his story of the true story.
