I saw this film twice a week, in a movie in Ortington, Kent, UK. This place was filled twice and people stopped. <br /> <br /> With Henry Winkler's football field 'wounded', the whole audience was filled with laughter and continued to the credits. <br /> <br /> For those who love American wrestling, this film must be ready to see Henry Winkler. <br /> If you get an opportunity this movie will be the best of family family comedy entertainment!
