If you're a big Sunday afternoon movie, if you go with your own business, you'll be a chair with a big hand and a few hours. The amazing performances from Cher and Nicholas Cage (as always) are a series of plot along gently. There are no surfaces to cross the best, most exciting, lightweight paddle through New York life. It is a family image of each part and deserves the appreciation of it.
