This film is one of the ages. First of all, I have seen this time and it has become one of my all-time favorite movies. Why? Normal; Ben Kocosa (author, director) made art as a true art. 99.9% of the movies are full of fun these days, Director Ben CoCo gives us the truth, gives us the reality, giving us a learning tool to find out why it happened. Mainstream media spins and spins but Ben Kosio sees school shootings in the interview, where no other form can go on minds and hearts that two young men have planned to kill their companions. It's definitely graphic and horror, how is it not? Gloves come, lie over our media masters' lies and sugar coating, and we are taking the place to find out the truth about what happened. Sometimes it's not just like everybody, no matter, sometimes hatred and loneliness are still deep, and more people are, and this boy will know us and we are. The community left behind them and the consequences are horrifying and real. <br /> <br /> Respect and love your fellow man. A lesson we all want to learn, thank you so much to make this film Mr. Coccio, I hope you have great imagination to continue your film manufacturing career.
