Carol's Journey is a pleasure to see for many reasons. Clara Lago's performance is just awesome for a young man, and one of those special stars for her facial expressions. Director Immanuel Eurbeb has not given any break in a tight and controlled movie, so the plot is set at a steady pace with just enough suspense to keep the nude scene intriguing. Angel Garcia Roldon's screenplay tells the story of its best, which, if not all, with the main purpose afterwards. The plot is unpredictable, yet the events that they dislocated are completely logical. The best feature of the film is that if the story of the Spanish Civil War affects people. It is a major event of the 20th century, and no Americans know about it. In fact, in the 40 years of university teaching, I heard a student about a semester, who were far less likely to speak about it - and a large number of students merit scholars and immense censorship in American education. So, in a way, remember that this film is unraveled to a great deal in history when a thread is a good way to start an event study. Hence, the film's appreciation is in direct contact with a person's knowledge. There is a completely miss movie coming in to see another movie. Volume Elbow Index has seven elements of the film - acting, product sets, character development, plot, dialogue, film continuity and artwork - 10 for the very good, 5 for the average, and one level for assistance for needs 1. Carroll Journey exceeds average of all calculations, except the average rated rate. When compared to the IMDb level, the LEI average was 9.3, which increased to 10. I recommend this film for all ages.
