I'd say this is one of the best animated films I have ever seen. I liked the first time but really appreciated it in a second view, a few weeks ago. I'll see why a sequel at the box office is doing such a great business. <br /> <br /> A beautiful color (man, good looks) and good adult (non-pure) comedy make this big winner. A 3-4 minute scene begins with "Skate", which includes intraduates along with him. "Sid" sloth (voiced by John Leguizano), however, is the main joke of the film. <br /> <br /> Ray Romano is the voice of Mammoth, the big character in the movie, literally, Denis Liar's terrible bad-guy-turned-good Sabertot tiger <br /> It's not just humor and pretty color, but A good, sentimental story for how a little baby makes the tough roles soft. <br /> <br /> If most animated films are good, I own more. The songs do not disturb too much.
