I stopped short of giving "Mr. Blandings his Dream House" due to an aspect that makes us in the 21st century cringing: a black person loyal servant (somewhat reminiscent of Stepin Fetchitz). But other than that, cinema owl. <br /> <br /> The New York Couple Jim (Carrie Grant) and the Muriel Blondings (Myrna Loy) is a middle class couple trying to build a home in Connecticut. It's just as good as a wife. But Melvin Douglas adds real smiles like Jim and Muriel's lawyer Bill Cole, who seems to have more plans than he is obviously doing. All around the house ... you're probably overwhelmed by the image, whether you want to live there or not. Builders, contractors and others also provide a fair share of laughing. <br /> <br /> For all, comedy classic. Louis Beovers, Reginald Denny, Sharren Moufet, Connie Marshall and Jason Roberts Sr.
