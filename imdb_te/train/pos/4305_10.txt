Grand Canyon is a very strange bird. This is a totally unique urban area, in which the whole storyline will fail to deliver too much. <br /> <br /> The main thing is that every race, background and station people have life inherent in uncertainty. But the film's theme is horrific to announce its scope. Similarly, it can not be piggonhole in a particular style. </ P> <br /> The film consists of volumes, although each audience has different volumes, <br /> <br /> Moreover, it has a laser sensitive business; Each speech, dialog line and the background score of the music music caters to its pervasive mood and powerful message, I am very surprised and will take great care after each view. Still it does not feel at all stuffy. A shiny movie with great cast and everything worked out.
