Seven amicus horror collections are the third of the blood dug in the series. If the monster is part of the club's series, it makes eight films. <br /> <br /> When I was in my teens, <br /> <br /> My feelings for the film are so strong. All the stories of the stories were very attractive, and I finally found my copy. As I did, I finally saw and disappointed. This is not good when I believe it. It's better than its two ancestors, it's not good for all its four descendants. <br /> <br /> Connecting story John Bennett appears to be missing the police inspector. House. His journey begins at a local police station where he finds stories from previous owners. This weed story then visits the estate agent who sells the house. While this link story looks mesmerizing on paper, it is practical and weak of flat and lethal and amicus. I could not help, John Bennett felt that Donald Plejans or Ian Hendry's form of a poor man. I saw one of the two above mentioned actors in his role. We both had two - one policeman inspector and another was an estate agent. <br /> <br /> The film has four residential sites, each of which focuses on a home resident. <br /> The first story crime scene is written by Denholm Eliot. He realized he was into an exciting story about a stranger, even going up to drawing a sketch to aid his writing. Soon, he begins to look at the visions of his own creation. Peter Duffell's some superb direction, especially with the selection of camera angles, helps remove the controlled script. Elliott's performance is a striking writer and he also helps to increase the story. The story ends with semi-twist but I can not get the idea of ​​a script that does not allow it to receive its ability. <br /> Peter Cushing House In The Second Story. He was a lonely person who lived alone, kidnapped him for a beautiful young woman and he kept a picture. Cushing's performance really brings this mentally moving story to life. He chooses continuous attention on the loneliness of Kushin and helps the director. It takes a great hallucination scenario that helps to see Cushins inside the mind. However, Kushin sees a man in a nearby wax museum that looks like his girl. Naturally his anxiety increases but this seems to have a disturbing twist at the end of this seemingly romantic story. Jaws plays Ackland's opponent's cushion but his performance is overshadowed by the huge guru Peter Cushing. <br /> <br /> The third story and easily sees the best Christopher Lee - my favorite horror actor all the time - his daughter. Mr. Lee gives here his full ice cool shows. He does not show love or attention for his daughter. He went to a school to give him education. She tries to find out what's wrong with governess, played by another Nyree Dan Porter. Without giving away too much, I can reveal a witchcraft plays a role. Christopher Lee's presence is really electrically in every scene. Chloe Frank received special recognition for herself as a young girl who played a beautiful role in the overall film. <br /> <br /> The last story is almost complete to laugh, but it is definitely fun and related to those matters. Jon Pertvy plays a moving horror movie actor at home. He was very dissatisfied by producers taking movies and watching cheap and fake, especially clothes. So he decides to buy a classic dress for his latest bloodthirsty character. Jeffrey Boulden is an old-fashioned lyricist with Pertvi as a dealer selling an ancient clock. When wearing bedding, he develops fangs and becomes a vampire primarily. It can be seen to trust the performance of Pertvi. It's really hilarious. Ingrid Pitt is also in the story, but her talent is too big for her. <br /> <br /> This story ends with a loose connection to the last story. It is specially suited for inspector Pertwei and after making a decision to visit the house naturally. The rest you can work for yourself. <br /> <br /> "Peter Duffell, director, he really makes him the best one. <br /> <br /> Overall, <br /> <br /> Overall, despite its flaws, the blood is eaten, it must be seen by Amicus Anthologies, fans of other Amicus films or Portrait of horror films Ulu. Your essence is enough to appeal to your eyes-the picture, be sure to check it out. You'll enjoy it!
