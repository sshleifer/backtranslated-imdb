The director and Lara's two stars (1944) have been redefined to these great police: Dana Andrews is a criminal's son who, while he has copied all the relationships in the past, can not check his legacy of violent ways when questioning the suspects, one night he goes too far; Jean Tearney is a splendid wife of his victim, a prominent racketeer in town and a decorated war hero who worked with Andrews' number 1 Nomesis, Gary Merrill (who was also a Protective Andrews SC). Like Primer, it is a well-known film with a well-known credits sequence and Carl Malden (an Andrews boss), Tom Tulley (Tearney's motor-mouth taxi driver father) and Bret Freed (Andrews sympathetic partner) and Robert F. Nolan (Andrews' Craig Stevens, as well as Outinging High) ID, Brett Freed (Merrill's main exploitation). For the next few hours following Murdered Merrill's inaccurate ways (in this case), the second one has already warned Andrews extremes and Stevens to deceive others; However, Tully is supposed to be the main suspect (at which time Andr√©s and Terney is involved in love) and sinks himself in Merrill's cave, 'frame' the racketeer for his own murder! Apparently, the protagonist is a complex character and Andrews encounters this challenge, which is perfect in the first note style with the inner house Fox Noir style.
