First of all, in the defense of the Zone Phanton, Alice, Ginger Rogers as the young British lady who was the title character, was a terrible lie. Fontaine gets a heroine here, but her acting experience is stronger and her dance is not good. Fortunately, she went to work better. <br /> <br /> Here Freedom Audrey, GEORGE BURNS and GRACIE ALLEN get the top billing - they are amazing. Fans of Burns & Allen are surprised that they are enough for the dance programs of the aesthetic. Particularly interesting ballerina Herm√®s is a big fun task to win the Oscar. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story is not slowly getting out of the story - or the extreme conditions that call for a long time tolerance from the viewer. These humor are flat and some of the common romantic misconceptions of any Fred Osrey film will be given to traditional treatment during this period. <br /> <br /> Some pleasant Gershwin voices pop up for a while, but they can not qualify for all of them. A good supporting cast is a polished comedy show featuring Reginald Gardiner, such as Consents Collier and Montague Love (mistaken as a gardener by Jon's father Astier). While reminding us how well Barnes & Allen are on their radio and television days. <br /> <br /> Director George Stevens can not hide the camera-working intelligent man while filming the dancing figure on the Hill Fontaine's Hill with Fred. She survived from her element as a dance partner of Astier, and she seems to be painful.
