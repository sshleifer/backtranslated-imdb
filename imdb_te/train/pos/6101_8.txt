I will not destroy you, I'll be very short. There are some great acting and funny lines from the attractive cast. Harvard Med School (Brian White), a young graduate, does not know until he thinks of people. He worked as a TV producer for a girlfriend (May) job, as she traveled to a small hospital in Florida. His senior resident (Wood Harris) and his 'creative collaborator' (Joe Saldana) have helped greatly enhance him. They help him to preserve his career and show him a wide range of opportunities instead of a compassionate physician instead of a player who wants to earn money (many of my pre-mad friends feel real).
