What happens when the average Joe has supernatural powers? The premise is well understood. Watchmen? Unbreakable? However, the Russian sci-fi action movie, The Sword Bearer, is far from standard stock. <br /> <br /> This story revolves around a man named Sasha, who has a supernatural power that he has. When he asks for his or her anger, a sword puts his hand on his own skin. A lot of Wolverine? Perhaps ... but this is not an interesting part of the film. He hovers his life and drives him in anger (and he has a temperance). Our "hero" returns to his hometown to find his way back or find a cause. The only thing he encountered here was when he was killed on the ground when he met with a new flame of an old flame. Vengeance and anger come into play. This is a man you do not want to cross and this time there are mafia and police on his tail. <br /> <br /> In the movie earlier she met a girl and fell in love. <br /> <br /> Bold colors and noir over tones with small, intense action sequences are very good. It is important, which is beautifully portrayed in detail in each scene on the horror sci-fi action. This is odd mash which is very interesting to me in this film. The director's approach to this style refreshes and focuses on Sasha's emotional travel. But do not worry, there is action and it's plenty. However, these scenes represent only violence with horrific images. It does not say that action has not been shown. These scenes are here and are fantastic (especially the ending of Sasha's full powers desperation). The director chooses the violence of several scenes to focus on the emotional struggle of the character in the hands of the director. This is a tragic love story and a refreshing entry in the genre.
