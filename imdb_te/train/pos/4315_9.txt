I have seen this film again and are just dismayed at the number of soldiers dismissing it as the New Age pap. It's a great movie that takes time to develop, but it will never come to the edge, but will never do, and ultimately leads to life rather than people who can see its "coincidence" than meditation, influence, and much more. Movies such as "Prince of Tides" and "Bugsy" (I liked the next performance) won the best year ("Silence of the Lambs"!) Nomination for the best screenplay, when reconsidering, history supports my early reaction!
