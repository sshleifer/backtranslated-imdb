Disney animations should be just ~ must. Right? Where? Show me I found this attempt to be more enjoyable to ~ No ~ that contains a five-year standard Disney music cash hacker. <br /> <br /> Although it is not the heroine in this story, it is very good, enjoyable and adventurous. I hope a bit more, yeah, considering the subject, but this movie is not called bitter disappointment or absolutely no failure. <br /> <br /> Animation quality is average, but the dialogue is very compelling, narrative, plot, sub-plot and amazing creativity I've found in this product. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ <br /> This is the best Disney in my opinion <br /> <br /> It's rated Rape from a 9.4 / 10.
