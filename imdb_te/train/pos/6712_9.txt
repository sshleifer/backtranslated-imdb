I love Sabrina! This is one of my favorite! My favorite parts; She is a geek, the first episode, a true love episode and much of the rest of the series from the very first series. I do not think that college episodes are as good as high schools, but they were a lot worse than the last series. Valerie is a good character when she is rounded off Jenny, but Jenny has some fantastic parts. Hilda and Zelda were wonderful, and there was no explanation that they went there! Libby is a very good character. I never liked Morgan or Roxy, they are not as good as her other friends.
