The DOCTEUR Petit, starring Mitchell Serrail, is a ruthless story about a ruthless guy. A physician who suffers from ill health in occupied France, even if they have not compensated their compensation. However, he prays on the weak in the population. Imaginary and cinematography are fantastic, and extraordinary hallucination to this complex story. He is a perfect mental illness. Abusive and selfless, intelligent and caring, calculating and murders. Audience is an unforgettable movie soon. Kudos to Mr. Sarrott, for his Chilling role.
