Remember Ralph Bakshi? Who is the animator in Territons, then at Paramount Cartoon Studios, in which director Fritz the Cat 1 & 2 and Heavy Traffic? Well, it's Koncekin. And it's great. Racist, but good. The film takes place at Harlem Nights (No Do, It's a title title.), But it turns out to be a lapoon of the Disney movie, Song of the South. <br /> This is Samson White) and Preacherman (Charles Gordon) are going to help their friend Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) escape from jail, but the road is stopped by the invasion and firing with the police. When looking forward to them, Randy asked him to escape the escaped sinner (the Scotsman guards) because he started telling Randy "Three guys, I know you and your friends" story. <br /> The Brother Rabbit (voice of Thomas), Brother Bear (White of Voice) and Preacher Fox (Gordon's Voice) pack and leave their southern settings after their bank bank mortgage and turn it into a brothel sells. Harlem, Rabbit, Bears, and Fox did not get it all. They are a fraudulent revolutionary leader known as the "cousin" of the black Jesus, and he powers his powers to "kill the white people". Prior to asking his parishioners for "donations" in an elegant stage show in his "Church", John Wayne expresses dissatisfaction with black repression signs by images of Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon. <br /> <br /> Rabbit initially fights against Madigan, a racist and racist white police officer and bag man for mafia, demonstrating his contempt for African Americans in various ways, including denial of bathing before the encounter with them). When Madigan realizes that Rabbit is making his payments, he and his colleagues can lead to a nightclub called Ruby and Bobby's "The Cotton Tail". <br /> <br /> A black stripper dropped his drink into an LSD sugar cube for him. When Madigan was in the influence of her spike drink, then a stereotypical fetpendant was wristched into a sexual encounter with homosexuals, and later dressed as a representative of a female racist custom, dressed in racist, and finally recovering from her sedentary ambition His gun was randomly fired around Killing and killing by police. <br /> <br /> Rabbit, bear, fox and opponent boxer are coming out of the rare boxing arena. <br /> <br /> Live Action Story Randy and Papa end up running while a different white cap is fired, but managing to be alive. <br /> <br /> The film was disputed during the release of the film, with whom the director changed several times under the title "Street Tight", a 2005 documentary on racism in the streets of the street fighting. In fact, this movie is like the documentary. <br /> <br /> The Bryanston Pictures, the film distributor and the original Toby Hopper Classic, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, have led to the exit of the business. Paramount wanted to produce and distribute this image, but because of racial discrimination, Bryanston took up production of Bakxi. <br /> <br /> Controversial though it is controversial. The animation is awesome at that time, the plot makes sense, and it's very fun. <br /> <br /> The end result is: 9/10
