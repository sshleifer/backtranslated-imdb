By the end of the first hour, my jaw is conveniently between my feet. The film never, and I always mean, in action. It may be a minor act but it's a function. Once again cast each member perfectly. The explosions are realistic, chase scenes are possible, and the fight is amazing. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon is forever Jason Bourne. <br /> If I really mean, every Bourne film is better and it is no exception. Action, bet, plot. I never know how they will do it. I praise the person who wrote the screen for each of these movies. If he does not do such a great thing with the first film, we will not have to talk about it. <br /> Let it be seen in theaters, experience in the theaters If it lives, then December 11th No Bourne comes home to you!
