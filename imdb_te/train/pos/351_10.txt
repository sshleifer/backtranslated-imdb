It is a colorful slasher image. That's about it. <br /> <br /> There is a very popular mystery element in Scram films. <br /> <br /> Death scenes brought back memories of 80 horror films such as Friday 13th. <br /> <br /> Another good thing about this film is that it's hard to identify a surviving girl, which is obviously not in Scram and IKWYDLS. <br /> <br /> People who love slazer movies do not like this movie. That's easy. I really enjoyed it and will see it again when I wait too long. <br /> - MB
