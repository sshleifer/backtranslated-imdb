Certainly, he was rapidly disqualified after the film, but from the "Knife in the Water" until "The Tenth", Roman Polans was anytime calculated to offer something attractive and unique. Despite many running themes (alienation and psychological disorder), he is really similar to both of his movies. This story is somewhat similar to its own "repulsion" ten years ago, but the tone is completely different. The "tenant" performs a darker balance rather than dark absurdity (a bit skeptical as it is called humor, the mainstream journalists have played a major role in always annoying Polans), and the movements in the film are almost unpleasant creepy. <br /> <br /> In addition to Paulenski's sensitive director, the cast and crew provide great writing. The director of the Polanski actor Polanski often overwhelms, but his performance here really binds the idea that his characters are awkward and outward. The themes of social discrimination are not only bizarre but also more serious. The rest of the cast also provides strong performances, particularly the backbone turn of Isabelle Adjani, and the most annoying ones of Melvin Douglas and Shelley Winters. "Tenant" is often underestimated by how many people are willing to appreciate both the "Resolition" and "Rosemary Babies", but it's something that's wonderful in the classics. (9/10)
