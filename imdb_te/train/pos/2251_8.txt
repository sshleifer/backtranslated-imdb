I found the Alan Jacobs review in a very accurate picture, although BYU's curator, I have the opportunity to rent the DVD from the blockbuster with commentary from the motion picture archives James D'Arque. The then LDS protagonist Heber J. Grant approved the film to distinguish between dramatic expression and historical contents for telescoping events. For example, the film showed Joseph Smith in the trial. Despite Brigit Young's great speech in the defense of Joseph Smith, he was convicted of any crime. Then Joseph was killed. Historically, Joseph Smith has never been punished. Brigham Young was in Boston when Joseph Smith was arrested for this particular trial. Joseph Smith and his brother were killed before Hiram's trial.
