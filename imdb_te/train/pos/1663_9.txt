I enjoyed every moment of this beautiful picture and was curious about this female painter I had never heard of before. I explored her life and then worked. As expected, I found that the film is not exactly historically accurate. Because of this misfortune, I made quite negative comments on the film. Come, guys, not a movie and not a biography (or a novel!). Any historical film describes reality because it must work in art in its own art. A film director is entirely entitled to use elements from reality and history to create his own world. Artemisia is a fantastic film and I feel that I have brought many people (including negative comments) to explore the life and work of this lovely artist.
