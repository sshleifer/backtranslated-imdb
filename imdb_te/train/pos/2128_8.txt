I saw the first time I watched toner today at Turner Classic Movies and I enjoyed it. Especially like older movies, especially the lack of all the dirty language, and the most violent, nudity and sexy in today's movies. I think they are better in most (but not all) cases. Jimmy Stewart is my favorite. I thought it was a lot to watch this movie and I was totally enjoying it. If you think of the old images the same way, I do not think I can make a mistake on this. I believe that the film's "You Have Got Mail" is a remake (though slightly different and very enjoyable). If you're ashamed if your kids or someone walks in your view for an evening evening, get it or hold it in one of the classic movie channels.
