I wanted to see one in the end. I saw Fritz Long's film a few years ago. <br /> <br /> I hope the ideal screening conditions work for their magic. <br /> <br /> The conditions in Sinameric Ontario are ideally. Priest full length printing. The original Gothic-syntactic translation of simultaneous English translation of Intervivitels in Germany, is not quite a genre. Live piano cooperative <br /> <br /> The magic of the film was a bit cooler but finally failed to catch me. <br /> <br /> This film is not a real connection to Wagner's ring cycle but it's not certain. Wagner 13th c. Niebelungenlied his own interests. <br /> <br /> Fritz Lang's epic - Part I - Wagner's listeners of "Siegfried" is well known. <br /> <br /> "KREMHILLS REVENGE" Siegfried's wife Kreynhild is the story of King Etzal (Atila) Han, and Hugen and Gunther, a revenge named Niblungs re-named for the Sigfried murder. The striking clashes in the film include Wagnerian epics, such as his Gotterdermerebung, his Twilight of the Gods, and the end of Valhalla. <br /> <br /> The film is very spectacular. The massive sets were against "Kabiria" (1914), which inspired Griffith's "Intolerance" (1916). Their makeup is rumored to have a new benchmark in bright. There is a huge cast of Scudder, Manji Hans and Art Deco Burgundian. And battles. <br /> The truth is, <br /> <br /> Crihandl has been very successful in his revenge. She will manage to destroy everything around her. Her loyalty to her favorite Siegfried is not from hard love, or devotion, but is close to mood. Lady Macbeth cried, "Do not stay me here." She knows what she needs to be mentally prepared. But Kriemhild displays ordinary human emotions, and absolutely no one is equal to the female principle. From the beginning she was to take Shakespeare's post, already "full of negligent cruelty". Margarez Schon and her director have been informed with a glover. I do not want to exaggerate, but that glomer is just an expression of "animate" the face of Carmainhill. It's ultimate in a note displays. This is not just poor performance. <br /> <br /> Then on the offer we have a dimensional sketch of fury. Some may see CaremeHild as an empowering heroine. I will see this film as abusive.
