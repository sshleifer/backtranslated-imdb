Steven Spielberg's adaptation of the famous novel by Alice Walker is not controversial. When the first release of blacks criticized the treatment of blacks, others questioned why others were directing the film about blacks. <br /> <br /> In this film, Sealy grew up in rural America after the centenary. Her father's abusive father who stole her from her arms at birth is two children. <br /> <br /> Sealy (played by newcomer Vupely Goldberg in subsequent years) is married to an abusive husband (Danny Glover). <br /> <br /> She sees that she can meet again with her sister and her children, because this story often leaves the heart. Throughout her life she is confused with a large and sweet saloon singer, Shug, including Sophia, her stepmother's wife is hard with nails and a subject or two for her about love. <br /> <br /> Spillberg's direction is in the film, which offers excellent cinematography and some stellar performances. I dare you to see this movie and have not moved! The Color Purple manages to capture the essence of a complicated hero. It seeks to reduce homosexuality and African tale, both of which are clear in the book, the film is real to its background, the voice of Alice Walker shines. <Br /> I did not begin to respond to the controversy surrounding this film. In any case, this is one of the few films I see again, which left me an indelible mark.
