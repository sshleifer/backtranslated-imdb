I do not know how a Texas resident (director, Douglas McGrath) and American actress Gwyneth Paltrow has always been out of this but seeing this again Ms. Remember that all the fuss about Paltrow is the first remember! I have lost a woman for a long time and she is dull in the Oscar-winning "Shakespeare in Love" show, but she's got all the beats here - she's perfect as Emma Woodhouse. <br /> <br /> However, she is very appealing to Jeremy North's romantic audience as well as a great assistant cast including Tony Colette, Gerta Scaque, Juliet Stevenson and others, although in his work PtoTo is a bit sharp in the statement of love (in the process, To allow stress from); For many years, Ivan's hair is a little easier to take than it was in '96 and, individually, I find the presence of a melting point of anything puckish Alan Cumming days. But without engagement, Sophie Thompson (sister of Emma Thomson, daughter of Felida La) Miss Bates; This version is needed for the scene that Emma met with Miss Bates, which she plays the role we played in the fate. <br /> <br /> All of these are sensitive and attractive enough to sort the British class system. Well it's a rental value (because Paltrow will not always have this again - but we have Emma).
