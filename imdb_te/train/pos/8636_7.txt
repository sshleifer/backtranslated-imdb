The thriller, starring Brad Pitt and Juliet Lewis, joined the road trip to the west side of David Duchovny and Mitchell Forbes. The next couple are investigating infamous killings for the upcoming book; A serial killer (without Dave's knowledge) and Juliet is his poor, not all-in-the-door on the pitt's Lam. It moves along with good cast and story, but scares Pitt as a seat killer, although it is one of his best predecessors. <br /> <br /> The best thing here is to always shine on his characters in `Homicide: Life on the Street 'or short series' Wonderland' by Michael Forbes. <br /> <br /> Vote: 6
