"Emma" is a product called the first Great Jane Aston Cycle in the nineteen Nineties and shown on British television, as the second great Jane Austen cycle began with "Pride and Prejudice" two years ago. We currently have three TV movies based on Austin Biopic "Becoming Jane", and ITV recently based on Aston Novels. Of these, "Norgenger Abbey" is one of only six previously unreleased novels, so the cycle needs to be completed. However, there will be more time in the near future. ("Six", short novel "Lady Susan" and nowhere else she does not give her incomplete fragments "The Watsons" and "Sandton". <br /> <br /> The main character, Emma Woodhouse, from the aristocratic family in Regency England (As some critics assumed, Aston died before Queen Victoria's Victorian England-born). Emma, ​​financially, Elizabeth Bennett Rather than a lot of Ottoman heroes like Fanny Pryce, and she did not need to find a wealthy husband, instead she found her main ancestor discovered her husband. She refused to reject the proposal Ehitudu hriyetnu she persuades. This scheme is crucial to false leads, however, eltanku hyarit not interested, but Emma fell in love. Emma, ​​his proposal was rejected by the speed of her friend, matched her inappropriate marriage partner (for good reason), with her friend, why is that the wonder of it. This is a Jane Austen plot, where Emma becomes a spontaneously low spinster, and she also falls in love with more complexity. <br /> <br /> Emma always marries without her affection, and when she finds her partner, the beautiful Mr. Knightley, I feel like it's really affectionate. However, it's very passionate (unlike Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy). Knightley (she is 21, 37 years old) and is married to her sixteen-year-old Emma than herself is a father-man than her lover. Father's father, in fact, seems more like her grandfather than her real father, a grotesque and selfish old hypochondriac. When Emma was rude to her unsustainable and confused friend Miss Bates, Knightley pretended to be her uncontrollable. (His surname was probably meant to refer to his Gentleman nature-nineteenth century adults considered to be the modern equivalent of the medieval knights of their elaborate symbolic tendencies). <br /> <br /> About other characters I loved Juliet Stephenson's obscene Mrs Elton and Tony Colete Harris. I know that the novel is an innocent teenager in Harriet, but here she plays the role played by "Muriel Wedding" - a cave, a little overweight twentysomething, fretting about her finding a person. <br /> <br /> I thought this role worked well in the backdrop of the film and I thought it was not removed from Austin's themes. <br /> <br /> "Emma" is one of Aston's more lightweight writings, Mansfield Park "or" Pride and Prejudice ", and reflects on the screen.We have seen the world of beauty and kindness, filled with majestic homes and elegant clothes and good manners Apart from the ruffianly gypsies, who have a very brief appearance, only the "poor" people we see are Mrs Bates and her Martha, and, they live in some sort of lovely pink-streaked cottage cottage to change hands for today, £ 500,000, maybe we are sure that their poverty is relative.In the Emma world, poverty is defined as not having your own imposing home.It is a 19th century Not the perfect image of the early life, but the same as the regency of a kitchen-rink realistic <br /> <br /> I can not rate this movie in 1994 as "Sense and Sensibility" or recently "Pride" and "Prejudice" - it will drag a bit in the middle, It has a strong end, but it is the main, most enjoyable Aston adaptation. 7/10
