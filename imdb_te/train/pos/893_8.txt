Samo Hung's 1989 film The Pathablob Driver is considered by many to be his work. In some of the great episodes of I'm in Hong Kong, I have to some extent accept that the film gets really amazing and exciting. It's a pretty good and well-written play, interesting and sympathetic (and non-sympathetic characters), some genuinely funny humor and high-kung fu to guarantee that many jaws can be guaranteed when they're not actually aware of it. <br /> <br /> Hong Kong movie Watching the film and doing the same enthusiastic enthusiasts of the industry. <br /> <br /> Sammy and Max Mock Sue Chung The last century in Hong Kong, I think. They drive their cabs and love them for love. Sammy is interested in the local baker girl Ping (Nina Li Chi), and Max one day he meets with mysterious and cute Fanny Uen Kit-ying, who falls madly in love. Many other characters also introduce, and if the viewer is really focused on the film and its story, they are pretty clear, so the film is very confusing, especially in Hong Kong. Kung Fu Fight scenes created for some of the most wonderful choreography principles are created, as soon as a cruel gangster family is scared of neighbors and their violent actions will affect our leaders too soon. <br /> <br /> This film is a great cast. Leeds are all pretty good (for example, such as Pinefly's awful-acting and "humor", as in the great East Konders (1987) of Sawmoo) and they are also very well-liked and easy to remember, thanks to carefully written screenplay. The cast is a legendary action director and director of the film, including Kori Yuyen Quai (Soul 1 and 2, Dragon's Den and Fang Sai Yuk 1 and 2), HK cinema faces and directors in the smallest roles include mastermind Lovell Lone Coen -Taking (John Woo's The Killer and Ringo Lones School on Fire and Prison on Fire in many others, Al-Shird Ki-Ting (director of Run on the Dark HK Noir Classic since 1988), the last great LAM Ching Ying (many HK Vampire Horror / Kung Fu / famous for his friendly face in comedies) to name just a few. In fact, casting in the Pythablob driver was the most interesting I've seen in any other HK production. <br /> <br /> This film has a lot of interesting peaceful movements about the love affair between Max Mock and the Fennies. Thank you for the role in UNN and a crisis Lowell. They're really full of a completely serious piece if they really wanted to be very serious and genuinely effective in the middle, no matter what you've done for your past or whatever you've done for living, the film is more important than our average Kung Foo Entertainment action gets. Attempts to cure other things also have a lot of stress and are very happy about the proper human relationships and friendship, and love. <br /> <br /> I'm Fannie Max (about "bad cooking") in the future is very unnecessary and unfortunately pretty efficiently the probability of the whole section and its themes. <br /> <br /> But we are very interested in filmmakers. It's action, outrageous and over-the-top action. Junk Chan's drunken master II (1994) in traditional kung fu, some sticks, meat claws, and so on and in what film I have ever seen in the film is very foolishly used in the kung fu scene. , They are really great! There are wires and they are very intelligently used and they literally go to the opposite corner of the room when they are kicking or punched. Only amazing and again something can only be delivered to Hong Kong cinema. Dangerous stunts, with the viewer having his / her breath, a fast car vs. ten-lobby chase sequence and various dangerous jumps and twisting objects flying in the air and suppressing the strength of the tight destination. Film producers do not accept film violence like Sammo, and finally Bruce Lee, the final victim at Gangster Villa, would like to give himself after turbulence and I'm kind of excited <br /> <br /> The film is very low. <br /> <br /> I can understand that the most witty bits in the film are not Hollywood or everyone in America (for example). Hilarious Star Wars Gag initially this is perfect and I literally forced me to laugh when I realized what I was seeing. Some funny scenes have been created from Samo's passion for Ping. Still, the great and the longest men flying with great power on the screen for great surprise laughing loud walls or furniture is just INSANE and so breathtaking I can not hide my feelings and thoughts <br /> <br /> When I look at these testimonies of these film makers, It is positive and does not reflect reaction. <br /> <br /> Pedalablob driver is one of the most exciting Hong Kong action films I've ever seen. And easy between Samo's great achievements. If there are some minor flaws, it is also brighter and higher. 8/10
