After being completely addicted to Six Feet Under, I did not think there was another show to be good at this show. Well, I'm wrong! Last spell binding !! I absolutely love this show and can not turn it off. The greatness of the characters, the implications of the plot, the beautiful arrangement are beautiful. I totally and thoroughly tied up. I do not know how the creators do it, but each character is deeply deeper. I have their pleasure, their pain, everything, right down to my core !!! I rented the series at Netflix so I did not have a cable. When I put it on, I was worried when I saw all the episodes at once and when it ended. I can not wait for the next upcoming disk in my house. This is probably the best TV show I have ever seen !!!
