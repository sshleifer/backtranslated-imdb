So Mary and Roda are elderly - who is not? When I was aired by Mary, I was a teen, and when the "adult young man" left the wind. Yes, it is good to watch Mary and Row together, and yes, the film did not retain the comic of the original series, but there are enough moments to recall the spirit of the sequence to earn enough praise for this period. Example: directs the idea of ​​a new series about the "old people" and then the producer who appointed Mary. This is not typical of the current Hollywood TV and film "Bean Counters" this is not typical, but this may not be the best performance of the Mary Taler - but it is beautiful when we have been the best performances we've grown with the 70s.
