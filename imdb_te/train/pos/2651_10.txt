That's right. The book is better than the book. Do not get me wrong, I love the book. But this film is very good. Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall are the best of the film. (I have not seen Scotman crotales and clearly Danny Lloyd.) Some of the ideas used in the film are better than those used in the book. But I already talked about that in my comment in the short series. But I got a little bit longer. The film was shot in a better position than a small sequence. And the REDRUM scenes are more creepy than in the book. If you're looking for a great movie, get Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. But let's have night jams for three weeks at night
