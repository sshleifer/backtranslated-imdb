Belushi was at his gratitude and at Courtney Cox before friends played a minor role. I often use Belushi Hollywood as less and I think the role of this film is one of his best. For those of you who watch his TV show, this is a very different and preferred character. The film is not shattering or the message is new, but sweet and lovely. The cast to support the famous faces and unknown names is a perfect balance, but the loudspeaker's tone is shining, and the mesmerizing spiritual guide of Michael Cain is a little bad rather than a well-known edge. Hamilton, the wife of Balushi is unfortunately two dimensional and a miracle that she is married to. In addition, Renee Rousse is not ruined and terribly at the "Prom Queen" who got away. However, a good way to spend two hours.
