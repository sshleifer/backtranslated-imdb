It's never like it, it's perfect. This episodic, seemingly recurring trilogy only really feels really problematic, and is not about Groovin Gare, Utah cross-dressing sensation. This is a very self-conscious film about how the filmmaker will react to Groovin. The entire project for Harris is clearly an extended and stunning contortion of guilt and remorse. He is trying to commit suicide - yes, Gary tried to commit suicide after a weekly broadcast - through the correction, commentary and meeting, such a Hollywood-heroin standby as best friend and recurring happiness (two different people, a Glover version) and his personal personal uses Arcadam. But as a theme it remains a film about gender and disagreements, which is also a film about the structure - but with almost unprecedented level of complexity. A lot going on; In telling and telling this story, Harris is in the right place at the right time three times in a row, and does not lose the opportunity to do something on it. The most moving, and deep as the camp always gets.
