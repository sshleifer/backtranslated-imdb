I've seen this great good-natured Parede of Living Dead Night, and I have to say it's so terrible and so corny is amazing. The film portrays all the antics and scenery shots including the cemetery, the inevitable house, the dungeon and the front grass. I especially love the movie about Bread's humorous use and all the common household enemies have revenge against the bread. C'mon, we know that toasts, toaster ovens and zip-locks made bread a dozen times and now we need to call for their help to defeat the reanimated loaf. From low acting and voice-over, this little horror film is my personal favorite of the Night of the Living Dead, which was better than Night of the Living Dead in 1990. <br /> <br /> Directors and directors from the movie have used the conversation from the original images and revolving around the loaf, restoring the loaf and preventing the leftovers are seen as how they are particularly dangerous. Another great reason I like this movie is that the bread is bad, badges bad, and the Communians are bad, it shows a lively scene with a newspaper and a rather arbitrary priest. I think the actors will be particularly joking for the attack by bread crumbs (ie, the car scene).
