<br /> <br /> First thing is to say that I own Jake Speed. I have seen at least 10 times. This film is one of the most pleasant movies ever made. The film begins with Margaret (Karen Kopins) to find her sister. Her sister is kidnapped in Paris and the family has heard nothing. Jake Speed ​​(Wayne Crawford) comes along as she tells her sister and her make a proposal to find her. Jake Speed ​​is a hero. He does not work for money because he wants a good adventure and wants to have it. His partner (Dennis Christopher) revolves around him and writes their adventures as novels. This film is a great adventure. It's hilarious, it's packed with action, it's just great. I think it is a cult film with very little cult. Crawford is perfect as Jake Speed ​​and throws a few lineers you can never forget. Copins and Christopher are good as a girl and sidekick respectively. John Hurt plays the devilish, bizarre villian which adds just fun, as the blast in the Alien who stomach. In many ways, the film is similar to Indiana Jones, in some ways similar to James Bond films. Maybe it's called Indiana Bond but it's a happy movie, even though the title.
