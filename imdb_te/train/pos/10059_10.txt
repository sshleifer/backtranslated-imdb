The film is the best film ever. I have not been able to get out of the film for the last time. I love this film with tears in my eyes. It has all the elements to have a good picture: amazing dialogues, music, acting, story / plot. A story about friendship, courage, kindness and faith, between a king of masks and a famous street that sells as a boy in Serge Bazar. The little girl likes his grandson and a grandson of the king of Mask. They are not traditionally true. Every scene they have attached is invaluable. Camera work flawless and grips you. Acting is inspired. The Qi Zhu Musk is the king of the miraculous. Jiu's "Doggy" looks beautiful and looks good on her role. Zigong Zhao is the greatest as Liang Sao Long. He played his assistant and heartfelt character. If you do not have this movie, try it once.
