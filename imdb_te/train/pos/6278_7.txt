I saw on a plane to go to the U.S. and it was a little bit skeptical, and many of the characters said that you were not aware of it. But I did not find it all. The film is very fast, but it is the director and the nature of the star. Chase scenes are amazing and yes it may be speculative but most movies are not that true. The main antagonist Christopher Eccleston may not have convinced him to be, but it is still a good film.
