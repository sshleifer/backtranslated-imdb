Eva (Heidi Lamarre) is married to a grown-up and honeymoon, and she learns that her husband did not want her. She was disappointed with the tendency of marriage and love, Eva returned to her father's home and left her husband. One afternoon, while bathing in a lake, her horse avoids her dress and a young worker backs back and gives them back to Eva. They fell in love with each other and became lovers. Later, her husband loses her and Eva tries to get back home. Eva has declined, and the treasury trick leads to the same place, ending the tragic way. I first saw "Extension" and the first comment relates to the awful quality of VHS released in Brazil by the Brazilian distributor Video Network: the film has a 75-minute duration and is used by the film different reels. Some parts are totally damaged, and most of the other parts are damaged. Therefore, the aesthetics of images that have not been achieved by the Brazilian viewer, if he has the opportunity to rent or sell these rare VHS. The film is practically a silent movie, the story is very dating and has some lines. As a result, the characters are well developed. However, the film is very brave for Hedy LaMar's beautiful breasts and naked fat body for the current standards of beauty. The poetic and metaphor used by the flowers, another miraculous factor, indicating the interaction between Eva and her girlfriend. The director is very clear that the director delivers the scenes to show Eva's needs and appreciation. The incomplete end of the 1933 film is also very unusual. I liked this movie, but I hope I have a chance to see a 87 minute restored version one day. My vote is eight. <br /> Title (Brazil): "Keysthes" ("Extasi")
