If you like cars, you like this movie. <br /> <br /> The film features Vinnie Jones, especially Vinnie Jones. <br /> <br /> There are two minor errors. First, the poor storyline, but people do not see this film for the plot. Secondly, the glory of Grand Theft Auto (car crime). <br /> When I read the first time that Nicolas Cage works mainly, people really believe that stealing Ferrari and making it look good. Character, I thought the first "... Sweet.", But then I thought "... you suck naaaa!" <br /> <br /> I saw this in the movie "... you're crying!" Only plays a funniest role. <br /> <br /> "A criminal is illuminated by a simple film going to the audience to the horrible end of the glossy layer of criminal life, and inspired to change their ways, then this death has the characteristic greatness. <br /> <br /> P - Angelina Jolie Vote is great!
