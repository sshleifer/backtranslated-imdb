Hello again, I have to comment on this wonderful, exciting, and believable story of romance and intrigue. Excellent and memorable music. Good colorful image. Another film I liked later was the High Society with Bing Crosby. Excellent music. Thank you for listening to, Florence Forester-Stockton, Reno, Nevada
