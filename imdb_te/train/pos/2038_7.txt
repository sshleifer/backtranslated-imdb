This film has exceeded my expectations. I worry, I heard it would be worse, so I do not expect much. However, I was pleasantly surprised. At first I was not really well with the main girl and she really did not care if she lived or died. Shortly afterwards, she has definitely grown up and becomes a favorite character. People are not a slazer film to die without any reason. There is a background story taking only a few second seconds but it explains a lot. I would recommend this picture to everyone. If you are not sure what to look for, it's only an hour and a half in your life. However, you will live 80 years.
