After watching many Greek movies, I am very suspicious of most people. But after watching this I felt astonished. The films are good without a big effort. You can not claim that the screenplay is too great or photography is perfect or technical. This is a true story and it is in the village rural areas in the forgotten places in the villages of God. The image is like a punch in the stomach and I really want to like these things. This is clearly different from the Greek people Xenophobia (ignorance). The problem of this man is not a former culprit. The problem is he is not one of these people. He is different and they do not want them (hence he does all the good things boomerang). He speaks about the apathy of the people, because there are some people who are against king hunter but they do not dare to tell their opinion. Eventually you can clearly see that the deceit of society is religious and trying to behave like God, but at the same time he treats the king unjustly. It is easy to analyze how their feelings or their beliefs are based on the established system. Finally you can get a positive lesson from this bad story, which means you can only be part of this community if you want one of these. If you want to stay separate and stay alone, you lose (and not from reality) I think this story is real and I think it's an hour for everybody. There is no comment for the lead actor because he has already received an award and I believe his play is great. Short comment for Hatzisavvas (plays the police), he's like a dinosaur, he played a lot of characters and I'm sure that this character is so easy for him but it plays great when you can not deny him a big bravo. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who wants to watch a good movie.
