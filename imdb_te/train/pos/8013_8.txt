Yes, it's another great magical movie, and I adore them all; The characters, movies, TV show episodes (it's the best comedy or never a TV show) and all the artists behind it. But here they have done such a serious offense and I will definitely talk about the weird end !! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ' We all are poor visitors, so feel free or with its annoyance, the lack of peevishness and misery is probably happy! So we all enjoy these stories in which to pair 2 cute heroes in love without the legitimate bond of Mickey Mouse and Mickey, Superman and Lewis Lane, Dick Tracey and Tes, all of the previous couples and their favorites you feel safe, calm and peace. <br /> <br /> They are a weak living creature (Kermit) married to his daily nightmare, (Miss Piggy)! This is a historical change through the actions of the American entertainment industry! And it is pretty simple to have a negative effect on the audience, whom it just does not bless or believe or satisfy with a sudden or sudden marriage (even the melancholic Frog does not have the right time to think or think or decide anything!). Wonder no matter when you know their movie is a serious one that is just the biggest failure to charge just over 25 million, so one of the first of the 65 million people vis-Ã -vis (Muppet Movie ?? 1979) can be accomplished five years ago !! <br /> <br /> In this film they have taken Manhattan and my rest!
