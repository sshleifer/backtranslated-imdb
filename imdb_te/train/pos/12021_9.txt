This hard hitting in the Peckinpah / Leone tradition is often directed by Andrew V. McLaughlin, the most violent Western, and his former Western (mainly John Wayne), mainly in John Ford mode. <br /> It's surprisingly traditional (good people / bad guys) and a wonderful date to date. <br /> <br /> Hayeston played the former captain of the territorial police station, suspended the law enforcement authority to the law enforcement enforcer Shefff (Michael Parks) and discovered his ways of implementing the law adopted by Autos, Telegraphs, Telephones and Railroad in the first years of the 20th century . But soon he faces a ferocious attack - a half-ridden man (Kobern) who stole more than a decade of train robbery that killed more than a dozen guards. In the next shootout, Coburn's wife was killed; Thus Coburn is the worst kind of vengeance. It was kidnapping and, ultimately, the daughter of Heston (Hershey) and his gang rape. <br /> <br /> Last Hour Men, based on Brian Garfield's novel "Gun Down", is violent in many places, including rape scenes involving two members of the gang of Showdown Herton and Coburn, Hershey and Coburn's (Quad√©, Paul) DGS and Deliverance can be every bit as questionable as similar scenes. But it is not so terrible in the psychological manner of the film about the Western style. McLaglan is able to perform a bloody story with a considerable style, and Heston's performance as an aging lawyer is probably the best he has given in many of his 1970s films. Coburn is particularly cold-blooded, and Parks and Chris Mitchem (as Hershey's intended husband) make good turns. The music here is minimized from Jerry Gold Smith's scores of 100 refills and STAGECOACH's 1966 remakes, but it still works here. <br /> <br /> In the city of southeastern Arizona, the city is completely bizarre and the old Tucson set should be released by Fox on VHS and / or DVD to FAST HARD MEN. It is the west that deserves nothing less.
