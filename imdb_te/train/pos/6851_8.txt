De Paula's technique achieved his high maturity at the time of the film, which was a spectacular performance of his classic technology, although unfortunately, like many of the films written by De Palma himself, this story presents an emotionally detailed story of Meta's services. <br /> <br /> The story opens with a crazy scene where Anzi Dickinson is bathing while she is looking at her husband. Her husband is coming to her husband when she is caught and raped. - The whole thing was revealed that her husband was unwell when she was ill with her bed. She has a small scene with her son, who has a dead ringer for Harry Potter, who ends up with a joke saying, "She's telling my grandma that he is playing with her Peter." She goes to her treatment session where she complains about her dead marriage, trying to come to her therapist Michael Caine. <br /> <br /> The 22-minute pedestal sequence starts with a highlight of the film. Is there a full awareness of stories that tell stories of many stories from Hitchcock to de Palma Lock? And in the typical D'Palma Fashion, he becomes a way to show his formidable skill. The problem is, for me, to show a director's skill in this case is to begin to feel continually chronic without needing just the scenes. <br /> <br /> The art museum will begin with the amazo. She observes all those who are involved in sexual or family activities, and then begins to return to the person sitting next to her. Dale Palma is very skillful with Angie's incredible skill, embarrassment, retirement, and ultimately a very complicated story without a string of strangers behind a taxi cab, with all sets for a tremendously increased score by Pino Donagio. <br /> <br /> Angie Gay is sleeping, and gets back to her husband. Angie finds that she does not have drops, knowing that her husband is already in the house and where she is, no one can talk back to the Daily Palma again a word of speech to talk again, and she lost her engagement ring somewhere in Shuffle. It's all very appreciative, but if we fly up to a high elevator from the seventh floor, then in real time, we have to do things like that. ... spoilers from here! When Angji again reached the seventh floor, she will be killed by a long lady with long hair. When the door opens, Nancy Alen watches her there, hacks her away until she reaches the dungeon. Nancy has an amazing slow motion to reach the elevator, Angie approaches her, and the killer's blade feared Nancy to cut his hands. Then follow some mixed shots when Nancy is found and watching the killer in the elevator's convex mirror. It's good, and for some time we have some conversation again, you think; "Woah, it's just 22 minutes totally visual!" <br /> <br /> A young Dennis Franz is a vulgar and strict New York detective who has a great role and he does his job for everyone. He interviewed Michael Caine, who wanted to be angry (as long as it goes as usual). Angie's son is also, and he hooks with Nancy, who set out to find out who is spying on Cain's physician and who finds the murderer. <br /> <br /> Once again, the hitchhik is a strong tie for the film, in which case Psycho (a resumption of Versaillo). You have a woman who needs to understand, a mysterious, dying in the first 30 minutes, where the elevator is more than a shower. Then the relatives of the deceased conduct an investigation, which tells the killer is a dresser to kill a woman. Dem Palma also explains the psychology of the whole thing and eventually throws in a doctor. <br /> <br /> It is very interesting, but at the same time the viewer will feel a bit rounded up, and my basic reservation about this film. It definitely shows and de Silva performs some of the great sets, but D'Palma is a solid third running behind the need to show off the story and his somewhat unseemly sexual fantasies make it hard <br /> <br /> Bad and cheesy movies, Cinema de Merde, cinemademerde .com Check out other reviews on my website.
