It is one of my favorite Kung Fu films and is considered to be the most famous Shaw Brothers in the late 70s. The storyline is interesting and the Twisti, the characters have their own style - the toad, snake, and lizard are cool. The rest of the Chang Chah / Wonom's limits this activity, but it is interesting with various kung fu styles that can be displayed from different characters. Sham Brothers, especially the Chang Chen films, are the same, and I think most of my films should focus on 10 tigers and the ice-shadows against Shaolin vs. Snow. There is fresh air breathing compared to this film.
