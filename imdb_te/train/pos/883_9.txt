I read "My Lips," I came back to see the plate of Freedom Fries before me. <br /> <br /> I am very surprised by the original and wonderful thriller of director and co-author Jacques Aidard. <br /> Carla (Emmanuel Devos) is a secretary who develops major construction projects. She has some important responsibilities, which often do not come to the Secretaries and her potential and prestigious. <br /> <br /> She has been asked to appoint Carla Secretary, faster than she can handle it. Enter Former Con and General Labut Paul (Vincent Cassell). He is about his skills and in fact there is no need for any legitimate company. After the misunderstanding started by Paul, as Karla was interested in him, the two became allies. A quirky friendship starts. In a stunt, True Carla made a major contender on "The Apprentice", wounding her eccentric antagonist with Paul's compound. Exit the opponent. <br /> <br /> Carla is almost deaf without her help. She usually listens almost to her. She changes hearing aid to shake her from the bizarre sounds and annoying people. She is very lonely. A brave makeup makeup she seemed plain but she was really beautiful. She is not her boyfriend. Her girlfriend has an affiliation (which is a French film) which is worst and insulting, where she will stop her girlfriend's pleas, where she has a wedding friend with Carla's bed. <br /> <br /> When Karla and Paul find each other better, the former offender rarely comes to the bottom of the rubbish bunker. <br /> <br /> "Do you read my lips?" When asked, there is a story about Paul's relationship with his parole officer. <br /> <br /> Spiritual Paul, the ability to read the wedding, is also a considerable distance, more than the amusing parlor trick that appears to be the first. <br /> <br /> There is a caper that develops from there. <br /> <br /> Paul and Carla are the real criminal oddball couple. She wants to love her, but she also accepts money. He wants her, sort of, but the business should come before the romantic satiation possible. Cassell and Devas, together with an extraordinary crime story, were very memorable. <br /> You can rent or buy it, but if you enjoy a good crime story, read "My Lips." <br /> You may want to see it several times: I will do. <br /> <br />
