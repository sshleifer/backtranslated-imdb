Oh, this is wonderful music. There is a bit of a false propaganda - Frank Sinatra as Union Nathan Detroit is seriously mistaken, although this is clearly evident in the Jewish song "Sue Me". Unfortunately, filmmakers decided to remove one of the best songs from the show "Marry the Man Today", and replaced it with the lowest Sinatra Showpiece. These two flaws seem to be in mind, the film is excellent. Jean Simmons shines as Sarah Brown. Marlon Brando can not damage the beans, but it pulls it anyway. Stubby Kaye is greatly replicated in his Broadway role (which is written by him). Damn Ryanion's language and passing and humor are very good. This is my see-it-every-chance-i-get list.
