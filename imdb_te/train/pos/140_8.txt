Normally I do not like the series. They are speculative and they become very boring and dull. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br <br /> <br /> This episode is well played, although the story is through all episodes and you are missing one. <br /> <br /> Episodes are all being shot in the hospital and you are more like the mysteries of the dark and old secrets below the powerful hospital surface And going further.
