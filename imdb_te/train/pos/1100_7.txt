- After tired of the rat race and narrow living conditions of New York City, Jim Blondings (Carrie Grant) found an asset in the country for his wife and children. He is hoping to find normal life. But building a house is normal. Headaches and bills are starting to fit, so do laughs. Will Mr. Blanking ever get his Dream House? <br /> <br /> The film has three unique actors - Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvin Douglas. One of the three is capable of producing their own film, so when you combine their talent, almost every scene is unique. Grant is always in love with this kind of role. He's very good to put on his husband. Good luck is always a pleasure to see. Thin Man films made with William Powell are accurate. And Douglas has become mine's favorite in the past two or three years. Douglas also starred in my favorite character in The Old Dark House. <br /> <br /> This image is definitely its time. I get a kick to imagine a time when you can build a two-story, three bedroom, four bathroom house for $ 15,000 a year. It's almost amazing that your two children are attending private school and you have a worker who lives. <br /> <br /> However, for anyone buying or building a home, and the blondes themselves are easy to find today. Where is comedy coming How many people end up spending more money than expected to do these stupid things? - The biggest complaint I have about Mr. Blandings is the subplot of the "best friend's love wife" overall. It really does not need the plot and the provided out-of-place and very uncomfortable.
