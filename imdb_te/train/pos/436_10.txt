I absolutely loved this movie. I'm not sure about it but I think it's awesome and it's available for DVD. The women were strangers and were well suited to spend time in the villa in Italy. Actors, in my opinion, did a wonderful job. The characters differ from all over and the clever story has worked. There is a good time in humor, drama and relationship issues. These 10 lines are required but I can not think of any more to say so I just scrambled on until I got 10 lines. I am very sorry about this. What do I tell you for a long time since I finally saw it? I look forward to seeing again but it is not available.
