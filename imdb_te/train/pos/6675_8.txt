Comedy is good for directing this movie. Several scenes from the comic book seem to be outside of the comic book and very dark (visually - not theory of knowledge). Granted, this is not the most ridiculous film you have made, especially if it's too low into the raw sexist jokes, which is very low (compared to something about Mary or American pie). When you get it back, many jokes stand out and are funnier. If you ever read a comic book or liked the comic book-type movie (Batman, X-Men, etc.), you enjoy the subtle humor throughout the movie. If you do not like them, you may like that honorary plea for the film. If you like this movie, there is some cool add on DVD. (8/10)
