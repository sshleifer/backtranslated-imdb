When I was young, my parents came to see me in this movie. I really liked it, and I looked again and again. I've seen it from time to time even when I am in 3rd grade. Recently, I have seen again for nostalgia, and I still recognize that it is fun and educated, though not for my age group (I'm in my teens). This performance teaches good lessons about predictability and goes well with others. Some parts I found very amusing. Also, there is not any bad content in this program, so you can leave the children alone in this program and do not worry about removing any bad language or whatnot. I would recommend this.
