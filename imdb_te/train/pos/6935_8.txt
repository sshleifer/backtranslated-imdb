James Stewart stars in the classic Western story of Stars, which connects the film's fate with other starring Winchester Rifle. Stewart has gone unnoticed by adding some cool hard invasion to his usual laid-back cowboy. The story follows the fate of a Winchester Rifle and its owners, then our leader won in a competition and the man who hunted him was stolen. <br /> <br /> We are pursuing the rifles path in gamblers, gun fighters, Indian merchants and bank rubbers in Indian wars, bank hystitures. Supporting actors Don Durai was seen as a live-wire pistol with an itchy trigger finger as Johnny Dean. He is also seen as the Indian Chief from Rock Hudson at the very beginning. <br /> <br /> The closing showdown is a classic colonial rifle battle fought in a rocky navy and in the long run around. Some good old Western acting, fist fights, shootout and horse-dancing can make it an adventure for a western rowdy. 8/10
