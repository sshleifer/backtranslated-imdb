I found this film to be very funny, and I liked how to do it in modern sports politics. The film is not as funny as South Park but is pretty funny. And since I am a sports fan, they enjoyed some more ridiculous things in sports. The film is good for most people but is great for athletes because it is surprising why sports are so mad rules and implications for games and sports. I also found the original game to be of interest, which is like a horse with people of settlements and minds (for shooting person). Overall I see this movie and believe that you love this movie. You probably will not like it while this style of comedy is not your favorite. (But with no funny image)
