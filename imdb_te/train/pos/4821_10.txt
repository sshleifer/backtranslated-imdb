One of those pretty serious films that most of us are attracting in closer, it ends very quickly! Leave watching on the screen than, "they are not!", Lol. All good performances! Emily Blunt acting is amazingly amazing! I know she gave me a great, persuasive performance to capture the vulnerability of Victoria's realism, temperance and complete posture. Also, the product is unusual in every way: style, material and tenderness. A notable glimpse of British history, the queen of the school age princess, is said to be the first and foremost among nine children, from personal and hearty biographies until the marriage of Prince Albert. It has a well written screenplay and flawless editing. Prior to Rubert Friend Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany), the princess competing to capture the love of Albert and princess Albert. The relationship between Victoria and her mother in adolescence is cruel in times such as her mother and King William (her mother does not like). Acting and scenes are attractive and most emotional. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this to those who are interested in historical and political situations of that time, and in fact, anyone who loves the perfect true love story
