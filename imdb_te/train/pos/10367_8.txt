When I first saw "A Cry in the Dark", I did not know what the plot was. But when I saw it, I was amazed at what it portrayed. When I saw for the second time in an Australian movie class, I realized I was second: dialogue problems. Lindy Chamberlain's Meryl Streep baby, when she and her husband Michael (Sam Neil) were suffering from dingo, did not show it. Seventh Day Adventists, they believed that God made it possible, so they can not comfort it. <br /> <br /> However, when people are not bothered across Australia, everyone believes that everyone is doing Lindy. <br /> <br /> Point, wrong message was reported to the public and it changed people against Lyndi. Although this is a pure risk, it still has been done. <br /> <br /> This is one of the biggest disasters in the mass media, regardless of the political views of the mass media. <br /> <br /> For performances, Streep has a very good work with the Australian voice), and Sam Neal is equally great. You probably fly by what you see here. Fred is one of the best films of Skepacy.
