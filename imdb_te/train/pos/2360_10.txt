It is thought to be very balanced to show what Jehovah's Witnesses have done to protect American liberties. It also showed strong belief in the two families, the first generation of witnesses. How I have demonstrated how hard it will be to accept that they do not celebrate holidays by influencing non-Witness family members by becoming a Witness, for family dinners / visits Give presents to gifts or birthdays, or over the Witness family or at any other time. When it comes to medical care, people forget that witnesses seek high level of medical care and expect that blood transfusions allow for brazen medical care and surgery, but the bloodless treatments are the most effective and trained by the medical team to treat your loved ones? I highly recommend this video!
