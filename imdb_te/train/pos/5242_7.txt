I have achieved this film for two reasons. The first is that it rarely gives us an insight into the world, even though it's surreal in Northern Ireland which treats many films in which rarely tell us about a republican fight. The second reason is that the actors are performances. I thought they would leave so many honest and acceptable portraits of the most seedy underworld listening to many people outside of my native coast. <br /> <br /> All in all, it stars an entertaining ganster movie starring Northern Irish actors from one of them to the stellar performances. Some people's eyes may be open to the murky world of some kind of loyalist, but it is customary to move the earth.
