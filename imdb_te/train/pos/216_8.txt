Question: How do you steal a full, angry and intelligent Griffee Old Man mode from Experts' veteran Mathur's experts? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know anything about it but it is a favorite film, Richard Benjamin is very fun as a man - trying to get to Burns through the windows. The smaller parts are also great. <br /> <br /> Very funny scenes, <br /> <br /> A fun. <br /> <br /> Enterrrrrr!
