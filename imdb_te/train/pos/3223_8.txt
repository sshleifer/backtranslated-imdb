Well, basically this is a popcorn science fiction movie, but from the beginning it is directed with intelligence. You can calculate 10 clips of the film, but only three of them, and one of them has a twist, the director is you. Kurt Russell's performance is excellent and brings depth to the spectacular and rewarding character. If you see something really foolish, I want to rebuild your faith!
