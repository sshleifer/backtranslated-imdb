Stella (Meg Foster) decides to marry him to stop her homosexual Albert (Perry King) from moving to Belgium. Stella is a homosexual. One night after Albert's birthday, both of them have their own special lives, they come to bed and then into love. In the film after falling in love, Stella thinks that Albert will cheat, and after a night she will appear in her work. She sees what the viewer leaves to be stunned. This image is very original. Perry King and Meg Foster were great in their roles, and were surprised that they were not well-known for their work. The most controversial when it was released in 1978, the "R" featured film "PG" is now more liberal. </ p> <p> Recently released DVD's special features in the "Making Of" section of the disc, and the film claims that the film is based on a genuine story, so misunderstood that the film is not "original". Everyone is falling in love with one person and for different reasons-all of these are the problems explored in this amazing picture for everyone who loves it!
