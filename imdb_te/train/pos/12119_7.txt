Today actresses are happy to grow in weight, wear their hair, slabs, and lose their glamor for the role and Betty Davis is perhaps the actress who started the trend. <br /> <br /> Occasionally, as a young man dressed in Constance Bennett-type ornaments in designer clothes and movies, Davis is willing to destroy himself to create a role outside and outside of his character. <br /> <br /> Philip Carey was convinced of her breakout film, "Human Bond of Off", starring with Leslie Howard. Mildred, a masochistic, club-fulled philip of Davis Holds, plays impartial, durable, dull, low-life. She joins her for the first time when she is an attendant, and allows her to take her to dinner and theater with her rich man (Alan Hale Sr.). In fact, Mildred Philip was repulsed by Club Foot. For his part, Philip seems to have experienced her abusive childhood abuse and her darkness. Mildred is financially dry among friends who have left her when she eats herself, and he really breaks the lovely women's couple (Kay Johnson and Frances Dee). Mildred loses his apartment and pulls him out, forcing him to withdraw from the medical school and not lose his relationship. <br /> <br /> "Human Bondage" is a part of the days that can be frozen. Although Leslie Howard is an outstanding actor and charismatic, his acting style belongs to a more formal old school, and as a result, he is doing anything. He shines in his role as Davis opposite "It's Love I Am" or "Petified Forest" for its kind of technique. His dated performance is more evident here, because Davis created a new ground with a sandy, experimental performance that made her name. If she seems to be on top, she comes from the stage and the sensuality of film acting will later come to light for her. This performance is in contrast with her warmth and warmth, her warmth, which brought her to "All This, and Heaven Two" or her "Dark Victory". She is a true actress and a true artist. Davis really allows himself to see the sacred hell; Mildred's downfall Philip repents completely as Philip finds her soul cumbersome. <br /> <br /> It is a fantastic picture to develop one of the greatest actors in the film.
