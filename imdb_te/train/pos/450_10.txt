I'm biased toward any film that depicts a mysterious film from Italy - my opinion is the sexiest country in the world. Unfortunately the film is too small, for a long time, the time is short on the clock and cinematography aspect. However, the amazing story makes for it. These four ladies go on a relaxing vacation with difficulties in their minds. During the film, they began to recognize their problems and fix them. They believe that San Salvador, the castle they inhabit, have an enchanting effect on the people. "Love is a tub," said Lottie Wilkins. <br /> <br /> When you combine the Italian seaside magic you can see their gradual change of dissatisfaction. <br /> Their problems and their solutions are acceptable. The actresses are great. Background music seemed most suitable for a romantic Italian locale. All in all, I have a 10/10 film.
