When I was a kid I saw this kung fu movie and thought it was great! Now when I'm 26, my friend is on the DVD <br /> <br /> We got a moment to brew, and seeing this classic! It has lost the NONE of the original Kung Fu coolness! If you're a fan of kung fu / karate movies, it must be ... DVD is available. <br /> <br /> I also believe this film is "Choose Your Livestock".
