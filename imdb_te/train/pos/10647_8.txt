I can not understand that fans do not like this movie. It was a lot of fun. Special effects are excellent. I usually agree with the reviews and IMDB voters, but this time. I wait until it comes to the house that I think is another reason, I can not enjoy that movie. I believe that special effects films will appear on the big screen, but again this is not the case. I was compared to two films that were released at the same time. Blair Witch and The Mummy. The two pictures I thought were terrible. Blair is probably the most overrated horror film at all times. Mummy made money bats and this is a pure chassis. People liked it for special effects. Images like Mommy and Haanting are not great in character development, they are more fun rides. That is similar to the B-ticket to Mommy Haanting's e-ticket.
