Wonderful picture. The whole picture is shot in Budapest, so I feel proud. My minor problem is that it belongs to Hungry State Railways (M√ÅV), and is common to see that they are used in large railways and not used in local railways - in the narrative story of local railway stations for his victims. Apart from this, the picture is fantastic.
