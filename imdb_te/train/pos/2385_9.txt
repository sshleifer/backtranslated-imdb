Old Audio Cassettes In older commercials, the tag line "Is this true or is it memory?" This episode includes the same thing - the first pilot of "The Cage" and Remix Star Trek. Mr. Spock ordered the vessel to intelligently take him to the forbidden planet, Tholus IV, to allow the ship to return the frozen and frozen captain, Christopher Pike. Why finagling? Any contact with Talas IV invites death penalty. Why this is not explained - it's a great anxiety for me - but nothing else adds to the story. After spawning the ship to travel to Tollos IV, Mr. Spock Dr. McCoy (the senior officer is now in the captain's kirk ship) changes himself and "I have not been instructed to take the charge rebel and the top of the ship's ship." A court martial thanked to the Taloscias - Mr. Spokes Captain to come to Thulous IV by death Wait for the bike is the most important (obviously including paralysis), we know why. Fascinating, background music and the whole storyline that Thalassius creates are excellent. And Mag Wiley as Keeper (head Talosian) is amazing. Call me sexist but having a woman in that role never happened to me but she was perfect! Unesxes, almost all physicists who abandon virtually all physical suffering, and are completely independent of the power of the hallucinations. You can not really say if they're male or female and it really does not matter. This episode, more than almost any other in the series, makes me pray and pray there are other worlds and so far civilizations ahead! If that's what a nice thing! This is one of my favorite episodes and how many times I've seen (I'm in the video too), which will never fail to attract me. Meg wiley laks as an alien and I do not mean unfairly.
