The mainstream market is probably never available because it does not make the viewer easier. The story about the problematic Spike and his friend Heaton is not exactly a Friday night film, it has its own special edge and I found it to be fun. The film was filmed at a low level low budget, as there were bright movements such as spike aerosol absorption. But I did not really understand the relationship between Spike and Heaton and spent much of it working for me to be honest. And I do not like the fact that I have two very friends talking and really spent not too much "action". It's very hard to watch and it's attractive.
