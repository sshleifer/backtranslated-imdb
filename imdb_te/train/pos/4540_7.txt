The film featured Jay Leno as a Detroit police, Tony Costas and Pat Morita as a Tokyo Copa sent to Detroit to replace the motor model's stolen model. A Japanese man was hoping to sell Detroit to a man named Derick Jared, and to sell it to an upcoming car company. Unfortunately, the men who were to negotiate with him had killed him and took Prototype. An angry Derek Jared men who led men, Philip attempts to distance himself from Madras. But Madras (played by Chris Sarandon) has no one and threatens Jared to continue his partnership. In the same junk yard where Japanese man was killed, Tony Costas' friend was also killed. <br /> <br /> Tony's friend Junk Yard was watching. <br /> <br /> Tony attempts to meet the killer against his superiors orders. Tony is in extortion, but must be clearly investigated by the murder case. When Tony is investigating the crime, he goes into Japanese cop and mistakenly arrests him. Finally they ended up working together in the case. There are some ridiculous scenes, such as an odd pair and some real hilarious episodes as well as pot morita jumping and kicking right through a moving car's windshield and kicking madras in the head. But at least in my opinion, an enjoyable friend ends up as a police film. Jay Leno is an actor, but he is in the role and Pat Morita is good. Still, they make for an action movie one more chance for one of the friend police duus. I would recommend this movie if you would like to watch a friend cop films, cheesy 80 movies or Jay Leno as an actor.
