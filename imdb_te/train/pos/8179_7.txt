<br /> <br /> It was fun to see in the theater back in 1996. My movie flavor has a good criminal origin, which really appreciates the films that are really surprising. <br /> <br /> "Dentist" Sometimes people have strong feelings on dental things. The ADA launched a campaign to apologize for the film and reported by dentists for the "Marathon Man" (only one comparison with most of the "The Dentist"). <br /> <br /> It is amazing to note that the film was shot in 21 days, according to the trivia page. In fact, it may take more time than cinematic shooting than post production production and editing is perfect for "The Dentist". Quick cuts increase tension much, with only two quick cuts showing what the dentist is doing on his wife's "caution" scene. The rest is for our very rich imagination! <br /> <br /> He is a good choice for the role of Carbin Bernsen because he has been emotionally experienced with "off" characters. He sold the obsessive compulsive factors of the dentist completely. <br /> <br /> The motion of this movie is just right for me. Filmmakers reveal the right way with the wife's disgust. All the characters in the dental office appear like they are real people working in real office. They are very stressed when dealing with the people waiting for the arrival of a dentist. Meanwhile the dentist is off the cusp of heavy mental breakdown! Unlike most movies of this genre, the script is very tight. All victims come into the trap of the dentist in the most calculated ways. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br And is heavily recommended for fans of intelligent Gorefests.
