Robert Mitchet was a client at Tolleger in this short but strict Western: Man with the Gun. Tolinzer is a professional town tamer - one wants to have a town to save himself; He was the one who was brought to do it. Tolinggar's latest performance comes in an accident: going into town looking for his former event, he slips into a town where he plays as a puppet with a local Western gangster. But most townspeople started a day of renting Tolinger, with a lot of taxes to clean the town (suddenly the high-plane drifter seems to be less original). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The man with the gun starts off as an average Western Tough-Guy movie, but the movie begins to surprise you as the film progresses further. The unforgettable and run-of-the-mill ends in dark and alphabetically-centered. The whole film is well portrayed and the cast is very enjoyable. Mitchell is his most brilliant self in Gun Man - one of his very best performances, Mitchem still has his classic and effective tough-man performance in high gear and he is the action-packed, meaningful, and shocking sight of the movie on the right of the park. Man with Gun is a nice Mitchum west and easily worth a time.
