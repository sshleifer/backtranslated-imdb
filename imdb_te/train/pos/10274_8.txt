Spirals is a gripping picture about these sheep. But who is casting here? When the hunter goes in hunt? This sandy, dark picture slowly moves and is seductive. <br /> This is a good act (at least from Leeds), which has an inspired script. I did not recognize background music, but it was not always jarring, it was just right. <br /> <br /> I usually do not like this movie because I am very surprised at this movie. Genre but this one sucks me and he kept hooked to the end.
