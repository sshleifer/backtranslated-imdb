Last Saturday afternoon I saw nothing about the movie. And then, as I was watching, I feel my pain of Lanna and Bozeman into my bones. Acting and tone and I listened to the dialogues only partially and impressed me through the filming. As soon as we got to bed, my husband fell asleep and I was not asleep with the effect of the film. I wanted to wake up what I said: "If I ever vote for an Oscar nomination, it will have two actors." I decided to wait for the next day. Then I read more on IMDb's film and I'm sad to see that Mr Berry died before the film's release and never saw the final version of his amazing masterpiece. I tell you that his image, its sense and the true image of the soul, it is me. Actors are only praised for their brilliant performance, but not participating in illumination, displaying the true reflections of the human recession. Sad but sharp.
