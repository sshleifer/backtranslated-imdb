This is the last part we deserve. At the end of last season, things remain in the 'mood' of the mood, this is hardly the hardest deserving of this real series. While this is not a delightful performance, the series has always made you think (a rare thing on television) and this is no exception. 'Death Is Not to Death' 'Is society not moral values ​​that reflects society, or is society chosen by a certain number of people chosen by force?' 'What is death, what will it exist?' All of these questions and more, the writers of this exhibition will encounter each week, and this is their last doctrine. Good acting, great writing, excellent camera work, clever editing, pure direction. If you see the series and if you've lost it the first time, just hold a copy. If you have never seen this series, it will stand on its own, but it tries very hard to find out who is in all the characters and in their predecessors. For those of us who are interested in the series in the last two seasons, it is very satisfying for us.
