Partially, from the perceived need, there is a feeling to portray more movie on the 1950s film publishing banner to include a traditional love story in a film. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the unfortunate funny characters of top-level officers running the overseas office - the British worshiped only the British. But after that, the film loses its role in a traditional fakeshot platform. <br /> <br /> Terry-Thomas is always alert, but the great talent in cast (Peters Sellers, and others) are wasting greatly. <br /> <br /> A diversion, but not a great image.
