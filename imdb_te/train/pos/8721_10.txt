Disney (and of course the amazing folks at Pixar) provide a nice, humorous story that combines best of computer animation. The 'faces' of bugs are a bit more stable than 'Antz', and they are just four legs (in the 'Antz' six ...). But the backgrounds are fantastic and animation is breathtaking. But this is a lesson: it's not a computer made a success: it's nice little twists, which I missed in 'The Antz' is the man behind the machine. In the end, some headlines are 'blops' (so watch in the end, it's valuable!), Very fun and original. The line 'completely filmed' line is intended for a more attentive viewer.
