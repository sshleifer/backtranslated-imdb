Brian Dennehi, Bill Paxton, Joe Pantallino and the best, Jeff Faye, in one single film. Wow I can think of it all. These are four of the fewest actors in Biz, and they work pretty together. <br /> <br /> The poetry played each other and sealed the natural ability to feel good friends for the movie. <br /> <br /> This film is also good, it is very intense to watch for the first time, and four stars help watch the back to a great extent. I can not describe how bad it is to see Bill Paxton and Jeff Faye on screen together on screen, when they see a pair from a distance and a great moment when they fill in the vocals, which almost tears my eyes. <br /> Look at a good image, great cast. Why? Four Words, Fahi, Dennehi, Paxton, Pantallino.
