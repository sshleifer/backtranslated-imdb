The Barbara Stanwick movie is great what happened to see the other night. "Jeopardy" is amazing. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwick plays Helen, husband Doug (Barry Sullivan) and son (Lee Aaker) is a discrete fishing spot in Mexico for a holiday. <br /> <br /> She is a mental killer (Ralph Mikeer - my favorite) and her twins and rats is a game, and Micker tries all her strength to get her back with her to leave Barbara her husband. <br /> <br /> This film is very curious - I do not imagine a great image. But I guess I realized - is Barbara Stanwick less than any amazing thing?
