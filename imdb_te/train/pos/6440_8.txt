I never write a review of IMDb unless I am very surprised at how good a movie is, or how bad it is. This movie comes into the first category. Every year, I try to see the nominees for the best foreign film in Oscars, I know that I do not like it. "It is in Heaven" appears to fit the bill. This plot is sugary and sentimental and slow ... "Heaven" is not particularly interesting for my taste, which is more or less run by the original, dark and / or brave foreign film (Michael Hannicky, Fran√ßois Ozone, modern Japanese / Korean film) ... Not released in the USA, so I sit down to see a VCD found in Singapore and prepare to "cross the list" Esanu. After a disappointing start, "as it is in heaven" is a rare movie that triggered what happened on the screen. Weak Points: The characters in the film are pure "stock" characters - wounded dreamer, town bully, damaged wife, ludicrous woman playing for love, depressed minister ... Thankfully, they have a much-loved bunch, well written and well-played. Igela Olson, the wife's wife Inger, has been nominated for an Oscar Award in English for her performance. Strong Points: The music is beautiful, and the main song, Gabriella sang, is really dramatic and memorable. And keep an eye for the agonist 87-year-old actress playing Olga who is conducting dancing steps as well as young ladies! I will not talk about the end, but I said I understand. They are very emotional in the last hour and you are not sure why they are going. This makes sense when it comes to the crescendo that matches the movie, even if the words are not explained. **** out *****. The most powerful Swedish film I have ever seen.
