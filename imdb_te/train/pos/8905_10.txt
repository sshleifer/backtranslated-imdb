Old horror movies are interesting, plenty of chatter, plenty of chatter, and plenty of humor to go along with it. "The Blob" is a standard in its own work. Steve McQueen (1930-80) plays the role of teen trying to be a hero in his town. Go out on a date with her girl and be specific to all teens. But when an old man finds the same falling object in the sky, he ends up being a victim, and Steve helps him get the best. Until teen power, this film really offers it. When many teenagers face their hardship, when they are in danger, they must learn to forget the past and do something good to protect mankind. When the adults in the town learn the hard way to drive the "Blob" ankle, they must learn to trust young people and their behavior is not the best of them. Dazzling Juggernaut is very beautiful in the day, and in my opinion I think it is JELL-O! When everyone waits to stop the anxiety, this town is once again safer, thanks for the good old collaboration. I still eat jelo and watch this movie from time to time, you jelly, tougge!
