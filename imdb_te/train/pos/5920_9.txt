American icon Henry Fonda "sleek" John Howard loses his beloved big rig "Elinor", who lives in a long hospital, loses his payments and then plays the role of an aging trucker. He only decides to make a more perfect run, he breaks out of the hospital, steals Eleanor, and needs to change the prostitute, his prostitute group, with old friend Penelope Pierrean (Eileen Brennan). /> <br /> Fondas's incredible performance is a natural anchor in a comedy film, featuring an excellent cast, unwilling young chorus, including Susan Sarandon (he also co-produces credit, including Robert Incland as funny flashes of funny bones ) And Doub Taylor (always the most funny humorous part of the film). <p> <br /> Finally, the film's life-stability and sympathy of travel have an amazing weight; <br /> <br /> This is a picture that you get, and you must remember it for a long time after it ends. <br /> The open road promise is obvious here; The countryside is just beautiful. <br /> <br /> It is in its final act (some of John Bainer and Austin Pondletton's characters lose a little more than the intrusion of infiltrations). <br /> "The Great Smoky Roadblock"), which is a rewarding experience for me, I can not recommend myself. <br /> <br />
