Interestingly, though the "early commentaries" of the film are unpleasant - (why is the first lowest comment on the list?) It's great for almost everyone! Apparently the Church wanted to stress some points and the prophet Joseph Smith wanted to describe in a positive manner ~ the whole idea. In fact, those points were very effective. Joseph Smith is already a human being ... But despite that, and all of the terrible negative attempts to invite the enemy, he showed how his fairy could accomplish God's work. I would recommend anyone!
