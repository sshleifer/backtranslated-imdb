Fido is a story about well-trained men who have been trained to serve the human race. However, Timmy's zombie Fido family falls when everyone eats the neighbors. Since then, the disaster (well, perhaps not a disaster, but somewhat confused) occurs. Most people treat with their ancestors, and such a character sleeps with his zombie (the film is a very funny piece, even if not too disturbing). And we'll find Fidoni who loves what he can do. This is a very funny and unique image especially for zombie style. It's also probably the least violent of zombie movies (disadvantage in this statement). I recommend it to people who are looking for something very funny and something different. I rate this rate as 8/10. R rated for zombie-related violence
