It's not exactly why it's playing in Peoria, obviously, but it's a very funny, ingenious British comedy. It was set at the end of "Swinging Sixties". Peter Sellers is rich, rich in forty-something serial wizard. Sellers' Catch of the Day at the beginning of the perfectly lovely Goldie Han playing a 19-year-old American girl in London. <br /> <br /> The strongest performances from comedy, patos, great script, leads and supporting castes. <br /> This is a great image, and the last line of the best gag. <br /> Try it out, you'll like it.
