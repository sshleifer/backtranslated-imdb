I think it's a bit more complicated, perhaps in the mental sense, but the action and voice acting are top-notch. The animation in many scenes is huge CG, but those are very good ones. It is one of the Batman Returns / Forever typing films, including Love and Wayne's contradictions and intentions for dating. 007 Fans loves this, and so females, great theme song! Wayne played a good role in the film, and Penkwin returned to his original form, during which no mutant genes were present! Tim Drek is somewhat of an Indigo child or mind in the future, a good computer nerd <br /> <br /> A supporting cast Some sop opera stars, good talents and characters seem like voice actors. <br /> <br /> I've rated Phantas, Return of the Joker, and Batman vs. Dracula below. 7/10
