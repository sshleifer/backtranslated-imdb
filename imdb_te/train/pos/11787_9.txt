It had just a 8-minute film from David Lynch, but it became "the Lionel ingredients"! It is mysterious, dark, incomplete, strange, and strange; And it's a bit scary before talking to the elegant girl! Soundtrack is unusual to create this odd atmosphere, because it is also bad and mysterious? <br /> About setting, this is not "traditional" red curtains, but it has purple paint walls that give equal shape the purple color. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a girl locked in a dark room and she cries for help; Then comes just another girl who starts to talk to her in a mystical way, just because she is wrong ?? We do not know what happened or what happens? A good Lynch movie came to an end and it ended up being unclear and unclear! <br /> <br /> Despite some amateur acting, this is a great deal. The girls are professional actresses, but I think their acting may be better in this little.
