The second feature is related to a young woman desperate for a job for London, happy to accept an elderly woman and her son live-in secretariat position. The breathtaking about people being placed at home against their home will always make me a little harder - I will end up feeling very prisoner - but this is not the classy B-film lurid or claustrophobic. It is far apart and unlikely, but it's not uninteresting, and our heroine (Nina Foch) is quick on her feet. In 1986 it was not remade when it was rebuilt ("Dead of Winter"), because Plat-Elements were not a modern day. "Julia Ross" is very compact (very short 65 minutes!) But it's a little bit slower until the climax of a lot of fun. **** from
