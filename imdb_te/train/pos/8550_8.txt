Now I love American P1 and 2, but Sean William Scott's performance is as big as Stifler but after that the quality has fallen. Band Camp kept reasonably high standard with the characters you actually thought about but Naked Mile was the same joke and plot-recycled (Eric Stifler's sex issue is like Jim's). It's some fun moments like the football game against the midgets and the 'punishment' of Kojemen, but overall its originality and 'Mile' is just stupid and moronic. A friend who does not have a romance can not tell. <br /> <br /> Nothing is good about nail mile. I watched beta house, but I was pleasantly surprised when I thought the series would take a lot less. There is no real plot to be honest but with hot folks (Ashley is amazing) and sexy jokes are enormous. Yes it's formula and jokes old but Dwight Stiffler (Steve Tally) increases the bar with an exuberant performance. The Greek Olympiad is particularly entertaining by the late and last events, Christopher McDonald's Cameo is happy. Despite the weak points. Kojzin is frustrated because he is the first one, and I still resisted the way I got a piece. <br /> <br /> Eri Stifler was worse though Cowimann was bad. John White made a pain to see the naked mile but in the beta house he made his appearance less and less. For the first time he did not need Charisma, a Stifler. You can not care less about him. The only reason I worry about his relationship is because Ashley is on the screen! The rest of the cast was shining on him. Strongly John White's bad acting is the ultimate and deadly fish. <br /> <p> msgid "Kojajiman is afraid that the film will be very entertaining and his girl is not exactly a college. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is rented, get some of your colleagues and have a smile on the vomit-festivities and Eric 'beaten' Stiffler your anger.
