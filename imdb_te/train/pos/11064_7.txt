"I'm there" tells a man who loses his wife to another and finds a friend who does not have a blind date in a blind date. Unlike most romantic comedies, this little indie is of much importance on romance with much of Rogers and Shaddy's romantic moves. Very fun and some sort of road trip with some sharp moves, keeps moving, fresh, and worthy of indie lovers.
