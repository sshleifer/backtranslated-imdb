Let's Cut to Chase: If you're a baby-boomer, you've inevitably spends some time in 1976, the fact that McCartney was forced to drop the life of John's city monks and rumored to spend the day with him. Do you even think about how it happened. I heard the exact same statements from John's and Paul's perspective that the author of the film heard, and I agree that the film would be better reconstructed. But no one in my imagination could buy tears to my eyes. I have found a lifestyle that is perfectly perfect, and 100% saucer-free. How would someone explain why I did not hear this fairy tale before the CBC was shown last night? I mean for three years already for goodness! And yes, if you're a fan of Beatles, it's a must-see performance! Beatles's melodic paraphrase was also inspired.
