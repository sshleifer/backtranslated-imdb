I only saw all of Miyazaki's films, they are beautiful and attractive. But on the rest of them. <br /> <br /> I fell in love with pajas and sheets, their sweet and friendly friendship. They made cinema for me. However, the animation is also amazing and the music binds the feelings in the film. <br /> Now, let me make it clear: I'm really talking about the Japanese version of the film (Subs with English). The English dub is good (mostly), which compares with the original language version. Voices are good, dialogue, everything. That's why I suggest that the film is the first (and heard).
