What can I say, I grew up looking at Hum Saath Saat Hain, Hum Aapke Hain Kaun and Maine Pyar Kiya. Sorah is always different. Movies are part of our lives in evolutionary times. Love and loving and loving the joint family. Vivah is married to marriage and marries for a married couple. Shahid did a good job. Appendix is ​​always nice. Amrita Rao left me differently, though I felt that I was not in that role. We saw her in Ishq Vishk and Ab Q Baras, and Mein Ho on Me. So leave different character that she is not in. She is the most important part of my and Ishq Vishk, but she may be too small in her role. Whatever the great work there is. This movie will rebuild the forgotten values. Sweet year of the year. Great music and literature. I can not say it is a remake but anyway the hero of the hero. Sooraj films are all good. So we always expect him different from him. It's great for actors and everyone. Lovely Family Film to enjoy with your parents, siblings, friends and loved ones. I give 10 to 10.
