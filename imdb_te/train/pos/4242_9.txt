I read the book and saw the movie. Two amazing. In this era, the film is in diamonds. The Libman and Selby are dominated by the screen and the intensity of their characters is less erroneous. This film made them stars. The insulting thing in the studio is that they do not put things behind the film. It could easily be a franchise. DVD release and a valuable remake will restore this image. Look for it in your TV guide and see if it's on the list, no matter how delayed it is. Do not be disappointed. Do yourself another help - read the book (same name). It'll blow you away. In those days, the times have changed dramatically or at least we would like to think of ourselves.
