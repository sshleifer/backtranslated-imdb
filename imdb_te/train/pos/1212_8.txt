Care Bears Movie 2: A New Generation is not in all bad films. In fact, I like it a lot. Yes, I would agree with the dialogue of the wheat and the story was not right for some time. But DarkHart is too dark when the villain has enough shape to transmit, and Hadley has done a great job by telling him. Voice acting is great, it's nothing wrong. Animation colors, and initially some visuals are breathtaking. The songs and scores are beautiful, especially growing and ever-younger, the next two are my personal favorites. Care bears, I love, adored, and human children do well. And the end is a real tearjerker. All in all, harmless kiddie fun. 8/10 Bethany Cox
