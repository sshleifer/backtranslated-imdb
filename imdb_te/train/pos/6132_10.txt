I am glad that the users who love this movie (as of this date) are now coming forward. I do not understand people who do not like this movie - it seems like they are expecting treatment (serious!?!)! C'mon, how hell will you take seriously in a killer snowman premise? Filmmakers know this is a silly motion, and they did not try to reject it. The straight forward delivery of scenes actually makes it fun! Yes, there are times when low budget shows (such as a blast scene), but I will remove the expensive look from the movie's entertainment! If you like B-movies, and Goofy premise appeals, then you'll definitely like "Jack Frost".
