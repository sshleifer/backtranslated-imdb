Really, I liked it. The campus is good, the story that leaves the two series fits, here is my favorite part. Mary and Valerie are not bitter! They become synonymous to a particular sequence, refuse to talk about it or make possible combinations (a major example is Susan Day, "The Partridge Family"). In fact, Valerie said that she would be thrilled to make another film, and then Mary said the same thing, so I'll look for another ... But if it does not work much, they can do it again.
