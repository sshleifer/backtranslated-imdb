Space Camp is my favorite movie. It's a great story and inspires others. <br /> <br /> The performance was excellent and my wife and I went to see Lee Thompson in the later years of his career in the film. The Challenger accidental film is delayed and injured. <br /> <br /> The 20th anniversary of the Challenger accident is coming. Carnegie Mellon, who went to my father's school, knew about the Challenger Astronauts from childhood on campus. <br /> <br /> I have taught last year's technical review of the National BSA for Boy Scout Astronomy Merit Badge and I still taught a great image space relative merit badges for space sap. <br /> If I returned to the astronaut again and followed the schedule of engineering education we worked with when the Challenger was blown away. I sit with Wildrot Rockwell and his engineers and sit with "invisible" and the risk of accident at Stockrot Stockholders, so I am very close to the danger and the cinematic likeness. On the recommendation of the Rockwall Engineer, I was a good student and completed four years later, in 1986 when I chased the challenger and later did not build the endeavor.
