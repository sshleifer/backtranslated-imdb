The Lion King 1 1/2 is a very fun and addictive sequel. <br /> <br /> It is set to start seeing the original Lion King in Timon & Pumba Dark Theater. And suddenly the tracks change and begin to explain their own story. This often happens with humorous interruptions. For example, a home shopping trade pops during a certain period and a chagrined Pumba finds he's sitting on the remote. These little moments are pepper picture, and whether you entertain them or not well depends on your sense of humor. <br /> <br /> If you are harassing audiences through movies, if it is watching the film rather than your cup tea, they have invested in the Disney DTV line, and are almost collectively integrated into the original material. The newest, independent item uses a lot of artistic style of the original. <br /> <br /> The jokes in the film are widely recognized by many viewers. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the music and missed the good music merged with a Disney feature. The opening feature of removing the toe of 'dig a tunnel' is well choreographed and happy. If the Timon and Pumbaa Lion Kings take the opening scene, their introduction to the heavens is also fun. <br /> <br /> The story line is pretty well done, and newly unified, the return of "dig a tunnel" at the end of the film is the only problem. The final bit storyline during Hyena stretched a little bit of loyalty but the plot items are almost complete. This new story does not properly perform sakaryine or emotional movements, which is good when it comes to full comedy. <br /> <br /> Overall, the purchase value. If you like all the bonus features with a simple 2-disc set, go for it. For a penny pincher still ready to invest in a good image, wait for four or more dollars to fall and immediately rent it. <br /> Damien Crowley.
