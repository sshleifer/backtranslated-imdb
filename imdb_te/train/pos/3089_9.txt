Because I gave ABC license to this Pearl TV in Hong Kong, I hugged this way. It drew my surprise, as it was a break in listening to anything Chinese. But I started to get reeled in, as the cast and lines of stories just NYC enough and pay attention. Although Damien is writing a powerful black man with a sheet, it is very reliable, but I'm not very reliable! That's a very disappointing factor. The rest is great and I am sad to see in the IMDb I can not wait to see Season 2 when I return to the US. I am very disappointed as other commentators who showed promise and quality and taste. But when people show off the episodes that show close to the characters, it is obviously a little late for networks that are interesting.
