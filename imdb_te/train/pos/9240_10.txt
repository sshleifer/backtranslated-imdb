This video is available in a video store, which costs $ 2 to buy. The whole movie is really bad! If the cover, known as Connell, is credible, it must be in his eighties and it is very difficult to walk. However, he manages to shoot some dungstones in the world. Then the story should leave the colonel, giving the inability to mention the old man's worthless sense, one now two terrifyingly appearing in the Eighties, what kind of story should be. I was beaten a hundred times but the movie is very bad because it's a lot of fun to see. Zero-budget trash with actors is not deserving of that name. Check it out!
