I first saw Thief as a child, which makes it as old as I guess. As a child, I enjoyed the film's fiction, imagination and power. Several years later, I realized how much of the script's sarcasm and intelligence I missed at first sight. I have never given the opportunity to see it in the years I have intervened. In addition to the script, the product has passed the fantasy style. This is the best Korda, storyteller. You know that you have a great time when you find Thief as a child. When you see thiif grown up, you know that you've seen a fantastic story. This is timeless, because it's a story. <br /> <br /> Thomas McCarthy
