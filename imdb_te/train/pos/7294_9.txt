After reading many comments, I thought I should include in my two cents. "Lost Shobby" is one of the most memorable shorts I have ever seen. I had a chance to see the New York Independent Film Festival. I felt that this film was very beautiful and emotional. This story was pretty complicated - especially such a small amount. The story focuses on a young girl who was victim of her abusive father. She was immediately given a choice to "stop" a demon who played the role of "Witchblad's Eric Eatbree". I was very surprised to see the show, and he played such a distinct and different role. I never knew he could work well! His character was deeply complicated and he was very convinced. This performance is absolutely fantastic. The girl is okay and dad is good. This is the death of the girl as long as she escapes from her future. Effects and cinematography are completely dull. I wonder if they have at least a hundred thousand budgets for this. It is rare that you see such a high quality. The opening is absolutely breathtaking with any great feature film. It's not that it's not without its flaws - I took a little bit to get going and the intro was a little long. But after seeing this it stuck in my head days. There are very few shorts with this level of quality.
