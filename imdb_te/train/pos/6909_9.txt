<br /> <br /> The film has a slightly silly story, but it is a fantasy of everything, and on cast and acting scar! Dreyfus is full of actors / cheaters, complete with all the minor implications and vampires. <br /> <br /> It is one of the best characters of Dreyfus, as his role as a dead dictator in his role! And the segmentation scene: something like Casablanca, in fact! <br /> <br /> Ra√∫l Julia is amazing as a paramedic chief of the Secret Police. He gets some really funny lines, some of which are answers on other movies, "Round-Up Common Suspects!" <br /> <br /> Sonia is brilliant as Braga girl friend - Being a really hot number: "You have to get Oscar for tonight!" <br /> <br /> Sammy Davis Jr., Ike Papus, Dick Covett - Do not Forget Johnny Winters as CIA Agent and Most Guest Actors. All in all, a memorable romp under the Pandarian moon. <br /> <br />
