I started to lose my faith in recent films that have recently been released with Hollywood films. Story lines fail, and the camera work is just copied from the final image of the simplest taste. But I saw gentropa (Europa) and my faith was restored. The transcript is not just a storyline, but visually appealing color and black and white. Traveler (Max Von Sido) traveled every step of the way, and Europe surrounded you in 1945. We've all seen hundreds of thousands on the screen but the beauty of this film is how it takes you every slow moving moment that leads to death. Unlike many images, a second showing a knife does not cut later but will force you to see the devastating yet delicate beauty of a person's final moments. I think we can remove something different from this movie but it's precious to know what it really means. I love to talk more deeply to any person who wants to send me an email. Have fun!
