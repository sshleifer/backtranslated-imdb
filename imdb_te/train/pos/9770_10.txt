The film is good and I would like to rent it for those who own a local video store. Or, even better, you can buy it because you have the opportunity to see this and more. I remember watching this movie as a child and it was a great return. <br /> <br /> When I see you again after yesterday, I think it's awesome. <br /> <br /> The comedy's good compound is not as great as "Mr. Mango" - my favorite one) and action. This 10/10 deserves and I'm hoping they will soon make a sequel (fingers crossed). If you want to have a baby for kids or anything, I would recommend renting this movie.
