An amazing musical about an American painter living in Paris for an American inspiration in Paris. He admires his pictures on the street and meets a great woman and she believes that her work is more popular with people, e.g. Museum. Artist Jerry Mulligan has proposed Golden Globe Gene Kelly as perfect in both singing and dance. He also meets the main girl Lee Bouwier (Leslie Cuar√≥n), who is engaged to her best friend. He can not help this girl feel his feelings, even after learning that he is engaged to her. Nice romance and filled with wonderful song and dances, this is a very good musical film. It can pull a little bit with his dance dream sequence, which means American, but a very happy ending in Paris ballet. It won Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture, Scoring of a Musical Picture, Best Writing, Story and Screenplay and Best Picture and nominated for Vincent Minnelly and Best Director, Film Editing BAFTA as the best film from sources Et, and it Best Motion Picture - Musical / Comedy for a Golden Globe Award and Vincent milleni (Liza's father) was nominated for the best director.
