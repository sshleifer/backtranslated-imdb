This is a good movie. Not your typical war film, but a slight difference. This war has shown us to be trained before the war. This film is one of the more realistic views than other films, such as war and the army. Colin Farrell was an army candidate and Clifton Collins Jr. and Matthew Davis did a great job of playing a fairly good role. You never thought that Colin Farley might be moving from B grade to a grade in a few years. I also did a great job at Tiger Land Manufacturers film shooting in 2000 and add that it is a good touch making it look like the 1970s. It is good to see the cleverly used talent and see the same talent again in the near future.
