I disagree with anyone who can remove the film as "just" fun. Great Depression, Dancing, Fools In the early days of the unfortunate, twisted 20s set right, Dance is a heartfelt warning story with a clear message about how to deal with these hard times. <br /> <br /> In the 30s, Hollywood entertained an entertaining * and * luminous audience, without all the film fracking. Dance, Fools, Dancing - One of the four four films directed by Harry Beamont in 1931 - only 80 minutes, and its roles have grown up, its story has never been, and its many turns in the story. With the exception of Lester Werl, as Bob Townsend in allied love, the supporting cast is uniformly strong. <br /> <br /> William Bauquel Craftford's brother, Cliff Edwards (also known as Jimmy Cricket), reporter Bert Scranton, and Clark Gable, Gangster Jake Lova, The image of Jon Crawford, and she will shine. Even though she was 27 when she was 27 years old, this little version of Croftford was probably not known to anyone familiar with her next work. Nevertheless, long before the Oscar was taken home for Mildred Pierce, Crawford was a star in the true sense of the term, an attractive actress to take a picture of her. <br /> <br /> Score: TEN from EIGHT
