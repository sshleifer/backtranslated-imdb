Are the best screen version of Quo Vidis Miminx? Never done. Well, yes, the plot is not as strong and clear as in the book, sometimes loosing its suspense between appreciative and aesthetic subtleties. There is definitely an enigma and style of other versions - the R.Taylor and the new - from Poland, but the film is truly and pretty "strange". It is the air of the decline of Roman decline, the degrading paganness and the beauty of infant Christianity. At least I feel). Brandor, Forest and Ciudove made an excellent job of portraying their characters. The biggest success of Forest's Petronius cast (one of Brandon's finest actors) and the essence of this dying world (IMHO) wanders. That's it. The way it happened, guys ...))) IMHO
