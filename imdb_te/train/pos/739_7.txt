Since I was two children, I have been a Jody Foster fan since her Disney years. <br /> <br /> "The foxes" are such a huge departure for all. <br /> <br /> It is disguised as comedy ("Little darling", anyone?), in the frustrated and sorrowful story of the saddles, the power of the temptation and addiction They were killed by the charm. <br /> It's not Disney. It's not pork. This is not "Halo". It's a dark & ​​powerful story of the destruction of youthful lives. <br /> <br /> The film is still a daily basis across the country, with the film (with the current soundtrack) again and again. <br /> It's not the best film ever done, it's tired of a few episodes, not all performances are exclusively outstanding. <br /> <br /> But Jodi Foster continued to show his chaps as a real adult actor (her trend began when she was too young in a taxi driver). <br /> <br /> 7 of the 10 bar
