I've presented this film many times here in college, and the number of people that I see every time I see it increases ... I've already shown it to see it again, along with Virgins. It takes a little time to get out, but eventually throwing the whole room, shouting, sleeping, repeatedly performing scenes, repeating the conversation, and pia judo in "The Lonely Lady"! The most ineffective scene is the scene after the scene, poorly written, horrific Trash played my own propaganda topic (no short statement, friends) os Al-out attack, you will be thrown. For me, nothing compares 2 U, Pia ... and I suppose I'm not the only who feel this way ever!
