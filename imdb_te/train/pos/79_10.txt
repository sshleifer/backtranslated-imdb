I liked Real McCais (1957-1963). Lydia Reed has forgotten and decided not to be seen is very bad. She is awesome at the show. In fact, Walter Brennan is also the greatest Tony Martinez. I enjoyed it when he called Amos Senner Grumpa. I bought Season I on DVD and I can not wait to buy Seasons 2-6. In this way there are more shows on television, everything is fine. The show appeared briefly in the summer of 1999, but was later disappeared. Please send all the members of the cast of God and please, Llydia Reid, to make yourself known again to the people. You are loved and respected. Real MC Caise will survive forever.
