I had to catch this film on cable one afternoon. I'm never a big baseball fan, but I can get a good sports-related movie. I found more interesting is the depiction of the Foster family system. As a doctor who has seen both good and bad of community mental health and foster system, I refresh, rather than looking at the picture showing both the fluctuations and decrease of this system: family and family from family are always active interventions and do not take transitions like heart tissues and heart stroke . Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Danny Glover are the anchors of the film, and both provide incredible performances. Perhaps this might have been in my emotional state, but at the end of the film I will remove tears.
