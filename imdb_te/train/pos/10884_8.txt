The movie is much better than the movie. It killed the speculative-residential nut job spell, people are going to die, and this is some good positives in the film. I really like the nut job wore.it (though I have never watched every slasher movie I've ever) is sure to say at least the creepy mask to say at least and probably the only thing that is bad, because there is something I have not seen before, and he eventually he is finally a novel concept For the most part I know.i also really liked the job option by Mr sicko, for a lot of murders. The killings themselves are not graphic as much as the picture, but that little concern. This film is very bad, the movie is not serious, I remember early, "Friday 13 movies, they took a few shots about the movie, the killer is suddenly a bear that looks like one of our horror icons. And his reflexes were shot and killed, and he was also doing so If the big concern is, the scene is very close, where Mr. silly is more than another striking horror Titan's striking comparison (in reality). In the final scenes, we have our scandal again, another rip-off from another icon in the slasher style. Are weak and unreal (apparently). You have a chic for a chic with the Aussie tone (like me) The other great thing about this film is: Beautiful Kylie Minogue (not just adding to her) Molly Ringwald's courtesy Assy Assa has a courtesy, on the whole, there are not more reasons to see. And some fun. I should give cuts to 8/10 for some cuts.
