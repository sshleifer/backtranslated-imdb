A few days ago I bought this movie, I thought it was a pretty picture. But when I popped into the DVD-player, it surprised me in a very good way. James Balushi performed well as Bill "The Mouth" Manuki. But in particular Timothy Dalton plays a good role as a sheriff. The 'end' scene at the Bill's home is very spectacular, better camera work, good dialogue and very good acting. Bill "The Mouth" stole 12 million dollars from the Manchy Mafia. He lives with his wife in a South Carolina defense program. But the mafia will track him down, and wants 12 million dollars. Bill only believes that he is the only person who knows outside, himself.
