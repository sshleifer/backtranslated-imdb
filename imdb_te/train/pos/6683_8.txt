Forget depth of meaning, leave your logic at the door, and this maniacally funny, completely absurdist, ultra-campy live action "cartoon" is a great time. Mystery Men is the representative of the superhero movie you have seen, but its outstanding super-vanabale is very interesting, varied and well-cast, memorable characters in their own right. Dark comedy, clear plot, bonfire action, and a touching moment, or both, combine this comic fantasy with the true winners of these actors. The bass-basement Yoda, and the Geoffrey Rush, the wall (and exquisite lovely) villains will run on the pages of a dark horse comic book and come to the big screen, as a true foil for the performances of the comic strip - Laugh, get ready to get up and "huh?" Enjoy more than one time!
