Do you ever go to a movie? <br /> <br /> Schizophrenic is looking for an extravagant world with Harry Russo. <br /> <br /> Harry is a serious writer, killer and drug addicts, nothing can stop him from destroying those who stand between him and insanity. Driven by ghost voices of his ventriloquist blade rubberneck, Harry begins his killing spree. <br /> <br /> Ron Atkins is the first installment of the first fantastic stories to the director. <br /> <br /> The second part of I have similar similarities is Schizophrenhenic necromaniac. <br /> <br /> This is a very low budget movie and not for everybody, but if you're looking at something different and horrific, then this is a good choice. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about the modern day horror (such as the scream) <br /> <br /> The viewer is advised
