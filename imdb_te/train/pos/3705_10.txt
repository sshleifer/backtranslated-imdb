The film has a low 5.7 rating. It is a pleasure to people who love strong suspense plot and dark atmosphere. Tone is good and reminiscent of Midnight in the Evil Garden, Down Launcher (Savannah). Acting was strong, and I was amazed at the verisimilitude of Kenneth Branagh's southern accent. Former Jansen is the greatest, Robert Duval is an influential figure, and Embath Davidsz Bomb. <br /> <br /> The plot is fairly standard but effective.
