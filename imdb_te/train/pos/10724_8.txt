Saturday afternoon movies are good. It is on the right side with other retro flicks like navigator flight. With some delicate comedy a beautiful picture is easy to make things up. And it's fun to see how 20 years Kelly Preston and Lee Thompson changed the stars. <br /> I personally really like movies like this one from time to time. Not too deep or too scary. Just a nice story line. And when I was not known to Mr. Phoenix, I did not read the credits recently. <br /> <br /> Kelly Preston is also a very young junior actress. She and Lee did a fantastic job in the film. It's not an Oscar caliber image. But it's worth watching. Specifically, if you have children, say the age of 8 to 11 years old. Or interested in space program.
