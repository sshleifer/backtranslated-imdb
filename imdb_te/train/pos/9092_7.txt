The film adds to diversity and I think it's very accurate in terms of historical restructuring. It shows the various communities that are brewing in Thailand ... It's very interesting ... different groups organized by Portuguese, Japanese and kings. Plots around the court are routinely fighting for power with treason. Wardrobe is good. In Thailand, this film is also a product of reasonable production. The elephant scene is very interesting as executives. It's fun and I think it's used in schools for its historic accuracy, as there are many local residents in the traditional European Hollywood perspective in Asia.
