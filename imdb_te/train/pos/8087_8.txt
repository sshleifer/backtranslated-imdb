There are only two types of reviews for this film. Hate it and curse the name of Ralph Bakshis, love it and call it a melody work. I do not like to be in the middle. I agree with the criticisms of the film (eg, the ruthless cutting of the story, bad rutoscop caters, acting etc ...). But I still like this movie. Rotuscoping (when working properly) adds a strange lifestyle to the charters, and the end of the movie is a spectacular sight. Nineriders Chase Frodo is beautiful and well executed and musical score ... surreal scenes when magic. <br /> <br /> I'm going to hang out with all the people who are angry with the people who hate this movie. Review, well, such a life)
