California is a film about ideals lost. Travel ever on the dark road. No road back. This plot is a couple who find a better life in California. The man who's going to take pictures - who is a photographer - (David Duchovny now in his best role) wants to write a book about the famous crimes carried out in America and his girl. So they did not know that they were waiting for them in the way of leading murders. They find another couple to share travel expenses and put the statement. But that pair is not a couple. This is one of the earliest couples ever. The girl is very innocent and fragile creature who loves cactus. The man is exactly the opposite. The brutal ruthless killer. We will learn early in the film and we follow him when we go to California (with Kell, but with K, perhaps the word killer), his betrayal, murder and ultimately defeat. All Leeds, Duchovny, Pit, Louise and Forbes really want to give good performances and you should consider not even a star among them when this film is filmed. Photography is fantastic, with the darkest covers of the great parts of the film and the music fits the dark character of the film. Overall this is a good movie. Do not miss it. Before you take some stranger in your car to share the gas you have to think again!
