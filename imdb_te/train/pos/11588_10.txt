This film is great and I would like to buy it.The boy goes with his grandfather to catch a young eagle. The eagle is to feed the boy and feed it to the old enough to feed the crops. The boy saves eagle from the cruel and helps him feed him by catching a duck from scares up a small pond boy who flees from tribe. The eagle. The boy then shoots a deer that accused a bully boy because their arrows were very close to the same. Make sure they actually got the deer until they only check the thickness of the red lines. But it's unfortunate because others are even cruel to him, but he's finally going over a hill, but I think this film is a golden eagle that I'm losing my pure love for the eagle. I can not buy it for 30 years but I still remember the parts. If anyone knows Necklace as a reminder movie.deniselacey2000@yahoo.com
