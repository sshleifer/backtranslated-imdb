I liked this episode. It is so great that all 5 of them are team up and LutherCorp is so great to stop and save the world. I also loved this episode because Kyle Galner (Bart Allen / Implus) and Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen / Green Arrow) had a guest appearance! I hope Clark will join the Justice League and we will follow this group of leaders around the world! =) It's really exciting and keeps viewers interested in what's going on. I think Cloy also joins the group in The Watchtower, which is a chilling subject with her Daily Planet because she has no superior powers. Also, I wanted to know the types of things that were used for Lex 33.1, what am I wondering for other types of other people in the world !!!
