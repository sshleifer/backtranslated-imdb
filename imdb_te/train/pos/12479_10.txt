Uba City, Ce., Landing in the mermaid of Prince Edward Island in Canada (on November 8, 1993) and four days later (on November 12). From the "mermaid" is the inequality of helium balloon (roughly 4000 miles). This is a great movie. It is based on the true story. This film helps children to deal with losses, but older people as well. Hope everyone will enjoy !!! Rhonda
