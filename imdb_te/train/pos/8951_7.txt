It's a gentle, easy-to-go 1950 comedy. Kim Novak belongs to a coven of witches in Manhattan. Her neighbors get bored by Jimmy Stewart, eventually falling in love with her, losing her powers. Look, the witches prefer to have "hot blood" but do not love it. Elsa Launcher Novak Aunt, a witch. Jack Lemon is her brother, Ditto. Hermione Jingold is the main witch, and Ernie Kowkows, Sydney Redlich, a writer who specializes in writing about witches. <br /> <br /> I am described as a 1950s comedy. Everything is smooth and polished, from the set decoration, through wardrobe and plot, shows and direction. Take the role of Ernie Kovacs. He was referred to as "anxiety and a nut". And here's how this picture demonstrates this distinction. He asks for a second drink, and he always wears a jacket and tends to be like other adults, his hair is a bit long and tall. It is a drunk and certainly the 1950s version of the nut. Nothing. Everything is tidy and without dust. Soles of Jimmy Stewart's shoes are rarely scuffed. <br /> <br /> And the zodiac club where witches hang out. It is called "less dive". It is also a clean, dark place with soft waiters, musicians quintet, typically clad kelzel, and pocket brick pocket walls. It was not my idea or my own for the Greenwich Village in 1958. My idea to dive in Greenwich Village is Julius or The White Horse Tavern or The San Remo or The Swing Rendezvous, now unmatched Lesbian hangout. <br /> <br /> "I mean, Kim Novak walks around her apartment in her barefoots <br /> <br /> "It's a fun romantic comedy.

Her eyebrows are filmed with a set of plastic French curves. And Jimmy Stewart is very good as a confused and void victim. In the 1930s he played in the light roles in general. In the post-war years and in the 1950s he was a violent leader, but here he would keep his early experience with good humor. Who can not laugh when Hermione Gingold is strengthening him to concoct the scarf and scratching the scorching liquid to heal Novak's spell? He is in danger of becoming a person who is angry and angry. Richard Quine directs the film silently without fireworks or special effects, and makes some interesting things that do not have drama. <br /> <br /> Notice the scene of a spell on Novak Stewart, when the eyes of Novak's eyes and the Siam cat's face and ears merged. <br /> <br /> Ernie Kovacs is a popular television personality in the 1950s. Never before have the Ernie Coca Cola show - or later. This brings the word "surreal" to the word. He is able to prepare five minutes worthy and indescribable ideas in an empty room with orchestral background for Baroque's concert. And he made an indispensable sketch using the poet who played the role of Percy Dovetail. The credit types that are crossed over the Condolly Brothers, but these two guys - Peet and the Cante - jazz teams are great trumpets with independent careers. Conti is a member of Dock Severinson's band at Johnny Carson's Late Show. <br /> <br /> The third part is slightly reduced and becomes "romantic" rather than "comedy". But it is not disappointing. Rolls and kids alongside the whole movie Van Druten's play will probably also get a kick on it.
