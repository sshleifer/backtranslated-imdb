The film speaks universal language; One is related to self, community, society or the world. It does not open many questions, to establish the right questions and to ask one to ask for a custom of self-confidence / ownership. The usual depictions of the movie reflect the arcity around us, which are identified as the repetitive cycle of destruction, the opposite of creativity, creativity and growth. Issues that disrupt the natural flow of goods are clearly and correctly. Idea is definitely a film to be enjoyed and is not tapped to an internal voice / conscience by watching it, which makes it a feel free to just watch.
