Awesome film, The Next Best Picture of The Drunken Master (Jackie Chan). I recently bought it on the original VHS and I did not see this movie for 15 years but it's still as good as it returns. The performance is terrible and dubbing is the worst, but the film (and many other old-fashioned Chinese Kung Fu-Fu films) are great. Choreography is fantastic and the storyline is basically the same. I have never seen Shaolin's 36th chamber but it is the same movie but Gordon Liu plays San Tea but San Tee plays a different role in Threat Return to the 36th Chamber. It has a very funny value and clever kung-fu.
