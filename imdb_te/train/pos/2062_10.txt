First off I'll be the first to admit that Scrashko himself is over-the-top. A tough down aquropotic effigy down makes this film made of very little cheesy. But overall I feel one of the good B-movies. Tiffany Sheffice is absolutely amazing, it is absolutely amazing. Although the film has lost all the naked elements, there are many other movies to watch her. But here's where she's walking away from her dirty scarf and finally all the evils. Richard Elfman is doing a great job as a sheriff and a drunken male. Yes it's a low-budget B-movie. But from all of the ones I've seen, this is definitely one of my most favorite favorites.
