Some contributors mentioned the age difference between Stewart and Novak. She was 25 years old and was 50 when she was released. I think that the difference does not matter for the suspense drama like Vertigo, but it does not matter for a romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, we can easily understand why her character has attracted her, but it is clear that she is attracted to her. <br /> However, the film acts as a light romantic fantasy. Her dark paint-over eyebrows and the sounds of her humming and cat flower, the real magic is the sight of her on the head of the cat. This is a little jarring, so when the scene turns to the top of the Flatiron Building, the age difference is very fast. He combines her with her hair, fingers with her fingers, but stops the movement and brushes her fingernail lightly on her backpack.
