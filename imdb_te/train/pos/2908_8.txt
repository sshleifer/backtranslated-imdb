A Journey in Innovation The film follows the lives of a family living in the island town of sleeping in British Columbia. Satisfied and dreamy, residents are satisfied that a young, fresh face-to-face teacher, new ideas will come and allow them to go around life until it brings her life from the mainland. Slowly, for the excitement of their unprecedented state, father (and headmaster of the local school), mother for stability, the oldest daughter of love, and for young people for power. Even though the film is not a spectacular or sensational piece, it is good and enjoyable for the tired night when the air is dormant. Unfortunately, I suspect anyone outside of Canada can easily access it.
