This show is amazing. It has some of the best works I've seen. <br /> <br /> It is an excellent direction directed by Dvid Trainer, who directed another smart television series called BOY MEETS WORLD. <br /> This program is great. <br /> <br /> Two companies, Rosenne, and the famous COSBY have long been shown on television. <br /> <br /> These full masterpieces belong to the rich masterpieces, not the people who live in the seventies and the people. The show will hear young men and youngsters. Perfect presentation.
