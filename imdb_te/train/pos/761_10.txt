I'm one of the so-called classic hippo films, like Wild Style, Crushgrove, Breakin, Style Wars, etc ... Emo Beat Street is the best among others. When I ask others about their favors, it brings out the beat street. But still, it's the lowest point of all. 4.3 Just a punch "under the belt" (if specified, 5 points belt). I love the music performances, breakdancing makes me spin, makes RAMO will throw me a piece ... Simon, its a classic !!!
