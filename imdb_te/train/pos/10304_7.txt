"Bruce Almighty" appears and looks very foolish from the trailers. However, I have found a deep message that made me in this film. Bruce (Jim Carrey) is angry at God and is given godly authority by being God in a week to see if he can do a good job. Morgan Freeman has referred to a man as God, and it is good for him to work, even if it is not his usual kind of film or one of his best roles. Despite the crude, the film had so many laughs, Bruce painted half the ocean like half the ocean and the reaction of his customers, as well as Freeman's seemingly laid-back and renowned image. It is at times overly exaggerated, and some raw humor, but overall it is somewhat funny. Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter, and Steve Carrell have a good honor, which always helps. The ending of the film is proved to be very romantic and tear-jerking, and the message is clear, what God has to do and what we call it "miracle". <br /> <br /> ******************** ******************************************** ************************************************** ********************************************* **
