At first you think another Disney movie, it might be better, but it's a child's picture. But when you find it, you can not help but enjoy it. This film of all ages will love. I've seen this movie for the first time since I was 10 and now I'm 8 years old now! Danny Glover is amazing and could play no good part. Christopher Lloyd is happy and perfect for the episode. Tony Danza Mel Clark is as believable as. You can not help, but enjoy this picture! I give 10/10!
