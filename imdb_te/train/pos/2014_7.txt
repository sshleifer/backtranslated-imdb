Mel Torme and Victor Borg, at their younger age, use this film to be of interest - and especially looking for a young saint in a 30-minute sunny face, and it's his "Yes, I'm a famous singer, but rarely a actor and" stage. Michael Morgan has an unpleasant, unreasonable presence, and Jack Haley is always an actor. Leon Erroll is always crazy, but overall pretty funny. The potential of 10 out of 10 stars is about the correct "grade" because of the combination of its positive aspects and the lack of a lot of storytelling and a silly one and anticipated turbulence - an overall best overall. Their early years are fascinated by watching three fun signs.
