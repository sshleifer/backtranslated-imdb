The last film in Lucas's story is a luxurious, superb-looking product. It is often considered ugly duckling of the original trilogy, but I have a line on episode IV (and a line below parts III and V). In fact, I think it's the third best film in a 6-part saga. I'm worried, it's still a great entertaining film. It's not the beginning, the climax and the ending movie; The mechanism of this film maintains only one object in its mind: closing the universe of Lucas. There is a final paranormal combined with the whole thing, which makes the film more sophisticated, but emotionally rewarding. Also, it is very fun. New characters are introduced and old ones face new and unexpected challenges. C3PO and R2D2 provide (usually) great comic relief. Lia and Solo are a wonderful romantic duo, and Luke is still a great character to figure out. Again, it gives its underlying saga of the internal conflict of Luke (and Wader's). Lukas' furious fiction is still very clear, and echoes the fidelity of fidelity, hope and redemption. Since the film is a great book for a long, lovely and attractive saga, I finally enjoyed the idea of ​​Lucas making an episode VII, VIII and IX. Best Feature Film, but not the best Matinee style.
