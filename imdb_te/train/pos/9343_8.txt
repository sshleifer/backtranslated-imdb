I'm not a fan of Adam Sandler. In fact, I do not think I'll ever like him as I see him. The opening scene of the movie confirmed my worst fears. Adam Sandler played a somewhat ridiculous character, wandering around New York City on a motor scooter, as he was pitiful and lost. Again, I felt like a normal sandler-type defeat role. I've been there almost always. But I've found something I've never known before: Adam Sandler can work! Charlie, Charlie, was killed in one of the hijacked airplanes on 9/11 of his entire family (including the dog) and the result was virtually lost all the touch. Don Cheadle reunites his ex-college roommate with an unexpected Charlie and takes him as his mission to make him better. However, Alan Johnson of Cheadle has his own problems and resources of discontent, and somehow these two men help each other through their difficulties. Both of them were completely unreliable, and Sandler realized Charlie Real, especially with his emotions and feelings. This is not a Sandler comedy. If you're looking for your other, son, go to some things. This is a very beautiful picture - sometimes sad, sometimes promising and always engrossing. There are some funny episodes. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that Charlie persuades all his partners to face Alan, who is hard at college, and then has two conversations. <br /> <br /> Personally, I personally added to the film, such as Donna, the uncle of Burma's Johnson's apparently patient patient. The only reason for Charlie's last wife's appearance (based on a flashback) appeared, but it was not really developed and I was not overly impressed by the role. But look for the part of the judge, however, played by Donald Sutherland, I'm part of a bang actress. I'm concerned, though, it's the portrait of Sandler, and kudos to him for a great show. Definitely his best in my opinion. 8/10
