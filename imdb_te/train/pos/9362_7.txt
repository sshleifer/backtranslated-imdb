Thanks again from the darkness. How rare it is for the film to examine the lost soul of men in pain. Adam Sandler starred in Charlie 9/11 lamenting his family and lost his career, and refused to live with his intellect. <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle appears to have co-stars as a former Dental School Roommate of Sandler (formerly of Sandler 9/11). <br /> <br /> These parallels in the lives of men are obvious, but it is refreshing to see the man's feelings of appearance in a film ... Feelings of lust and revenge other than that. It is painful and heartfelt to see how they truly help one another. Writer / director Mike Binder ("The Upside of Anger", and Sandler's accountant in this film) really brings a different look and feel to the film. Some scenes do not work as well as others, but overall it is well written and strong. <br /> <br /> Sandler and Cheadle are both excellent. Sandler's role reminds him of a bit of his best performance in "Punch Drunk Love", but here he brings more depth. Cheadle is always good and is doing a good job of carrying the burden he takes ... by looking at him as a learner ... Jada Pinkett Smith (wife of Cheadle), Liv Tyler (a very patient psychiatrist), Kummara Burrows ( In an extraordinarily fascinating role), Donald Sutherland as a bored judge and Sandler's brother-in-law like Melinda Dillon and Robert Klein Malu. <br /> <br /> The tragic events of that day greatly affected a man. In addition to the interesting story and some great shots of NYC, you will love any film that includes singing from Chrissy Hynde, Bruce Springsteen and Roger Daltrey ... as well as Daltrey starring Eddie Wedder. Not exactly a chipper upbeat film, but it is a quality film with an unusual story.
