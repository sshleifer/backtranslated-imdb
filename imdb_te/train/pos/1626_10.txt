This film is actually funny! If you want your brain to rest for an hour then go ahead. Do not expect it so deep and meaningful jokes, that it is blonde and beautiful. The film is, we enjoy all the simplicity of the two blondes. It's a funny movie with a date or a company of friends (especially if you're not very smart) Pamela and Denis and pretty hot chicks. It is wrong to judge this picture of a piece of art. Simon, this film is about blues! It is considered light, funny and substrate. Another thing is, I do not feel like the girls appreciate and like this movie but definitely the guy.
