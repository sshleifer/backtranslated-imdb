Astronaut Steve West (Alex Rubber) and his colleagues perform a space mission that sees flying through Saturn circuits. His colleagues immediately die, but they seem to be lucky ones. The continuous muscles of the humanoid pulp fall back to Steve's ground; While he becomes a savage killer, he tracks every friend by Dr. Ted Nelson (Burberry Debenheim). <br /> <br /> It is often turbulent funny - it's hard for me to believe that laughs are all random - enough absurd lines and conditions to go around. It seems to me that the '50s and 60s are gypsy on low-budget genres, and this is a wonderful entertaining film. The scene with the nurse is just delightful. <br /> <br /> We're also treating the split screen sequence that does not really add anything, but it's still gas to watch. <br /> <br /> The writer / director William Sues deserves an upcoming credit with this ingenious idea; His ultra-slim character is actually a memorable one. I was a little bit of his motion; Some scenes (such as those with elderly couples) will last a long time, but eventually he presents a rich, schlocky, B-film. <br /> <br /> Arlton Oberger's music is enjoyable (yet silly even in a few days), and Willy Curtis's cinematography sometimes creates some great shots. <br /> <br /> I am bringing in the fascinating and persuasive decorative effects of Rick Bakers, the most venerable center for the film. (Sachs also gets my appreciation for playing the movie field) and he does well to do it. Debinning does not make for a rather oafish and silly hero, and Sweeney on his wife is not hot either, but it is best to support Myron Healey, Michael Allldrade, and Lisle Wilson. Catherine "Rainboys" Smith Janes Blighty ("Eaten Alive" by Tobey Hoopers and Wes Crewense's "The Hills Who Eyes"), and director Jonathan Demem <br /> <br /> It's enough entertaining midnight movie, Chili, and everywhere Laugh to estimate the value of low-level science fiction / horror lovers. <br /> 8/10
