This is not the best romantic comedy ever made, but it is definitely pretty nice and watchable. It is directed in an old shape and works fine. Cybill Shepard is not bad when she is bitten in her role as a woman who can not afford her husband's death. She has sexy maturity. I can not say much for Ryan O'Neill as Philip, because he's fine, in a shallow script. <br /> <br /> However, I have a feeling that some characters, especially Alex and Miranda, have written enough deep thought. We do not know who they are, because the story is thicker than a few minutes after they've appeared, and the writers can not tell us what is going on. Mary Stuart Maesterson has a fresh-one-daisy sweet to bright, and Robert Downey Jr. is very beautiful. His smile is also an infection. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this image is lighter and lighter and if you like it, why should you try it? <br /> <br />
