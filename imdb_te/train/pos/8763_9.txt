The film is cool and true. Often we say, "Oh no, it does not happen to me." But it is. Drug trafficking is a big money and often people do not realize that they do not work for smugglers. The story of the two girls is the story of many young people, the only exotic holiday they like - it became a nightmare. People need to know that such events are not improper or exaggerated - this is a big problem in today's society. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film because of the understanding that this mature audience really needs to be a priority. It is very emotional and raw. Well worth looking and stays in your memory perfectly.
