I had read the good things about this film and eventually got the chance to see it last night and it was everything I could expect and more.It should be the right horror movie. It's so realistic because it's scary. Spooky noisy sound is enough to create a dark mood. I liked the dramatic opening scene and enjoyed the rest of the movie. Unlike some movies, it's easy to see and understand that it's very complicated. It's very good.I love to see a lot of horror movies.It is one of my favorites. This real thunder and lightning storm has a good atmosphere for the film. All the stuff is a good horror movie. I recommend this song to anyone, and I would appreciate the good horror film that pulls any punches. I'll add to my collection. The DVD has some interesting special features.
