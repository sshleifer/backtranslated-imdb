I never shy away from telling that most action movies are just plain to me. Many times they blow up stuff, show sexy models, and throw out any comparison of reality or intelligence out of the window are stray vehicles. The Bourne series is amazing. Doug Limman gave a new look for action by using a more varied film Variety style, which demonstrates full-strength struggles and we can keep our super spy on ourselves mentally and humanly. This is not Bond science fiction absurd (before being short of the style of the series). When Bourne came to Supremacy, he was very worried. After taking the director Paul Greengrass, what could have happened if the original second hand copy was improved in style and skill. These wagers went up because the story grew. The latest installment is to give a green grass credit tonne so that the Bourne does not appear to be ultimatum. The amazing conclusion about an outstanding song trilogy is that action has brought a new level and the story and performance never compromised. <br /> Once again, Bourne has been mistaken for the CIA's minds. When someone left out about the treadstones upgrade called Blackbrayer and when he tried to talk to the storywriter who broke Bourne's story, he was considered Mole. Only Pamela Londi, she knows what she finds in Supremacy, knows that she is not one. Bourne's intention is always to be clear to the government and to live his life with peace. Puts the CIA back in order to drive him into slavery. Bourne ultimately wants to know the source, and eventually finds out who he is, and makes him a murderer. Hence the film is chased by source and one, and see if the government can close the loophole and close all the loose ends, or see if Bourne can take his revenge on those who have lived his life. br> <br /> <br /> The simplest storyline of the story is that the entire story continues to be full, but it is the story of the big characters, and the story of the story is full of faith to reveal the corruption behind. However, it is not very damaging, but it allows for greater combat and car work to complete the plot. Between Bourne and the second property of the CIA, the film is available for the Apartment Fight. Jumping chase through the windows in Madrid is cool, but when they meet up, you get ten minutes in the struggle to inspire you to see what scene you see. Also, rather than using a huge car chase like the first two movies, we have been faced with just three small-scale road jams instead. <br /> When we wait for five years, we also find out with the heart and feeling of our favorite worker. By the end of the film we will find out what is the cause of all the spying and destruction that takes place around him. No one is better than Matt Damon. He has the body and attitude to be believable in action scenes, but the intersection of that intelligence and cat and mouse distant moments against him. Joan Allen repeats her role in dedication to her role, but when Brian Cox's character took her from the first two films into her own hands a bit more frustrating to see what was going on around her. We need a character in that mold, we have made a good turn from David Stratier. Like Cox, no one is working on food security and answers when he makes a decision. He is trying to cover up any connections to his officers in the BlackBriar program when he is trying to do his duty in his country, and you can not properly understand what he can do. Even small people are doing a brilliant job as dairy consididine, a weekly leak in the center of everything, from Bourne's past as Albert Finney and possibly his source key, and Bourne as one of the CIA's activists sent by Edgar Ramirez. Ramirez is a good role for the role played by Clive Owen (Identity), Carl Urban and Martin Sisokas (Supremacy). He does not talk too much, but at all, but he will get more characters to show down the pat down and robotic capability and hopefully he can post a nice turn in Domino. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The end of the game is to applaud Paul Greengrass to rely on an expectation of expectations and bringing an end to the success of its predecessor win over this series. His expertise in the close-up hand-led hand is amazing and has the same kinetic power as Tony Scott, but without the most intractable-inspiring cuts. Unlike most productive feelings, his use of hand holding the environment increases and takes action straight away. Let the credit cinematographer Oliver Wood, who filmed three Bourne films. He worked with two directors and changed his style into a good harmony with them.
