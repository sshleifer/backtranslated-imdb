This documentary is absolutely fantastic by Marian Cooper. I have seen tonight on Turner Classic Movie Channel. I feel that I can order its copy on DVD. The movie footage is not all vague and unstable as you thought from the 1925 B & W silent film. Set in Iran in 1925, in the documentary the people of the nomadic tribe left their desert house, an aggressive river, men, women, children, animals ... Then all the barefoot pass on the snowy mountain. It sink or swim and climb or die. In search of grass for their animals. They have cows, goats, dogs, horses and muscles. In one scene, the man is carrying a very sick character to climb up the hill. Children in the documentary are happy and healthy. They have such a hard life. I wonder if Iran's nomadic tribes still live in this way. You can make modern life in the United States appreciate.
