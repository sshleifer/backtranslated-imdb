This film is a very funny and heartfelt story about an orphan found in financial trouble. When the director is on vacation, his father agrees to do things temporarily. <br /> <br /> It's best done by Leslie Nielsen. <br /> <br /> The little girl in this movie is very sweet and lovely, I know I can never forget her. . Make sure you do not miss the first five minutes of the film! <br /> <br /> Such great family entertainment is rare nowadays. If you go for a little brown pictures with happy conclusions, go for this! I can see this and over, and I often! My only complaint about this film is that it is very difficult to find a copy.
