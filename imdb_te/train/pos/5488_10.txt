At one point in the right place at the right time. What a lovely image. Let's see why Chavez is very popular with his people. He does things. He is available. And it's easy to see why the West hates him too. He controls his country's resources and returns the benefits to the people. Mostly poor. And how easy is it to portray misleading images to keep the TV stations out there. Just like the war in Iraq or the war on terror. Or that's missing WMD. Or how about the axis of evil. People need to wake up. And get different points of view. Neo Cons of the world. Watch this movie with open mind. And make your own mind up. Then I suggest you see Aaron Roose's: America: Freedom to Fascism. This is not the problem of the American people. This is the government.
