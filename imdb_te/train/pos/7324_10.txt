My personal favorite horror movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " All-Hallows-Eve 1978 escapes Michael Smith's Groove Secretariat. On the night of Halloween, Michael again came home to murder. <br /> <br /> This story is about killing Michael stalks and children. No bells or whistles, just the basics. This is a high power atmosphere of the carpenter's horror atmosphere that creates tension. As with any great horror film, these programs have long been outdated, yet they may still be coincidental, giving the audience a second chance to predict. <br /> <br /> I've created a lot of claustrophobic and uncomfortable scenes in the dark lighting, long stable-kong shots, and (especially) in that horror instrumental music. There is a body calculation, but this is much smaller compared to the slew of slashers later. It and many murders are almost bloodless. The fear is not death, but it is not known. <br /> Acting is good. PJ Souls offers a lot of humor (and one of the best deaths) films, Nancy Loomis changes a good performance and is at the time of the youth (Jamie Lee-Curtis). Her performance was initially shy and un-guaranteed, although she realizes that she is perfectly fit for her role, she is not shy and does not guarantee her and is ready to face her. And of course the perfect cast is determined by Donald Pleasures (perhaps a little more volatile). Sam Loomis. <br /> <br /> If the film has a malicious error, it is time passed. Several years ago, almost unquestionable clones, copies, rip-offs, and simulations have been stolen and stolen by the best bits of movies until almost all of them know about it since its release. <br /> <br /> In this day and age it should take into consideration something special to really appreciate. <br /> <br /> I do not have any reservation to look down on this film. , The time of horror. <br /> <br />
