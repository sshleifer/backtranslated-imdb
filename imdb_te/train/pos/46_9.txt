Just probably finished watching this movie for the 7th or 8th time, picked it up for a night to see the blockbuster in the past and totally loved it, so far I've shown it to 4 people and they enjoyed it as well. All Hollywood glamor, special effects and stress on the "shock factor" Paul F. Ryan hits the nail on the head dealing after this independent film influences the painful conditions. After high school shooting, two characters Alicia (Busy Phillips) and Denny (Erika Christensen) form an unlikely relationship. Alicia, a girl with a rocky heart, Dinah helps her to overcome the problems of life, death and death that have a pessimistic attitude to Goth's life. Meanwhile, Denny tries to see the softness and light of the world in helping Alicia. It does not emphasize the shocking incident of shooting, but the film is separate from the relationship between individuals. Despite the low budget and short filming time, the film is away from cheesy. Ryan respects the situation he can never afford and tries to bring it into the human mind. The incredible up and coming actress, Phillips, adds the overall drama for the overall amount of dramatics and dialog, and Christensen's "Doom and Darkness" balance will help. Overall, I recommend this film and the subject of school aggression and torture and more about it, the documentary "It Is a Girls World" by CBC in 2004, which deals with social threats, Montreal, Quebec, and Victoria , British Columbia, a group of other friends and 14-year-old Don Marie Velesley The two groups of girls, one worse than the one who killed her, horrified, and then compare and contrast.
