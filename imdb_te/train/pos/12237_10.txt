Ming is a beautiful, wonderful image from an era that went through the game. Hollywood should consider a lovely remake of this film. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful romantic comedy film I've seen in my wife and AMC. <br /> <br /> The film is fine for Tony Randall. Debbie Reynolds is as great as ever. <br /> Dear it. <br /> <br /> Very bad Hollywood has not made these images anymore. <br /> Hey Hollywood .... Take this old scripts out of the old safe and bit them (you do not scatter the original movie and script with other reconstructions) and the casting call. <br /> <br /> A remake of silver is a big hit on DVD, and cable / sattv. <br /> SN Austin, TX
