You really can really see a fertile intellectual that the use of symbolic use, form compilation, the position of the characters in the scenes ... are all used by the happiest Hitchcock. When the wedding ring is put on her finger, the wife moves from one corner of the ring to the other, and when the wedding is ringing on the ring ... today's scene can be clearly seen in the quiet silent era of the volumes about the story. The title also has four meanings that I can see; Buying a boxing ring, bridal ring, girlfriend lover, and love triangle at the heart of the story.
