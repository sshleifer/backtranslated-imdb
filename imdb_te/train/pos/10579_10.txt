The powerful young producer of theatrical prolongs (the exhibition performances, usually musically, continues to feature films that are often featured in large films) will have to face twisted competition, fraudulent partners, loyal lovers and enthusiastic talent. <br /> <br /> When the other Warner concerts, especially close to the GOLDDIGGER movies, the film has a special appeal: Jimmy Cognney. He is a fantastically, loose-jointed and lively, agile like no catcat - a creature that mimics a few times during the film actually. Cognie has attracted viewers from the audience and never went out, had fast-fire conversations and his charisma and light charm. <br /> The rest of the cast is their best. Joan Blondell, Cogné (the main point - why she did not give a musical number?) Is perfectly hypocritical, smart-minded, big-minded blonde secretary. Dick Powell & Ruby Keeler once again loved the stage & off; The fact that her singing & acting abilities are replaced by her dancing with a bit of lean side; <br /> <br /> Guy Kibi and Hugh Herbert's mother-in-law are planning to cheat Cognni in two ways. Ruth Donnelly scores Kibyey's wealthy wife, a woman dedicated to her beautiful protege. Frank McHugh's malicious choreographer is an appropriate foil for Cogné's intelligence. Herman Bing is happy with a small scene in a small concert. <br /> <br /> Mavens' music numbers include Billy Barti, Jimmy Callin & John Garfield. Finally, Busby Berkeley, choreographer Naparelli. His techcracious interactions throughout the 1930s cinematic spells of cinematic esppisis that the Depression viewers would enjoy. The big joke about Berkley creations, of course, is that they are part of the plot, platform structures. But the theater does not have these products of these masters imagination. <br /> <br /> Berkeley's musical offerings usually tell one of two different ways, one story (often strange) songs and dances; Otherwise, it features amazing geometric design numbers, eye candy, abundant chorus girls, overhead camerawork & a romantic tune. In a spase of Outré Uber, FOOTLIGHT PARADE CLIMAX with three birkie masterworks: `Honeymoon Hotel 'and its pre-production code telling the couple's wedding night; 'Through a Waterfall' - Dozens of unclad females, splashing, floating & diving in perfect designs & patterns (close peer & you will see how the effects can simultaneously be achieved); Finally, `Shanghai Lil '- a tribute to both Cagni & Berkley talent.
