This film is intelligent. That is, far more than most other movies, it's beyond the most common denominator - stupid people probably do not appreciate it. The story also relies on conversation. <br /> <br /> The sunrise is very bright, somewhat abstract, and very nice. <br /> <br /> The script, characters and even slightly surreal atmosphere feel completely realistic. Actors are playing brilliantly. <br /> <br /> This dialogue leads to personal problems, and there is a risk to be slightly above it. Although it is a bit frustrating and awkward at times, it is almost at all times right. Still on this narrow song, demands outrageous talented actors. Sometimes, it gives great results, and the whole picture is just gorgeous! Only rarely is "love" in films that I believe is reliable and realistic. Every time you achieve, the result is amazing. I think the spectacular and obviously timeless beauty of the female lead actress has helped a bit in this regard. <br /> <br /> In this film, she is still 12 years later. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this movie. One of the best movies I have seen since the 1990s!
