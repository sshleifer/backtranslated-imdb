Chuck Davis and Emphie's attention: Many years ago I saw the Phantom Lady, when I was not jazz buff. The performance of Paris's brand new MUSEE DU Quay Brilli ended in june until the end of June, while the LE SIECLE DU did not receive a jazz name, with a special entertainment non-jazz from jazz films including the famous drums of the Phantom Lady. Einza Cook Jr. - and Elisha Cook Jr. - I have seen almost all of the films and I can verify the following: 1. Elisha Cook Jr. This is some progress and most of his other performances have been murdered (mainly Howard Hawks's The Big Sleep). 2. Corruption is probably dubbed cook in PL. I was able to recognize his style since he used (and misuse) from Tommy Tom, who used early in his career at Singing, Singh and Sin Sequence in Hollywood Hot in 1937. Call in French "La Size Claire". 3. The sequence from PL, as shown in the museum at least, is not the sensor. Harry Carlosso, Paris, France
