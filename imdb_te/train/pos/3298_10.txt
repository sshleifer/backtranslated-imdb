It's definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen - it has everything - a genuinely touching screenplay, fine actors who see a gorgeous art, a realistic elegant romance (that kind of romance just does not appear anymore), lovely songs and lyrics (especially the last song) Artistic score, and clothes and sets that you want to live with them. The conclusion was only disappointing that I was expecting a fantastic picture that had an incredible ending - but it still looks fantastic in amazing movies out there. Check this movie correctly - over and over again. You will miss the first time to give a second look.
