I do not know what people complain. I saw this film yesterday and I really liked it. Stone has once again played a great role. She's good at her first basic instinct. She still has those smart but tricky answers. Although Sharon was 48 years old ... she looks amazing! I do not care if she is a dummy like a Barbie. She looks good. Basic Instinct 2 gives you everything you need from scratch. Sex, violence, and a great ending you are thinking and leave talking about it for hours! Half of the people who commented on this film did not see it. So do not listen to them.
