When I came, I was very happy with this kid, and I still do this today. A simple story that has a search for literally straight paperback lower for a kidnapped girl and a adventurer. It has more recognizable back actors in the day. This should not give the viewer a whirlpool. Wayne Crawford starred as Jake Speed, the lead character. Certainly, it can be cropped from some of the raw materials of the Stone, and Indiana Jones. But this room is better suited to keep from cellar. I am surprised that most people do not know about it. It should have been covered in other films in '86 again. I looked back on cable TV. This can be difficult because it does not print both on VHS and DVD. I got a DVD from eBay at less than 8 bucks! Cool Flick.
