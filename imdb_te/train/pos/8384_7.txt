I read somewhere (which is in the most panning review) I think this is a live-action meta and I think they are in the right path. I first saw this film at a very young age and I'm dying to see again, and finally I finally flooded all memories. I do not think I should take it too hard - it's a good old 80's almost-a-TV-movie fun (it's set against a backdrop of a very dark future, but this point is not very emphasized). No cliche, no predictable lines - all just good fun - what I liked about this film is that the dialogue is a simple sound! Perhaps this little film has no time, but still I can get the appreciation for it. It's not meant to be accurate, but it's fun and does not try anything other than that. Let's worry about nerds and comic-shop-guys technicalities - who cares? See it for yourself and make your own decision. There is nothing else that matters.
