If you follow a book written in the 50th century in the 90s, the bloody set of 50s is not set in the 90s. Look, the roots and values ​​of the 40-year-old can not play as well, or the real ring, that down the road too. This is a simple rule that violates the Hollywood habit. There is a problem with this image. It should have been set in the era of writing. You do not think it's a no brainer, but nooo. I feel elaborate, but the bmacv comment is very good. I will limit my comment to Rachel Ward. She has eaten her full-grown donkey. As a result, she looks like a crack hoop on chemotherapy and is sexy as gay gate leather suck in the drag. I felt her "ever dead", it is rarely seen, and it is far from the film intended to create "hotness" and "sexual tension" from her. Besides, this movie is very good. A 10+ from 10.
