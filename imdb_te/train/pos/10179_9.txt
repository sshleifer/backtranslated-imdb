De Groot is a very good movie. The great storyline comes from the novel by Tim Craub, who brought this story up. Some of the top-class performances by TV-worked prior to the performance of Axel van de Griff, notably by Van Hut, particularly Marcel Hensema. The film is a thriller and a wonderful mood. Then we start to learn about Igon Wagter and Axel von de Grape, the story reveals bit by bit in a very compelling flash-back structure, which adds more romantic and character to the role of the character. In the end all of this ends up with an emotional ending, which will grab the audience through their throats. Be aware of the plot as little as you can see this movie. Especially if you like 'Spurlos' (The Original Screen Adaptation of Vanishing).
