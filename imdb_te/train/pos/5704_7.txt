I think the car will be in the car. There is really only one, but rather, 'Freeway' is a great movie which I'm happy to own on DVD. Homesides Richard Beller is the only big-name advertiser-coating freeway killer, such as radio psychiatrist and B-movie villain par-excellence Billy Drago. But the rest of the cast generally gives good performances. I especially liked how Darlanne Fugel gave her role, Sunny, a bit of guts. She was a helpless victim, but she was completely rounded with the help of draco bullet hunter James Russo. <br /> <br /> Russia, I'm afraid, plays again, again, Frank has given his former Commanding Officer of Sunny not very well fleshed to save for a back story. The spectacular way to keep his length in his horrific gray sedan is a fairly tone of the LA Freeway's film and atmosphere, which is perfectly composed at night with a killer of music used to film the film. I do not know why some people hate this movie. Different strokes for different folks, I suppose. But I enjoyed the 'freeway' and I strongly recommend it.
