I love the big epic pictures - I'll name you - sometimes it's nice to leave some beers and a simple action flick. Images where plot sets will take a backseat. The dialogue is a very intelligent film that claims to be in the infinite knots of purse. <br /> <br /> Hundreds of films pertaining to the bill ... but one of the best sixty seconds in my opinion. <br /> The update of the image that it shares its name. It shares the film's culture, but it is not in operation. What's great about the original is streamlined. The streamlaid is what thanks to the big budget. Often these kinds of attempts have a recipe for a complete disaster - see the cutting of the pug-ugly remake of the Italian job - but thanks to an actor in one of the greatest actors, sixty tracks. There is not much to write about dialogue and conversation too much about IMDb. Often the conversations go back and forth between the same kind of dialogue actors, each of which plays differently. Many have found this to be offensive; I'm raising a smile. Case, Jolie and Duval Each item gets an opportunity to showcase his style of course (and it is fun to see Mrs. Pitt's first billing is given). Good Ol 'St. Nick chemistry, Staliwart (see review date) and Angelina leads to good couples. <br /> <br /> The villain is not even a little scary - I think Chris Ecclesto is so tough-guy characters that I know he can handle them, but I think he's directed to make his character irrelevant that he was deliberately not far from the action. We know that leaders will succeed. We sit in the car with them and enjoy the ride. Most of these scenes are numbered, which is on the heads of people who are poorly rated. In fact, I can not think of the fourth wall breaking wings at the camera: it's just that kind of image. <br /> <br /> This style and a lot of stuff - my patience is often not just * therefore * implemented - it does not work if it does not take action. And for the most part, it is. That's amazing. I have seen that the use of fast-cut intimate shots for live activities these days is a general trend. I personally find this kind of thing tired. Ramping prefers movies like this where ramps are impressive enough stunts do not need artificial tension by raping all the time. Cage actually told several car stunts and it shows as I figure out he's missing out on his life (without realizing that in his life - I miss him in real life). <br /> <br /> A man can truly move a vehicle and make a good use of the climate in which he is slowly burning, where he is the most extreme - the film is an "epic, life-custodial post 9/11 film mandatory social commentary" not. This pace is uneven, some scenes may be slashed and all the actors do not. But car films rarely come better than this. <br /> <br /> I would take several days of sleep on "The Flaccid and the Treedies" (estimating the franchise). 7/10
