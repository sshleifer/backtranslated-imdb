The film is in my collection for a while, but not before I remember a friend about it? I decided to see it. I do not know much about being close to Leo? It is supposed to be an age old film and is it a very serious topic ?? AIDS. <br /> Despite being a helper? What is Leo? Marcel (Leo's younger brother) revolves around his cousin's ill-fated path. At first everyone is trying to hide the truth from Marcel ?? Do you believe he is too young to understand his brother's illness? Leo is a homosexual, helping her with the parent's dislike to discuss this topic with Mother Marcel. I have been experiencing a lot of times because I have a lot of experience agreeing that sometimes too many older people can not take the thing themselves and can not take action in a more appropriate manner. Although the family tried to hide the truth from Marcel, they impressed me a lot. How can they support their son? Even after learning about the truth about his sexuality and his illness. Is it really a great deal for them to allow young Marcel to travel to Paris to travel with Leo to meet her boyfriend? I know that many families are reluctant to do so. Is there a lot of warmth in the sights that the brothers spend some time together? You can see them as real friends and everyone concerned. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
