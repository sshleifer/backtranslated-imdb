I love the satan pit !!! David Tennant is a great actor and Billy Piper! Someone throws the pieces to throw pieces ??? He is very beautiful, is not he? I told him he hated the bits that the devil had and said he was going to "go hell", as he rose to obscure. Mr. Jefferson was so brave, he was not to die, he was really sorry for Toby (Will Thorpe) because he was very worried when he came out of the second time when he came out of possession I say, "Oh my God I'm so scared for him if I rose". Grrrrr when she hugged him like Ryu, he's mine! Hands off! "But I thought it was really sweet. And the doctor .... Well, I thought he was gonna say to Ida "Tell Rose I love her" but he was not. Oh! Good.
