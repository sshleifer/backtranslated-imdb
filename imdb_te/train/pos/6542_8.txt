Despite having a target audience, I always had a soft place for YA Fiction, so Nancy Drew retreated back to backstage. <br /> This is not a bad image. The central mystery involving a long dead actress is presented in simple general terms with dashes for competitions for young spy. <br /> <br /> Nancy and her friends do not take seriously threats, so young audiences will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Emma Roberts is as good as Nancy Drew and hopefully, I'm very appreciative of the story, and the ultimate results are very serious and meaningful. I'll see again in another mystery.
