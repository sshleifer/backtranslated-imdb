I want to comment the series as a great effort. The storyline is especially season 1, although some improvements are required. However Season 2 became more of a leaked show and lost the original attraction of the DA. Season is an interesting season towards life in Jam Pony, however, with a serious plot with Mt. I'm looking forward to new seasons, in fact I'm still. I hope FOX guys and DA product staff ppl still wait to make a comeback waiting for DA. After 2 years of canceling, the DA can be bigger if it works properly, and I want to take this challenge as James Cameron.
