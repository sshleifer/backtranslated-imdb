This event has a great ending. The fact that Adm was able to make a double switch in Javier Borg was great. The fact that she allowed her to be infected, so that the Queen was infected with "poison", the essence and boreg. The way they ended up is not too much for a reunion image. However, they brought them "home" and was as amazing as they did !! It is sad to say a part of my family is a good buy. When they enter the Alpha Quad, they end up with their baby, Tom and Bilan. A great way to show a new start. It would be nice to have some characters reunion film - see where their characters are.
