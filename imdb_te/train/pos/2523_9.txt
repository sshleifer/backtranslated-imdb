When I first heard about the Moon Child, it was a joke. A few months later, I thought for the truth. <br /> When I give a chance to see, I have to groan, vince, and if not closed. <br /> I'm a little bit more surprised, and in a good way. <br /> <br /> Yes, Moon Child cheese, Camp, Common dorkiness - I think it's kind of impossible to avoid when that Guy Camui has a man who does not know for his integrity - but all in all, it is totally enjoyable. The work of the movie genius but it's very hearty, fun, fun choreography, touching score and fun. I'm not very judicious in the Japanese cinema, but I can not really judge the acting, but the cast speaks in a language or in another language, and one of them has an acting experience. <br /> <br /> You have a good action movie, a good play, a If you can enjoy good comedy, watch this movie. Rent at least until it comes to the region. <br /> <br /> On one hand note, there is zero homosexuality / homorotid content in this film. I do not see too many subjects. Do not allow people who have read more of these things for you.
