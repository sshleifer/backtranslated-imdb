This is really a movie 'heartfelt'. It won the George Poebid Award and you can tell about the essence of the film, which has won over "Roots". How I ordered this film before my father-in-law Eugene Logan died a few years ago as a co-writer of this film, so I could not get information from him. I love his unique grand daughters, my daughters, to watch this movie, and to send this amazing story to his great granddaughters. By the way I was televised, my eldest daughter was seven years old and I was looking forward to seeing it again. One of my friends said that she is her favorite movie. I can not 'ruin this picture' for you.
