I always saw a huge fan of "Homeside: Life on the Street", so there was a reunion movie, I could not wait. <br /> I'm not saying, disappointment at all. It's one of the most powerful 2 hours of television I've ever seen. It was great to see everyone again, but all the biggest happiness came back to Andrei Bugar, because the relationship between Pembleton and Bayliss was always a strong part of the great show.
