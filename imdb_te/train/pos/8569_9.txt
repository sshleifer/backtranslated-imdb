It's as good as the 101 if not better. Cruel, however, stole the show with his outrageous behavior and costume, and the film was probably made, because people wanted to see more of a cruel character. We'll see a lot of time this time. I also like the Ion Gurfood Kevin. The climax of the film is to use Paris as a brilliant idea. It is good to see what your age is, and you love animals.
