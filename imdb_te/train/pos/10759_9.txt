You always remember the work you are doing to the disaster or tragedy attacks. <br /> <br /> September 11, 2001, the date the entire world changed the fight against terrorism. <br /> <br /> Instead, the filmmakers, brothers Gideon and Jules Nouvettes set out to make a documentary on the attempts and hardships of a rookie New York firefighter, instead of the events leading up to this documentary 9. They went to the academy and fired some of the training, and they chose NY for their "Proby" (Probation Fireplace) to live in the firehouse, featuring Ladder 1 and Engine 7. The World Trace Center is believed to be the only aircraft slamming the first plane. <br /> <br /> I traveled with a friend on the train from the night of LAN gaming, 850pm local time from my father, who informed me above. A few minutes later, I knew one another and WTC was attacked. By the time I was home, the upper floors of the twin towers were burning, smoke, and in one hour in my horror they collapsed. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers had two cameras running on the day, who followed the band on a regular call, and soon after the WTC heard a plane crash and saw it immediately. We follow the only painted sequence of events happening in WTC1's lobby, where firefighters, paramedics and police are aware of what happened and quickly plan the action plan. The other camera, run by another brother, went to WTC to look after his siblings, and on the go, captured many expressions of New Yorkers, as well as the feeling of confusion in Manhattan and around. </ Br> <br /> There are many interviews with Peppered Ladder 1 and Men from the documentary 7 throughout the documentary, which is surprisingly, there is no danger. However, the survivors brought about their own mental confusion. <br /> <br /> "In the sense of the collapse of steel structures, the lives of men who work around the clock to the right of the rescue phase alive It's not a fictitious movie, but what you see here is not restored in any other documentary (and no sound steps for the skies and Hollywood blockbusters). Code 1 DVD consists of a special extra bell of 4 sets of interviews with Ladder 1 and Men 7 of Engine 7.
