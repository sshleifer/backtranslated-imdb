I was born in 1982. My childhood memories are in the late 80s and 90s. <br /> <br /> When I was 19, I saw the Grove Tube in 2001 for the first time. <br /> I'm happy. <br /> <br /> "After 30 years it's a lot of fun ... Think again! If you have no thought of 70s, the idea of ​​Bel-Bottom Pants can make you worry." Who's arguing with a Bojo Clown type of adult literature? At the end of the scrotal puppet show is the best.
