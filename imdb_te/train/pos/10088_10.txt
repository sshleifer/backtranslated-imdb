Elephant Walk (1954) Peter Finnch starred in the role of a Peter Finch in the neglected garden of some people at the time when the danger of elephants or mad English humans was always in the afternoon and drowning. In the end, they eventually die after typhoid or cholera spread, of course, and most may be depressed. In this pot boiler / adventure film, Taylor is replaced by a sick Vivienne League. When elephants storm home and trap lizes on grand stairs I still get goose lumps. Thanks Dana Andrews is around to save the day. My favorite flawed pleasure is one. Even in color!
