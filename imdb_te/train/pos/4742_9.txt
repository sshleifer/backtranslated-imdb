The film went further than these entire Hollywood films. The film is directed by Tui Hark and Jet Li. The band brought you several Hong Kong film productions, including the one in China series, Once Upon a Time. This action is fast and angry with excellent wire work. I saw only two wires in shots. Unlike action, the story is not even used to be strong and complete. To find any other action pictures to your opponent you must find the Hong Kong movie outlet in your area. They are really worth checking and are generally disappointing.
