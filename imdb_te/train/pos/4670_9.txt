Only those who recall the late Sir Sir Peter Ustinov like Hermauley Poirot or a professional raconteur would be better for them to wish for this lovely piece of the last '60s satire. Ustinov emerges from a computer expert and an American multinational intrusion (through an ingenious piece of unrecognized theft) poses, sensing that in future computers (as we first see him during his last day of gail where he is preparing the tax governor's tax returns), posing as a convicted embezzler . <br /> <br /> Ustinov (scripted co-autor) is in the best form, Maggie Smith is a delightful, -Parro Dolly bird. Bob Newhart, also a suspicious executive expert on maggie smith, also participated in the amusing performance. Moreover, Carita Malden is satisfied as Ustinov and owner of Newhart's owner. <br /> <br /> What do I especially like on this film? It's not a well thought-out 'caper film', but it's an impressive little love story. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> There are also small plot glitches that you can not notice until the second or third view, but I think these are small naggis. <br /> As I said, the value you met is fine, and you want to see it again at regular intervals once you see it.
