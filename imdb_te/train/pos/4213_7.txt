Director Samuel Fuller concocts a spectacular visual set up: confidently pickpocket is unaware of some thumbnail from a woman's purse; She becomes a courier for Communists, now she and the white police are watching. The Film Noir Formula has all the fame - the materials have been clich√©s, including waterfront bases, floozies, saxophones in soundtrack and a hell of climactic fistfight. Performances are perfectly targeted by Richard Widmark and Jean Peters, and the smart, sharp script is very colorful. Fabulous Thelma Ritter received an Oscar nomination for a knock-out support role as a "professional stool". Stunning as exciting, weather, nails. **** from
