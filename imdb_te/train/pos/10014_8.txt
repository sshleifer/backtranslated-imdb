Robert Williams is a New York City radio host, a 14-year-old boy (Rory Culkin) is very ill with his friendship with illness. Williams did not personally meet the person because they were only touching on the telephone. However, Williams' former boyfriend (a good job from Bobby Canawale) increases doubt about the boy, and Williams asks for a meeting with him. After this he has a permanent impact on Williams. I will leave that. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> Sandra played as a friend of William Williams. The Night Listener is inspired by real events, and throughout it, there is almost a creepy silence. Sometimes it is imaginable, I do not thank the few reviews I read before watching the movie and the logic was just due, but I liked it anyway. I like Williams in these roles, such an extra bonus than his comic strips. Recommended. 8/10
