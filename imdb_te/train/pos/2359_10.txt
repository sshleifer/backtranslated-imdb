I think if you ask whether their JW's are they expect to heal a miracle of their faith, you will find they are not. I do not know. Instead of what you will find is that they believe in the promises made by Christ resurrected. So, even if you remain honest, even if we live up to our integrity, Jehovah can correct it. <br /> This really comes down to a simple question: is this all just to believe? If he is true and believes in him, you will follow his instructions in the shortest possible result. <br /> <br /> I had a year and a half ago heart attack. One of my family was terrified when I saw the words "NO Blood" written with my letters in my chart. If I have only a blood transfusion to be able to save my life, I am arguing with her that it can only give me life when the time comes for me to have a good time. She did not come - God is not true to her. Very bad. I would like to have a strong belief in her.
