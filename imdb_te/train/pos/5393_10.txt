There are some Australians who do not see tennis while broadcasting this series. William McInness is the first time I see it, it's a bad movie actor. But the series continued and he reduced his performance and I totally loved him. He was a rotten man but he made me laugh. I saw this program to see Hugo Spears (Heart and Bones, Full Monty) and Tom Long (Seung, Two Hands). It is interesting to see a nice silent man with the Spears and see more interesting to see Tom Longs' rippling muscles! Sigh ... seriously, Long's performance is a whole shock and really brilliant. He stole the show. Martin Sacks was a good character in a small role, and the main actress was an entertaining performance. I'd recommend this program if you enjoy stories with a twist and walk around with the shirt on Tom Long ...
