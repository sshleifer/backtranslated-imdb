Ah, Domino is actually fresh breath of the air, new to the cinema world. I enjoyed a lot of movies due to the complex film, variety of characters and serious camera effects. I've made some complaints about the camera work and, in fact, according to the creators, elegant and wild shots have all the ending of the mistakes made by the time. Everything you see has a good effect. Although it is different, some people have never done this before, perhaps because they can complain. In a deeper point, what you see is that Damono sees things through his eyes, think about it. <br /> When it comes to story I do not see much bad about it. Although it is a "violent" nature, according to some, it is a fast form of storytelling. The plot is really not that difficult to follow, if you really focus on what you really want. Acting, Plot, etc. I saw movies because it's not for me because I've chosen a different film than "commentary" or movies, which comes to me. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine how different characters and characters are. If I happen to cast their characters effectively in the cast as they cast, it will make a movie ladies and gentlemen. The characters are all very special and one plus you get them to witness each other a little piece of their lives, separating them further. In fact, I personally loved the cast and the characters. <br /> <br /> Those who bash and burn this image probably will not see it, or they do not like it. Well, it's a great movie in its own film, no, it's a great movie period.
