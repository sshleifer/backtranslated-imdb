<br /> <br /> If you are open minded for choosing Barber Shop, you will like this Canadian film. <br /> If your mind is closed like Fort Knox, <br /> <br /> It is a movie that is ready to watch movies from outside their own race. It is alive, you lose connections between the scenes in two or three cases, but several times, especially at the end, you have one or both of your eyes, and this is very often because I like and exceeds the traditional American movie I would recommend anyone to be open minded.
