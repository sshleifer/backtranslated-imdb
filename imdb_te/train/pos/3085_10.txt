I'm very sad that I've seen the on-air episodes online and the show will not come back. It is the best actors of mature, talented actors and excellent chemistry. All actors seem to be personal friends in real life. In the end, the show has become attractive, sexy and highly viewable. In fact, some of the heroines are not realistic, so what ... the characters love everything and you are the source of them. The show reminded me another cross between two favorite: "Sex and the City" and "Felicity". A big fan of all cast. Note to ABC executives: Nielsen ratings reports do not show you the real results. Performance spectators are most likely to record. Reality TV or teens-based performances made us very disappointed with major networks for flooding. Why do we have to switch to HBO or FX, from time to time, to get things done carefully and well? I only thank the network for keeping the rest of it in the other parts. New stream media is becoming more popular among viewers.
