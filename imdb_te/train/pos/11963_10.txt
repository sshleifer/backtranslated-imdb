"Scoops" is Woody Allen's funniest movie of the 2000s. Although Allen is finally looking at his age, the low-brow magician is on the top of his game as Sydney Waterman. He is a liner and happy in his attitude. Do not change your opinion of critics. "Scoop" is a top-lyric "Woody-Lite" film. <br /> <br /> The classical music scores excellent performance for action on the screen. Scarlett Johansson is beautiful in that bathtub. Jackman is agile. Cinematography is glowing. There is excellent escapist fare from start to finish "scoop". The final shot of the film alone is the admission price.
