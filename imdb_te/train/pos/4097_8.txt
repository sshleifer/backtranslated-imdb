Youth, Sexuality and French Rural - is one of the only unique paintings you'll ever see. If you can see it, it's not hard to find its copies (a combination of shortage and censorship). It is sometimes romantic, sometimes frustrating and occasionally fun. Even in the middle a boring item is boring, but you can not call yourself a viewer of the bizarre image as you see at least once.
