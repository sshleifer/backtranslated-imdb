The most striking, spiritually modest picture about the restoration of the Gospel. It is better than any other movie, or so has been filmed about the restoration. If you do not see it, hop on an airplane on the salt lake and see it now. You do not worry! First of all, you must fight with the holy ones, realizing that you have absolute confidence in the prophet Joseph Smith. At any time, you have always discerned about the struggles of the prophet and the persecution that he and his people have suffered. If you have any questions about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and our humble beginnings are just watching this movie, this is done after the whole and the whole concept.
