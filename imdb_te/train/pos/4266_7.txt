The first half of this half was seen in a small community village on black and white TV and it was considered to be happy. Now, after a second time, after much, I did not see it as happy. I can not be happy anymore. <br /> <br /> This is a move that has become a 4F that falls to 1945 and Fred McMarley to enter into an armed force. He rubbed a lamp in managing in Scrappard and a gene will grant him some wishes. (Ho ham, right? Though the introduction is quite okay, fantasies are pretty shy.) He wants the Macmere gene to be in the army. Pooh, and he is dressed in a warm and inviting USO, along with the Washington Soldiers, June Hawthorn and Jon Leslie Lois Dolallis, or wearing a lot of lavender wigs. Washington sends Washington for spying on the enemy - red coating, German-speaking heiens, not brits. The Hessians are impressed into a Bierstube and are singing songs of Vitalland's voices with the most amusing drinking song, "White Wine Vineer / and Rainwater's Rainer / and Brightworth Melawers / and Yellow Hair Yawlower / and Frauleins jucier / and goose steps are goosier." Something like that. The characters are the best of Sig Romero's, are great. Otto Primer was suspicious and bad Hessian General. "You know, Hedelberg, Wei are against 241 to 1 - but we are not afraid." <br /> <br /> I can not go with these fantasies for a long time, but they are a lot of fun and literature. Mack Marie falls down to Columbus as he wants to be in the Navy, and is shown as a fantasy grand opera. "Do you not know if you are a wealthy Westwait Sailing West / Dehrapi? / And give you / Isabella, Queen's Queen." When someone sees the new world, anyone thinks it looks great. <br /> <br /> I do not think it's "thick to Columbia", but that place is called Columbusland. <br /> <br /> While the genome at this time is very drunk, and in the Marine Corps, Merryn Corps has the right girl in the wind. <br /> <br /> I made it a very beautiful sound but it was beautiful. The kids will enjoy the smoke puffs and magic and the love story of sprouting. Unlike college graduates, adults get a kick from the more challenging elements of the story (who are Hessians?) In which they stick with Leggerdine and "Wow Awesome!"
