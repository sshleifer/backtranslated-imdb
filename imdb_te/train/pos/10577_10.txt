In fact you can not always go into the theater and you will see the types of sets you find in this movie. From that perspective it's totally fantasy. But who cares? This film with Citizen Kane, Battle Ship Pomericin and other films is absolutely right to tell us that you want to see it. Such films are worth hundreds of people. The film is fine: great camera work, great settings and great presentations. <br /> <br /> At the end of the three wonderful scenes are probably best <br /> <br /> I gladly see this film again and again.
