After enjoying this show over the years, I can see them again and share it with my grandchildren. I pay a small amount of memories recorded on DVD. Florida is a lovely housewife, a loving mother and a beautiful daughter and two sons who are different from day and night. Michael, a son of a baby is a free walker and a clown of JJ. I know that most Afro-Americans do not like this show, but I know many people, and that's what it says. My heart was sad when I realized that I was passing by Ester Roel. Tyler Perry is now a prominent actor and I have supported his work, but he made Rolle's brutish mockery of one of his plays. Nobody should hear any unpleasant things about the physical form. The show was less interested when Daddy James died. It grabbed a few times when Florida married, but declined when she was out of the show. In all, the presentation is great and I'm happy to have copies of my last part again. I try to keep the former stars of good times, and they say, they are a band, they are not wiped out with rumors. I do not have any problem today with today's children enjoying this show and sitting and sitting with the kids. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Recently I noticed that I have reviewed the series, but they do not like it. I feel that Florida is a bit tough when it comes to children. Children do not need supervision, but Florida's mothering has been done in a way that makes it different. I'm now struggling to talk about what other people do not know about Florida. While James was alive, James demonstrated much of his own fix-shop, but he could not see his families out of projects, but Florida married a man who had a solution. An actor who finished his time in Good Times showed a small skinned face in his face that he had performed. Finally, when I look at the shows, I'm going to the series overtime and naming "JJ". To be honest, James J.J. Not a bad thing, just a noticeable thing. I can not do my DVD's business for any money, but time, maturation and experience have begun to guide your eyes shortly after.
