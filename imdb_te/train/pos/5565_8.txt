I went back to C-C's fan of their records and liked the film, but in the mid-1980s, San Jose was broadcasting with an alternative plot line at one of the cable televisions in California. All references to cannabis have been replaced with "diamonds". "Red" drops to the chong, instead of marijuana instead of diamonds, but the conversation is still the same ("... it is $ ~ 3000 / lb value"). There is also a subplot speaking to each other about diamonds, observing C & C's clips of the aliens in the ship. And finally, instead of "space coke", it's something. I do not know who created this version, but it's terrible and clear that it's trying to make family / child friendly. That's fine if the network does not broadcast everything.
