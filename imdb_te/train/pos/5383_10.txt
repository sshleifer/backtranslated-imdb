I was good at this movie, and newcomers to Curin and Sean business. It was acting and filled with a little love, but there were some points when Corr√©an did not talk too clear (she was a gun when she was scared with Sean) and she opened her teeth tightly ... Maybe she wanted to do it? The roles of Joseph and Sony are well shot, and are in sharp contrast.Also, I see the next action star, I've done well with their own stunts by Corrayne and Sean. They are looking forward to another movie, they're a big band or a sequel to make your life bite, maybe a big apple, this time it's about Carmen .. Your life is amazing!
