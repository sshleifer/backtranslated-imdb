This film is good, and it is unpleasant; But I can not see it twice: I became a Peter Cushing Compliant, so I saw it. The best property of the film: Bewitie and EffectiveWence. Compared to other similar images, each of the four (plus one) segments never excludes its feet, ultimately less than 10 minutes. In the first section, the writer who suffers from the "writer's block" goes to the solitary old home seeking to stimulate. He sees very much when he starts to think of one of his fictional madmen. Plot Contract Like Primer Bury. The good use of the point-of-view twist: the writer is mentally ill ... or (as in the end shows) his trophy wife wants his lover to run his owners safely to drive his employers madly. <br /> <br /> In the second segment, friends who have lost a long time are together in the same solitary old house and can not help to visit a bizarre horror. The museum, which has a wax statue of long-lost love for their youth, once separated them. <br /> <br /> Do you recognize a dead murderer from the Gothic museum keeper who killed a woman ... or she? <br /> The third part is less interesting to me. <br /> <br /> A horror film actor in fourth shows - he feels the best of low budget movies. Seeking a garment to give more fidelity to his fictional Vampire, he gets the real deal. This section does not have the fitness of the first two. <br /> <br /> Acting is fair, with 2 early divisions contributing to it. Good picture, taken a grain of salt. Not the best cushioning, or lei ... but worth looking at.
