"Red Rock West" is one of the most beautiful 90s suspense thrillers (by John and Rick Doll) all over you and the edge of your seat is unpredictable for the movie. It was directed by John Doll and was not featured in such a spectacular cast as Nicholas Cage, Dennis Hopper, Laura Flynn Boyle and especially J. T. Walsh (in a memorable performance), which did not miss a single escape and attractive thriller. The film's release does not have many promotions (actually I was originally caught on TV) and that is why you would prefer one of these specialty gems, but this particular film slowly gained a cult. </ P> <p> <br /> When Nicolas Cage finds himself in a small town on the Red Rock, Michael Williams is broken. Wrong for a contract killer from Dallas, Lyle is surprised that he has paid $ 10,000 to murder the wife of bar owner Wayne Brown (Wonderful J. T. Walsh). He runs alongside Plan and warns Brown's wife Suzanne (Laura Flynn Boyle), but the plot is thick and there are many turns, turns and surprise - and double dealings - Cage has been out of trouble and he is in a terrible state Can not pull out! Only then becomes more complicated to kill the real loyal deal (to be played by everyone's favorite Dennis Hopper). <br /> <br /> Hopper finds out what happens, he goes after the cage but does not give up on the surprising moments that no one can follow. "I hate to see an innocent woman hurt but it's an awful lot of money" <br /> <br /> Boil (up to the cage): Nicholas Cage (Boil to Lara Flynn) "You're going to get out of here because I'm going to town, but you're out of town." <br /> <br /> Boil (Michael) To the cage): "ok how are you <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do I go to explain 10,000 dollars from my husband? <br /> <br /> Anyone who plays the role of J. T. Walsh, O.K. In my book and "Red Rock West" is one of his best. How sad it was in 1998 that this extraordinary actor was tragically cut short by a heart attack. The most beautiful period for "Film Noir" is forty and nothing but "Red Rock West" is a good modern example of the genre and has entered my "Top Ten" list of favorite movies from time to time. I'm looking forward to more from director John Doll. 10/10. <br /> Clive Roberts
