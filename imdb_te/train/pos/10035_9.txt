This is my second review of my movies because I think James Cameron wants to become my favorite director. Anyway, everyone remembers the RMS Titanic. It's big, fast, and "unsinkable" ... until April 1912. This is one of the news and biggest tragedies. Well James Cameron decided to make it a movie but the star instead of two fictional characters to stay in the spotlight. <br /> <br /> In the main review, let's remind you that this is all the opinions and zero facts and the only event that comes from the movie. <br /> <br /> Our two main characters are Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). They are not too annoying but watch this and you will find why they can be annoying (http://tinyurl.com/ojhoyn). The main villain I expect is the misfortune, destiny, the hand of God (no blasphemy is intended) or just plain coledon holey (billy jane). Combine all of the above and what do you get ?! That's yes! The sinking boat is in love story. My personal favorite is Mr. Andrews (Viktor Garber) (idk he is very good), Lovejoy (David Warner), Murdoch (Ivan Stewart), Laitler (Jonathan Phillips), Captain Smith (Bernard Hill), Molly Brown (Kathy Bates), and more. We've also received treasure hunter, Braque Love (Bill Paxton) today. They added some story and something good. The action here is particularly good in the second half, the drama is also good. In the end you can have your eyes wet or silent tears. The story is easy and it works. A treasure hunter seeks the heart of the ocean and finds a drawing of a woman wearing a diamond instead. She has opened fire and tells her story in the RMS Titanic. Two lovers are social class and finally, the fate of the ship is separated. Everything about the story has very little errors. 86% of the Titanium gave me a miracle
