The film was first released in 1969 at the Camo Theater in South Beach, now known as the famous Coburn Bar Club. It's the past year of the wild 60's and this film really hit home. It has everything; The controversy between life gap, sexual revolution, quest for success, and "traditions" of the family of those who look for their own ways of life. <br /> It's a fast, most enjoyable movie. Vegas has it at the Hippest Peak, Sin City all in it's fame. Beautiful women, celebrities, smiles, conflicts, love, and even a happy ending. It's a great time for everyone. <br /> <br /> The movie poster is on my bedroom wall. I'm looking and I'm back; My time in my youth and my father is a great time in my life.
