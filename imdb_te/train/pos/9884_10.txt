Radeigh is a wonderful TV western series. Trail Drewovers Band focused on the band by bass gill shaving. Many episodes - especially the first 3 seasons of the reality of Fawar and his human being. The guest stars have come, but they rarely dominate the episodes they have seen, not just like the wagon train. Ravid is the real, confused Western and Gil Fewer is a memorable character unforgettable. The show was a huge success for Eric Fleming's performance. Clint Eastwood, Sheb Woolley, Paul Bringer, Steve Raina, James Murdoch, Rocky Shahan, Robert Cabal - he was completely justified by the outstanding cast of good actors. All these actors abandoned their mark in an episode of television history. Rahid seized any fragrance of the west, and I did not have any other series yet, however, to do so. Later seasons lets divide Leeds and give them personal story lines. It did not work for me some time - offering cattle drive and regular best stories. But there are still some classic stories and there is a jumping uphill rider. Black and white photography added realistic feeling that other Western sequels rarely compiled. Rasterers, Indians, Kammancharos, Distresses, cute damsells, serial killers, they come to give us our heroes problems. The series finally came quiet when the final season was less than halfway. The reason - Eric Fleming has departed and Rahid is now headlessly with a body - the sand realism has gone, Gill Pewar has been honored and exuded to power - he has never been mistaken and it made him more interesting. We can not see him again. Whenever you can see the episode, they are rarely disappointed.
