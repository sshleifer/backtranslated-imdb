I really enjoyed watching "Fird Worms" - after some real stinkers (racing strips, shark boy and lava girl) were forced to sit by. For once, I did not expect the end! It's funny and entertaining and despite the title, does not resort to a ton of gross-out humor. My boys (6 and 10) both liked it - oh and my 45-year-old "boy" got a smile whole time on his face. This is a non-family image for parents. The relationship with the little brother is close to real life. "He will stop singing to hurt me !!" Similarly, the new boy tries to make friends and that the friendships actually create are the right way to behave. Parents of course had little goofy acts - but my favorite scenes were involved in the Dad used his new job. Have fun!
