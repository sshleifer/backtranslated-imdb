Deathtrap gives you a twist at every turn, in fact, its biggest problem is that there are too many turns you can not actually get the movie based, and they often do not make any sense, but you wonder if they are usually caught. Except for the fact that it has too many turns, it is very good. Screenplay is great with great dialogue and characters, but you can not get all the twists. Performances by Cain are particularly spectacular. Directing is good, directed by Sydney Lumet. Visual effects are affordable, but more often drama and drama. Twists are way too much, but still works and worth watching.
