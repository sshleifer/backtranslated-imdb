I first saw this film in the Mid Day film spot in 1980. <br /> Yes, it's a custom of another age - a domestic comedy in wealthy middle class America - but well executed well executed. But the document of its age - postwar optimism, infant boom and new age consumer ages. <br /> <br /> Three amazing trends lead actors - Urban Melvin Douglas; Kami Grant <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes - "We are a blast" and "Miss Stewwagen" and "this little piggy". <br /> Love it.
