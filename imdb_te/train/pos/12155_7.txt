I saw a few years ago on local TV and saw it, and I removed the tape. However, when it was released for the most affordable price of Curtis Harrington / Shelley Winders' double-featured DVD's "Midnight Movie" Deep-Featured DVD by MGM, to print). In fact, I received a DVD a few months ago, but only now, with Harrington's passing I did not get it; Fortunately, I am more interested in the film and are you actually a child of WHATVER now being one of the most satisfying? <br /> <br /> The film's 1930s Depression offers America's spectacular sponsorship - a news reel opening with its child-actor fad and sensational murder (exploited during fake); It was made beautifully (the cinematography of Luge Ballard's cinematography and the grandeur of designs set by Eugene Lourse) and an effective David Rockin score. Shelley Winters, Debbie Reynolds and Michael McIliamor are superb performances; More and more vulnerable than the next life is impressive as a bad digging coach (he finally proved red herring!). <br /> <br /> Dennis Weaver and Agnes Moorehead (Her role is only a character, the evangelist who actually plays the role in the radio). <br /> Many children seem to be sorry to include musical numbers (including an entertaining May West simulation), but I do not care for them personally; The film is a bit more miserable due to a characteristic speed and (perhaps uninterrupted) twisted plot. Reynolds - a musical actor - is ideally a dance-school owner, and despite their on-set rivalry, she and Winters work closely together. In fact, WHOVER SLEW gives a more balanced depiction of schizophrenia and madness than the AUNTIE route? (1971); The story comes with the number of contradictory turns leading to the expected grand gwinol-type detection. Producer Martin Ronsoff - against Harrington's wishes - this film to get a PG rating (it's actually more gore and the advice of the lebble!
