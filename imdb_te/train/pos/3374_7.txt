"Soyland Green" is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction films of the 70s and is still very persuasive by today's standards. False and short by the time, the apocalyptic touch and ecological campus (typical at the time) are still not very undisturbed and thought-provoking. The quality of the film has surpassed the contemporary SF flick because of its strong cast and some serious sequences that I seriously consider classics. The New York population of 2022 was disappointed to be alive with the poor, unemployment, unhealthy environment and the overall shortage of every significant food product. The only available form is distributed by synthetic and soyland company. Charleston Heston plays a police role investigating the killing of Soyland's most prominent executives and he slips on scandals and dark secrets ... the script is a big surprise at times and does not really come to a climax, yet the atmosphere is long and unusual is. The Aller-Scene is really one of the most gruesome moments in the 70's film. Edward G. Robinson finally impressed in his last role and had a great (but very modest) supporting role for Joseph Cotton ("Baron's Blood", "The Abominable Doctor Fibes"). Science fiction in my book: A nightmare for humanity and the inevitable fade! Fancy space ships with hairy monsters attacking our planet.
