A great picture, really challenging than really entertaining. Unfortunately, there are no memorable quotations here, but this is my favorite: Alexander: If you love someone you like, I'll tell you what I will say to you now: "Farewell, I'm going." But to be a criminal, to disappear, to disappear. (It does not see with English subtitles) <br /> In my opinion, it expresses everything. There are so many ties between Alexander and others, and everyone is waiting for a little more truth. However, as Alexander experiences, knowing more of the truth becomes worse. The general feature is that the film criticizes the "redemptive love" by describing unwanted effects on people who have just criticized. This is not true but it shows in a contractual manner, but if the causes are slightly deeper treated I can appreciate it: This is not a loss of carefree love affair but people (especially men, I think) <br /> <br /> This film is realistic and really looking good.
