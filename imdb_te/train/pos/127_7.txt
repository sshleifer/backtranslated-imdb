The Zentrappa Third Man is common with the image of another Nair in post-war European rocks. As with TTM, there is a very creative camera work. <br /> <br /> There are two children, a third-person, well-made storyline. The jentropro is a bit confusing in this regard. Perhaps it's deliberate: it was a dream / nightmare and it damaged the most intuitive effect. <br /> <br /> The film is relentless - "noir" in more than one angle; The sun shines. Grim, but secret, and scary.
