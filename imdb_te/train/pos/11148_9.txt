'Midnight Cowboy' was rated X in its original release in 1969. There are some scenes that you can understand a little. Joe Buck (Jon Votlite) is sometimes a little worried about moving from Texas to New York City to become a hustler. Dressing as a cowboy he tries to live as a hustler, earning money through action. He does not work according to plan. After a man named Rico 'Rosso' Rijo (Dustin Hoffman) pulled him a trick and converted some money into friends. They live in an empty and very dirty apartment. Retso is ill and Zoe tries to make some money. <br /> <br /> The film may possibly predict X as the main thing, but some strange things to see. The editing of the film is good. The scenes from Joe and Rarroso we interrupted in a nice and sometimes funny way in the real world. Dustin Hoffman, Jon Voit and assistant actors are performing great performances. Hoffman, in particular, offers some very good lines. The score is John Barry and sounds great. This good movie makes this great movie to win the best movie Oscar.
