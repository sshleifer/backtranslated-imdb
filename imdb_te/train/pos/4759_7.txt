The Nifty little episode is mainly laughed, but with intelligent dolls of suspense. Something a Martin has somewhere snuck on a broken-down bus on its way somewhere, but it's passenger, (talk about your illegal immigrants!). Jack Hoyt (the most obvious suspect, if she is Martian, then I'll open the borders!), Jack-grassy jackle (rarely hamming)), John Archer and Barney Phillips (and a good turn from Bond Driver Bill Kends) There are such faces. The action is only limited to one set and makes it entertaining for half an hour.
