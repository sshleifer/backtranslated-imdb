Deathtrap runs as a drama in a movie, who primarily reached a set, who made it. Annex is a dancer, starring, receiving a wonderful manuscript from a former student, so he plans to plan his plan for his wife's unmatched protests and his game. Or you think, for the first half of the film. Before half-way, death begins to rotate the door and astonishments, revolves its campus on its head, and then right around, and then in a mad spin, the title is adequate. This is a fantastic mystery movie drowned in intellect. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine plays his role as a senior playwright in this film. There are no surprises here - he's doing his usual good work. He has received the best range of Detroit, which he fully accomplishes: "Your definition of success is the gang-raising of a state fatherhood?" <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeve, on the other hand, cheated comedy and drama in a surprisingly strong performance playing a prestigious (and mentally) young playwright. He also tries to show his body sound, coming out of Superman movies. Noyes Off - One of my favorite comedies Cain and Reeve collaborated with another movie. It revolves around drama at the same time, but during this time Kain is director and Reeve is an actor. They were joined by comedian veterans Carol Burnett, John Ritter, Marie Hanner (Taxi) and Mark Linn-Baker (Perfect Strangers). Together, they perform a drama's bed-hopping cast and crew's hazards. On the surface, the film looks more like a slapstick, but looking at them, they find that they have very little jokes. This underestimated picture is available on DVD.
