I enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> It is a pleasure to see a version that is very close to the scenery of Peter O'Donnell. <br /> <br /> Many people do not like this movie, but it has to be seen in the source story. The film uses a flashback to show the young Modesty and the events she impressed on her. Before the network. Before Willie Garvin. <br /> <br /> This pace is slow, and there is not enough tension in the present scenes for my taste. <br /> <br /> If you like modesty blues, you will experience mistakes along with it. <br /> <br /> It has the first experience in the franchise, but as I have never seen it, I suspect that I do not have to follow. Sin.
