When I was in the video store I browsed through a dollar rent and got on this little gem. I do not know about it but I have gut instinct about it and I'm always right. <br /> <br /> This story is a story around the two girls who survived a school shooting. One of the girls is Aliceia, a teenager who is a witness to the full assault, and another dead man's head trapped outside the head. Throwing together by fate, they start slow and painful therapy and movements. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Wow! Because Bassy Phillips and the rest of the actors did not tell the rest of the actors by Erkya Christensen! My only complaint is that the DVD lacks special features. Oh and some of the jump cuts in the picture are some kind of jarring. But all in a stunning image.
