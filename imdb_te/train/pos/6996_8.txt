This film is a great film that influences all of us. I know I've personally implemented this many times. Thanks to the goodness of Smith Smith text messaging is jumped on the social issue. People, do not do that. There is not enough time for an hour and forty five minutes for this reason. Personally, I wanted to remove my cell phone after the movie. Other people in the theater enjoyed seeing the message and dumped their phones with popcorn's empty bags. I decided to discontinue all text messages on my phone and encourage others to do the same. If you do not care about your family, you can see this important public service statement on text messages or kill seven people while driving. Thank you for showing us the way.
