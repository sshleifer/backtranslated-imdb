I saw the Insomniac Nightmare a long time ago and I say, I really realized that it was very good. If you're a fan of Dominique Monaghan, you like it. The hole image takes place inside his mind - or is it? Acting from everyone else is a little bit faster and shaky and may reduce some scenes but ultimately works. The extra things on the DVD are so great in the film, that the Dam is not as big as the fans. It has tons of moments from the set and is a great interview with the director. Anyone who has gone through a standalone movie would love to see Tess (director), Dome and everyone try to bang out this little trippy creepy movie that is quite close to the individual close. It's pretty enjoyable and I'm happy with my collection.
