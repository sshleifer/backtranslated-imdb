Until the sixth and final episode of Star Wars Saga, which ended in 2005, I saw the 1983 Entry as my favorite feature film for a long time. <br /> <br /> It has become a particularly captivating film with different action sequences and really different characters (Jabba the Hut, Furry Woodland Animals). <br /> <br /> Another good feature is the scenario in the film, with some scenes changing the ships into space ships on the space ships, switching between Las Skywalker and Darth Wader to a personal laser-dual war. There were no two in the fight between the two actors earlier. There is an unpleasant stance between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Finally, everyone's on the same page! <br /> Finally, this is just a fantastic adventure story.
