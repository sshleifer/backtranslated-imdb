Well, I saw the film as a kid and it really liked it. My parents never bought me for a movie, but I think I'll go and buy it now. I'm a sucker for 2000 animated films before. <br /> I would like: The real role of heaven and hell is one of the few I've seen in animated films. Character development exists It's easy to classify characters in the film (ie: Charlie Swadha Math, Itchi Sipkam, but Charlie believes, Corfu's absolutely relentless villain, etc.). I also liked the song of King Gator. I always loved loud, annoying, gaudy boys. This song may be random, but it's great fun. Finally, the animation details are beautiful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I felt sorry for you: He denied a place in heaven and STILL finally got it back. I recall some songs with some songs "... you can not have a good dog", "... let music never be done" and "... welcome dead" but I can not remember most of them. To be honest with the songs, that's not impressive. Whippet Angel: She is annoying and that's the nuke! <br /> <br /> Parents are not good: horror on hell images (depending on the viewer) are shown in the picture. Corruption is very dangerous. Beer also indicated, but in reality the beer is not double. Gambling is crucial in this movie. <br /> <br /> More than anything, I loved this movie. Poor child animations are always my favorites. It was rebuilt when producers and writers were not afraid to threaten children. Nowadays, this is probably rated PG. Children aged 8 (or easily disturbed) can not see it. Besides, I give 9/10. <br /> <br /> Happy view!
