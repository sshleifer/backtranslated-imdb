<br /> <br /> Viren Sahay (Amitabh Bachchan) is a dark dawn, running from Bangkok. He is a family in India. Once mistakenly he kills Sekhar (Akshay Kumar). Like Viren Cohe, he also has a family (brother, wife and parents). Aryan (Aryanman), Shekhar's brother retaliated for his brother's death. <br /> <br /> The film is a turning point (Amitabh Bachchan). The second half of the film is entirely his own, where instead of his dialogues, the expression is related. Akshay's small character also kept him equal to Amitabh. <br /> <br /> I do not know what Bhucca Chawala is doing in this movie. <br /> <br /> There are some loose points in the script; Like; Amitabh is shown as the City's Most Wanted Criminal, still walking non-Scott in the city. The abduction of his family seemed even vague. What type of big dawn does the family have?
