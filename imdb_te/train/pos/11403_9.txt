With MGM, Gene Kelly has given some really great ideas about music. Here he is at the top of his creative forces working with the Arthur Fried musical unit. The hardest players believe in an American sight in Paris never leave a lot back at MGM. <br /> <br /> An American's magic in Paris is due to creative editing under the direction of Vincent Minnelly and mixed with MGM set up some backing shots. The film's idea began with Kelly, who wanted to make a film with a long ballot sequence in George Gershwin's tone commissions an American in Paris. Arthur Fried, who came to Ir Gershwin, was very surprised. Gershine provided music to Arun Gershwin, who spoke good with him as long as he used the term Gershivin. One note of non-Gershwin music in an American in Paris was not heard. <br /> <br /> Listen to some of the background music, you will hear things like emblemable you and not for real without real musical numbers. <br /> <br /> Alan Jay Lener wrote that the story is a thin one. The former GI by Gene Kelly, who left France after World War II, settled in the apartment on the left bank and became a hungry artist. He lives with an outstanding composer Oscar Levant and it sounds forever like a redundancy. <br /> <br /> Two women are interested in him. If he is contradictory in other matters, another exiled American actress Nina Fach, who wants to sponsor him as an artist. But Kelly comes to a shop girl who played Leslie Caron for the first time in her film. <br /> <br /> Charon George Gershwin is just a pretense to sing and dance to music. An American in Paris is the first film I've ever seen in the film of the first flight of flight I took in the film. I'm still going back to Phoenix Arizona from Kennedy Airport, I'm doing rhythm. My favorite number in the film is the tra-la-la, which is singing and dancing on the apartment with the Oscar Levant who plays Kelly Piano. Kelly once dances on baby grand piano <br /> <br /> In a book about Arthur Freed, I read the quote in the United States at the Paris Ballet Sequence. French Impressionists thought he would take people out of the streets or behind the actual setting. So it happened. Kelly has done long ballet scenes in Words and Music, The Pirate and On the Town. But this is the top of all. And in my opinion and it has some of Jean Kelly's next films. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, in the Oscars, Anne was chosen as the best film in 1951, in Paris. I guess that year was fantasy trumped realism. <br /> Moreover, one of the best American film music parodies in Paris, studios no longer have the creative talent on each roof, is less likely to be repetitive.
