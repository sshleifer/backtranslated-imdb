Cross-eyed original and funny picture. I think I'll refresh the eyes of Adam Jones's comedy style and revive it better. This film is good, concise, and consistently entertaining and funny. As a writer / director, Jones performs full control over the immense and friendly characters. You do not see the story is good. It is unique and fun, and visually works in excellent ways, as well as creating a long-lost slapstick genre as a heartfelt comedy. <br /> Very good first movie.
