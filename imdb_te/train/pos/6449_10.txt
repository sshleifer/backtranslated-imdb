I am a friend in this movie and I am skeptical about a Swedish film with a subtitle. However, I enjoyed this beautiful movie every minute. The unwanted cruelty of man's ability to be portrayed with confidence without high images - animal lovers can save their eyes somewhere in the first 10 minutes somewhere for a few seconds. The modest and cruelty and trail versus traditional story is cited from a fresh perspective satisfying using the color spectrum with very natural flaws and properties. I was able to discuss many aspects of disagreeable human behavior about bias, discrimination, and sacred performance. A strange gem promotes everyone I hear.
