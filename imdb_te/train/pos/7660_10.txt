The film features a dark, sandy masterpiece. I can be bias, the area of ​​the apartheid era I have always experienced. But I will speak with the rankings of cry Freedom and with the beloved country. Until a few days ago I never heard of this film. Inside is one of the least expected films of all time, as it is a small movie company and I have never heard of it before. However, my favorite actors are Eric Stoltz, believable and dramatic, and Nigel Hawthorn plays his Dastdie role. There is nothing to look for humor in this movie, nothing. It's true, in the end savage and gritty, and delicate I'll say I bring a box of tissue. But all of these pictures will surprise you, why do great movies often hear?
