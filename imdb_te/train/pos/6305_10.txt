Welcome to Collinwood is one of the most delightful films I have ever seen. An incredible ensemble cast, tight editing and excellent direction. <br /> You can not say much about this movie. The tag line says it all - 5 guys. 1 Safe. <br /> <br /> William H. McChee and Sam Rockwell lead the wonderful cast. <br /> <br /> George Clooney should be congratulated for this gem product. <br /> <br />
