It's a good deal of good drama and pace from today's more intense and loud images. It is another solid based on-one real shop, which is still designed for more dramatic purposes. Frankly, I do not know but I liked that story. <br /> The story is about a young man who is interested in the queen of the queen and the coal mines in the West Virginia town of everyone, including his father. The big problem is the controversy between the boy and his father, which I think is overdone. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> He's here, his school buddies here. It's good to see good children in a modern film. Two other important actors in the film are Chris Cooper (father) and Laura Dern (the kid's mentor who encourages him all the time). <br /> <br /> Cinematography is a fun to hear soundtrack in the 1950s. Once again: I want to do more in these films.
