Another attempt by modern Japanese directors to redefine the Chambara style. <br /> <br /> The Buddhist monk has a vision of killing an epic (and aggressive) ghost in the glass bridge to attain enlightenment. While not in the forefront, the Buddhist idea is in the heart of the film, Kurosawa is like the "run". It's probably near the "Runs" league but the movie has made me very interesting. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting for two hours and eighteen minutes of stylish visual direction and fantastic photography. The main actors are unusually amazing. Music is good. Two weaknesses are story and fight scenes. The film is drilled in the middle of a few by intelligent editing. And the action scenes are often portrayed in obscene closely. This works for a very movie but the end feels like a cheat. Another recent film like this is "Seven Swords" of Sunie Hark, a great movie but the promise of the fight is disappointing scenes. <br /> <br /> Asan does not really move the sword holding a knife, his performance is good but he is extraordinary in the traditional Chambara fight scene. <br /> <br /> Good movie, traditional knife does not expect arguments.
