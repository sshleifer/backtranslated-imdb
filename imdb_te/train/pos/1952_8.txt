I had to watch the film on "Thin Ice" on the television in India. Say this movie is really good and really I sent the spine up my spine .. The basic story is that some addicts <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton I thought ... the scenery with her wishes, and rugs her house for cocaine ... the best thing ... two ba Uru good, and even better actress Linda Boyd .... cinematography and directing, she has done well in the script. Everyone must watch the movie
