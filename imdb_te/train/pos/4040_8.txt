A new, sublime exercise in claustrophobia. Japanese thriller that stands as a tough challenge by fitting completely in two rooms. Not entirely successful, but tat, surprising and well-acted. Can SAW find a somewhat recalled film? Two men are trapped in the room and running with each other? But rather that the movie rather dare to stay on its premise and keep the hero locked in his cell throughout the movie. It's like looking at the lab experiment. Some people have a suspense tough, but this reviewer found it enthralling. The sound and depictions of the film are quite awesome. This is definitely a good picture to display a good home video system. For a last night film fest, when in a mysterious mood. That night I woke up.
