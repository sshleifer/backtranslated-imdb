When "Good Times" was broadcast in 1974, it was the first black family set. It is centered on the poor Chicago Evans family and ends their efforts. Part of the early episodes about parents, James and Florida Evans, and the fight for their family. John Amos and Esther Roel is the best part of the show. They have excellent actors and have great chemistry as James and Florida Evans. They have three children: J.J., Thelma and Michael. JJ The skunk-chasing but well-understood young son made with his lack of artistic skill. Telma is an attractive, bright girl. Michael is well educated on social issues and has become an advocate. <br /> <br /> In 1976, producers made a huge mistake by burning John Amos, literally killing his character. This has become really focused, and I might be good for it. Shows J.J. And his Buffy-like behavior, angry by the black audience, followed by a seasoned series starring Esther Roel. <br /> <br /> In a program focused on key African-American issues in society at the time, viewers have been overloaded with sketching and fat jokes. <br /> <br /> Esther Roel's performance was much more complicated. <br /> <br /> When the return of Esther Roel for the 1978 season, it became clear that the show was in its last call. <br /> The first three seasons: A. The last three seasons: C +.
