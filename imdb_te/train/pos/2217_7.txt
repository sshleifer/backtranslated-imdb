I'm skeptical about watching movies or short-range movies based on plays because screenplay is always different from the novel. Fortunately, I'm wrong! The screenplay is very close to the novel (who said I was the author's executive producer and writer?) <br /> The cast is awesome. I can not describe how happy are those such a wide range of actors (from Ozzy Davis and Ruby Dee to Robert Richard and Bianca Lawson). <br /> The location setting ... I look forward to see the homes and cottages I imagined in my mind: a little bit different from what I saw on the screen. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this to anyone who reads this novel. If you do not despair. <br /> 10 stars!
