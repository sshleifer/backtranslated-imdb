<br /> <br /> I really am in this minority but I liked this movie. It's not a classic but definitely involved and ride an adrenaline fuel too. <br /> I did not see the original because it could be my reason. It tells me that this is a strong fan of something like this. People who do not see the original version, it's a little less to compare. <br /> It's not a fairy but I've got into it so much and actually want to see me original. <br /> There are some things I liked about it. Kovakki is one of the cast members. Viggo Mortenson is amazing and really brought a lot of attractive to the character. As the big part of the film fell on his shoulders, he had to be really good and he was. This is a great role for him. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing about the one-piece piece of whisking point is that it is made for television. I do not know this thing when looking at it. It definitely looked like a major movie and I did not expect it to be a big screen release. <br /> <br /> I also found that the story was very absorbed. I'm not for action movies but I got sucked into this. Plus it's an action movie, very drama, mysticism, a love story, quirky people every way you have turned. (I did not even recognize the priest.) And it was touching. <br /> <br /> This film is very big, but it is worth watching. This will prepare a strong punch and if it is involved in the story at the time, it will change at the very end. I do not know how I feel about the ending. <br /> <br /> Kovkakie survived, but it is not always a matter of mixing a movie and realism as a movie, although it is possible that I can be helpless. <br /> <br /> The end is very unreal but I have to say that I am immersed in a very good way, and I'm not generally unwilling but for some reason it is almost forgivable. In fact, many of the plots (the villains are no longer a stereotypical) are based on objects, but many have made mistakes, but the makers have the right. However, I can admit that anyone who is the real favorite fan hates this version, although I do not see the original, I've rebuilt many original films with terrible results. <br /> <br /> Previously compared to Smoky and Bandits in this film, "Telma and Louise" meets the road version of "Legends of the Fall" ? I definitely thought of two films (both of them are a fan.) But I do not think this is a great movie. It's an average good then me but far from great. But an absorbing, adrenaline fuel, touching image with the main character's amazing performers. My vote is 10 out of 7.
