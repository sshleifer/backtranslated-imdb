I think this film is unrealistic. In the opening sequence, a man is killed for no reason. He will not be mentioned again. Special effects may be good but I enjoy watching the old horror movie. It's not a classic example of a classic horror movie but it's still an alright film. I'll put it in scale 10 within 5.
