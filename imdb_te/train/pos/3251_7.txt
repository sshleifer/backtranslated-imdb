Another remake of "Fistful of Dollars" is a remake of Kurosawa's "Yojinbo" (Sergio Leone's novel 'Red Harvest'). <br /> It's definitely a B-movie; It's taken, it's enjoyable. This direction is crisp, full of Verve's performance, and its 'direct-to-video' photography is very well maintained. <br /> <br /> The weakness of the film is from 'When upon a Time in the West' in the phishing '/' Yojinbo 'plot plot. Though Lyon directed both 'Fistful' and 'West', his inspirations in these two films are no longer different. The 'unnamed person' (Eastwood) is the borderline social path to the broken area for broken families. Harmonica (Chales Bronson) engaged with his own broken family and engaged in revenge. These two characters are unable to do one another. <br /> <br /> To bring this together, you need to twist the story of 'Gun Crazy'. And filled with reaction and silliness; It's entertaining at that level, just never expect.
