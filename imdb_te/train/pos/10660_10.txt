I'm looking forward to this film almost go-go. When Miss Stanwick opened his comment, it was only a few minutes of learning that the problem was coming. Deserted area, the deserted gas station locked the door, everything is set up for you waiting for it ... here it comes. At first you think it will be about the little boy, but all very quickly start holding your breath watching the tide coming in. This film is really stressful, even though I've seen before and made for the dinosaur. If you find a film that you can keep in suspense now, to get a special rating now, maybe a white knuckle award?
