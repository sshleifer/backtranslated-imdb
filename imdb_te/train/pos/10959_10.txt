If you do not fall in love with Big and Little Eddie after seeing this movie, everything I say is you, then you're not human! This was the first time I saw it. I can say that this is true for other fans, it's hard to explain. After seeing this, you do not think these two wonderful ladies are with us. At least remember them in the Gray Gardens! I feel so long that I have a serious freedom that is covered with these two women. Although I always appreciate Jackie Onassis Kennedy, she is not in your heart as Big and Little Eddie does. A rare treatment known to such people; I only wanted to!
