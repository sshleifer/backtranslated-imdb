It's different, it's perfect. See cast! <br /> <br /> <br /> William H. Mackie and Ben Stillers stars, but some actors share this spotlight about the superhero-wannabees, spotlight. <br /> <br /> Paul Rubens is the most outrageous character of the "Pe Wee Herman" reputation. <br /> <br /> Many humorous, luxurious colors and nothing are lost. It's a pretty entertaining, lighter comedy with heroes one La Superman, Batman, Spiderman, but Goofy characters all of whom you name it. They are real leaders (and do not want to!) Have talent in strange areas. It's crazy, but you know you're going. <br /> <br /> Do not really lose the picture and the sequel that you can see in the installments. It's serious, so take a break here is a long film for a good picture. As many children feel this, this language is very important. In fact, I do not recall any swearing here, except for someone in the theater next to me, "no dumb, F-movie movie." I thought it was two hours of fun, but I would be watching on DVD and taking some breaks.
