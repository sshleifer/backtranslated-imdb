<br /> <br /> This is one of the first series to air on television in this amazing series. This is very effective in the agreement with the Americans. Color Television Set, which is around $ 800 in 1959, today is more than $ 3,000. How much do we have to pay for the power to watch a 17-inch screen on a cathode ray movie tube? <br /> Now looking at it, 50 years later, there are many things in mind. First of all, many of the heroes have a Comstock load and a claim of silver mining in 1859. In 1859, weapons and garments were largely not standardized. <br /> <br /> In 1839, Ben came to the Lake Tahoe area and a 100 mile ridge in the next twenty years. <br /> <br /> Pioneers are still trying to resolve the Sierra Nevada issue by 1847, and Gold Rush did not even begin two years later. <br /> Indians are not Native American actors. John Ford used native American actors in the 1920s. Bonanza producers made it easier for thirty years later. <br /> There are other time-line issues. In season 1, Mark Twain appears, and he is portrayed as a middle-aged man. Mark Twain was born in 1859 at the age of 24. Stories were also in favor of the 1859-1860 (before the Civil War) and the 1880s-time frame. <br /> <br /> There is some off-putting that has a lot to kill in the first season. In time, killing is reduced. <br /> <br /> Many episodes take the socially liberal slant, although it is difficult to believe, even though the time-line is given, but the writers are periodically the Nation's beginnings in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> If anything, acting is good, and let's figure out Am's role in my last years better than any other. Pernel Roberts I do not think he deserves any credit. Also, Don Blacker (Hassan) strengthens Season 1 as a good actor. <br /> <br /> Many stories have found true historical events. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </
