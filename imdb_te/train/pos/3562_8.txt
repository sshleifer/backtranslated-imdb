Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) is the organizer of New York's long-established floating Crops game, and he needs $ 1000.

'Guys and Dolls (1955)' This is a great music because it combines the contrasting styles of the film and the stage. During a fantastic start-up, pedestrian groups move in a rhythm, stopping and launching, even when responding to behind-the-scenes signs.

Simmons suggested that Adams Hepburn would bring the same baby-like livelihood to the role, and Brindo may not care for such a self-assurance and Charismaman's voiceless voice.
