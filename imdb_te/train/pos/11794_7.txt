This is a very gripping, fascinating, tragic story. Very good, most accurate, is a TV movie rather than a documentary. They created some fictional characters and included many real people in a role, but it's a very tragic and dark story. <br /> <br /> The last moments of the film were shot directly from the audio recordings by Jim Jones, who shot and assassinated a mass suicide. The record of the People's Temple took place in the last 44 minutes. It is available in many places on the Internet. <br /> <br /> This part of the film is about the same thing. <br /> All in all, it's not a documentary. Nevertheless, it covers the origins of many elements to the People's Temple Story.
