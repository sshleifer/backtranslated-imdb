What about Tara Fitzgerald's comprehensive performance? She is absolutely believable as Mrs Graham, who suffered an experienced injury in a way that is not yet immune to Mr Marsham's passionate, experience, sharp and strong. Toby Stephens is the main character of his character, telling every flicker and facial expression in his eyes, through every wicked glance and every flame of anger. The power of passion and hope that he restores Helen's wounded soul. Graves Huntingdon is the perfect work of the undisputed rogue. Moreover, he has done a dignified human dignity in his rejection to reject the master at the end; He is at least aware of his own failures and how they brought him to ruin. Helen's attempt to save his soul - leaving him and after taking a child at the time he did not hear - the hope of hope, hope and faith, the value of every human life and spirit, but it could be a person. Mark's consistency is her reward for her lack of faith and commitment. Although the mood of rented morality has been demonstrated by today's standards, the story is still infused with integrity, passion and confidence. The tenant is more reliable than renting heights or Jane Eyre; Here is an adaptation of the novel justice. I'll look better
