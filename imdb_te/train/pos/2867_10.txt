I lost my father at a very young age. So I can not remember the young man. Over the years I have learned a lot about him. One of those things was that he loved Westerns and looking at Bonanza every Sunday evening was a perfect ritual. I remember the end of the series runner up when I was 8 when I stopped the show in 1973. Over the years, I look at this show and make me close to the lost father. A program has all the right things to succeed, your seat laughs, tears, edge, and even angry sometimes. Our beloved "Hus" cartwright, after the death of Dan Blacker, the memory of the original run of the show, a special episode, and the end credits painted the end of the blocker, and fades into black. In this view, remember my elder sister with tears in his eyes. I remember it as soon as On behalf of the father who gave birth to me, himself Eppakapote, we love Bonanza. .
