Why this movie is all but hidden into darkness is a perfect offense. "Canon" Perhaps the same Sword and Morgari film is good. Cruel torture, cool character design, and good pace, make the best fantasies around this. This is definitely a great animated film that targets adult audience I've seen. It does not resemble Bucky's simple frantic style. It is a long way away from the bird, and my opinion is his best work. I feel like this film is desirable.
