I think the team behind this film did a very good job with the limits they have. Just writing Â£ 300,000 and 7 weeks, the film and the only thing I feel is the only one to achieve. This film is not for the Mass (an innocent teenager was killed and the story is homo-erotismism) I suffer from this movie heart wrenching tragedy and more deeper involve you in the story you feel in the story. <br /> <br /> "I think it's an insult to me that the film is not very good at all.
