Hi .. I take into consideration one of my favorite Sean Connery movies, especially from the cast of the spectacular performances, especially for Connery, which is a passionate psychological thriller. It's one of the best lines I've seen in movies, so dialogue this one is a pretty good .. scene interview is just incredible in the role of Ed Harris in prison .. It is one of the best scenes in most movies, I enjoyed this very much and I would not really recommend this enough, really do not miss It is! Suck the last 30 minutes, it's as serious as the rest of the movie, I just do not have to pay attention to negative reviews stating that I find the most entertaining film cause ..
