War Inc. A funny but strange picture. I like the cast and the film does not like it, but I do not know how to explain the plot. I'll go to the next plot. This is a picture with some weird casting options. As a Hitman alongside John Cusack, we had years ago that I liked the grossing point I liked it. <br /> <br /> Here we played a Russian pop star named Henoari Duff Unica Babia, or something like that. Her role is odd. She has a scarf scene on her pants. And hits on Huser (Cusack). There is a twist at the end of the two characters involved. It makes sense. <br /> This is the only casting option I have to go. It's plain strange. The whole picture is strange. But sometimes it's very funny and I'm never bored. Here we have some of the best actors. Excluding Miss Duff. She's not great. But here we have John Cusack, Marisa Tommy, Jon Cusack, Ben Kingsley. <br /> This is the story of a hunter named Huser (Cusack). He was sent to some Middle City to appear as an actor on an oil man named Omar Sheriff. When trying to deal with his personal problems, he should help the wedding of Popstar (played by Hilary Duff). He falls in love with a news reporter (played by Marisa Tommy). There is one thing about Popstar. Houser hated her. She has a scene that sings a song and then she throws up. <br /> Why does the twist in the end of the film reveal? The thing about the twist is the kind I see coming up. But it does not matter. It's a strange, funny and entertaining comedy. I love most actors. <br /> War, Inc.: 3.5 / 5
