One of my favorite "Imperialism" films and one of the best action adventure flags. Grant, McLaughlin and Fairbanks dominate the screen, all the daring and intelligent cracks are best placed on the film as the "PC" for those who go to the film. Unforgettable scenes - 3 sargants and their 20 sapphires fought for hundreds; McChesney & Cutter gave Bobby Cock Spike Punch ("Some Save for the Elephant"); Cutter to McChesney - "I'm an Expedition"; <br /> <br /> I have tried to capture the film anytime, but I 've always been a bold - But for hands chairs and generals, it's hard to imagine a good 2 hours.
