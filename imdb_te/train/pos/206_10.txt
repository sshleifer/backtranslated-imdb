I'm 14 years old, so you probably never heard someone like George Burns or Walter Mathau or someone like that. The boy is wrong with you. I heard George Burns in the movie and received an Academy Award. I'm a fan of George Burns since age ten. Oh film, recently I saw God. It's pretty awesome. George Burns did a great job. So Walter Moutou did (the first time I saw him earlier). Though they were really small characters, Phillis Diller and Steve Allen did a good job. If this really happens, they will be filmed specifically. You say this, if you're a fan of George Burns or Walter Mantou, you should watch this movie immediately!
