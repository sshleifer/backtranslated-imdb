I first saw in this film some of the few film channels (HBO?). I saw CB4 in the Public Enemy fan, NWA and other early rap and theaters. Anyway, that promo attracted my attention, and I wanted to know about it all. Well, right off the bat I knew it was going to be good (Caution!) And I was right. One of the parody songs is that the movie is valued and over-looking (my peanuts), but the overall flow and delivery of the film is great. I loved the rap groups (apparently NWA), some rappers (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube), and NWH's humor. Who can not forget to scratch his ass? The film did not receive credit, it was covered by CB4 during their release, but my opinion was a better image. If you know 'gangster' 90s, you'll be watching and laughing for a long time. If you do not like or do not like rap, you'll enjoy jokes at the expense of the genre.
