This movie is as magnificent as the adults are looking for storytelling and fantasy in the way of adults. The idea is that the child's drawings will make her feel physically and influenced. At the same time you can say that she is really exploring her subconscious as we all are in our dreams when all the children's psychologist and she sleeps about it. When my duck was in the paper house, she bit me with a goose-pimples. I can not stand it is sold as horror movie ... this is not true. If you want to see the British country with plenty of storytelling that you can imagine without having a simple thrill to use many movies, then the Papus House should be seen.
