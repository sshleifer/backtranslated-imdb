Vladimir Novokov's literary intellect is brought to the fore again and many take notice of the world of the culture. An absentminded chaplinesque study of director Chess addiction, puts us in Alexander's story check mate. Nassassia is on vacation at a marble palace resort hosted by a chess championship. She meets Alexander by picking up a queen piece by making her coat pocket. The next day he proposed a magnetic attraction, the mother's husband alerted the telegram. He arrives in Alexander and questioned, in the past we have seen this mess in the past, as Godfather II, we see a young Alexander and child prodigy. He took under the wing of the school teachers 10 mm. He loots his genius to gain vast sums. Thinking Alexander reached his peak, giving up on him but myth. The old teacher Alexander returned to the detriment of trying to give the old rival the victory. World Chess Championship victory is one way for the batsmen, in a serious chess game with a chess clock, the match ends at the end of the next day. On that day Nassassia married, the old guru intervened and Alexander was sent off on a nervous breakdown. She holds the stomach and finds her strategy for her love coat match and follows the movements. The film will unfortunately change from its Russian origins, its low back cut dresses are lovely, Alexander performs his character's breathtaking appearance. The director evaluated her audience, we could not play anymore and the only reference to Lujun's protection was just after business queens that the King of the King sacrificed the castle for your 3 Pals & King and colleague. Nastasya is a great match, but its conclusion is more intensely considered fit, but perhaps more empathies mean to him more than she has been right to check for. Luzhin Defense beautifully gives the Navokov honor, a world event that does not miss the complexity of his work on the pictures.
