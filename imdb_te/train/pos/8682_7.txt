I am saying that I have disagreed with other people in this Colombo episode. Death gives me a hand is a kind of boring Columbo frankly. A few times later, I was bored and changed the channel. I still love the role of Robert Colp and Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland, but the story is weak in the story than others. First, Robert Culp treats Ray Milland as the investigator. He appoints him to investigate his young wife's wife who has been played by Patricia Crowley to see if he has his affair. Instead, the character of the Kalp blackmail his wife cheating her husband plans to expose her scheme to destroy her career. Furiously, Kalp kills her, hitting her face and creating the body elsewhere. I do not know. Maybe I do not care for this one. However, Colombo finally gets him. This is just the question of how.
