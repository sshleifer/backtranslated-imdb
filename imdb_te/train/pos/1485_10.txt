What do you do about your life, but when you find out that the priest is right, it's so nice, so there are two parts where the other people are doing what? The film has made you dream with new life, experiences, and other people, and it's up to you to reach the dreams. It also shows life as hard as you can. But it gives you the opportunity to choose what you want and what you really need. I hope this comment works for you. It worked well for me. I bought the image through the way;) take care.
