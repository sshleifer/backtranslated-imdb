Panama has produced a funny, obstreperous, joyously messy ensemble piece that ends with a note of redemptive and heartfelt fun in his new offside, seemed to be terrible from the coast of previous movies such as Circle and Crimson Gold? Yet the film is very challenging and deals with the corresponding ingredient like anything he has done. The World Cup in Tehran Stadium brings Panah into national inspiration and independence-mindedness, and contradictions by focusing on the soccer fans of the collective girl attracted to the burglary-Iran match. And dissatisfaction. <br /> <br /> When we opened the film, we breathed together in one of the girls in a bus separately, and a father dying of a lost daughter. This is a disguise and national colors is warpaint, but we smite with her in the knowledge of what is happening: she is still easily spotted. The thing is, a lot of men do not really care about that. However, if the rules are rules, and they try to make it through the various stages of the large stadium, some of them are soccer girls, or some of them go up to a small compound in the stadium. Many of these big city girls do not know how to deal with independent ideas By young, green, and rural soldier-cops? Whose roar can be constantly heard in the background? Themselves. Every girl is different? Indicates another reason for breaking rules and different paths. A soldier's uniform was worn and came to the rank of officers. A friend is a tough and masculine and ridiculous and provocative (she passes for a pretty boy, and teasingly hints at those: "Are you a girl or a boy?" "What do you like me?") One (Ida Sadeghi) is a great soccer player for her and so on.Tehran girls are stubborn and smart and they are (Saifer Samandar) The rural police (Mohammed Khairabadi) takes the men to the men's restaurant (not the number of women) to the football basketball player, she wears an Italian bass star poster. A spiffy looking van vice is an authority that directs the cops to take girls to the vice department Defects and confusion Comes with a comic? Violation of sexual abuse rules qualify as a vice and a male who is seriously convicted of smuggling fireworks. But it has a cap space, so they can often hear the heart retention report. Cops and prisoners are now entering a collective enthusiasm. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br <br /> <br /> In this background, the real game, the real stadium, and the real teenagers are the result of this event. <br /> <br /> This is emotional, and the streets are impressed with cars and flags and milling mobs of supporters who are united with their enthusiasm. By now, the real game that turns everything around it is shot in the real game evening. This contrasts with Panahi's maximum computational detailed plans, improving the rhythm in the context of real events taking over and makes you curious with enthusiasm. Does the summary of offside become a disconnect between modern world soccer madness and retro-Islamic social barriers to crushing women? Young Irani women are part of the women's world sport, where young girls participate in the compassion of the spirit of the national team. How exactly is the country's ambition to become a modern world power with medieval social perspectives? Offisde is very surprisingly true, including the way everyone is trying to go out. The director's decision to inject the young actors into the original players' mega-event leads to the documentary, polymeric and fantasy mix, which is very powerful to be bone, and it ends up intelligent and moving <br /> <br /> I made reservation about Panahi movies , But it's a donkey kicks. Panahi is great here. He criticizes his society, performs exceptional drama and understands the country's aspirations of our hearts.
