I went from Sacramento to San Francisco to see the film show (and return) and I am really happy. I was amazed how many Oscar-winning films took place in the Bay Area, a large film fan and life-long north California. As a fashion designer who wants to be in the Bay Area against LA, George Lucas is about the totalitarianism and community, and I really have a visibility resonated with me. <br /> <br /> Hey, if he and all other filmmakers can do this in SF, other artists can also do. <br /> <br /> This film will be recommended
