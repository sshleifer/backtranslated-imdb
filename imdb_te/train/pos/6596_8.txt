Brazilian movies often get more positive reviews than they really are. Besides, Contra Todos (Against Everybody) (original title, omitted by producers: everybody of God) got a very low GPA (grade point average) on this website. This was largely denied by a male audience. Actually, it's not cruel. As far as graphical violence is concerned, I understand. Its cruelty is inherently lumpens, which means that I actually are underdogs, in fact have high-tech devices, they issue murdered orders instead of "gram gruda". Is this modern-modern man? Is he / she only worrying, ultra permissive, fast, almost non-satiating over his / her satiating meal? The film is perhaps the best Brazilian film of 2004. Its shining editing style, its interesting soundtrack counter points, an efficient overall cast and more importantly, its original description, at least a mark of 8, with the subtle nomenclature emerging on the surface.
