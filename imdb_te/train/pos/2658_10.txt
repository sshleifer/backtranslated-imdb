Kubrick will again demonstrate his magnificent ability to craft a perfect atmosphere for the film. Mainly through cinematography, but using an ingenious score, he creates a chilling and an ominous tone that lives in the whole movie, and initially my spine weakens. This flawless atmosphere, which really shows up in my eyes. Of course it does not hurt that Jack Nicholson gives one of the greatest performances I've seen. A frightening authentic character of a mind that has gone mad. Duvall and Lloyd are artificial, be nice, but the rest of the picture is so clever when both are easy to look past. Plus it has the actor all the time with great name (Scatman Crothers).
