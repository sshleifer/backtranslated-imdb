My wife, Kate and I definitely loved the series and can not wait for the next (hopefully the sequel is!). I call it an impressive song and I'd like to read what's written in "old and gray" and still interested in life. <br /> <br /> My wife and I have seen this series so much because it is 75 years old and retired but still very intelligent. It is good to see a presentation that shows the work of community that still has special skills and experience with older people. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The human interest factor shown by the interaction of the characters and the young ones around them is an important part of the show. <br /> <br /> This series is very fun and the most sophisticated, some of our other favorite, "Spooks" and "Hustle".
