I finished watching this movie and found it very enjoyable. It's a quiet little picture that you are not discouraged with special effects or "big" shows. It takes you in the lives of people living in a small hamlet located on the backs of North Carolina. <br /> <br /> Henry Thomas Raymond Toker gives a good performance as a young boy who leaves a baby in the forests. Toker's search for infant parents can have a profound effect on his life. David Saratner Truman plays Leicester, a slimmer with a mysterious intention. And David's perfection plays bad man. <br /> <br /> There is more than this image. Filmed in the city of North Carolina and with the amazing sound track of traditional music, it is worth watching.
