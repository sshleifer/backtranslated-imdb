Okay. This is a favorite since I was 14 years old. Granted, I do not see it many times, but ... it's not a movie for a big generation that wants a deep meaning or some wonderful message. This image is FUN. It's pretty dating, almost Paris, but Parker Posey is so intelligent it is unbelievable. If you want to be lovely with 90 Breakfast at Tiffanys, take 90th Chairs or Love the Parker, this is for you. If not, do not bother.
