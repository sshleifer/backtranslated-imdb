Danny (Reese Witherspoon) is always so close to their sister Maureen (Emily Warfield) falling in love with their neighboring court (Jason London). <br /> <br /> When the two sisters could separate themselves, they did not lose their love for each other after a terrible tragedy happened. <br /> <br /> It really removes the heart about the first love. Perhaps the most painful story about the young love I've ever seen. All acting is amazing and Reese Witherspoon will give her a great performance in her first film. I give The Man in the Moon 8.5 / 10
