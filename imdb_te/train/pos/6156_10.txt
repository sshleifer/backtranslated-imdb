This film is always my favorite Disney movie. Then on 11/21/01 I saw the 30th add-on of this movie DVD. Wow I remember why I loved this movie. The DVD is great, it does not have the original 30 minutes. I do not know this when I first started looking. Since then the film has done so much. They have to leave the cut off music. You have not seen this movie until you see a full 131-minute version. Many people say that music is unforgettable. I remember every song in this movie, each song has its own selfishness and comes together as a hole. While I was young, I stuck on my head in the days of "Eglantine". Also, "Brinkey Sea" (intended to marry the sins of the song, but was removed from the film) please see the 30th animation film and the re-vote for this movie. The 10 It really is.
