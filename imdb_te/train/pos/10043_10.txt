The film has rewritten the film history in every way. Nobody cares about what this picture is about, because it exceeds criticism. Every flaw in the image is easily overcome many amazing things going for the movie. It is a very beautiful picture, and I suspect most people will see anything like us again. I have seen more than I care to count and every time I'm still confusing, it's hard to describe. One for the ages.
