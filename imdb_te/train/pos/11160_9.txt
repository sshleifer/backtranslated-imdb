This is really a great Swedish film of all time. It was not revolutionary in its narrative, but the first of its subsequent films were Swedish humor and Swedish comedians after the latter generation. Felix Herringgren and Frederick Lindstrom are two of the most intelligent and witty filmmakers in Sweden, which really keeps displaying. <br /> <br /> "Vaskana manscore" (Adult Peoples) is a story about a warm mind and a happy teenager, and without it we are not the question.
