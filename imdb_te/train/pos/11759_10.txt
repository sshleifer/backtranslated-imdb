One of the greatest sleepers in the Times of Best of Time. Setup is not taxing your patience, development is stable, many mutual relationships love arranged, gags and bits all work and are all funny. There is a lot of pity. Kurt Russell is one of his best performances by playing Reno Hightower, and Robin Williams regularly practices Jack Dundee's role. The cast also has great supporters. Jack's wife Jack Falons is the daughter of the lovely, Reno, great comedian. I can not tell you how many times I saw this film, how many times have I enjoyed and how often I would like to see how many people see it.
