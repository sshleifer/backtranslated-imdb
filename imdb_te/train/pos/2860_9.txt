It lasted until 1959-1973. This series is much more than its longevity. <br /> <br /> It has survived the fashion and taste changes from the 50's, the Psychedelic 60's, and became popular in the 70s. <br /> <br /> I am reminded of the recurring sequences of this series. It has been an exceptional combination of all its elements from stories, actors and productions. From this series Lorne Green has an iconic role that he defines. Its appeal is throughout generations. All members of the family can enjoy this. This is a balanced morality with violence, satisfaction, humor. The result is a spin-off from this cartoon series. This series of shame is no longer repeat and many do not know its importance.
