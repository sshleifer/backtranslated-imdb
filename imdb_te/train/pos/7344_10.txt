In my opinion, the film could be better if it was smaller than 10 years ago. I think I would benefit from modern technologies, but it would have been better if it was 90 minutes less than 70 minutes. <br /> <br /> Artists and animated great job done. In my opinion, this film can boast one of the best background art and the best character design. The animation is very smooth and realistic. Everyone has done a great job in the world that you see in the world that you see. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the bad throws are not about the film, it is not attractive to one of the sexy women's animated characters. So attractive at the moment. First, plot and execution are comparable to contemporary adventure films, and are really old by modern standards. Second, it will benefit from additional 20-minute conversations due to the duration of time. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Conan is a great alternative to another short story about Barbarian, but not a novel.
