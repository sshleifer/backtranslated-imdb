From a rational perspective there is no way to resist the 'jubrisky point' or try to explain it using the words and sessions you use for other movies. Because it's not a movie. It is a concept and an idea that some filmmakers have turned into an object that has become an object of a world. What we see is not the ending of a story, a series of events that are not seen in movies everyday but from friends only when we hear about some tragic events in the news. We have imagined people who are intriguing to us - we do not know, but we have doubts in a book or TV or somewhere. So what do we see? Events. We see people arguing, driving, and inevitably, fleeing. The only escape is not something unknown-it's a collective status and cruelty, even if the civilization of a civilization is lazy, or ... human nature. Our players set in Los Angeles in the late 1960s react to the self-inflicted unlawfulness of modern existence. These creatures are effectively empty slates that can show any specificity that we have expected. The actions taken are criminal or irresponsible, but the characters are not criminals. Humans are the ones who return to the familiar and unproductive presence beyond the normal routine they experience everyday. They are not always happy or sad, but when they go out of modern lifestyle suicide they have achieved the type of self-actualization. They are the only surviving victims in the modern world, but they have only real life in the natural world. Eventually 'Zabriski Point' is a manual attachment of the natural world. Even the most desolate pieces of the earth surrender to our opinions of progress, we lose our souls leading to the death of human soul.
