I'm really enjoying 60's. <br /> As of that generation (I'm looking forward to "The 80's") it's interesting to see a four-hour capsule for that era. <br /> <br /> The main problem in the film is that the film is in the shooting of families. According to the promos, which I saw for the film in NBC, the story is basically the two families struggling with problems in the 1960s. <br /> I've lost something, but we have learned more about white people than the African American family. <br /> <br /> In the 60's, <br /> <br /> The actors come out of the mouth (all of which are very talented.) It appears at the end of the first half (about two hours) in the smallest series. Image!
