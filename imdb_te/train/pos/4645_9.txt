This film is very interesting. I've seen it twice and Glover will see if I pull the nail on the head with what he wants to be fulfilled. I can tell you about the filmmaker's apparently expressive anger against the current unexplained corporate dump that causes our every media center, and we as a culture of corporate media control. The anger that expresses "gloomy" elements in Glover's films is beautiful in its vague tension and its poetic power. I'm glad I saw this film and Glover is also clear that both of the interesting two of what's going to be a trio will be up to something. That's cool! Everything is fine. See it also. People who dismissed the film as "unthinkable" or "acting" really missed the boat. It's brilliant movies. If you can see with his books in his live performance, it is also very angry. There is really something that you come to his mind. You have experience!
