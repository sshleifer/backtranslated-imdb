Weeks for a fantastic virtual account and a weekend weekend in the weeks leading up to a thief in the night. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the product values ​​and content values ​​of this independent Christian film. <br /> Production values. Hey, it's going to look a bit cheesy (if your standard A-list Hollywood fare) is a standalone movie, so, with a shoe-string budget. But this film is perfectly acceptable with other independent movies. Acting style, clothing and music are more important than the narrative. Story is compelling? Do dramatic moments work? Is the story scheme committed to satisfying climax? As a "lunch" side note that does not answer all these questions, really important techniques are the continuity, sound, lighting - the best. <br /> <br /> Contribution VALUE. Image message is amazing. When you consider the ideas developed by the filmmaker in a short snap of 69 minutes, he will begin to congratulate his artistry. <br /> <br /> Film producer is a good storyteller for the message of the gospel, the consequence of distrust, the downturn, the truth of the rapture, and the flame of fire, world, inflammation of Satan's governments. For example, he develops the message of salvation in two important ways: (1) He shows us through the real act of sacrifice of Jesus Christ for us. This can be achieved in a subplot where the zoo-keeper is a bit poisoned with a poisonous snake and is almost dead. Blood is only for those who have immunity to snake-poison. Sin is like sin; Christ was healed like a blood, beaten on the cross. (2) Develops the message of Nirvana through the filmmaker dialogue. He has different characters to explain the truth about the need for salvation through human sin and Christ's faith. <br /> <br /> The image produced by Evangelical Christians actually includes the fact that the dialogue and scenes reveal a clearly drawn message. Nirvana, clearly evangelical in the evangelical Christian language, imagery, and theology. Apparently being Christian is irrelevant to criticize this film; This can be heard by criticizing Nike commercial for dressing up in sports. What do Evangelical Christian filmmakers do, and if they do not have a picture of their case? Moreover, the filmmaker makes use of the idea that the worst of the worst in the world will be left behind, and again, is absolutely acceptable. The filmmaker will use the dramatic ability of that idea to look great. How do i know I heard about a thief in the night from a woman who saw the show back in 1974; It still lived in her memory thirty years later. How many movies about it? All around, very enjoyable, thought-provoking performance. I plan to show it to my teen group at church.
