My favorite Jackie Chan has always been "Drunken Masters" (1978), followed by "Police Story" since 1985. In which Chan plays a Hong Kong Super-Cap character, he is accused of cracking a cruel criminal owner and his gang, and then manages to save the man's girlfriend (Brigitte Lynne), thus revolving state witnesses. As the story continues, the gangster sends his gans to send Lynn, but Chan takes him to his own fist and legs while holding his friend Maggie Chiuung at the Bay. Chan is famous for "Drunken Master," "Police Story" signature stunts and over-the-top martial arts / action choreography, which climaxed into a monumental war at a crowded shopping mall. In his role as director, Chan is outstanding, giving it attractive and funny performance. In the "Police Story", a police story on the whole slapstick of "Drunken Master" is a fantastic cop thriller that is often copied in years to come. 10/10
