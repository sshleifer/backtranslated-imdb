John Thaw is a wonderful actor. <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> Accepting the escape from the London streets (the LWI era), I have to admit that I am impressed with his scope in the role of a Cruzie Old Karmudzin. The picture is also excellent. A very moving story with a satisfying ending. Some of the characters develop slightly (especially the school teacher), but none of these are required by the plot. In fact, the story is about the old man and the boy, and the picture needs a little bit.
