The film is adjacent to Ireland, where Americans do not normally see the narrow-minded religious step of the 'friendly race' in the world. This film is perfect by introduction of the aged people to remember these events by Feward's residents (although the filmmakers find that some of the more violent sequences have dimmed the action). The film is quite unpredictable in Ireland, the Catholic Church has been filmed in a bad light, but the general truth is that the representatives of the Catholic Church carried out the Wheatos (Protestants before the Jews) of the minority. <br /> <br /> This film is a fascinating insight into the absolute problem of religion in Ireland
