It's not great that many people believe it (including my last aunt who said my favorite movie). But the film was not so much better than the real value of Orson Wells' failure in conquering the legendary "fun housework" from Shanghai's beautiful horns, especially the nice sections of Noir. <br /> <br /> By 1946, Wells's character was a mix of Hollywood film. Citizen Kane, it was not recognized as a serious film that was thought to have been attacked by Hurst Press and Hollywood Insiders. Total control of the entire film (direction and production and acting) Wells attempted to threaten the whole system. His best job at this time was Edward Rochester in Jane EYRE, which was filmed by Robert Stevenson, but was originally filmed by Wells (with Stevenson's blessing) a huge shot. But credit went to Stevenson. Stranger only benefited from the postwar benefit of fleeing Nazi war criminals. <br /> <br /> This is a great record in Hollywood for five years. <br /> <br /> Wells returned to Broadway in 1946, hoping to regain his critical potential through its production worldwide in 80 days. Although Mike Todd and Cole Porter compose the score, the music failed. His failure was at the same time rising in the role of his wife Rita Hearth, GILDA. <br /> Wells should make money - his broadway production led to his bankruptcy. He sold his interest in toad to world to the rights to the toad (eventually him last), and sold a movie about Charlie Chaplin's career about Henry Desire Landru's film. <br /> <br /> The story is Welles , Proposed a film for a down payment with Relay, with a $ 10,000.00 tax bill called Cone. Cone wanted to do that, but naturally asked what the film was about. This is a clever question. Wells is on a paid phone in New York, a pharmacy with a bookstore. He grabbed a book with Lady's title from SHANGHAI, raved it to be a great thriller. Some Welles Wells knows what he's talking about and convinced the feudal cone in general. Kohn said he was trying to get the rights and sent Welles to a $ 10,000 discount. After Kohn hung, Wells bought this book and read it - it's very bad. Elsa Bannister spent a re-writing of a therapy and screenplay to build the role of Rita. <br /> <br /> It certainly develops an interesting plot. Michael Hara is a Seaman / Longshoreman. He saves Elsa Bannister when she is attacked by gangsters in a park in San Francisco. Elsa Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloan) married. Michael persuades her to appoint her yacht's captain. This cruise includes Bannister's evil partner George Grissby (Glenn Anders) and a Sydney Broom (Ted de Corso), and Elsa becomes a detective appointed by Bannister to see Elsa. <br /> <br /> When Michael and Elsa try to find time together, they are showing Bremenme or Grissby. <br /> <br /> Grisby Michael makes a proposal - to pretend to be a modern society) to leave it out. According to Grissby (the plot is very bad here) it is used to run his life insurance still and die to the South Seas. He pays $ 10,000.00 to Michael, who pretends to shoot him. This fact signals a document acceptable to murders (Michael did not realize that such entry would eliminate the necessity of producing corpses if all other evidence suggests that Graceby probably died). <br /> Course Grissby is killed, and Michael is arrested, for the murder of Broom (Michael shoots a gun). Michael Bannister attempted to save him, and finds that he is doing a second rate job for Michael to be punished. Michael Bannister was convinced that he was the original murderer, and the jury would make him escape before the judgment. He is out and enclosed in a desert carnival, which leads to the famous "fun house" sequence and the end of the film. <br /> This is a very horrible confused film (as I have commented). It's not worth seeing - the focus is on hitting it. In the trial judge's quarterly witness Michael and the police are a witness, where he creates a magistrate who breaks glass in a bookmaker's book. Or the heyarth diving of photography can be captured from a rock, reflected in Lecherus Grisby's binoculars. <br /> Acting is particularly beautiful in Sloane (perhaps the best actor's best film character). Glen Anders is a leading Broadway actress. He rarely built movies from Shanghai to Lady and his soft grissy is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> "(Blood and Son, Tales of Manhattan, and Strawberry Blonde exceptions) and this one Wells is a very unusual role for the actor - a mysterious, innocent man who learns to believe he believes he is secretly trusted. It's not the same, AMBERSOMS, OTHELLO, EVIL's Touch or Minutes at CHIMES, but it's a good image for all.
