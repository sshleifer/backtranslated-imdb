The film is designed by Fred Astier-Ginger Rogers - Plot Outline, Dancing Numbers, Zippy Music and Total Principle ... except Ginger! It was not originally intended to be originally intended by the team's review, but it was definitely one of these films. Fred (like Eric Blor or Edward Everett Horton), instead of the usual sideways, is used by Burns and Allen - perhaps since the comedy band they can sing and dance. It really surprised me, but the group was a welcome alliance and Fred and Ginger's numbers were some of these along with Fred and Gracie or Gorge. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Fontaine's dance with the front is very small, but it is very brief and with long camera shots. <br /> Speak about Burns and Allen and talk about them. I have never seen a fan of their performance or their movies. Generally, I found Gracie's idiot a very annoying job and gave me some poor reviews for their movies' stories and full-length films. Nevertheless, I have to admit that I was a great dancer - not just a dancing competition but I thought it was really funny and I thought it was a great hole by Edward Everett Horton. <br /> <br /> It is fun and fun for the rest of the films. My problem is, however, is not a good choice for Joan Fontine's film - her acting outside of the range (after all, she is not a singer or dancer), but because of the presence of the screen of Men's Ball. Because of this, there is no general balance and great boy-dialogue dialogue. There was also a very beautiful show by Harry Watson as a devilish little boy who made everything he was able to play Cupid because he wanted to win a bet! In the end, I loved the Fun House and Love Sequence Tunnel - it's very hard to explain but it's great to watch! Overall, I liked the film quite a bit - it has a lot of charm and excellent writing. Unfortunately, Shri Phantine had a courtesy appearance that brought me a point - I brought my score 7 for the film.
