The first time I saw this film a million years ago (exactly 5 years). In the wake of recent developments, I decided that Australian woman Schappel Carby was imprisoned in an imprisonment imprisonment imprisoned in Indonesia and wanted to see this film again. Except I cried to my heart, 'I will suck for the hot girls who need it (just read my review of' stacking of the lorry show '). Some wet my eyes escaped, but it's tear-filled buckets. Why? The two heroines are not entirely uninterrupted and helpless because the film is not a heartbeat in the film, which mainly covers the live stream of their live coverage in almost inhuman conditions. Why? Why did not I cry? I wanted to cry! When I rent a movie like this, I'm disappointed because I do not have a tomorrow unless I move away. This movie is very small. The script has been reduced to the main plot elements and has been dropped next to the psychological aspect of it. Clare Danes and Kate Beckinsale filmed two friends' emotions, but the film shouts their frustrating (and repressive) surroundings for more footage. For some reason mental travel is not here. You're just looking at key edits (which is very touching, I agree), probably due to bad editing. Sometimes I think these girls are walking on the postcard. Relationship with family members used a little more attention. What is the relationship between girls and parents (especially between Alice and her father)? <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, and in the end I had to give my latch a little bit. . But I would like to do with acting skills (and looks) of actresses (and the music) then with director Merit. To be honest, I know Kate Beckinsale before I see this movie (again). Now I'm a fan! Great cinema, as long as you do not expect to be classic cinema.
