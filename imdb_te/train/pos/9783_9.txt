How can you say that the "little TV idea" is beyond me when you're dealing with problems with peaches and its complicated comments? In addition, many small films are thinking of "little thought" their plot. Your obvious dislike of the TV industry ("Sue Smith fails to pull up on its television background") is confusing. In particular you have a "great time" working on TV. Ms Smith (not, I'm not a friend or relative) - All AFI Award-winning brides of crude, Coronine from the road. All made for TV. What do you think about other small TV ideas like "Against the Wind", "Bodyline", "The Divine", "Justice Scales", "Blue Murder", "Water under the Bridge" I am a pherishing film that has my interest, and most of my friends, from start to finish. It's not flawless, and I think it's one of the best Australian films I've seen over the past few years. It may be with classics such as "The Year My Voice Broke", "The Devil's Playground", with some other perspectives. I really enjoyed this film more than "Somersault" and "Three Dollars". These movies, their ideas, surreal, realistic, realistic and dealing with important contemporary issues, but mr.and mrs the average film director and I have been very fun, and it's not very boring. Whenever I go into a film, I will always see the reaction of the audience to the film (through the movie-reactions and listening to the conversations in Foyer and Lou). Some peaches were shaking heads, some faced with negative criticism, but enjoyed many experiences.
