Many people have a problem with this movie, and the story is very entertaining (based on a true story) or a film that is portrayed (this is not really true). The film is so close to Jon Anderson's definitive bio that he gets the story correctly. Soderbergh makes an amazing job of setting a mood for Chester's Bolivian adventure. You really get the whole coward and frustration of Bolivan farmers about Cheli's revolutionary ideas or the problems faced by his men and the appetite. Sorry to be cautious about the cinema fan but sorry how it happened. So do not go into this movie to expect a Rambo Shoot Em up, its true story!
