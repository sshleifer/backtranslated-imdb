This episode is a bit confusing. Some people say that you should start from the beginning but at the beginning I can say it is very confusing! <br /> <br /> When Clarke was hurt by his head, Ferreview made a mental institution and fun for believing he was a superhero. Clarke said in his life that he was on his head. Unrealistic beliefs. He also invented exceptional things: married Martha's Lionel; Lex, who suffered his accident on the bridge, adheres to a wheelchair cut his footprints; And dedicated to Lana Clark. But he found a contact; Someone dedicated to Clark: Chloe. There is also a mental patient from the known world of Smallville. And the doctor who escaped from the Phantom Zone. <br /> <br /> This episode reminds me of the episode "Buffy", also known as "Norman Again". Where Buffy has a bright daytime dream about the mental asylum. The doctor tried to persuade her, and she regretted her imagination, and she seemed foolish. Her parents still married, they still lived in LA, and she had no friends, Angel was never her beloved and she was not a sister named Don. There are no demons and vampires. These two episodes are episodes because doctors do not tell the characters that describe all of its imagination, but it tells us what is right: fiction, and brings us back to reality. It's nice to have it every time, but we'll see these shows escape from reality. Characters to overcome new challenges because it's good again.
