This is one of the best movies every time you watch them. It's packed with the most original and unusual ideas you've always found a new detail. In Sabu's subsequent films (yet I did not see "Unlucky Cocky" yet, but the rest were great), the failure, the possibility and the humanity played a great role. Cutting and Montez is creative and artwork, not an "art" film, but it is very entertaining. Compared to "Run, Lola, Run", "Dangan Rana" took place a few years earlier and first appeared on German TV in 1997 ... So it was inspired by Tom Tyrer's film, and not the other way. I like acting and ends with other performances. This film is very fun in many ways, which manages to handle a message from annoying or disruptive.
