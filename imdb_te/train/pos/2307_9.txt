I must say that this film is truly amazing and heartfelt. Reese Witherspoon is very beautiful and Jason London is not so bad! It's very sweet looking at Danny's fall in love and it warms my heart at the same time it breaks my heart and still watching the court fall in love with Maureen. Yet it is very sweet to see how much attention he has for Danny. Finally I want to leave him for Danny. It was so pretty looking at her fall I did not want to get her heart broken too bad. But the biggest tragedy I have ever seen in this film. He killed me to die. I can not believe it. Nevertheless, there is no more loving relationship in the film Maureen and Danny. They can really do anything by themselves. I am giving this film a 9th because I do not want to die in the court but I still have one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen.
