The film is fantastic, daring and the music is great. Moviewalker 's album Bad (1987) .Thank me Bad .It is wonderful (*****). The film starts with Michael Jackson's performance "Man in the Mirror", which shows Michael's history, in his early days before the Bad Age in Jackson 5. Oh, and Bader is also good (music video parody of the Badger Single Bad Music Video) .It shows Speed ​​Demon video. The song and video are very good. This is seen in the movie Moonlalker. A few minutes later, he plays a soft criminal role called the Club 30 Club. When he's leaning, it's nice to see you. Bye bye.
