Lover of the surrealist (in art and films) I am happy to find this movie on IFC. This is definitely a keeper. Other reviews tell a very simple plot (not all that is right) so I do not bother to bother anyone. The main thing is the feeling of alternate worlds, which is brought by Ana's coming illness, and the way she manages to link with someone else after her "isolation", and finally with her family, I believe it's still a little problem still. This is known as a scary film, which has intimidating scenes, but it's a fantasy ("An Age of Coming", Ana only "hates boys"). I recommend it to those who appreciate the story of their imagination.
