This image is really a mixed bag. On the one hand, the story's story and feeling are great, as long as it has some nice plot turns. But once again on the other hand, it is said to be very slow without style and unrivaled. <br /> But I thought that Sean Connery was misinterpreted in his role. I mean, he is primarily a hero and father of a young daughter (by way of still very young Scarlett Johansson) and Kate Kapus's husband is not reliable. I think it's too old to play a very credible role in that role. Although Sean Connery is a great actor and the only reason he still has to take the film as he does. But he helped with a solid supporting cast from actors like Lawrence Fishburn, Blair Underwood, Ned Beatty, Hope Lange, Lenny Thippen and Ed Harris. All actors are good, but some of them are at the same time very inefficient, which is a real shame, as well as a missing opportunity. Especially Ed Harris is absolutely great in his role as a mental serial killer. He is really chilling and acting greatly. Usually he does not play these cruel, cooling roles in films, so he is really surprised by his role in this role. His acting alone is already over enough reason to watch this film. However, due to the fact that the story is not very styled and most formalized, any single character in the film does not work well because it feels very far. <br /> This is really the way of storytelling to kill all the movies. Arne Glamor directs the film a little style and keeps at times at low speed. Because of this, as audiences we do not really have to do with the characters or any characters in it. <br /> <br /> "Just Cause" is really bad for having a good enough probability. It is a good story and a slick story with some unexpected turns and turns. The cast and story is the reason why this film is still the thriller on the average, which is probably still the genre fan. <br /> <br /> It is a permanent shy, or the film is a true classic in its style, telling the story and lacking in style. <br /> <br />
