<br /> <br /> Fox pulled the plug through a play / mystery. Do they want us to invest our time in their new programs when real risk is not finding what's going on? Why are not the remaining, already filmed episodes in America? They were broadcasted elsewhere. <br /> Hey, Fox! Are you listening? This is a great show, but you leave us hanging. If you're going to introduce new drama / secrets, it's essentially the least wind end before ending the mid-theme. This happens every time (and that's what happens with you - Fox), "wait and see" most of them before investing their time. This means you will see artificially lower interest rates, and it is possible to end this range. See? This is a dangerous cycle. Do not let us down again ...
