The film is the best in terms of visual beauty! I do not know that the technician has come too early. Even though I do not want to end it, the whole picture is wonderful and I want to be in North Africa. The cast is amazing and Marlene Dietrich is a big plus and of course her impressive and I loved her in this film. Basil Rathbone is also very good in this movie. I can not get over the scenery and sets ... hotel, palm trees, desert, all of which ... legionnaires also bring the concept of "Beau Gusty" to the picture. They certainly do not make movies like this anymore. Do not fail to see this classic!
