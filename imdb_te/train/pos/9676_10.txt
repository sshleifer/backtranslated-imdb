The picture is very sweet and hearty! I watched the movie almost every time I watched it. I would recommend this film to everyone. This film inspired me. Actors did a great job of acting, and the film was well played and done. The film is about a little girl from a parrot named Pali. <br /> <br /> When Paulie experienced a lot of people, he ended up in a basement in a basement. Finally this Russian man got a job as a gates. He found Paul in the dungeon and started talking to him when he told his life story. Finally, the man returned to Polly's back to Marie (a little girl who raised Pauli). Love surpasses all obstacles.
