This is a great movie with good actors, all of them hitting the cylinders. And when Dianne Keaton is her best, it's better than that. But Tom Everett Scott, always underestimated, is also good. He must be a star. <br /> <br /> My full complaint is with an item of screenplay. None of the characters ever realized that the dead daughter was not always a good person. And Keaton is not even her mother. At one point she made a promise to a character not to reveal that she was asleep. <br /> <br /> One of the other commentators said the movie was a "political agenda". It's a blocking thing to say. There is no politics in this film.
