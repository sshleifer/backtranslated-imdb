The film will get my stamp approval. The scene in the museum is requested to act without dialogue. It is one of the most interesting and unique scenes in cinema history. Dickinson's character Kate is well developed and her performance is thought to be throughout the film. Best work done from Angie Dickinson Point Blank!
