Rachel McAdams. Cylian murphy. Wes Craven. Dream Team. This is one of the best thrillers of 2005. A great story. A great twist. A great eye candy. This is one of Wes Craven's greatest films from "Scream" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street". It's the best. The plot is one of the best things about the movie and it's easy. Lisa Reisert (McAdams) is a struggling hotel manager, late late Red Eye boards in LA. She did not know that she followed Jackson Ripper AKA Jack the Ripper (Murphy). They have a couple of drinks and end up sitting on the plane. He later reveals to her that he was a killer sent to kill Secretary of Homeland Security who is staying at Lisa Hotel. And what will it do with Lisa? Well, she has to move her room to the top, so they can bomb him, if Ripner does not murder her father (Brian Cox). Twist and bringing the story really gives extra jing and side characters and side jokes really add it. Overall, definitely one of 2005's best thrillers. Definitely worth it. <br /> <br /> In the 4 1/4 stars
