I hold this concert in public television and know that I have it. The Boys Complete an incredible, often thrilling performance for everyone in Royal Albert. <br /> If you're a cream fan (or you're a unstated, intense, and appreciative spectator, all of them are leaving their bottle rockets at home) If only they heard); If you're a blues fan; If you're a rock 'n' roll fan; You will not be disappointed when you view and listen to this DVD. You will never lose this DVD even if you do not give it anytime. (This DVD justifies self-reliance! Tell them to own them!) It's very nice and very replayable; You may want to keep it easy to reach.
