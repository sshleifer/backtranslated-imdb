This is a different kind of review. I've seen this movie twice on TV and have a copy because my favorite time is talking about Panama City and Beach in the winter. I saw Ashley Judd as the first film and she was great and I enjoyed every other thing she saw, directed by Victor Nouzez and Sun Dance's reaction to me and also directed a number of films about Florida. This film speaks to me and I do not see anything to compare. This place speaks to me less than the surroundings. Well, I told you it would be a different kind of review.
