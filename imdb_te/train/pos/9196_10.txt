Kimi Wa Peto A girl is a beautiful story that one day she found a boy in a box outside her baby. She decides to bring him up and decides to fix his cuts. Since she had to go to work, she left a note when she went home to eat some food for her. When she comes home she learns that she is there. He wants to live with her, such as a brother or a relative. If she is in her despair to leave him, he says that he has stayed. And she said she would do what she told her that she had no rights as a pet. (That's not on the poverty line!) She agrees to wonder, and since then he's called Momo, her pet.
