This is great in Pure Orson Wells intellectual films. To illustrate Wells as a murderer, he is referring to a sarcastic comment with "the big dummy I am". The plot is very complicated, I do not know yet and the victim knows that he is losing his life. The shootout scene in the Carnival Hall of Mirrors is one of the most spectacular ever shot. The value of entry to that view alone is worth the price. This is the only time Rita Hewever has ever played a critical and reliable role. No one but Wells cut her hair and it would have brassy elegant colored nerve. No one should not miss this movie.
