I do not know why this film is going to be beat up. Jeez. It's mindless, it's not polished and it's (I'm reading) some of the waste. The cast of the film plays their roles in 'T' (yes if you see a permanent midnight and Ben Stiller is a fan). These are misleading, well-intentioned misfits trying to protect the city / world, but nothing with grit and will. The problem is that they do not realize their limitations until the big showdown and that point! The Spy Who Shedded was shot three times by you and the same population group, the first film that first saw the sequel comparing it to the sequel. I can not get it. Jokes work on a level more then; If you do not, I know what level you are on.
