"Holi" is a problem-driven film, but it is not durable or overly moody. The lost soul with Patrick (Ron Livingston), a slow waking conscience and the holi (thi nuuyuan), is a character-based film that is virtually unsuccessful without its disappearances, a strong fridge, but ultimately a young Vietnamese girl who fits most. From powerful places and photography to effective editing, everything is well and well done. The contemporary classical score may initially curtail some, but it underscores the outstanding temperament of the finest lyrical composition and apparently visible. This film increases a lot of problems, but offers some clear-cut answers that eventually end up with a lot of understanding and compassion that share Holi and her plight. This is the grandeur of those who were able to do it.
