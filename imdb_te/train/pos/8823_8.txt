Good picture. A fictitious story tells us that we are trapped in social situations and act so vigorously to act differently. Or at least the feeling: if you break one you have to break each rule. If you want to express love for someone you do not know, how can you create a social situation? What about the fascism of making decisions on the cultural life of others and what kind of culture that covers our voice? What is the right to determine what Disney or Fox or suicide bomber chooses. One person is not allowed to drink coffee in the morning. Do we hear the NRJ cry, do we have to see stupid tabloid headlines and street commercials before we have our morning coffee?
