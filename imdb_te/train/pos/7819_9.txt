What a movie! I did not expect Richard Attenborough to make such a film. Unlike Ben Kingsley's performance, Gandhi always left me differently, I never thought Attenborough was a good filmmaker. But Cry Freedom has had my interest like some movies in recent times. It is a wonderful, lovely political film with great performances by Kevin Kline and young Denzel Washington. <br /> <br /> Klein plays Donald Woods, editor of South Africa newspaper editor, Steve Biko. It begins as a difficult friendship, seeing Woods Blow as a black admirer of hatred against whites. But with his kind words, lively attitude and full transparency, Bicco wins on Woods and introduces him to the discord that Woods does not know anything. <br /> <br /> Bicco is a sacred, law-abiding citizen who stands against all abuse and system that keeps his people. One night, coming from an illegal meeting, he was arrested and beaten to death. Officials try to run the matter, as Bigo became a huge figure in South Africa. But by Woods's efforts comes true. But what should have happened Woods becomes just a nightmare and his family has become a target for secret police. <br /> <br /> This film has an interesting structure. It actually has two stories: it first describes the life and death of biko. <br /> <br /> The second half, less interesting, explains that Woods is trying to escape South Africa to publish a book. About biko. Woods is a state enemy, who is forbidden, meaning that he can not meet people or leave his country. Plus he's constantly spied by the police. <br /> <br /> The first half is quite straightforward, and the second makes editing interesting things by displaying the oppression of Biko's past and the oppression against the strike. Black South Africans. Some argue that this is very interesting, but the latter half is attractive to me as Woods and his family make a brave plan to escape South Africa. In tears. The score of George Fenton and Jonas Gwangva has to do with it. Although Fenton's fan (never retaining Gandhi scores), the film is always beautiful for Cry Freedom. In the film, thanks to the musicals who marry powerful images, sometimes it has reached an amazing summit of emotion. <br /> <br /> Freedom is not exactly a movie to look for the image of Denzel Washington. This is a movie that is full of love. Acting, writing, music, compilation, cinematography are in perfect synthesis to create the odys for the power of the human soul. The film is also accompanied by films such as The Pianist, Life Is Beautiful and The Shawshank Redemption.
