The film is the first in the trilogy of the Moyques Triad Society, and the trilogy is a great beginning. Movies in the trilogy are only interactive, and you are clearly visible in all of these pictures, if you look closely. Shinjuku Triad Society is about a policeman trying to prevent his kid brother to take part in a vast gang of outsiders, struggling their way above Tokyos yakuza. Kid's brother is a lawyer, and the film is growing because of the need for a trusted gang. The film takes place in a very harsh environment, so it is pretty violent and hard. Michael has done much worse, but it's a very hard movie because you are very difficult. As always, most homosexual sexual desires are also high. This film is a gangster movie in many ways, but it is great drive and genuine gratitude. If you've only seen Miikes distant movies (Ichi Killer, Fudoh etc.) it is worth checking out from a compromise sort between these ages and his aggressive over-the-top style of his movies, trilogy's other films. And at all times with Michael, you should not forget at least two scenes in this (you can see them by yourself). <br /> <br />
