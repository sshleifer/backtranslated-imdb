I went back, as an adult and my summer days spent in the camp ... I was very fast there. The camps I went to are not this great. They are mosquitoes actually carry people off but they're in Texas where horses and fishing have. The film's cinematography is awesome, especially the funny and reliable characters Perkins, Polach and Arkins. Sam Raimi's role and sub-pulp are precious. So anytime I think this film is slippery ... because they can not temporarily ban their trust because they can not imagine the life of the camp or never have children. All the people were allowed to return and have a child again, so they made every opportunity. I want to do it. It takes me back with fun, intelligent, beautifully written, brilliant casting and artistry, so I also want to see for the scene. Like dancing with wolves and lady hawk ... good movies but forest actors become more of a character. Give it a rent, see, buy it and look up and down ... never old. ; 0)
