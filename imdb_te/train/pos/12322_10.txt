This film is one of my favorites. This is a style blend with elements of action / horror / romantic- / commenter. Some special effects appear to be older compared to modern standards. This small error is easily omitted. There is a lot to find in this story. Sexual relationship between the two main characters is so pretty that it hurts. Visuals are very beautiful. This action was surprising, the birthplace of the world's best action films originated from HomeCong. Humor sometimes feels a little silly but in a good way. Somehow this film keeps balancing different moods and being good. Absolutely recommended.
