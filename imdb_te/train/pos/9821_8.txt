I saw this movie in True Movies (which made it skeptical) but in fact - that's fine. Why? Because of the amazing plot twists or breathtaking conversations (most of these are), but in reality, what I was saying was that I thought it was accurate in the depiction of young people dealing with the story. <br /> <br /> Dawson's Creek is cool, witty characters who breeze through sexually explicit sexuality, they are not elegant. They're kids and they work like kids. <br /> They are vague, embarrassing and confusing for everyone. Yes, this could be accidental and they are just bad actors but I do not think so. Dermot mulruni (when not enough to be cool) gives me very unbelievable performance and I love him for that. Patricia Arquette is hurt and annoying, but she is pregnant and a young man? The combination of the two is certainly not lavender on your pillow. But what's the plot most speculative and I believe in them, his insistence and inability to bear - she was daring, yet a little more misleading effort to bring. I played the roles and the others, but they are not really annoying and unbelievable. It reflects the surreality of the situation they are, he is sitting in class and walks the premises with her baby. I felt angry for her, I was angry with him for being such a child and blaming her. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what you want,
