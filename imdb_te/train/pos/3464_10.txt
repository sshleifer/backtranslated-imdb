* Caution * Spokes coming forward ... The authors of this story are well aware of these men. Actors have similarly filmed them well. The result is the end of the movie you'd really like watching John Lennon and Paul McCartney. There are expected tensions, especially in the first seconds of the awkward. But as both begin to unravel, the old Camararium, who works with The Beatles, begins to show by well. Bitter is still present, and occasional breaks, but John is thinking of taking Larn Michaels on his proposal to appear on "Saturday Night Live" in "Saturday Night Live", while playing the hornbill's tough nightclubs with Liverpool's teenage pranks, and superstarding managed. But in the end, this spectacular fantasy gently scattered us. Before the murder of Lennon, the Beatles reminisce never became possible: the two driving forces of the group made each other a lesson.
