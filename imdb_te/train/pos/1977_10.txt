I really love this movie. One time when I was in 2nd grade, my teacher showed us on the 16mm movie reel. This film, however, will be frightening for the 2nd graders as Bill scene I've seen Nancy Bill killed and the fagin's face for the first time on screen. One of my cousins ​​was sick at seeing this movie because she studied music class. If I were a teacher and could have been able to grade the people who made this amazing film, I would give them an A +.
