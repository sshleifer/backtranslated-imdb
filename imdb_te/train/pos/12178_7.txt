I think this movie got a lower rating because I decided to have the worst moments. There is a diary joke and an awkward nut-scratching scene, but there are quite a few moments that make me scream from afar. Jason Lee performs some awesome subtle comedy in the film and Julia Styles is pretty jolly. Apart from this movie behaves like a very romantic comedy, about 40 minutes later you know how it's going to end. (Most of them are better than you, you already know after +/- 5 minutes). Anyway, better movies should look but certainly not the worst choice ... cheers
