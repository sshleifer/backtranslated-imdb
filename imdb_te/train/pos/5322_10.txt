A real dark nair film and a very graphic film that continues to liberate the good storyline of a man, may be too late. Visually amazing scenes to do with a little budget is artfully amazing. Gareth Maxwell is looking forward to the next project with full marks and new ideas for the Roberts and Team, but hopefully more British actors are great. Having seen her before Lisa Ray looked lovely and hope to see her again in the future. All is related to sex, drugs and violence. Bring it up. I will definitely check if this is a rent and a mood for a semi-moody noir.
