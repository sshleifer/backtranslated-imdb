<br /> <br /> Historical accuracy can be questionable ... (and with such an unattainable LOTR's mass appeal .. such things are now easily forgiven) I liked Art Ness. Not really an art house movie. It provides little emotional charges from time to time. <br /> I have two complaints. 1. It is very small. <br /> 2) Quality: 10/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Replayable: 5/10
