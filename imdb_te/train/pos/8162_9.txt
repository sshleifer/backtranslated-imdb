<br /> <br /> As Dr. Alan Feinstone, Corbin Bernsen falls in an amazing upset with "The Dentist". <br /> <br /> In his high gear, his obsessive compulsive tendencies, IRS housing, and very suspicious acting wife; <br /> <br /> Dr. Alan Feinstein is losing most of his innocence every day. <br /> When he realizes that his wife has ties with a local pool boy, violence, murder, and an entire turmoil! "Dentist" is a solid image! Bernsen can play the role of Dr. Feinstone at the same time. Although he is not entirely out of his wallet, the audience still has sympathy for him. <br /> My friends have good acting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Incredible directing, good killings and gore, and effective movements make fun of all the movies. <br /> Most recommended!
