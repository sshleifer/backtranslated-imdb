It was the first television episode of the Colombo series (which was filmed after "Death Lands a Hand") and left one of the most successful TV series in history. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy tries to measure Smugs, Pride and Self-Guaranteed equality, as Ken Franklin, a half of a secret writing group that has worn an extensive plot to kill his partner, Jim Ferris (played by Martin Milner). Franklin Franklin is not just a good publisher than a good publisher. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " This is a Colombo murderer. <br /> <br /> Peter Faulk plays the role of Colombo and the characteristic qualities and abstractions of the character in his role, underlined by a fraudulent slack and absence of character, the serious self-esteem of the character: in their opening scenes that meet the story of Ken Franklin's killing One, Expo-Franklin, which does not exist of Jim Ferris Olamboku the potential motivation and Colombo (intentionally or anonymously) without references have failed, Franklin his disappointment that the incentive scheme for its expression and detective books Mrs. Melville does not match him. <br /> <24 year old Steven Spielberg is also noteworthy for the first direct work. Nevertheless, some basic additions of cameras and shading cameras add some beautiful and elaborate touches to the general pursuit of the episode. When Ken Franklin responds to a phone call to the frustrated wife of Ferris, a special film, Jim Ferrer's dead body, is almost dark in the front, when he makes a glass in the background. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the second murder event is compulsory by a blackmail scheme, a friend who is a friend of Franklin's (and ridiculously Colombo "sloppy") stealth out of her full case. The cutting edge of the plot has been compromised and the screen time between Falk and Cassidies is reduced in this phase, and the script-writer (Stephen Bocho) can not develop a single story without a single murderer to get out of the hard corner. <br /> <br /> This climax is the most disappointing aspect of this episode. The initial terminology and phrase conversion between Falk and Cassidy is strong and efficient, but it promotes the fact that it is most episode. The main crushing coin clue (which is called a clue) is: the emptiness and pride of the cassidy role is exhilarated by a clue that is very little to understand his guilt; <br /> <br /> All of the problems associated with such ingenuity, such as maintaining high standards and most importantly, create a credible and intelligent brilliant ending, pretending that everything is good about Colombo, and, of course, a bold opening for the pre-rolling series.
