The film combines all the usual ingredients of a Dawid Dhawan comedy - male heroes, buffoonish supporting characters, heroines, evil villains, voicescocks, rocking soundtrack + choreography and a slight dose. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda are in the role of police and kammen. Ravi Krishnan and Raveena Govinda are in police custody of Amitabh police. Heroines are simple, just round-filling objects. The commanders have no leaders. Paresh Rawal DAUD takes forward his villainous move (he also played such dawn in KHOOBSURAT). Asrani shines in a brief role. <br /> <br /> Govinda is not normal - with intelligent knowledge, good humminator police like Paray Mohan and a Common Chot Mian. He mimicked Hindi-style Bihari style with delightful results. Amitabh Bachchan, believing it or not, likes him. But AB is still good. Madhuri Dixit has acted in his role in the song "Makhna". She will dance as air. <br /> <br /> The beauty of music is great. Check the "Kisi Disco Main Jane", "Makhnah" and the title track. <br /> <br /> It's a comedy and do not look at any screenplay without any convenience. Just have fun.
