I find it hard to like someone in this movie. Lindy and Michael Chamberlain's main characters, whose daughter disappeared during a night in the Australian back, is not bad people, but then it is not necessarily bad for all the people who see it throughout the film. We know them well. Although we are sure that the Chamberlain's guilt or innocence, since the film has opened up the tragic confusion of our life, the film will have more or less social view of satire, news media, groups, groups. And predictions. Not particularly an image of Australia's depleted society; It's an account of the true story that happened there. <br /> <br /> A wardrobe is more restrictive due to the press, newspapers and TV programs that when a randomly damaged, a randomly damaged dog kills all the dogs, the unfortunate truth is contrary to the level of drama that can trigger its users, So that empathy or look outside of any kind There is no sign of one's life and those around tunnatluga criticism seriously and dramatically influenced by the left and right side. <br /> <br /> The evidence against Lindy Chamberlain, the suspicion is largely jet-fueled by her virtue. She did not have enough addiction to the eyes of the people and her daughter's death. Why is she to keep cool, even a sort of aloofness TV and press, allowing her not only to hold her head? Does the media behave more in the public interest? Meril Streep, if not, a great actress who works on this day, specifically stands out, and clearly does not make any other actor, or film-making department. But she, and the authors, understands Lindy. It is not difficult to be angry. Apparently, it is not natural to show emotional expression in any case. <br /> <br /> She is also a success for her performance as soon as Sophie's Choice, the Devil Wears Prada, whether Angels in America or other work. This makes the audience harder when you deliberately reject them. We do not know what we think we are thinking, because she disappoints us. <br /> <br /> She married a pastor, and they both practice a religion. Small minority and therefore very misunderstood. In the beginning, they will respond to their loss, beginning with a rumor mill that conveys the idea that their daughter's death is a part of the killing of karma, in harmony with God's will. Whatever happens to young children, her parents can not immediately figure out how many people are in the media, so the first parents followed the starry pack ... well ... <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep and Sam Neal are constantly on the screen, but the Australian people here are real Leeds plays. Each plot is a break-up before the director Fred Schipesse goes to the tennis court at the office for the saloon, and people tend to lindy and take them into their own emotional plans. <br /> <br /> This Golan-Globus docudrama is not particularly memorable. The atmosphere of this exhibition does not give enough enthusiasm to the performance, it has shown that the product's performance or content does not exist. But an indictment of the collective knowledge of people has been very successful.
