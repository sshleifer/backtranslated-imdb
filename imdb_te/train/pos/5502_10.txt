Whether this film is promoted or not (I'm not sure), it really shows the power of the media. The significance of this documentary does not show how well Chavez is good for man. The Bolivians see how this happened, and it is really true to see Chavez's way of looking at it. Although it is mistaken and bias in support of the film, I think the opinion shown in the film is completely legitimate. The Venezuelan private media corporation has only seen a side view of the insurgency, the Neo-Liberal side by the Venezuelan people. This film shows us how Bolivarianis have seen. Call campaign, I will say that you will call judgment on your part.
