I first saw this film when it came first. I am 9 years old. <br /> <br /> The Basic Plot: This expedition was sent from Earth to the fourth planet of the Altair, and <br /> <br /> The theme: Introduction to a low level civilization (ie ours) to find out what happened to a settled colony, The remnants of the well-developed alien civilization, the cereal-200,000 years have been removed. The "seed" of destruction from a civilization is unknown, not previously known. The theme of this image is very good. Evil. <br /> When I first came out with my brother, I first saw this film. I'm a boy and the tiger scenes are not really intimidated, and it has not seen the invisible organism-force war scenes. <br /> <br /> The truth of the "originally banned knowledge" is actually an advancement that meets my attention and how much we can do it. (At anytime) we develop more advanced with a modern (alien) civilization than what is present. Advanced technology and responsibility will go hand in hand. We must work to gain knowledge along with the knowledge of how to use advanced technology. <br /> <br /> I learned in Graduate School that I was "better in knowledge" and not actually appropriate. [Potentially] energy "depending on the power of the knowledge" (if you've ever applied it) [you do not know, but how you use what you know!] <br /> The effect of the film may be understood somewhat in Mankind's own future, not knowledge and self, Wisdom really depends on really restricting our fate or we are mugs like Kel in the movie <br /> <strong> Thanks to those who responded to previous versions of this article, they are all very appreciated! I hope you enjoyed this story as I have been in the last 40 years. <Br /> Rating: 10 are 10 stars
