I really like the Mookis movies about Yakuza, this is what I have seen about 2 years ago and this is really over my head. Never before seen such unhealthy and distorted things. The story is good and the actors do their thing well. I did not see the UK or Japan version, but I have to say I believe the German DVD is a bit sensor. If you do not see the movie already and live in Germany, it's good to watch DVD from Neanderlands or Austria. <br /> <br /> "I have a lot of hard and nasty scenes on i-on DVD, but if I do not have something at showdown, one or two About the very small scenes.With crazy characters and high level of violence, that's what I like Miike !!
