The film begins very slowly, with a volunteer Wallace Naplum at the Photos Service Drop-Station. His wife was restricted to ankle bracelet as a result of his body's skin. <br /> <br /> When looking at Wallace's disappointing life, suddenly something new and jarring comes: the carnival of the journey comes to town. Walters Naplum, Wallace's brother among its actors. He is a clown, but he has a special talent. <br /> Wallace does so. They are two pyrotechnists or "pyrrotics", people with the ability to start fires through mental energy. Wallace keeps his powers secret; <br /> <br /> Spoiler: Their variations go back to a small children's event, where they accidentally suffer irritation. Wallace returns without using his powers; Wilder wants to go public on national TV. <br /> <br /> We want to treat Walters Wallace's wife. She becomes a controversial bone and the brothers eventually have a literal gun. <br /> <br /> This movie is entertaining, but not laughable. I do not think it's enough to have a copy in my library. This is a good offbeat film.
