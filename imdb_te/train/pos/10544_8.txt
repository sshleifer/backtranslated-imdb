Well, "Cube" (1997), Vincenzo's first film, is one of the most interesting and tricky ideas I've seen when talking about movies. They have just one scene, some actors and a plot. So, it's all in a special direction, great dialogues and characters make a hideous situation so special to deal with as mice in a labyrinth. <br /> <br /> "Cyper" (2002), his second film, is about its story, but it is not as good as "cube", but again there are characters that are tested as rats. <br /> <br /> "Nothing" is a very interesting thing and Vincezo returns to his 'cube days' lock, locking characters once again in a very different place at any time once he plays with characters like playing with rats in his feel room. Instead of thriller science fiction (false advertising teasers and trailers are also false), "Nothing" is a loose and light comedy, which is certainly called modern society about our society and we live on the impatience world. Once again Vicenzo amaze us with a great idea into the very small kind of thing. 2 actors and a blinding white scenario, you got a lot of time and you do not need more than that. <br /> <br /> "Cube" is a claustrophobic experience and "cipher" is confusing, "Nothing" is completely opposite but at the same time is undesirable. <br /> <br /> This film is once again a smart idea, just a millionaire budget. However, the film sometimes fails, but its main purpose is to understand and overcome any defects. Everything is a wonderful surprise and there is nothing more about this film because I have a different experience that I have from movies "cube".
