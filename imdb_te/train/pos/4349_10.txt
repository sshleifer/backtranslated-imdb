His son Ben Kleinman (Paul Riser) is very surprised to hear that his mother, Muriel Cleman (Olympia Dukakis), left his father. Ben's wife Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins) and his three sisters attempted to identify Murale, and Ben and his father saw a farmhouse that was sold to it. Their road trip will become a long therapy session between Ben and his father. Ramand de Felita director The Thing About My Folks (2005) .Paul Raiser is behind the screenplay and he has done a great job. The conversation between Ben and Sam is just amazing. And has worked with the script for twenty years, is not it better than Who is better than Peter Faulk? No one can tell you. And I really love this role for Peter Faulk. One beats and then sticks him with the stick. The film is often very funny and I have found myself smiling too many times. But it can be touched from time to time. You can not tell any story better than what is said here.
