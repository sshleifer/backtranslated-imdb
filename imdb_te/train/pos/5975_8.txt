Every film critic and metal head hated the film but I enjoyed it. I have seen this kid on TV anywhere and was surprised by Sammy's performance as a trick or treat by coming up on the stage and fast way. <br /> <br /> The film gets a skipper from Mattress Place from Melrose Place, so the record of Tony Fields from Skippy Jenny Simmons gets him comfortable and all hell The breaks are lost, Tony singing (lip-sinches) and dancing for a metal song before hitting the fan before the shit. </ p> <p> Most errors and items, but music and all images are enough to send my fists to 10 to 8
