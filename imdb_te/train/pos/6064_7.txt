I started by telling you how I came across this film. It's the winter time in Alaska in 1990. A friend from Australia has been with me and my girlfriend in an apartment's shoe box. A bit cruel and many people stay at home, drink heavily and watch anything that's available on television. I discovered this image outside the savings store savings store in a snowbank and soon there is a treasure new. This is probably the best movie ever.We have been drinking fish and fish for two weeks of watching this movie.We have seen many times that we sometimes have to turn to television or to make a full filling effect for the effectiveness of the film. True gem. Smiles will never be a nonstop and memories forever. If you watch this movie in a video store, steal it.You will not regret it!
