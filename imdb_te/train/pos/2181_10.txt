<br /> Artistically portrayed actors have correctly cast their role. You get a real feel of lounge going from poverty to a very beautiful girl. Trying again with tragedy in tragedies. Overall, I saw this film at least 10 times. And Very Well Prix de Beat '(Beauty Prize, Miss Europe) can say that my silent favorite in my silent motion picture collection. The expression of Louis Brooks is perfect and I recommend to the film anyone who appreciates artistic beauty, along with the tragic story.
