The Big Rock Candy Mountain is amazing. I saw it when I was young and still do today (senior high school). If I could imagine heaven, it would be the same. I want to live in large rock candy mountains, where the candy trees grow over. Zach Hyman Professor, and my best friend. Little bunny foo man foo. It is mess and colorful that night I dream about it. In fact, my friend watched it for 18 years and it totally enjoyed it. I recommend people of all ages to watch this movie. I have a huge party this weekend with my friends to watch this wonderful movie. We are going to see the pizza order and teddy bears Gilk. I constantly looking at the clouds and wishing that little girl that I had to visit. Thank you. Bye.
