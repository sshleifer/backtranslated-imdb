I saw this morning at the Legacy Theater in the Joseph Smith Memorial building in Salt Lake City. <br /> <br /> However, I'm going to think that the level of experience in the film is based on a person's level of acceptance of the story of Joseph. <br /> <br /> However, it is aside, well acted, and a nice score. If you come to Salt Lake City, it is necessary to look at Legacy Theater. I have never been in the Narker Theater for all my life's image quality, sound quality and atmosphere ... I'm surprised that the church will let me see Batman Begins! I'm LDS and I felt like Joseph as a prophet, and when I touched myself in many places and brought it to tears ... I did not expect the tissues before they started the film! However, I have said that the film is available in many LDS visitor centers around the globe, if you check it for 70 minutes, if you do not believe Joseph Smith, he will tell you a fascinating story.
