As always, the controversial films have mixed reviews. You like it or you hate it, not everyone likes this movie. It shows the perspectives of these killers, the important thing I consider personally. You hate them, you can say that you understand them and feel like you're connected, but regardless of the school's thinking from different angles. <br /> <br /> The film is a fully hand-held camera and I think it works more realistic. This was completely out of their moves and their mission programs, leading to the big day of their "Zero Day" plan on a massacre in their school. Zero Day does not answer, but a glimpse into the lives of two disturbing young people just decides for the audience. Our feelings towards boys are a mix of sympathy and hatred, but we are confused why two common children do so. They are surprisingly simple and have been shown to ordinary young people in common life, and we can not expect a thing if they do not know that they plan (they are obvious throughout the whole movie, but acting is very good that both actors can be completely unknown. It's just a fictional movie However, Calvin and Andrey are similar to Eric Harris and Dylan Claybold (not in appearance, but in the process), Columbine is one of the most widely researched, I have seen similarities and that is exactly what it depends on. <br /> The real massacre The school was shown by surveillance cameras and I am now This is one of the greatest things that I have ever seen, and I'm totally in shock and it's a bit around, it's very real and good, and it's very hard. <br /> All Zero days is a fantastic picture, and everyone I think at least that should be checked. In the past, we have always branded the killers "psychiatric" and thought they were biased for failure or media impacts, but Zero Day had more intentions than with the intention of showing off, and after schoolmates we saw from the viewpoint of the killers.
