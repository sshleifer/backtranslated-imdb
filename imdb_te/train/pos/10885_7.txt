Twelve years ago, after the death of almost everyone in the building, the production of "Hot Blooded" was stalled. Earlier, though a rumor of the film was true, the couple decided to complete the film. <br /> <br /> When the screen was released, every nation saw its success and Australia seemed to want to make money. Today, the concept of death (a slasher image inside a slasher image) is relatively cool and original. The movie was considered to be the first film with this concept, as it was released before Urban Legends: Final Cut and Scream 3 (in America but in Australia). When Urban Legends 2 was released, many of us resented this feeling, because the film was not good, the film was destructive. Now, cut is not the best slasher image ever, or do not try it. It is known that it is a rip-off, and they also starred a girl who looks like Neve Campbell's blonde version in the role played. But instead of trying to add new and realistic twists to the story, some 80s slazer flicks like "Nightmare on Elm Street" and surprisingly enough, this actually works. The killer is very creepy and that mask is just a killer! Instead of intimidating the audience, they created a very good and creepy atmosphere that puts us in suspense most of the time. There are two plot holes in the movie, but I can not completely ignore, the end of the film is the biggest plot hole. Spoiler ahead I mean, they burned only a copy of the film, so that they found the print on the final scenes they found in hell? I will tell you this. The end of spoilers. All in all, the cut is a pretty creepy slasher film with a silly story but I consider it one of the better Scream Rip-offs I've ever made this big. I was shocked that I never had a sequel to this, but I guess I just got too late. <br /> <br /> The Australian Slauss Flick with suspicion with less fears. Cut is still a pretty neat slasher film and I would recommend this one even though I consider the story quite crazy from being totally ridiculous.
