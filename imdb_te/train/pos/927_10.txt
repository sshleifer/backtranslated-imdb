"Father of Pride" is another of good performances that are unfortunately not in a long life. And almost all of the time, pretty sad, if you admit despite the similarity of the show and the "The Simpsons", it has its own benefits in the program, almost all of the worst performances in the air (I think in "Simple Life"). Animation is not enough, not just enough, but it is good .The best characters. All the animals are very fond of and funny, and even their moments with Sigfrid and Roy. <br /> <br /> Although the show is not quite original, I think it's very probable. "Mission Hill" is very popular but I liked it too, this is not appreciated it deserves. No shame.
