I can never forget when I see this title in the video title. I was always a big weird al fan and I rented it when I saw this video. I'm very young at the time I was at a very young age to congratulate all about the subtle humor and irony of all, but I must remember much when I was young enough to understand what I was looking for. If you're an "al" fan, especially his previous work, you will fully enjoy this movie. It takes place in the MTV-esque "rockumentary" style and tells a real (but sometimes exaggerated) story to find out where he was in 1985. You are the brand of his humor and more importantly, his music.
