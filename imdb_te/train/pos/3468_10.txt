I absolutely loved this movie! I thought it was very painful because I was hesitant to see it first. I remember how hard it was when John was shot. Nevertheless, seeing "two of us" came back to the happiest time when he was alive and had hope and opportunity. I think the author I wrote made a wonderful job. Aidan queen Paul met adorable and challenging head. I am impressed with his voice and habits. Jared Harris is also very talented and very confident as John. My favorite parts of the park and the ceiling scene is a scene - it's very sharp. The film has made me sad and satisfied, both of which I feel fit and are in harmony with the situation.
