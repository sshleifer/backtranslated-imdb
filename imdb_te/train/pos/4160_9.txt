One word to describe this movie and it is unnatural. It was Japanese animation because I had a record of this day and I thought it was interesting. Well, this film is about to get a metal body that travels to the universe about a young boy so he seek revenge. On the way he meets the most colorful characters and if he wants the body, then finally decide. Very strange, if you're an animation / science fiction fan, you might want to check it out.
