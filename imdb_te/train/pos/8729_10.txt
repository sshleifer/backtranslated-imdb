Bugs Life is a very good animated feature. This film is for young children, but it's a great movie for my age people. This story is about an ant called Flick. He brought ruin to his colony when he destroyed the food for the rich grasshoppers. He was expelled and he needed to find big bugs to solve the mess. It's a good movie because this film is a classic and it's a Pixar movie. The animation in the late 90s is amazing. The story is good, but a little more detail. Voice acting is good with many animated films. The music is nice to hear. Nothing is unique, but it was nominated for one of the music genres. Overall, this film made me wonder. This is a good picture for all families. I rate this movie 10/10.
