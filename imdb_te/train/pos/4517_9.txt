With this, it's easy to take less shots. You know, the guy with the hair legs is trying to look like Marilyn Monroe. Not here - Adrian Pasdar Gerald makes a wonderful job of making a real person, someone you care about deeply about, and as a result you feel for his feel of trying to live both Gerald and Geraldine. Not only that, but like Geraldine, he looks hot! And chemistry power between him and Julie Walters. Both are the two characters who love each other, and even if they see each other in the breakfast table. The powerful storytelling of corporate possession is also believable, and in the end you will be happy! At least I did!
