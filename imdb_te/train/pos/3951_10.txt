I saw this movie on TV and it was not repeated. This is strange because you'll see the rubbish repeated over and over again. Usually horror movies are fun for me, but this really frightened me. </ P> <br /> <br /> If there is a bit of horror, the towns where there is a bit of horror is when the preacher chooses where his wife is almost dead (they'd be poisoned). He asked me who you are hell anyway. Each gives their true identities. The girl who is deaf to the corrupt, says, "I'm a witch who loves Adam before Eve."
