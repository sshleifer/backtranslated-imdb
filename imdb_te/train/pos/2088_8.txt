From the top class of great classic books, this amazing story comes from Pearl Buck. The book is a book like "Good Earth." This narrates the story of Wang Lung (Paul Muni), a small Chinese farmer who went to the 'Great House' and took his wife, O'Lan (Louis Rainier), who opened his day and made his wife. From the beginning, she will change her kindness by saving her small breeding offspring by planting her new home. In the following years, O'Lan proved her worth by sharing her husband's hard work, difficulties and changing fortunes. During the passing years, they grow up a family and see their normal home environment both with feast and drought. In fact, in the shortest way in their lives, everyone recognizes the value of symbiosis, loyalty and love. With changing times, their growing family both help and threatens friends and relatives, like their uncle (Walter Connolly) a scoundrel and Charlotton, but kindly coughing. Wang advises and advises his 'old father' (Charlie Grapevine) the weak and fickle nature of life. The two most notable actors in the film, Ken Loch, Wang's Elder Son and Philip Ahn, played as a national soldier. The film is in black and white and is awesome from the novel. Highly recommended for all audiences. ****
