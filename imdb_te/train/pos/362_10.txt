In 1985 (my birthday) Steven Spielberg visited an emotionally strong and unforgettable story of a young African-American girl Sally (Debut's character for Woopie Goldberg) whose life is in tough times. This story dates from 1909. Her father gave birth to two children. Seli has a small sister net, she is inseparable. A husband shares his eyes on the net, but their father gives him Seal. It is at the start of the terrible misuse and continuous control period. Women are fewer men and especially an African American woman whose rights are less than zero. Seale's story is a true survival story. <br /> <br /> "The Color Purple" is the main character of the SpecialBook and the lowest estimate. <br /> <br /> He wants to make a good drama "The Color Purple" and "Schindler's List". <br /> The cast is wonderful. Wupee Goldberg is a good running comedian with a round-the-clock romance, but since Seilly is a wonderful word, she can really get a huge drama. Danny Glover surprisingly evil "Mr.". I have never seen such a bad character. <br /> <br /> Tonk Show Icon Oprah Winfrey is a very intelligent Sophia who is very intelligent. <br /> Warning! You have several tissues when looking at this picture. You can connect the really strong sister story. <br /> <br /> Big praise to Mr. Spielberg!
