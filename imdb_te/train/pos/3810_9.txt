This is my first review of the IMDb, I do not really write one but since now there are only 2 for this great movie, I can not add my perspective ... and not, I do not relate to the filmmakers (yes ye are you here already; - )) I'm in my late 20s <br /> <br /> I'm really limited to the creators' imagination that I really like animated films And they are very attractive in this regard. Not quite in terms of story but very unique and imo achieving the latest visual style. After all, the movie works well as the characters look good but look very real and it is a fairy-like world. But the themes and the world are full of magnificent visuals that my jaw dropped down in the background. The blue-bunny-like mini-dragon steals this program and has some of the funniest moments of the film easily, he is already an instant classic with Scrat from Ice Age. The story is not very surprising (the anti-heroes go out of a bunch and you will slay the biggest dragon you can imagine) but the movie watches and cares better if it sounds ;-) 1 point I have to point out, Emo has a very dark scenario, frightening in children 6-8 years Because I did not fit in very small sequences, this is some fine There has been very little, but very little mention of imoni. Anyway I have a great time looking at this and it just can not wait to hit stores in high-tech to see it again and again for the perfect beauty of it. <br /> For me, 8.5
