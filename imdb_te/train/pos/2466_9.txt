I did not pass four hours as soon as I saw this film. The film feels like there is always power and art to Hamlet. Those new speeches will also take place in new and innovative ways. And the cast is amazing, the bright star of Brannagh. It is a role that describes the role of his film, the power and the character. Creating a complete and complete version fills many holes and allows new appreciation of the tragedy in spite of length. In anticipation of a dark and dazzling fortress, we are treated to luxurious dinner for the eyes. That only came from the hamlet. Well worth your time, it's four hours.
