Perhaps this film is not one of the best Jackie Chan movies, but I think the Mall Fight is one of the best fighting scenes ever made. There were some memorable adventures that impressed the film as an action classics. The film has influenced many other action films and I would like to learn from the movie action producers these days (as I can remade that chase scene, so that I can make them better with modern technologies). There are some funny scenes that enjoy the film even when Jackie struggles. I think it will give more scenes in this film.
