"The Secret of the Lens" is probably pretty campy all the time favorite of mine. Kazawar Yoshi is the best and most ludicrous, called innocent and indispensable hantai-ekhi. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes are psychedelic CG sequences, Lord Helmis killing his unsuspecting servicemen, party riots (one of the funniest scenes) that lead to the Bill Riot. <br /> <br /> This warning is not for serious sophisticated anime fans !
