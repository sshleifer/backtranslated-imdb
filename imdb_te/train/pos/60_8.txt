"Home Room", such as "Zero Day" and "Elephant", was inspired by a recent wave of school shootings. But unlike the other two films, the "Home Room" focuses on two survivors (not shooters or killers) after a shooting. This makes it less expressive and more useful because a small effort is being wasted in asking questions without answers. <br /> <br /> Do not give up in this little picture during the first 20 minutes, playing the "Hill Street Blues" episode, which refutes the real story. It is dirty, but with it, the length of the running is at least soft to classify as a feature of the film. I would recommend jumping before these funny scenes-nothing else you can not get from the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Like the good little pictures, it is the creator of Paul F. Ryan and a man who is the director of the creativity. Although this setting does not guarantee a good film, it is usually a good sign, because it is often understood as a unity in construction and execution of large budget dramatic features. <br /> <br /> The script of "Home Room" is its true strength, so the writer also implemented the product and feared that he had brought his attention to the screen. <br /> <br /> Ryan tests the limits of the pale tolerance of the average viewer. He runs right up to the edge but falls crying instead of crying against all logic. This is why the end credits of some kind of audiences are needed at the end of this kind of journey, the song (Sarah McLaughlin's "Sweet Surrender") and he's a wonderful album in the final minute. The other strength of the film is the cast of the main characters Busy Phillips (Alicia) and Erica Christensen (Deena). Although Phillips portrays her authentic abusers Teenage and Christensen as her best daughter's daughter, both of them have more intensity for their roles. The two girls are more than satisfying family life and Ryan is less interested. A lone side story about a police detective who is wondering around the town trying to build a lonely shooter Alicia is all about what happens to them. If they ever cut back and cut the story of this film, the story must be condensed. <br /> <br /> A story about two very different girls bonding and helping each other is hardly a novel idea and Ryan easily makes this film cliche and predictable. Instead, his script takes them into an attractive and convincing sparring match, slowly moving away from each other and sharing the moments of vulnerability, and only going back into themselves. Dina's "I'm Dying Within" Line I thought you were as strong as that when you tears apart - I can not think of a moment in any other movie. She needs a connection that prevents Alicia just desperately. Deena progresses only when she leaves. <br /> <br /> Again, I know what to do ? I am only a child.
