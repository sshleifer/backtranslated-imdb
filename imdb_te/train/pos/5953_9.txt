I wanted Paramount to portray the film with Rodgers and Hart, but did not have copyright issues, so Burke and Van Hughes wrote among them that he was very good at Bing Crosby. </ P> <p> <br /> Leonard Malton has read that the film is "fitting a crossover for Crosby" and I could not do it well.

Paramount Technicolor was once used and Rhonda Fleming was not beautiful on the screen. <br /> <br /> William Bendix's Brooklyn roots are quite unreliable, but it has a good comic effect. Crosby, Bendix, and Sir Cedric Hardwick's trilogy is a good time for Rolling Nothing Bcc Doing Nothing. <br /> The third song he once and always sings with himself and Rhonda Fleming. The song was nominated for the best song, but lost from Baby's Cold Out Side. <br /> <br /> "Bob Hope, I love road pictures, but Bing has a humorous talent for himself and the movie is much better than any other. <br /> <br /> It is Crosby on top of his game.
