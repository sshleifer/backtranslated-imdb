I'm seeing these commercials, I'm thinking of it "NICK DONE because it's the" latest prince. "Well, I still love the latest prince, but George Lopez is a surprisingly good show and I love how to be conceivable Benny. The character is really funny to see how she is stupid and overemotional sometimes But it's a nice role, and yes, Angie is a little stereotypical, but she has her funny moments. Ha ha george has a big head! But he's pretty cool. Definitely should be on home improvement.
