The bloodiest gangster story taking place in the years of the Great Depression. It tells us about another brutal hitman, Michael (Mike) Salliwan. Something else, this time the story turns the other way: Mike fights to save his life and his only remaining son because the rest of his family was killed due to his own boss's dirty game. He succeeds with his vengeance, and his son receives an honorable future and eventually dies. <br /> <br /> Mike Sullivan is a senior character, Tom Hanks has been a great performer and played by Paul Newman, part of Mr. Rooney (mafia boss). The film is a great impression and we have heard the famous word "We Will Blow Banks". Even if you can guess that something from Sam Mendes is bigger after your American beauty, the film is still worth watching.
