Anthony Mann has done with five strains in the West in five Western countries with James Stewart, which is owned by a tough tailor's owner Jeff Webster, who takes cattle drive from Wyoming to Alaska through Seattle. On the north for his boat ride, he ties his partners with Seattle, with Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) and Ruby Morris (Jay C. Flippen). But first, he must put incomprehensible sidewalk hands, cheat ribout captains and Cai's attractions, and Rhonda Castle (Ruth Roman), who believes Jeff is a valuable friend in the future. <br /> When the captain looked forward to him (and justified) he hid him in the boat to kill a trail hand. <br /> <br /> Jeff Graveyard Gannon (John McIntyre) runs the city of Skagway in Alaska. Gannon climbs up Jeff to drive his cattle in the town and remove his public hanging. Jeff is jailed for his cattle ownership and Jeff. <br /> At this time, Jeff agrees to take Donson to Ronda to distribute suppliers. This is just a misuse of Jeff, Ben and Rubel to slip back into Skagway and steal cattle. <br /> <br /> Judge Ganon learns about it and is lagging behind, but Jeff is delayed with a rifle, but he falls in a race on the Canadian border over the Canadian border. Some of the other Skagway men in a sudden and another shootout, they eventually reach Dapsun, where Jeff sells his livestock to the highest bidder, which is Rodo, which immediately sets up a new gambling house in Dawson. Jeff took his money and bought the suit himself and began to pan for gold. <br /> <br /> But Judge Gannon comes up to Dawson to get out of action in the gold there, and Jeff tells him that he is frustrated with Skagway and wants to try his luck in Klondike, himself. This brought him a hired gun and forced him to steal other prisoners' claims. <br /> <br /> While Jeff and Ben are now on time to get out of the wells, Gibbon and Reuben dropped him off as a highly effective sheriff on his gang. <br /> <br /> Gannon's men have found out that they are lazy to go back to Ben's big mouth. Ben was killed and Jeff was seriously injured but did not save Judge Gunnan from his intellect. The overnight shootout in Dawson Street, a muddy, takes great care. First Jeff Gannon's best armored person (Jack Elm and Robert Wilki) was killed. Randa then comes out to warn Jeff, Gannan is trying to move around, Gannon turns her back and she dies in Jeff's hands. Then he hid under a wooden sidewalk and kills Gough. <br /> <br /> Another pan-Universal DVD Wide Screen printing with this Saraswati sin and a man from LaRammy why use Pan-and-Scan print instead of TCM, is beyond me. You can not see half the magnificent Alberta cinematography by William Daniels. If you like 50 well-written writings, then this is an A-list keeper. <br /> 10 to 8
