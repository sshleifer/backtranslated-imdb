When it came out I saw this movie in the theater. I grew up in Scottsdale and went to Arizona State and enjoyed the places I spent a lot of time. Recalling when thinking that Barbara's venture into a rock sound (actually R and B for my ears) was a successful one. I'm not a fan of Chris's singing until the last attempt to the New West. As a songwriter and actor, he has serious chops, IMHO. I think it's a good romance. I'd better than Judy Garland's version and Selznick's Janet Genner never saw the original. <br /> <br /> I believe that this is a long-awaited DVD release. Among other things, a packed Sun Devil Stadium is a long time and more dramatic since I remember the helicopter shot. I've done a good job writing in Chris or God's house, and I've put his original songs there. <br /> <br /> In the music, Chris and Barbara have some information from the fundamental source that music has a problem. While interviewing for my own new musical documenting Rocking the Boat: A Musical Conversion and Journey, I interviewed the best singer / songwriter / guitarist Stephen Brutton with Chris, Bonnie Root, and Delbert McClinton with a very professional and personal relationship. John Norman character's band in Stephen "Speedway". Chris has a real difficulty, especially a pop score passing for rock. Stephen and Chris's friend and long-time band member. The set had tension and at one time the band was chilling in the presence of Barbara. She said that the band should not talk to her. Chris reacted to him and his friends and they were rock and roll! Finally, Barbara was rounded up and decided to use Chris's live performances in the film and put Stephen in particular to work on things. After hearing this story, I got more respect for her as an artist. Much has been made as a diva. What's good for her. And I'm not gay. There is nothing wrong with that.
