******** Spoilers - be careful ********* <br /> <br /> What can I say? I'm biased when it comes to urban cowboy. <br /> <br /> I love and countless times - usually learn about it with every view <br /> <br /> The things that I like about it are not the wealthiest inhabitants of Urban Cowboy class people, LA or New York. <br /> <br /> Travolta Budd, a small town plays a Texas boy. The oil fields move to Houston to work. Travolta is actually playing good dramatic films such as Saturday Night Fever, instead playing bad guys / owls in the budget budget films. Mechanical bulls competition and two-stage dance may be crazy, but it should be enjoyed. <br /> Budd meets Sissy (Debra Winger slutty Brightness) - and soon, they are married and living in their dream trailer. But their relationship becomes a real life struggle of the sexes. Bud wants to be a real cowboy. Sissy wants to stay with a real cowboy. But in modern times, men's roles are not clear. Where do you prove that he is a real person? He can work his dangerous job on the day and ride the mechanical bull at night - he will be a "urban cowboy." But Sissy wants to drive his pickup truck, and she also wants to ride a mechanical bull. So where does this leave the bud? Sissy is about to ride the bull and flirts with her former con and jail Rodeo Star, as she clarifies her independence - a real bull rider -, Wes (played by the great Glasse by Scott Glen). Bud is threatened, and Bud and Cissy break up. <br /> <br /> Sissy moves with her harrowing path. To repel herself, the bud palm doll became a doll, a wealthy girl whose daddy is in oil and it represents. Sissy comes through the cleaning the trailer in it - there is that kind of palm thing. She writes a letter to Bud, but the bad palm takes credit for it's tears and Sissy's housework. <br /> <br /> The uncle of uncle of Bud is seriously dead and causes an explosion. Bud and Sissy are likely at reconciliation, but are very stubborn. Then the mechanical bull is in a riding competition gillies, and you know that you have won the Bud. Pim finds Pam not to love him, but Cassie - she has done for her. <br /> You can ask why Bus and Cissy go. Every night about Gillies and "live like pigs." It may contribute to their bad marriage. Or why not with bamma pam - she is not that bad and has money. Or why they had to kill Uncle Bob. Or why buddy and crazy friends like Marshall and Jessie have fools? They tried to respond: Marshall said to Bud, "You're running that ax well than her!" But it's entertaining part of the Urban Cowboy's entertainment for a while - not that Bonnie Royite on stage!
