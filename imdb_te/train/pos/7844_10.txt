I really love this show, it's like reading a book and every chapter leaves you wanting more. Think about what's going to happen in the next episode, and the fight to organize their friendship throughout the year. After the end of each episode, the sweet bitter taste in your mouth will stop: one - the show is good, you can not wait for the next episode and actually think what happened to friends in twenty years. And the two - the program was put on "restless" and we will not see the end of the show completely. Fox clearly said they did not know what they did, they say they were losing audience in the 18-49 segment, and they did not know what people would like to see if they removed a good show like "Reunion". I have a question, but I want to increase it. If they have to bring back the show, it goes on to another period, because each episode is paid for one year and how it works, and the story is based on a twenty year period. Your answers are very welcome. Bring Reunion back! Bring Reunion back!
