I first saw the film released in 1987 and I was very concerned about what my fellow man could do for the innocent people and the world's reluctance to investigate these maladies on humans. In particular, Steve Bucco's cemetery was particularly moving, making it more clear and hard hitting through the South African anthem at that time. I have long believed that no one has done this to open the eyes of the world what will happen in South Africa. I thought it was a simple right idea and I completely thought about how the film will look at all the blacks, not just South Africa. I did not see any difference between people of any color or religion, but after seeing this film, I changed my life and lived in a black country for the last 17 years and that many people overcame their current standard of living and that they can not. I received the greatest gift honestly - I contribute in my own little way and the balance has been corrected. <br /> <br /> If a lot of people like me, if they do something without blacks, then the entire black population of this planet is much better. <br /> <br /> When I started liberty, you first saw 700 students in Sharpeville, who were killed and discovered by Steve Biko's supernatural murders, a winner for his own people's rights, as you read, as you read the emotion at your heart. /> <br /> My friends, look at this movie, and then let's see if you can go out and party hard. I could not. I was very upset about knowing the truth. This is the hallmark of a great movie. The purpose of Sir Richard Attenborough to get this message about South Africa is clear. In fact it has achieved. If you do not support apartheid. God will help you.
