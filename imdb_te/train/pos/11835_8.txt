For the first time I watched the trailer to see this movie, I was surprised at the film. But the dark nature of the film really makes this a very different experience if some of the characters and actions seemed quite a bit. Instead of the feel-good-cheerful story, the film will take you in another direction, it's stimulating, but also upset. Many children do not understand the dark moments in the film, making it look rather adult for the movie. I was impressed with cinematography, creating a seamless network of portraits and tilts, using animation and digital animation. Music score was once again solidified, as Hans Zimmer Go-to Guy demonstrates when it comes to animated scores, and I really do not think Bryan Adams has enjoyed the music.
