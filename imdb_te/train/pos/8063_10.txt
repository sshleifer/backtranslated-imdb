The winner of this fantastic Oscar winner (in all 4) and John Ford's first academy award winner, spellbiding with just scored by Max Steiner. An art film, because there is very little money to do this great story about Fort guilt and vengeance and greed and stupidity. But what makes this film such classic, direct and unreliable photography and the use of fog and lighting, which is quite different from the usual American film, and more in the tradition of German expression. And Victor McLagland's Oscar-winning performance like Drunk Zipo is simply unbelievable. Initially, the film takes place in Ireland, and becomes a friend in the rebellion movement to English to collect 20 pounds to give to his girlfriend. But with that money he drunk overnight and started giving it, but the leaders of the movement are trying to figure out the informer. The whole movie is a dark and fog one night in Ireland, and a cast of memorable characters but, in addition to psychologically, the whole world of zipo closes him. If three directors are to be selected to have a number of movies on a desert island, there is no one, John Ford is definitely one of them. What a really great movie ...
