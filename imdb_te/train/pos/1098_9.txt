"Mr. Blond's Bills His Dreamhouse" is more than what the audience was looking for in 1948. However, political commentary is subtle. Finding a home in the last 40 is really exasperating experience, only lightweight through Levittowns to come through. Politics in the film? They want to talk about progressive ideas that are taught in school. (Communists allegedly teachers in real life). In real life, Mirna Lai is a home worker, a Democrat, and a feminist.

But it is 1948: Communism is a real perceived threat and the blacklist is just in the corner. This is another decade before the political reaction appears in major films.
