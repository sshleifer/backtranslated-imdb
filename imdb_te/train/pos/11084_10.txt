<br /> <br /> When I was nine, I saw the glacier fox in the theater. I started looking for it for a video five years ago, and finally banned a copy on the online auction site, but it was a new distributor and re-released (I understood that the original video run was small), or the rights purchased by The Family Channel, Disney, And will be shown regularly. This is an attractive film that captivates you in the life story of the fox life in northern Japan, which is commented with a brilliant tree tree. The superb soundtrack is very well appreciated. It is a good seller than weak submissions for today's children's movies.
