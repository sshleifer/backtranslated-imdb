For a low budget project, the movie was a success. The story is interesting, and the actors are convinced. Eva Longoria, now starred in the TV show "Dragnet", which is sexier than ever. This place was ideal for the Gunster Plot, and the director showed his talents by taking many roles for his project. However, this low budget movie can use more special effects for better editing transitions and gun sequences, but this script keeps moving music. Although the film is a stake of problems like continuity, I have to say that the director's next movie will be rented. If you are a film student, you can learn some things from the director's commentary.
