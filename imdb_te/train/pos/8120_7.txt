Things to Come is an early science fiction film, which shows the world of imagination, or "every time" over 100 years. You can split up to 4 different scenes or parts. The film expanded from 1940 to 2036, and the ruler or "boss" was once again seeking the ability to fly in the airplane, after each bombing and the war began. <br /> <br /> About 3 flaws: It has some quirks of audio muddy and video, the characters are not deep at all, and the whole plot is not entirely solid. The plot is something that I should not wear my finger ... it's a little "soft". If you like science fiction, H.G. If Wells is interested in what has happened, it should be seen. Because of the war with Germany, it is only valuable to learn that everybody is scared: the long and lasting war, because they go to war with Germany and have all the biological weapons and everything threatened. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
