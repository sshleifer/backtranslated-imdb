Last night I saw this movie on television. It went through the title "Stevie to Heaven". Even as a young child, I am deeply moved by this story and remember that the court was surprised by the visual effects of the trial (I know who I talk about). Such an imagination! A perfect blend of romance, drama, humor and fantasy, this film is exactly the best classic ever made: Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Gone With The Wind. The film was rated highly by IMDB voters, and exactly 51% of the voters rated it 10 out of 10; Over 84% rated it 8 or 10. I found that few people have seen / seen compared to those in the list. What are you doing? I hope that the film will be released on DVD for Region 1 (North America), so 1), I can buy it, and 2), and others will find this hidden treasure.
