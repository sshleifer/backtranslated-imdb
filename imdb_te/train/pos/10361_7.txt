Once you get out of your jaw to get out of the ground ... somehow ... this thing is that this thing is as fast as it gets released the same year, you will find that it is not half bad. This plot is engaging and interesting and in many cases the passing is fast, so it is often jumping fast after a line or two. Acting where it really stands out. The shows are amazing. Both Neal and Streep are impeccable. It's also great to talk to many Australian people in Hollywood film, and it does not come naturally, even if it tries to get a slang. Cinematography and editing are great, but they do not really go beyond standard items. The film's story is compelling and this is not the standard, it makes it more agile. Although I have not read the novel as to what happened outside the film, I understand that this is very close to the truth. Some people have strong language and disturbing content in this regard. Sometimes it's a great court play. I recommend this kind of fellow fan. 7/10
