My Super Expect Girl turned out to be a pleasant surprise for me, I was expecting a terrible picture that was really stupid and predictable, and what do you know? That's it! But this film has a wonderful plot that laughs very spectacular and does not get a kick out of someone. I have this very cheesy movie, but Uma and Anna are just cool and Steve is a great addition along with a great cast that they have been so much fun and that's what the movie really worked for. Jenny Johnson (scary, it is my best friend's real name) is a typical librarian looking woman when she asks G-Girl when she asks, Superhero! But he's an envy and crazy girl she really is and it decides she might be a good idea to spend some time, but Jenny is not it, since she has fallen for another girl, Hannah, and she does. <br /> <br /> "And the cast story has really worked and I liked Uma in this movie, it is such a step from the Prime Minister. <br /> <br /> My super X girlfriend   ్ మీరు నిజంగా తీవ్రంగా తీసుకోరాదు ఒక సరదా చిత్రం, నేను ఒక నవ్వు బయటకు పొందలేరు ఉంటే నేను భావిస్తున్నాను ఒక అందమైన శృంగార హాస్య వార్తలు, ఎవరైనా అనుకొనుట. <br /> <br />
