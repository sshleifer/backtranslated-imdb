The movie "Scarface", directed by Brian de Palma and Oliver Stone, is not a forgotten one. Cuba's refugee named Tony Montana (Pacino) came to the United States for the American Dream. Montana then becomes "king" in the medicine world when he runs his brutal empire in Miami, Florida. This gangster movie is very violent and does not like to see some scenes. The film has approximately 180+ F-words and is about three hours long. The film is entertaining and you are not bored. You cheer for Drug Lord, and in some scenes you find Montana is not as bad as some other crime lords. This is a masterpiece and I would recommend that you do it. Do not be disappointed. 9/10
