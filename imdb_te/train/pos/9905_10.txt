I lost the number of reviews I wrote in Slater High. I read them very bad and now I say that this is a wonderful movie. Simon Schudmoor has given his reputation for his reputation for some time, and although this is his only film, the film has made a great deal. I did not know Simon first until I read the review of his suicide. Then I found the current webpage at www.IMDb.com, born in Dayton, Ohio, in 1957. Although Simon played the most pathetic role man has, self in his real life is definitely their strengths and weaknesses. He has done a good acting job, who disagrees? I felt like I was naked in a movie. To be fairly impatient to say the least. In the sixth grade I saw this movie at the age of 12. I agree with some of the things that the girl does not bathe after killing anyone, and in high schools there are no bath tubs! Caroline Munro is the only star of any respectable acting talent in the age of 36, and unfortunately future movies for Simon's death. The reason for his suicide (s) is secret, and hopefully in the near future. When he made Slaughter High he was at the age of 29 and was mathematical in your webpage. He looked like a young man. I gave the film two thumbs and made the best horror film. Perhaps due to their horrific performance, others did not have a reputation for cinema business. -Jacob Young
