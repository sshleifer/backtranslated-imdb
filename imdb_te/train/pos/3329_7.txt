The only reason I saw this film was for Jimmy Fallon, and I crashed out of the 9th grade in his first year SNL. The film did not appear to be painful until I was a die hard hard Yankee fan and the last 15 minutes of showing ALCS game clips. <br /> <br /> I had to cover my ears and have small sounds. So I should not listen. But it's totally irritating. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] <br /> <br /> I know it is not an award winning academy award, but this movie is just a light, fun, romantic comedy. It is really suitable for both men and women. <br /> <br /> Jimmy and Drew are well-known, and they have better chemistry in the camera than other actors in the past. (Ed Barnes and Angelina Jolie in the stupid film? What?) I think it's a good career ahead of him, because thanks to killing Jimmy Taxi, and thank goodness. I think Fever Pitch will help him a lot. Everyone should stop his acting ability so complicated as he starts in movies. I imagine that I will be hard, if you see other great actors of our time (Tom Hanks, Russell Crowe, etc.), you'll see that they started in some flops. Bosom Buddies? Australian soap opera? Where Jimmy wished a successful career on the screen. I never wanted him to leave the SNL, but what can you do?
