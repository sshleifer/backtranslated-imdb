A punk rocker is essentially a film made by Ramones surname in the early 1980s (when it first appears on premium cable stations). It is the first and best of American punk rock films with a cult classic status with the Rocky Horror Picture Show. Originally the producers wanted to be cheap trick stars, but the release of the album "Live at Budakon" made them super stars and was too hot to be a low budget film. Very good luck for Ramones looking underground punk rock world and mainstream market (never barely sung after the bands fall). The band, deepe, especially did not like the film by the 80s but fans always liked it and did not read much of the film while waiting to get Ramon's performances. This film, like most classic, is stupid fun with some of their deadly classic Ramones footage. Do not expect more, you can not find it. It's very fun, so have fun. Another Alan Arc classic in the same Varn Get The Crazy Get Crazy Crazy, Legend Hardcore Punk Band Fear Lee Wing.
