In this case of the New York Firemen, an outstanding example of a realistic documentary for the 9/11 film Variety, while fighting against the most extraordinary events in world history. This is a very small, casual, hand-held video cameras, with most of the shooting of most of the shooting (and director, the hand of the knot is often wiped off the screen). <br /> <br /> In this movie, you know the firefighters - Tony Benototos, NY (in Fimono County) or Rookie (or 'Probe'), Fire Chief Joseph Pfeiffer (he later finds his brother lost) and others. The whole film has studio interviews with these individuals, to emphasize the individual, reflective nature of these events. The limited art of shift-pans and diversal editing, which is very useful in the Fire Department (it's Rob Reiner's A Few Good Men). <br /> <br /> The perspective and camera angle is common among the fiery fire and there is some excellent footage from inside WTC1's lobby which is a classic cinematic variety. Outside Portico's crash is occasionally an ere and chasing sound of the human body. This largely baseless Fire Chief Pfeiffer finds his work unattractive and possibly helpless - and this is where WTC2 crashes before. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br / Firefighters From the lobby, it looks, feels and sounds like the whole world and the poorest firefighters are totally confused. The neighboring tower collapsed yet - a large, monster beast fell to the ground after slowly dying - and the firefighters in the WTC1 ignored the incident. <br /> <br /> The film is still attractive, this article is enthusiastic and avoided - 'It's really like the other day or the routine ads of the knight. Fear in all eyes and 'I know Tony will be out!' The film is really just a long video diary. Some firefighters have no pictures on the dead building. Combine this picture with CCTV footage from some rooms or some coverage in news coverage from day to day. The effect is high. <br /> <br /> You may have joined the story with Mayor Giuliani and possibly a number of roles featuring the famous Carnivian Ric Riskorla. <br /> I do not see much of this advertising element as some critics have suggested. The film is not a success by Refinstall. After some time, the fireplace is near the ground, leaving the American flag to the American building, looking at what it sees. <br /> <br /> There are a few moments that are unrealistic cameraworos. For example, who were the two knight brothers who caught the camera when they met at the fire station? <br /> <br /> There is a very good ending in the triight of the excellent French director Alain Renaiss (Hiroshima mon Amour), two pieces of light reflecting in water, shimming.
