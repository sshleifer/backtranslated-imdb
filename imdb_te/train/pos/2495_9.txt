The weird, witty and spectacular depiction of family life! Writer Andrew Marshall wrote funny, forbidden and occasionally scary! Yes, 2point4 Do not be fooling the kids happy tunes and bubbly characters; The show has a dark side, and sometimes very cold. And it's great about the show, it's not a simple sitcom with a 2D comic device (in my family). Instead, the characters are completely surrounded by people showing human emotions as a roller-coaster. The bills are two examples of the show taking a surreal, dark turn, as occasionally dark moments like a curse and a surreal, dark turn to help haunt the devil haunted in a hideous village. The presentation of the course is very funny, and is guaranteed to make you smile. It's a real shame for the release of this funny gold release on the Eureka Video DVD.
