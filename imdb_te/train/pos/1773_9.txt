Barriers are one of those series that lost the movements of time. It was in the early 80s and after a recurring stream, it sank without trace. <br /> When I was on TV evening in the afternoon of evening afternoon, I saw it. Although I did not remember much about the program, some things remained in my mind. The most important are the unforgettable titles. The sensational flu music along with the attempted escape in the attempt on the Eastern European frontier and later the car crash (and the scene was used by Merchant 200 when 'Fintile' left me with the respect of Mercedes models). Although it is not clear at the beginning, this is the solution to the mystery of the series. <br /> <br /> When learning about a young man, he tried to get to know what happened when he learned about the twists and turns but there was a surprisingly 'adult' child play. <br /> <br /> This is a shame that Taylor Billy is incredible and Billy is a shame he has not done so much <br /> <br /> This is a quality play well over time for a DVD drama and I hope <br /> <br />
