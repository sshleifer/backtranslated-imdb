Seriously, people say that Antz is good. Antz is a good movie, but I have enjoyed a bit of bugs. I can not remember any other pixel animation than two Toy Story movies, and I'm very laughing. The animation is clean, the story is original and does not teach. Voice overs will make this movie. Dave Foley gets himself into trouble and is a serious ant. Hopper is a fantastic character by a wonderful Kevin Spacey similar to Hernan Panetier Dot. There is also support for Sterling from Dennis Leary, David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn, and I and I can go on. The script is stunning, so funny and sometimes touching. It does not have Antz's social messages, but what we do is rock-solid entertainment. 9/10. Bethany Cox
