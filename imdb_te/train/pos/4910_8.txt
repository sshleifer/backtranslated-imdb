This is a good movie tension. Stocks, of course, high - police and widmark, public health physician, will they have to capture criminals who do not know that they are carrying the plague before full epidemic breaks? But small plot elements introduce tension in each scene - between bad guys between the Palace and Montaella between the Wilmar and the police captain, between the famine and the dying plagues, he tells him that because of some trafficking in goods between Widmark and his wife, and the danger to the public Or complete The level relied on whether it was better served by hiding the situation to avoid panic. The film is filmed by Kazan, an extraordinary dancer who shoots a place in New Orleans, and ends in an incredible climax where the palace flees as a rat from his pursuers through the domes and warehouses of the city. Commentary is excellent, cinematography, boutique and lighting, product design, casting of non-professional actors in small roles, and a plot and parallel to the plot, usually a 1950s film techniques and a brilliant seminar on film noir. Watch for a while to get the movie, and if you are interested in film production, comment the second time to find out.
