This is one of the most picturesque paintings of a person who has ever seen the screen. Andy Golds is a type of personality wartime extinction. He sees earth and nature as old as a good sense with such admiration and respect. His holiness, honesty and compassion are obvious if you look at him in the simplest and simpler films of Morocco's pieces of life. I was amazed how he made his pieces and accepted patiently. Sometimes sooner, but his Scottish humor jokes his disappointment with humor. The film is beautifully portrayed and has the same stream that holds the art of Golds Worthy. Nature and art are combined. Fred Frith's score combines all of it without interfering with natural sound. It's a great job for every aspect. There are not too many borders.
