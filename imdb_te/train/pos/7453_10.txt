I'm always a James Bond fan! I've seen movies other than Die Another Day, and The World Is Not Enough. Graphic is breathtaking for everything or Nothing! Voice Talent ......... Wow! I love Pierce Brosson! He's finally Bond in the video game! He is Bond! I enjoyed the last Bond games: Golden, The World Is Not Enough, Agent Under Fire, and Nightfire. It's definitely great! Finally, Mr. Brosnan, (who would I call Mr. Broznann as a mentor? Yes I can!) He excited to hear on video game ....... Long ago! Duh! I have shown him with Robin Williams and let me tell you, they make a great team. "Pierce Brosnan, James Bond," "If this is not for you, I do not know who the James Bond is." He was a great man, and he was a big fan of Pierce Brosnan. actor! Even though I've seen him in a couple of movies I'm a huge fan of Willem Dafoe. His role in Nikolai Dywas is amazing. (Did I fully understand the character's name?) LOL !!!! He does a great job with a voice. Sometimes I can not even voice. I saw Willem, Mr. Duffo, in two films: Find Nemo, Spider-Man My favorite actress: Kirsten Dunst! She's Rocks! Anyway, he never marveled. And Richard Kyle, Wow, he certainly got the part of the nail of the jigsaw. I saw him in the movie and he was awesome! In fact, my grandfather met Kelly, and I was jealous when I told him. But, Kirsten Dunst is at the top of my list of Celebrity I want to meet. John Clice is breathtaking. I've never seen playing a clever man and the Q to create gadget! Mr. Clais is happy! I worked with Pierce Brosnan with Goldie and Tamrover Never Dies. He is awesome! John Kleys's recent project is Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Julie Andrew and Eddie Murphy, Shrek 2 (Shrek 2's Theater Now!) Good Luck 007! Oh, yes, and Q Always say: "007 to grow!"
