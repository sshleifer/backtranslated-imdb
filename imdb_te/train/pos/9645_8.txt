'Presque Rile' is the story of two teenagers who fall in love with the summer of the beach. I do not like to tell the plot because it's not so important about this film (but you can be sure it's interesting and real). Cinematography is the best part of the film. The visual side of 'Presque Rileen' is pretty awesome that it deserves the highest note. <br /> <br /> For the plot, it is rather uncomplicated. There is no simple timeline or answers to all the questions that the picture brings. But this is what makes the 'pricic regen' more interesting. I recommend this movie to all people, the artistic piece of the images is very important and they will not be disappointed.
