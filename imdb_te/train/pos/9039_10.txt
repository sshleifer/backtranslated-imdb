I grew up in southwestern Virginia; I'm Hart Hakkam, the author of "The Rocket Boys", a book based on the true-story of this heart-warming film. So I am close to the West Virginia coal mining backdrop, and I have had an excellent effect on Sputnik at all times (October 4, 1957). Rocket boys have gone to make great lives. I went to get my degrees in physics and computer engineering. Sputnik woke up to many young people "science gap" because the USSR was in the U.S. during the Cold War days ... <br /> <br /> For all, this is a wonderful movie for everyone. But if you grow up in West Virginia in the late 1950s, it will hit your main point. <br /> Everyone: get it; Feedback; This is recommended by your friends ... who will come to thank you many times.
