I'm 60 years old, a guitarist (lead / rhythm), and in the last forty years I've been in four bands, all of it, fights, foul-ups, rotten food, worst accommodation, always traveling, small or money, and every one drunk Or higher. But, clubs, fans, and music, it's all worth it! Strange Fruit is Like! I'm a very painful old now, and the rocks in the hands and bones are longer rocking, but for the length of that video, it all came back, and it's all there! Birds, events, and booze! I'm young again! This is like Billy Connolly's voice over, and God loves those 70 things! Rock on forever!
