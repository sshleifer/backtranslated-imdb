Many of his movies (Citizen Kane, Confidential Report, Touch of Bad) Orson Wells gave him the role of exaggerating men. In "Lady from Shanghai" I saw him playing the victim's character. The offender's character, he gave Rita Hayworth, I guess because he's in love with her. Therefore, it is an interesting picture. But the story is amazing. Direction, directed with Wells: Two scenes are particularly spectacular: one in the aquarium and the last one with glasses. This image is good. (10/10)
