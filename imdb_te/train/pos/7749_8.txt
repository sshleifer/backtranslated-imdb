This film kills you from your feet. This debut film from Tom Barman (known from the Belgian Rock Band DEUS) introduces you to 8 people by building blocks of attractive movie mosaics. In Antwerp's metropolis they are every day one day and one day. Barman describes his characters greatly with Verwark and meets their personal narratives, and tours are recalled by Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson's best work. Incidents of surprises, moves, amuses; Conversations are very natural and look like improved. Some great performances by the most funny duo from Matthews Skyners, Natalie Broads and Ghent, Jonas Boyle and Titus de Vogue. Sam Louvic memorable "Windman", the dancer dancer throughout the film. Sam is also responsible for excellent choreography, and of course Tom Burman himself took care of the ultra cool soundtrack. We are very impressed: any way air blows is a picture that removes your feet.
