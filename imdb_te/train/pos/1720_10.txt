It's great to see this early biography is small. D.W. Griffith's "Years of Discovery" DVD set (highly recommended) is the second of the disc's, and includes Henry B. Waltzle (The Little Colonel, Birth of a Nation) <br /> <br /> Countess's husband is his wife She becomes addicted to betrayal and she enters a little room for her girlfriend. It's kind of incredible that the wall goes up, but hey, maybe wine has something to do with it. Here Mr. Johnson (the father of silent player Raymond Hackett) lives wildly and adds the play, but is accidentally joking. The best moment comes to the end. When Lady ran away from shock and fear, she once found out that she was sad, Henry chose her instrument and "fans" on her. The way he did was very unexpected and sexy in a strange way, and I just lost it, and my head laughed off. Expression on his face! From that moment on I was attracted by Henry B. Valthal.
