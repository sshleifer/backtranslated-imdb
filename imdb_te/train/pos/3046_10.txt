All good films are "live" to video copycat flick directly. "Gladiator" is not really a good movie, because I have not seen any movie that is similar to any other thing in the new releases shelf for months. Then I found the full moon's latest offering, Demonicus. I'm not a fan of Full Moon's PuppetMaster Series and Blood Dolls, but never seen in their puppet movies with their killer. <br /> What happens to a camping camp in the Alps Mountains? One of the camps, James finds a cave with old pumpkins, remove the helmet from the corpse and try it out. He was inspired to kill his friends to rebuild the corpse, who is the real Tyrannus, and, like gladiator Tyrannus, supposedly. <br /> <br /> Like many full moon films, this is a very low or no budget. At times, editing and directing was so enthusiastic, I would say I'm looking at the Blair Witch Project. A Monte Python Skin reminds me of attempts to separate the organs and heads off. Weapons are, obviously true, look really plastic-y. It's literally seen as a group of friends with a digital camcorder on this weekend. Granted, there is nothing wrong with making such a film, just do not rent out this technical masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The script also has a series of experiments to take place, because Tyrannus speaks at least Latin, even if he does not work as a gladiator until the end. <br /> <br /> All the while putting everything in the picture is actually enjoyed. Probably as a killer puppet image, but the full moon still offers! The only thing that disappointed me was the Full Moon videozone!
