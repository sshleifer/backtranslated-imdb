The film is not very comedy, dark and Gordon Liu is shining in this regard. He performs his funny speech and it is really unrealistic to hit him. Who thinks that his training is "conventional" and crude? Lots of great acrobatics and choreography. Very creative! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not give up the thugs; They're brutal!
