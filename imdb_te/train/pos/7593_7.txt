<br /> Do you look forward to a comic-based high-faced intellectual film called a slam dunk? Really? Jay Chow's acting was not the moving thing I saw correctly, but I certainly enjoyed the film. Is it close to the marvelous arise of anyone like Jet Li or Stephen Chow? Not really. Is it totally entertaining if you just take at the surface value? Sure. It's a movie about some Chinese eye-candy statues and musicians to play basketball. A bad trilogy-style Dude and Jay Chow is an absurd scheme guy who participates in all of this. Interest in love. It's formula but really, suspended for a while. Come on. It is called Kung Fu Dunk. What do you really think you've actually signed in? If you see this you like it - I found some copy of the English subtitles, which featured the film inappropriate dialogue, but we got a great laugh from it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you feel like you do not know what to do, And well shot.I enjoy the plexiglass pool table specially - I'd love to play one of those <br /> <br /> Slick enough for me, but I want to dig the worst movie.
