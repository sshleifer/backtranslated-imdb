This is a long horrifying gem featuring Sydney Laci√®que ("Carrie" and others) and Barbara Bach. This image is very difficult to find a copy, but it's worth it. This film is creepy and cheesy at the same time. Three young newsmen (Karen, Vicky and Jennifer) in Solvang, California, a small town in California, form a blend of their hotel room, and they are Ernest Keller (Lucic) and his strange wife Virginia. Vicky is suffering from illness, and the rest of the story is filmed. She was murdered in a very cheesy way by some unknown force hidden in her ventilation system (she was beheaded by the end of the field after she hanged her while she was trimming her). Soon Karen returns and she is killed in a more ruthless manner by ramming her face by covering her face. Jennifer fights with her boring sub-plot without her (former?) Lover, when she returns home, when she returns home, a plot that attempts to kill her (she's brother and sister we now find and their son in the basement). Virjina fully agrees with Ernst's plan to murder Jennifer but she goes into the basement with Jr. Here the film junior (portrayed as frustrated by Stephan Furst) is a ludicrous, mental defect and human being, whose actions and moves are scared. The movie's pace is here and it's good to finish. Actresses / actresses have done a wonderful job with the musicals, especially Lassik, Furst, and Bach, and this is a very entertaining job even though it is not the most horrific film!
