God! Buttgereit's masterpiece is one of the best films I've ever seen. Being close to the films of Peter Greenaway and Jean-Luc Godard, it feared as Necorrotics but was not really afraid. All the short stories have deep philosophical interest and are totally visible despite the lack of money (see the "bridge" sketch). Highly recommended!
