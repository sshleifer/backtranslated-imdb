The film is one of the most laughable comedies in Canada, Yves P. Pelletier. I was surprised in the second that I had done a romantic comedy, but he was a huge film festival, and at every local festival and in local cinematheek I have a positive feeling about this film. <br /> Hell, I'm right. From the right bat, the visual (pellalier) is a bit distorted and difficult to follow, but it's a 90 minute jack-in-box in the style of Pelletier. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what you want, <br /> <br /> This film is a popular love instrument for you who wants to know who's playing on Fridays evening. <br /> <br /> Great storyline, great photography, great quotes of other images. Should we ask for the very first film?
