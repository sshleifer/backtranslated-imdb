Sergio Martino recently impressed me with his Giollo classic 'The Strange Vice of the Mrs. Ward' and memorable 'Your Vice a Lock Room and Only I Have the Key' - but I'm the film. When it comes to the classic gaiol, the Scarpian's tile is not mentioned as the above titles - but I do not know why, because it's better than that! Dario Argentino might be Giovallo's 'king', but with five of his films - Sergio Martino is not necessarily far behind. In some ways, he overcame the commander. The Martino films were released in front of an ornament in the Argentine crown, the superb Promondo Rosso, twenty early - Martino king! The plot here follows the idea of ​​attempted murder and follows the payment of the wealth of the rich. His wife earned 1 million dollars, and there was not much time before there was people for her blood! <br /> <br /> Scorpion's Tail's Case can not benefit from the beautiful Edwick Fenet, but it has it. Two of the Martino cooperatives on board. The most famous is George Hilton, The Strange Vice of Mrs Ward and Marino in All Colors of the Dark, along with several other Giolos. Hilton has a great screen presence and every time I see him in an Italian thriller; It is clear why he is repeatedly cast. Beautiful Anita Stringberg, a locked room, reminiscent of your vice, stars along with Hilton, and typically gives women the main role of classic giollo. Sergio Martino once again makes a good job at the Directors chair, with many beautiful scenes - the best in the bathroom with a green lighting! Score by Bruno Nikolai (Wardath) sets the spectacular mood, but it is the driving force behind Martino's success. Martino's other four Giovelo writer Ernesto Gastaldi, unchallenged from a simple Giollo disaster, so the film was liberated from the rest of the supernatural genre. The Case of the Scorpion Tail is a quality Giollo film, and another win for the great Sergio Martino. If you like Giollo, you will like it!
