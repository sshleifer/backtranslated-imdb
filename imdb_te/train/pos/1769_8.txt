Just came out of a hidden preview for this movie. It laughs every 30 seconds for me. The ending tears is funny that my face is rolling down and wishing it does not buy me big coke. There are definitely some lulls, but, overall, most entertaining. Steve Carell gave the film the opportunity to film the film "Bruce Almighty" and Will Ferrell's "Uncorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy" after stealing the spotlight from Jim Carrie in their films. Paul Rudd is always delighted. I love that he will be very funny in these panoramic movies and work in indie drama (like PS). I want Seth Rosen to do more work because he speaks talented and appealing. Leslie Mann also has the most wonderful moments. I recommend it to those who just want to smile just like a maniac. However, if you're easily scared, do not watch this movie. If you're a serious feminist, you can not see this movie. And, please, if you feel that you are one of those "hip" parents, do not take your children in this movie. Sure, let your teenage watch this movie and watch them. It makes for some amazing awkward moments.
