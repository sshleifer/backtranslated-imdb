I sincerely hope that Cosby will release something in the first season DVD at least. Hilton's eloquent intellectual brother, George (who played the role of the late Rossko Lee Brown), is classically happy. <br /> <br /> It reflects the classic sibling competition and love amongst the brothers, which led to different paths but both were happy. Cosby and Mrs. Rashad has been involved in the Cusby Show for many years and has seen the role of middle class, showing the size of the artists. <br /> <br /> The comic list is the greatest ... the Madeline con, Philipia Rashad, Mr. Cosby ... the classic genius!
