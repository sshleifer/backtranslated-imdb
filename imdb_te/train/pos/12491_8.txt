This image is good. I would recommend if you are a fan of horror movies. The actress who acted in July thought she could have more emotion behind the lines but acting was very good. I think Alan is very good and cinematography is wonderful. My friends were worried and thrown out at the end of my seat. It was a complete success in my opinion and made it big screen. I will give two thumbs! If you do not see me already, it will be rented. If you see it, if you do not see it again and do not see it again, there are completely untrue episodes. I liked how the feature film was around and was filmed in my school premises.
