The film was the first by Johnny Too, the film won several awards, but Cannes was not the most prestigious as Golden Palm nomination. <br /> <br /> The Tide Leung Ka Pha (The Train of Zou Yu, The Ashes of Time Redux) is Big D, even if it understands the war, which is what happened, It's going to happen. Well, the war is bad because the business is bad. <br /> <br /> Simon Yum, Louise Cu and Kang Tung Lam (Infernal Affairs I & III), Tony Tuang Ka Fai are great performances. <br /> <Mason's men, men, or members of the Volgoge Society, celebrations are identical; Lovely to see. <br /> <br />
