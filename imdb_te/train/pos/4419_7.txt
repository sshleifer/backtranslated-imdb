I saw this movie and I heard the writer-director Juan Gerard speak at the Santa Barbara Inter Films Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I know about it, it's eight years old - let's see how influencing his son and family during the Cuban Revolution in 1958. <br /> <br /> The earliest sequence brings to mind the "movie paradiso". In fact, the film featured classic films: The Roulette Veil (Casablanca), "Chicken Claying" (Rebel Without A Cause), Touchs of "Bushwall", "Touch of Evil"; You will find more. The homeless man (George Stanford Brown) is a reference to Cuba folk tale, which often uses a black man as a Greek chorus. <br /> <br /> This film is really the end of the dream. <br /> <br /> The real story of Zhou Gerard and all the people in it are real and painted events. Gerard was originally an architect and engineer (and a passionate film lover) but his dream was to make the film. He and his wife decided to live that dream and Harvey Keitel Gerard believes he was an "angel" and agreed to produce and act on it. The mysterious and mysterious grandfather was keen on "Ke" on the Kelet Screen. Brown and Keitel are the only Americans in cast. <br /> In fact, the first half of the film faces maximum distribution of songs, and with some people overcoming, Ivan Hezel (High Fidelity) and Gale Garcia Bernal (Yu Uma Mama Tombin) The last half of the events of the revolution is so sweet that bittersweet, and blends the honest climax. This is Juan Gerard's first effort, but it is honest and his love and heart really takes place in this honest first attempt. <br /> I'll see again and hope that he has continued his career. <br /> <br />
