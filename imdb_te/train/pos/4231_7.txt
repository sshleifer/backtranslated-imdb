<br /> <br /> When returning from a Christmas Eve shopping trip, the abusive suburban housewife (Basinger) finds himself in the fight for survival, and turns violent with a group of criminals. <br /> <br /> Directly released here in the UK, Susan Montfort's directing is perhaps the recognition that it deserves. <br /> <br /> Kim Bajinger gives her the best performance for a while, the authenticity of the writing, behavior and acting standard is really good, and definitely exceeds your average image quality. An abusive husband (Craig Shepher) is a dowry wife. When Befuerger does not do anything more than frightening when she joins, it's in their brief scene - showing painful vulnerability, and finally struggling with her faced with the youth. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what you are doing, However, four young men were more physically desperate, and Bashir was not going to turn the tables against them. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The episode is a great thriller with a couple of cheesy lines here and there, the viewer leaves something we really think about when the movie ends. Some early scenes can be slowly abandoned by nature, or sudden ending. Sometimes through brutal torture. I said I'd give you an opportunity, which is definitely worth your time on S5.
