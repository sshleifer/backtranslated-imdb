The castle in the sky is undoubtedly a picture of Hayo Miyazaki. I'm glad to say that after seeing it for the first time I'm not disappointed. By contrast, you can get the value of your time (meaning the worry of movies), this is not less than amazing! Started in his cinematic career, Castle in the Sky is a very interesting (and sometimes friendly) supporting characters, with strong but (but young) female characters forced to grow in outdoor situations, with many trade marks in his later films. And, of course, the natural war of nature is civilization, flying machines (which too !!), beautiful painted scenery ?? But alas, no pigs (at least I noticed, I saw only one time). Never been less, Miyazaki had already started his stage debut two years ago, with Nasikka, which Princess Mononoke, is a dress rehearsal for his great work. Castle in the Sky has set up a bit from these two films, with a smooth action packed for the first time by his TV series Conan and Maitante Holmes. Here we are introduced to Sheeta, a girl fallen literally from the sky, only a small child named Paaja who works in a small rural mining town. As she was amazed by her memory and suspicion between her and the mysterious flying cities, Pazuccu helped her get to know where she came from when the army and the pirate gang escaped. As the film progresses, the plot is heavily and more interesting, and will feature in its finest show for Myagi. <br /> <br /> The Soundtrack Spirited Away (or similarly, the Fort in the Sky was originally produced), and its composer Joy Hiishi starts with a very lightweight score that makes the plot more complex and beautiful! <br /> <br /> A note for dubbing in English, with a very good voice from Anna Pekingin's sheeta (a still actress still in her career) and a major two leading actors. Mark Hamill leads the musk, which is a joyous and overwhelming villain! <br /> Do not miss this one!
