Disney has done it again. They again met Timon and the females and again and again to say how he came to meet Simba when he needed them. I love this movie and see it again and again. This shows how Timon lived with his family and fellow marchants before finding out his dream home and adventure. Then he meets Pumbaa and things change. Together, when they try to find the home Timon and they are repeatedly failing, it's funny that Timon gets more crazy. Then the return of Simba will come back and look more about his childhood than what we did in previous 2 films. The rest, you already know.
