The fact that I got a Christmas together came out of my time, but I grew up in John Denver and these special songs always have my family's Christmas music. Over the years we got a cracked cassette made from the record that we understand is Christmas. Some years ago, I was able to keep track of a video on eBay, so after almost 21 years of listening to music, I and John and Muppets took action for me. If you ever get the chance, it's fun - great music, heartfelt and cheesy. It is also interesting to watch 70 versions of the Muppets and compare them to their new versions today. I believe Denver actually took some heat for such a show - generally the performers would not be able to compromise their pictures by singing the performances with the Muppets, but I'm happy. Even if you can not watch the video, the soundtrack is also valuable. It has some Muppified traditional favorites, but some original Denver tune as well.
