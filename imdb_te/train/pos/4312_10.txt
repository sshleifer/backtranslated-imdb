If you do not see this amazing movie in the 90's (in L.A.), you lose a trust trust. It's one of the most awesome and most powerful movies of the Americans in the 90s, which has reached the world of today's world. It is everything that increases children, partiality (more than one), love, adultery, empty nuance syndrome, selfishness, etc. The story goes to the ultimate climax and goes back to love with friends, family and love. It helps us dig deep into ourselves and helps us search for what we are looking for. We ask ourselves. We've done enough for others, we like it. <br /> <br /> Please note the amazing acting of Mary MacDonnell, Kevin Klein and Danny Glover by this movie. These actors are amazing and really show us what a true glow and what is sent to the message. After watching this film 10 years ago, there were 3 of my favorite actors. I enjoy it again and again. Do not forget this wonderful soundtrack and try to figure out how many times you see the helicopter fly and try to figure out the markers for the film ... I almost almost all of this will probably starve in Steve Martin's first serious he never did. He is also doing a wonderful job in this film. This may come as a surprise to you. Sit back, really relax and enjoy a good movie .....
