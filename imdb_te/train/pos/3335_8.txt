This film shocked me. Personally I have a very bad buzz flock. It has been lost in the sleeping night since I finally got the DVD for the last months. With the use of additional scenes in the film, the intensity of his hobby and the lack of any scenes, along with his performance, had less realism. The best thing about the film is that it is in harmony with the relationship. There are no exposure to the former's popping up or characters. I usually see some exciting twist of fate of the girl, they see the date, the boy meets, something that we break them down and they look back together with the last five minutes of the film. But this film did not follow that mold. Although we have actually relate to it and there are moments where it's defects and characters have anti-love moments they do not have dramatic disruptions and they have a montage of 15 each and return in love again. I did not think that the movie would be expected as the rest of the romantic movies. The story is unique and honest in the way that I felt were most believable in what I saw in a romantic film from modern times. And it's all baseball games real and kicked in even the fate so fate at the original World Series they do not hurt. It's not "My Fair Lady" but it's a cheerful and sincere film. I said I said it.
