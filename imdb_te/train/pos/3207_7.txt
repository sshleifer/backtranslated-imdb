In fact, with no general standard criticism, Soldier is a very poor movie. Kurt Russell is a future super-soldier who has been killed since the killing, but a bit like a gladiatorial contest without crash mats. He is prohibited on a waste planet, he has been friends with a naffe spaceship hippies, who teach gardening, family life, and Um, chest. Kurt does not speak much. Finally the super-soldiers hippies run back and kill them by shooting them back as they flee. Kurt gets angry and kills everyone. A planet is a maximum. End. <br /> <br /> If a new category is not started for Academy "Best Explosion", Soldier will not win any awards. Still, it's funny, it's a joyful experience. The military hardware is cold for 90 minutes from the Aliens (especially APC, especially), overcoming its welcome. Please note that the bottom mark is only a guide. <br /> If you do not take the maximum, beat five points.
