Freddy Krueger Dream Stalker from Elm Street, great character actor Robert Inkland is again a nightmare 5 sequel, Dream Child. I hope this is exactly the number I have. Alice Cooper (singer) is a kid who loves pain, a painful kid and a family guy (creepy), and this is one of the best, and this is one of the best, especially Rossne Bar (then Arnold) Tom Arnold, Joni Depp, (the first nightmare in 84) ) The effects are very funny and creative, the cast also includes Lisa Jane (Billy's sister) Breekin Mayer ( Hadari trip) yapet kotto (alien, live and die, die) and Amanda donahyu (father of the well-known), which has seen better in 3d. 3 inches of love. I lost the first 3d wave in 1953 (I was not born yet) The second wave in 1983 was like all Freddy films. This is good, it is one of the first to be counted, Freddie became a new monster in the 80s and '90s, Jason Wehrays, Chuckie, Michael Myers, and a leather face Can you imagine a movie with them all? I would recommend this to all Freddie fans and horror fans. Freddy cuts more than 10.
