Extreme comedy. Ross Hunter-Producer film version of French play "Les Jois de la Fepel" (later translated as American as "A Very Rich Woman") is expensive, well cast, occasionally funny ... and unfortunately timeless. She is a wealthy California widow, who seems to have left her money, her two grown-up and greedy daughters are ramored, and both of them are spending their inheritance illegally Mama Rossi. A crucial - non-aged woman-woman after her will send her home with a will, will have to prove her regretfully in court proceedings, comedy (and her credit to director David Lowell Rich Cross Gags or clear over the film with no explicit sentiment). Some humor is slightly widespread and does not work, and Rosalind Russell understands the characteristic gravity in this scenario and can never withstand a false reference. Sandra dei is also the granddaughter of Rosalin, and James Farringo is very pretty as a young lawyer. The importance of our elderly, the ways they choose to spend the rest of their time "Rossi!" The seriousness of the rush goes to the most happy ending. The film leaves you laughing - and at the same time very lucky always very old ladies wondering. **** from
