I did not read this book, but in the film I was amazed at my head: this is Vonnegat. I have never seen a writer, intellectuals and all the life of the film have been well shot behind the novel's performance. The film has the same complexities as in the novels of Vonnegate: jokes are often meaningful and symbolic and dramatic events and icons are often jokes. <br /> <br /> Campbell is also well documented by Vonnegut, nicknamed Nick. He has all the assignments of the "hero": the lack of concern for political frontiers, the reaction to the pressure in response to mute inactivity and the desire to increase the reality of those around him. Overall, I was surprised and impressed when I saw the film. It's the same feeling that I read "Cats Craddle," my first ever Venezuelan novel, the most perfect oddball thing to happen, he thought that, and he made it true and important. Yes, he has only the army surplus "white Christmas" albums. So it goes!
