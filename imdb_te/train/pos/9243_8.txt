Do not listen to many acerbic and dorsorie comments on the film ... In Ninja movies, it's as good as my friends get! <br /> It's crazy, yes acting and script approval are absolutely worse, but by gum - it's very bloody fun! In reality, the fight scenes are the main attraction, and for the most part I will be very happy with the fact that B-Movies, the horror 'acting' (in the question of the film, really the pleasure I see!) And the ridiculous 'plot' They choreographed well, especially the final decline (this time we witness that Ninja is not constrained by gravitational general rules) <br / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Ninja movies, you can trust me in this case if you have not yet been lost on one of the true jewels in the crown of the genre,
