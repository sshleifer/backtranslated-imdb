The film is fun to watch. If you like "Dave" Kevin Clean, you get this kick out. Drefus has named Jack Nova, an actor who is an actor in the island of Portugal's Secret Police, who was replaced by a dictator alcoholic spouse Alfosse's Sims and died of heart attack. When Noah closed and tried to block Raul Julia's plans, the former dictator's assistant helped him in his role. Jonathan Winters also appears as a heartfelt American immigrant who becomes a CIA. Polly Holiday and Fernando Ray. <br /> <br /> Some absurd moments, such as the body of an old dictator, can be frozen for a year and the last scenery here is the occasional natural white moments of Sonia Braga, Bloody, Bullet Riddled Drops. But all in all it's a great long.
