Many of the features of this film are up to date. The sound is dark and identifies the greatest progress in sound reproduction in later years. The language of speech is rather strange and unreal and still reminiscent of its transformation from stage technology. <br /> <br /> In this early years, Betty Davis always plays a strong role in all of her films. She is a very successful life. I feel something wrong with the cockney voice facial expression. <br /> <br /> Somerset Megan prefers to see human relationships with great dramatic intensity that promotes all dramatic sentiments. For most of her roles, Betty Davis may switch to a viper who has a fraudulent hatred from a beautiful seductive woman. Leslie Howard acts as an English artist backed by a partner in a club pedal and a bad choice for a little weightage to lay the scheme. <br /> <br /> At the end of this film a young doctor meets her true love in a busy street. They cross the horns and whistleblowers and cross through traffic to avoid them. This scene is probably meant to be funny, but I'm not too ridiculous in this otherwise very serious movie. It sends home with smile on your face. And after all we can see (and hope for) it is a happy ending.
