In "Die Niblungen: Siegfried", Siegfried was cheated. Now, Craemhild gets revenge. She is married to Hagen, and eventually takes a very serious (but appropriate) action through several series of events. <br /> <br /> One thing to watch this film today is that the shoots. Antila the Hun (the movie called Etazel) was shown to be from the east as a strange figure, probably related to the Soviet Union. Apparently, this was not Fritz Lang's fault, Hitler used "The NiblungGenide" for German national pride in the Third National Reich but could see FÃ¼hrer's interest in the story. However, this is a completely formidable film.
