In my cast and team program, I have gone to this movie by my friend who is my friend who has produced me. Forget what you saw in commercials, forget what you heard, see this picture for yourself. I was more than surprised. The Grinch, Charlie's Angels, The 6th Day, Unbreakable, Your Hard-Ever Bucks in the World Comes with an Image! Glorious scenes, amazing cinematography and cast that you want to eat with your heart. I recognized one of these years as a powerhouse film and reason. Robert Denier gets an Oscar approval. If you provide an Oscar for everyone participating in the package, it will be an image.
