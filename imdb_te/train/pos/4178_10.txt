The film is a true reflection of the Australian resources needed for a country over the past 200 years. Unlike the British, the Americans are not like Gang-ho. If any of these countries tried to attempt to try, it failed. Because of ignorance on the British part, or greater confidence in the ammunition in America. "True" Australians (ie non-imports) are the only individuals to pass in modern military conflicts because they have gone to improve their adult lives. Just look at examples like Gallipoli; Paschendale; Tobruk; New Guinea and Vietnam.
