Stylish, moody, innovative revenge blood. Even cheesy, of course, and occasionally very cheesy. It reminds me a lot of Big Heat because the revenge plot set by the exact event, and the girl comes around the side of the good man because of the bad behavior of the bad guy. It's no wonder Gloria Grahame is sad but Alan Delon and Glen Ford are so amazing. Will Alain be a sweetheart anywhere around a cashmere sweater and TrenchCode? Yet he is absolutely tough and icy cool. Nobody can touch him right now - I guess anyone like Jude Law. No girl is difficult to look good with him. The music is funky and perfect and carries many amazing car (and that's not usually my cup of tea) - a Willy nilly in Woods. People met their dooms in the creative and bloody fashion for example in the Junkyard Cruncher. But beyond the cheese, affect the whole atmosphere and deftly pull off. More creativity, excitement and freshness than I've seen recently in "forgotten" movie.
