An old saying associated with the exciting new film by Joe Johnston is: "He is a man who can think of and think he is not right." <br /> <br /> "There is a young man who believes himself to be Homer Hickam, though he is confronted with self-motivation and belief in a person, despite the road blocks and family difficulties. Homer loves in a small coal mines, where almost every man grows up as a minor. <br /> <br /> One night, everybody looks at the sky and goes as a Russian spacecraft overhead, known as Sputnik, which is new to Homer. , And it's wonderful and worse. <br /> <br /> Previously, he worked in a rocket scientist area for a career Eyalani tells everyone. He was saying the bad, the idea of ​​losing their heads, his family, his friends, to continue life as normal, however, believe that this idea has some potential. <br /> <br /> When four friends began testing the model rockets and threw a white picket fence to SmitHires, a forest fire threatened to end their progress. <br /> <br /> The performances in the film have been completely stimulated from completing. All the performances are given as true mumbo jumbo here. All of the fame stand out: Miss Relay Laura Dern. <br /> <br /> The Academy may be the subject of the academy award if the judges are able to come back to the year when the film is released. <br /> <br /> The characters are well developed. For filmmakers, it is clear that Homer is interested in the subject, but explained to the audience what they did to the audience. <br /> <br /> The movie, unfortunately, is a crazy because of its momentum in some of the characters, beliefs, especially the father, the recycled romantic sub-plot that Homer's girlfriend loves and his brother steals him from him. This kind of high-school films is such a variation that is not intended for high-school teachers. As actors are at a trance, mindlessly stare at each other. <br /> <br /> In 1997, I did not complain about "Inventing the Abbotts". But I'm adequate in this regard. <br /> It's just a small complaint. In the honesty of time, the film was the first major film of 1999, with Homer in real life and the cinematography of Oscar and Oscar in the end, with their dreams, especially with Homer. <br /> <br />
