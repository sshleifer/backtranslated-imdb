Immediately after World War II, the sounding ideas in Hollywood attempted to distance themselves from the vacuum flag-waving, which was natural in the war effort. The "Best Years of Your Lives" and the 'Gentleman's Agreement' have also been investigated by the Americans to see themselves in the face of war, but Deller Davess's "Marines Pride" has attacked it. The movie goes to war after a nightmare evening in a foxhole and a Philadelphia smart alec about John Garfield, Japanese soldiers crying wonderfully "Mariiines, tonight you die!", He came home-hand-grenade, his girlfriend returned home She goes back home rather than going. <br /> <br /> These men who are daring to be dell'erate doves are random, and when they are burned, they react for a lot of heroism, but they finish the work, and then the dark, dark sense of self-pity, humor. His blindness and film makes no excuses, as his friend tells him, "this is free candy for anyone in the world". <br /> <br /> "When I come back, some guys do not appoint me because my name is diamond". <Br / > <br /> <br /> The great movies are made with buds like this, and the 'marines pride' fail to rise to innovation, since then it's the art of the art Marutundimiru's crying constantly, the article, you wonder and you hope against hope guricestarani.
