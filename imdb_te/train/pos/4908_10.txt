I have seen Martin's day at home, just 10 years old, at home and still remember the effect of my life. <br /> <br /> When I saw the first time I could not see anywhere else. I'm going around and nobody has heard about this movie! I guess it is one of the rare films that many do not know, no one is nobody, I know who I am talking about. I searched for and searched for years, checking scanning shelves and cable TV listings for video stores, but always got smaller. Finally, in 1996 I was able to order a special order, and I probably saw it at least 50 times - it shouted every time. <br /> <br /> Martin Schackert, who is in prison (but honestly good) about Martins Day, prefers to make it back to a special lake grown as a boy. This is a special place, he survived the nature, lived with his dog, and left alone to enjoy life. <br /> <br /> In this film, he escapes and starts to return to the lake. <br /> <br /> Cops are not long before finding him, and Sketter pulls a kid captive, off. Shortly after Sketkert and his captive (2nd martini) were good friends, and combined with a lot of fun adventures - stealing a toy truck and hi-jack up the train when going to this special lake. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Sketchard has great glasses at a boy's lake. <br /> <br /> I do not destroy the end for you, but the film must see. This is the best film I have ever seen in my life! I am, without a doubt, the biggest fan of this film! I've found the song that has been singing the song of both Martians ("when I come back, where did I come from ...) I'm crazy, shot on Martin's day to see the lake and the cottage - but that picture means a lot to me.
