The snare of the devil for the time being mutually unemployed. What if they were a 'what?' There's something sort of fun to consider in. 'Star Trek: First Contact', 'Back to the Future' Trilogy, 'Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure', 'Ground Hog Day' and 'The Ground Hog Day' Stargate SG1 Tribute, 'Window Off chance'. Heinlein's 'All You Your Jones' have been written decades ago, but it makes it the first time that people read the short story. <br /> <br /> In the Terry Gilliam's striking '12 Monkeys', it's hard to find out the plot elements and continuity issues that are intended to rediscover our concept of the film. <br /> <br /> Some people who have seen the film for the first time are considered a schizophrenic, played by Bruce Willis. <br /> <br /> It is unclear whether it is '12 Monkeys' other than Travel Stories at other times. Changing the history of the past can change the future history. Cole changes to his psychiatrist, Railley (Madeleine Stowe), but can not change at the time, but a phone call scientist from the airport prevents him from returning in 1996 on his personal time-line. > <br /> This time-line is also an interpreted event, to ensure that the time-line has not been changed ... Cole dies before his small eyes Self-self to learn the task. If so, the time is like a fluid, its function is to find its own level or path, regardless of external forces. <br /> <br /> If we can change the events in the future, guide the actions of people at the time, at the end of the picture to send people back to the time, then the past events in the future can be changed by manipulation ... or is it? The film was probably led by physicists and mathematicians at frequent bars at alcoholic fingers. <br /> <br /> The bonus material on the DVD makes for a very interesting view. Gilliam's budget was under normal pressure to bring up the film, which was not a surprise after the 'munchoujen' defeat and after his next attempt to portray 'Don Quixote'. One of the interesting things I have seen is the 'Making of' documentary. It certainly stops the whitewash and certainly the difficulties arising between creative individuals and occasionally notice the conflict. Gilliam's explanation of his "7Â½th" release, the film written by other writers rather than him - is not really his 'film' - the film does not do justice. <br /> Although his character is not particularly sympathetic, Brad Pitt's role in Goines is interesting. Look for his little wall-sighted scenes from the shelter from the shelter. <br /> Maybe a coincidence is the '12 Monkeys' and 'The Hitchhikers' Galaxy guide at the end of both the Louis Armstrong song 'What a Wonderful World'. <br /> <br /> 'Monkeys' is a science fiction story. It's entertaining the mental inspiration of the chess game. It's not a vacuum entertainment, it's perfect.
