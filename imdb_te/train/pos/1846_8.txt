When I read the first play story, I wanted to be like sex and the city, but there was no play. The stories of the characters look more realistic and you empathize with more conditions. The drama is similar to the feeling, four 30 something women friendships and guide us through the ties and troubles along the way. Katie GP is a dark and breeding character. It is hard for you to relate too and Trudy is a widow with good friends. Trudy's character is the only four parents who have suffered because of her heart warming. Jessica party girl is very single minded and knows what she wants and knows how to get it. She is a preferred character and her husband circulates in her work colleague and her husband can not help her eyes completely. It is surprisingly addictive on all plays and it can do well if the BBC continues to maintain that series. It is unlike other female actresses such as sex and city, or desperate housewives. This may be the right cold place. Plus female cast is not bad on most eyes.
