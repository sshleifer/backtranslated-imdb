I like this film too. I was guessing what it was going to happen. One of the better films about the division I saw. Urmila Matondkar is very beautiful. This is one of the most personal and down-to-earth movies I've seen in the division. It's a little less mainstream than Gadar, and an emotional roller coaster that starts with an impression of what's really going on, and completely pull out the other. This is not a distinct Bollywood charge, but an art-type type. The best part of the film is to keep track of the story of another, with no side of the partition conflict it is not ill. It does not blame or deny, but allows you to make your own decisions about things.
