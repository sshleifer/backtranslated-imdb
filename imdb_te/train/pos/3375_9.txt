The film will be seen as the seventh year of 2022. <br /> <br /> It is fun first, but how many things do we get to grant, even though the future is not a different world, even though the viewer is soon? <br /> <br /> The characters often interact in a strange way, without any strategic or polite or respect. I believe that this is not a bad act. After all, with the changes in the 60s and 70s, by 2022, most of the population of the population may think that they behave. <br /> <br /> I do not like the action scenes too much, the priest: is also very cheap for the seventies. The plot is not improved. <br /> <br /> The great scenes and ideas that deal with Sol's death, riots, dead bodies, "furniture" by overcoming the flaws in the film.
