The world is a terrible place. But this film is farce and it is fun. And if you do not like it ... you can not get it ... and if you do not get it ... it does not matter. It's up to you if you want to play along. Enjoy this every actor. It's just a joke. And that's good enough for me. Gabriel Byrne is very impressive. Bain and Paul Anka My Winning, "Vick" as "The Best Version ..." Okay ... it does not story, but it's not bad. I warned you for watching this, but I'm happy ...
