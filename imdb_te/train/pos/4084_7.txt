I guess a sort of redefining or updating of "Beauty and the Beast", but I can never see a movie that started with several minutes of graphic horse sex. Wow. Anyway, it is a young woman and she is aunt? The woman reached the fort in France, where the castle owner's son was to be married, who is the one who takes care of the horses to take their rocks. Besides it seems that a beast has legends in that area, uh, frisky, I expect ladies, or at least, one, most importantly, you can say. There are all kinds of references that remain, but the sooner the young bride Varun's father can remove her from her point of view. However, a young bride walks upstairs to go upstairs while waiting for a cardinal (family member, I guess) for the wedding, and she goes with her in her forests. Some of these effects can be a bit more affordable, and romanticism (I'm not very familiar with), some specialty appear to be realistic like a bed post or baseband bat. This is really strange and abrupt, yet with the twist ending, with really no clues or build it up too much, but it is not the kind of appropriate and absolutely appropriate I will meet. I do not know, it's a tough but it has its movements and is absolutely peculiar. 10 to 7.
