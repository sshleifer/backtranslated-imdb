This is a great movie. Since reading other reviews, I am not the only one who killed the tears. Tamilnadu Tommy played such skill and confidence, making her hearty and memorable. In the hands of the lesser actress, her last scene seemed to be soft and brown. An image did not expect a tight, limited budget. Cinematography is gorgeous and has a large number of big actors. The script is incredibly awesome, so I can see why they all stay in there. If you look at the list of long and long credits, you'll see that Haley's half is going to make this film and you're going to be good for a reason. Soundtrack (available on CD) is absolutely beautiful and sets the mood across the film. My only "complaint" is that I almost do not end up in the movie.
