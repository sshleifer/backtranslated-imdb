With Imfigenia, Michaikali Caciennes probably brought the sense of the Ancient Greek Theater to the opening of the first Greek director. His own screenplay is a simulation of the tragedy of Euripides, compared to the other two films of the trilogy he directed. The story was carefully removed from the Euripides version and placed in the logical, accurate chronological framework, which is good for modern techniques of film tales. Carrionius added some roles to his film, which is the tragedy of Euripides: Odysseus, Kolchas and the Army. This was done to make war, the church and the government clear of certain wars of Euripides. Finally, the closure of the Caacionius' epigenia compared to Euripides is somewhat obscure. <br /> <br /> The film was filmed in Alice. Director of photography Jorgos Arvantis, shows us rough but beautiful Greece, where Homeric days are still visible. He uses his bodies, arid lands, debris, intense light and darkness. The hardness of the landscape is particularly suited for the souls of the characters. The camera is full of a wide range of shots that are available from a very long time, in the spirit of harassment characters, to extensive and desolate of the terrain, as well as to bring the level of humanity seriously. In particular, at the beginning of the film, along with a bold, quick tracking shots, being boats, and an air scene where thousands of soldiers are unhindered at the beach are the most effective way to demonstrate Agamemnon's marvelous political and military relationship. <br /> <br /> Costa Kazakos (Agamemnon), Irene Papas (Clytemnestra) and Tatiana Papamoschou (Efigene Ya), but no word of the finest performances of "utkrstamainadi not". Kajakos and Papas show the sublime feel of Greece's tragedies. Kazakos' character is very down-to-earth, and his powerful look on the camera, more than his words, reveals unbelievable punishment for worrying his soul. Irene Papas is a modern essay of classic Greek dramas. In Ipigenia, she is terrible in her agony, and she knows she is a vengeance for her. Tatiana Papamosco, in her first role on the screen, is unusual in the innocent Imfigeania film she is contrary to the rigid description of Amazon's Kajakos. <br /> <br /> Caciónis is confident of his representation in Euripides: Odysseus is a sly and schematic politician, Achilles, a faint, eccentric warrior, Menalas is self-centered, eager to humiliate his honor, and his wife And the property must be renewed. <br /> <Textiles and sets are realistic: There is no Hollywood. The quarters of Agamemnon are similar to those of others, beneficial, hand-woven, regular cloth, a barn. <br /> <br /> Music is composed by composer Mais Theodoracis. Theodoracis score is dramatic and cinematographic, reflecting the psychological aspect of the tragedy, and refers to its dimensions and originality. <br /> <br /> In this movie and the ancient story of a lost insight in the lost world is the Greek concept of many innocent people in our modern civilization. This teaches us about human beings and social and political life. Euripides questions war and patriotism against the simple tendencies of family and love and reflects the woman's toughness in men's violence. <br /> <br /> In accordance with Euripides' s sadness, the Caachianis will revise all of these themes in a modern, clear and dramatic style. <br /> <br /> The politics of political machinations have been proved to be clear: warfare and human spirit may not normally work for any person or group. With the exception of Minellas's Minneapolis, his wife was no longer defiant with his honor, and everyone had his own personal inspiration to go to war with Troy, who is not associated with Helen: Thirst for Strength (Agamemnon), Greed (Army, Odyssey), or Fame (Achilles). In real sense, Helen became the WMD of the Trojan War. <br /> <br /> This war, excluding Homeric Glamor and religious sanctions, was just an imperial venture, encouraged by the desire to be the preferred choice of everything, mainly through the earned desire. Between church and state. Callchas, representing the church, calls his priest to sacrifice his daughter for insulting the goddess, seeking to destroy Agamemnon, to feel the challenge of his priesthood. When agreeing to sacrifice, the king comes close to his moral retirement, but in rejecting, he loses his power over the brains of the brain (religion). However, it is a game for Agamemnon. <br /> When the king honestly believes in the gods or believes, he hurries himself in the torture that he has wiped out until he is late. How can I say the difference between murder and two? Euripides / Caciónis will create a dramatic political and harassing personal drama - and, more importantly, a child's sacrifice - by focusing on the violent and primitive horror of a human sacrifice. It touched upon the most complicated and sensitive ethical problem faced by any community: the terrible conflict between the person's needs against the community of society. But in the case of Iphigiania, in the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac, the Father asks his father to kill his own hands. In what kind of payment should God be? Is divine inspiration, whether it's just or morally? Finally, is the death of the daughter's sacrifice different from the deaths of all the sons and daughters sent to war? These are a lot of deep questions by a two-hour film.
