When I saw the dentist, I felt very nice. But this film is not for everyone, people who do not like the gorgeous scenes especially like the dentist Gary has a lot of scenes. That's why it has R18 rating. It was about Dr. Alan Feinstein, a divergent dentist who discovered that his wife Brook was cheating with Plymu. It's best to go "before" your dentist. If you do not intend to go to a dentist, it's not best to see this as you go to life. Dentist is the best bloody revenge of what I have ever seen. A dentist (spoiler) pulled out his cheating wife's teeth and saw the image of his tongue cut with an anesthesiology? Overall is a fantastic flick, but not for everyone.
