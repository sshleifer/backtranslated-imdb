Mr Michael Jackson is an artistic phenomenon. His short films, music videos, are the best. I do not care if I get a sane sci-fi feature from this man, but I cautioned me to get his crazy dance, shiock jales, cool audience choreography, and a bit of bits CGI and animation. There should also be some uninterrupted videos. Everything I mentioned here is here. Stupid plot and over-the-top "Vanity Fair" are not a problem as I witness Mr Michael Jackson in action. I do not think he's always music videos (not "pop king", especially for us, Russians, asses ") because Russian word" pop "sounds for" ASCs "and MJ, and I can see his best music videos (artistically beautiful) I'm not tired. <br /> <br /> The first impression of the film is "what is this?" (Bits of various videos, some drawn images, from a background <br /> <br /> In the end, I have seen that there is nothing really like anything that is shown on TV today. <br /> <br /> Music videos without Michele Jackson is rather poor, unlike the universe. The best conventional videos of artists are also the powerful hyperbole of MJ music insanity and artistic quality He knows how to get a variety of aged audience and know how he continued with a man with moral principles. <br /> <br /> When I see the right DVD release with Mr Michael Jackson videos it's up to me that some clips already appear in some other previous releases . "Moonwarker" is a movie (solid "Smooth Criminal" theme, "paparazzi" item and some lucky spoofs and turns, such as "Moonwarker", "Historie I", "Historie II" and "Moonwalker"). <br /> You're not going to be a fan of MJ. I still have the main complaints of "Smooth Criminal" by 10 to 10 ("MJ Anti-Drug Campaign" and "sky-rocket insanity and stress" And more "moonwalking"). Thank you for your attention.
