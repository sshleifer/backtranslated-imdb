And finally this film killed me! I watch at least 3-4 movies per week. I saw loads of great movies, and yet the worst - them. But when the scene is over - it's catharsic at the core - I got to cry! And if you did not - you have serious problems! The story is ideal - nothing new or original. But the truth is - because such things have really happened and people really exist. Glam is not my sort of music but I really admire all they have gone through the early 70's ... at some point directing me to this velvet goldmine! Docudramas is really pretty good always working. But this film really believes all of us ... Musicians present that they are wonderful concerts, superheroes, present stupid and emotionally unpredictable group girls, they do not glorify drugs and alcohol, they also encourage rehabilitation and redemption 20 years late. image. I never made a film from "Leaving Las Vegas".
