49. Paperhoos (Thriller / Horror, 1988) was sleeping with 11-year-old Anna (Charlotte Burke), who only had her drawings to keep her companies. Her health gradually changes the mysterious 'black drugs' grip. Each of these episodes has dreams of a house in a homeless field, and only the boy, Marc (Elliot Spears), lives. When a dark, unknown accident threatens her idyll "paper house", Mark's life is put at risk. <br /> <br /> British director Bernard Ross has been unveiled for the first time ever since. Taken from the story ("Marianne Dreams") by Catherine Store, which leaves plenty of other 'original' fantasy works on its backdrop. When dealing with a story with dreams and nightmares, it's hard to give a mix of story and realism to work in the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Roger, who has been fired by Felipe Glass, 'jump from your seat' Most thrillers are very dull in all these important aspects of the audience. I also like the capture of suspense and make it slower in the next scenes. Furthermore, keeping objects in the frame (as in his P.O.V.shots), his cinematography gives the view that it lacks. Single house, fields, coastal towns, watchtower etc. <br /> <br /> Rosie follows the film with "Candyman" (1992), a real 'idea' of the person's horror gem and bon fide cult cult hilarious.
