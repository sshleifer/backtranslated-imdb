The film's undoubtedly highlight is Peter O'Toole's performance. Gradually extensively comic and terrible terrible tragedy. Anyone better than a 'tool? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> The story is an odd one and parts (especially at the end) are very disturbing and mentally acute but it is also unusual touching and does not succeed at many levels. However, the film primarily turns around the glowing performance of Peter O'Toole and I'm sure he's not even half enjoyed even when he's not there.
