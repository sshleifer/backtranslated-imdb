I think it's one of the best films I've ever seen, I'm an old man and very Western love. I love the movies at least for the facts, and if I'm not mistaken, it's such a film. I also like revenge movies, and this is the same as in my opinion. The opening sequence with some of my favorite parts of the film is the hitting and barn shooting scenery. I thought the Karal beating scene was a little overkill but how would I feel about the whole movie? I thought it was a continuation of this movie in a stormy smoke episode. I also enjoyed it. I recommend to take the time to watch this film and see again. I also played the romantic parts of the film. I thought villain played a role in the role of Randy Travis, but I enjoyed his performance.
