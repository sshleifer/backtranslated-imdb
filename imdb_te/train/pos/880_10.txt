Perhaps the best film per year. This little French film worker Carla (Emmanuel Devos) has spent other men doing jobs, lacking confidence, and their ridicule and loud time conversations, which read partially deaf and lips. The change occurred when the newly-named Perald con Pal (Vincent Cassel) appointed her assistant. The relationship between them is the picture associated with it. For different reasons, mutually dependent. The fact that Carla Paul is attracted and he makes her feel attractive for her, looks like her first time. Paul does nothing to dispel his feelings because she needs her help. He pays money for a local gangster, and creates a plan to steal him from, which has the ability to read the carlass. The main thing I pushed the picture above average suspense / play is the amazing chemistry between the two stars. Throughout the whole movie, no other characters are on the screen, you can experience this wonderful bond between Carla and Paul. I saw sexual chemistry between the two actors. Emmanuel Devos gave a splendid performance (she won the French Caesar as Best Actress). You always feel like watching a piece of acting, this is really Carla. The oscilloscule like Vincent Cassell is also amazing. He makes a somewhat improbable role for both impressive and attractive. I loved this movie for all these two people, and I wanted to go back to the cinema once again and again and again to see them again.
