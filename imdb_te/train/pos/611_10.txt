I am absolutely shocked by anyone who is ultimately responsible for creating / accepting the trailer for this film. I know I'll watch this movie based on the previews, and it's actually (I've learned) seeing it thoroughly ... advertising campaign is insulting / disaster / flop. <br /> <br /> # 1-Rush Hour, which I did not see, Average IMDb score 7.4. <br /> <br /> # 2-The Bourne Ultimatum, I'm Watching the # 3-The Simpsons Movie, Okay Movie But Averages In The Fourth Week, <br /> <br /> # 4 Stardust, 8.4 Average IMDb score (less in Bourne, but our 3 weeks is ours). <br /> If it's a bad schedule or poor statement, I feel that the forces behind this film are so big! Should this be a fantasy / fairy tale and should be promoted as a fantastic movie not just another fantastic campaign? Very bad: (Anyway - now I'm in a very meaningless and on-going ... Awesome movie, see it!
