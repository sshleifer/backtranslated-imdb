This should be a great movie about the serial killers I've seen, and this is coming from someone who is completely lambs silence. HBO has hit the jackpot here. <br /> <br /> The movie is very difficult to tell about the underlying themes. It is a systematic decade-long search for Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. Stephen Rea is an experienced Forensic expert who has been appointed as an investigator, and Donald Sutherland is his exemplary superintendent and gives the only person in the Russian government who is ready to help him. Both of their performances are miniature masterpieces-Rhea is unlikely to be innocent and compromise, Sutherland starts separately and begins to spend the entire situation. <br /> <br /> Although Satarland finds her more passionate and idealistic, eventually, Rea becomes a forgettable and inconvenient world. <br /> <br /> In any other film, Sutherland's performance is resting, but here it is also competing against serial killer by Jeffrey Dumann. DuMann brilliantly creates a character where a sense of empathy is more than what we experience --- he's a monster, but he does not want to be, and we're thinking he's just disgusting what he's doing. <br /> If you take a very dark subject (and it is very painful) then you will see this movie.
