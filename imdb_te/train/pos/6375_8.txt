Although I have great respect for Disney's animated films, I can not say they really are "must see". Atlantis looked awkwardly from the first film poster and trailer and lived up to my expectations. This is a more "mature" Disney movie (which is a very unusual feature of the Disney movie) because of the Atlantis's songs, and has focused more on the action and innovation than the recent other Disney offerings. The Atlantis world is concealed as a major center of the earth, known as desolate caves with ruins, and then slowly develops true ecosystems, usually having some tough reminders, and has reached tropical paradise. The appearance of the landscape and arrangement of Atlantis, with some costly cheese song, gave the kingdom a more beautiful and mysterious look. <br /> <br /> Including the Atlantean language, efforts to integrate the myth of ancient civilizations in real life can do this and it works very well. <br /> <br /> Except for a few scenes of Moe, practical jokes do not seem to have a "childish" element that is usually associated with Disney movies. Instead, the main elements of Atlantis's struggle and the constant discovery in Atlantis, he was able to learn about this place by helping the outsider find the parts of their own history to the Atlantis. They do not know about it. This episode includes the Atlantian "weapon", which is used in most action-packed climax, which is very exciting with the lack of a good word. </ P> <p> The concept, and the film does not have any amazing new computer-generated visual effects, but, from Toy Story movies, this is the most entertaining Disney movie I have seen over the years.
