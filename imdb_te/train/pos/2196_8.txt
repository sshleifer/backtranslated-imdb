... so what's missing in those 10 minutes so terrible that they had to cut them from the original image? We have three years into film production code ... Barbara Stanwyck starred in the original play, but here, Carol Lambord plays Maggie King. Co-star Fred MacArray is probably known as a "double indemnity", along with Stanwick and his hit TV show "My Three Sons". Keep a young Dorothy Lamour (Bob Hope movies) and put on the tape Keep the eyes of Franklin Pangun very well decorated about each image. However, he works at the beauty salon on the ship! Add the best of Charles Butterworth and Anthony Quinn. Good timing and brilliant banter in the beginning. Maggie's friend Ella was featured in the "Holiday" and "My Man Godfrey" by Jean Dixon. In "Swing Hai", the Maggie meets a soldier leaving the tourist army. When it goes to the port and tied to a soldier, Maggie loses his boat. The 20-something queen has a small scene at the local bar in Panama, where Johnson (McMurray) is playing the trumpet. Maggie, Harry (Butterworth), and Skid Band try to find out how to get back to the states together. Some good singing by Lamour. A good (but brief) acting performance by Cecil Cunningham as "Murph", a clever and useful employer at the local salon in Pasima. This is not terrible, as the others call it badly, and a little exotic with the fake Central American language setting for the first half of the film.
