This is probably the best rockumentary - the British, the better this Spinal Tap. The characters are incredible, the plot is great, and in the band you can honestly understand some events, such as Ray's problem. <br /> <br Soundtrack is wonderful. Real period stuff, if it is in the same key, you'll be humming the songs for a few days. Nearly all the British cast of my choice, with some favorite housewives. Ray's wife is priceless ... <br /> <br /> This film is never pulled, it goes at the right speed, and there are some genuinely funny sections. <br /> This is a hidden diamond.
