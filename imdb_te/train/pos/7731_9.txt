<br /> <br /> "After dark, my sweet" is a strange combination of sensuality and enticing. The film slowly runs very slowly, but takes a rhythm to tell a story about murder and passion. Jason Patrick is never always sexy and powerful (man gives a real performance), and Rachel Ward is all sexy. </ P> <p> Sexual tension, piscological heat, past footage ... flashback scenes, the dysplasia of Patrick's character, everything is sexy mystery. I recommend this one more sexy dull film I have seen. Check out the love sequence, which is related to the center.
