I'll start to say that it's just unfair to everyone! In fact, nobody really wanted to hear from Guy Ritchie. Everyone has cockney geezers and good liners like "Daggers?" Etc., but it is much more mature than its previous works. I agree that it's confusing but we have all the facts that we want to see them and listen to the harder, this film demands your attention! <br /> <br /> Notice the cool and dazzling look of the film, I try to hear the conversation than admire the performances and I feel we get a more intuitive understanding of the whole picture. The effects from modern classics (fight club, pulp fabrication, etc.) are both in original and both are paced with music score for both. I feel that many people have understood this because they have seen this picture and it is a great way to appreciate the best part of modern cinema and I hope Ritchie will continue to do this in vain, and I like his "masterpieces".
