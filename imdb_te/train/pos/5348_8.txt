Another amazing Arnold film. This is a great action film in the future, and one of Arnie's best films. Arnold is a bad guy in this movie and plays a game of Death. This film is an amazing and great science fiction / action movie. I always liked this movie and it should be one of the greatest adventure films of all time. 10 out of 10! Perfection
