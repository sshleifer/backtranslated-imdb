There is a sub-genre in the Western so-called 'Robert Mitchet Western'. Muchchum's wonderful, unique, and generally unwanted Westerners have made his film Nair's personality move to some simple dark character sketches, and bring out more familiar world-fatigue from Sam Peckfafa's paintings. 'Man with a gun' is his best. Archimedes Wells Protest, directed by Richard Wilson, has left a town threatening a monopoly with a private army, with embarrassment, monochrome beauty, chilling photography and terrifying torture. Between Mitchell's retreat, a soft-spoken stranger who is disturbing the murderer, with a host of dark emotions, the miracle of expression and physical acting.
