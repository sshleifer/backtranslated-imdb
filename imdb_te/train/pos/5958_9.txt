Unlike some comments, mine is positively. This movie is not a group of friends around the dinner table, some of your favorite people. Some relationships - mother, daughter, son. Their stories are not a soft, everyone and everything, happy with the kind of life - as in most real life. Some of the heroines do not develop, they just happen. But like real families and good friends, they stick together. Parents who buy baby are such holes! You're happy for the end. Poor Delmer is a rock and a Boulder stuck between herself, her mother, her son, and trying to keep their lives together. It ends with 'sunset walk or house' and everyone lives in a dream calendar, but it's a real life picture of people living in a day. Overall, this is a good story and great movie !!
