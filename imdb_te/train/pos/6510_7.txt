Actually I really like this cartoon so far. Sure, the animation is not the best, but frankly, I'd rather see this type of more cartoony style done more quickly and cheaply than the old type style (which is more often started to happen - it's a style only when a lot of time and effort put it) . There is nothing wrong with angular lines and small black-dot eyes - in fact, I feel really beautiful. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Shaggy is always my favorite character, and it is not believed or not, but I did not think it was, but the design of Scooby Doo was particularly adorable. He think he has some potential depth. Certainly, the program is not central to the original "mystery-solving" background, but it is just a tired old formula anyway. Mystery Inc. I'm not sure that there are writers who are more interested in traditional pursuits (not too late). A fun deviation from the show standard. Shaggy and Scooby still funny, but no longer only comic relief. They're still shy, but it's still possible to use (shock!) Intelligence. <br /> <br /> "The pure cheese and the best to be happily unhappy, but this program is actually capable of real humor, and the cassie kommin is never really shaggy <br /> <br /> In total overall cartoon history is not a great cartoon, but there is also a reputation among other scoop avatars.
