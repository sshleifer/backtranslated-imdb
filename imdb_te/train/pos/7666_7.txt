On the fourth angle trying to destroy the land, two witches and another (Jeffrey Combs Anton Mordidid) are trying to save it. "Doctor Morddidi" is an enjoyable fantasy fare of cheese.The cheese is pretty crazy and gore is not full, but the picture is very small and fun. So give it a look if you have enough time to kill.Your rating: 7 out of 10.
