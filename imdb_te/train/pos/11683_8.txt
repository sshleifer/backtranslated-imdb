I really enjoyed this episode, it's astonishing, bad reputation as it has purchased. From the pure writing perspective, '16mm Pilgrimage 'is a perfect treatment, with the distinctive speech and alphabetical analysis of Sterling. Especially when I'm actually balancing it with more psychological subjects such as rejection, pride, and desire, to experience the solutions of the philosophical affiliations, existence and realities of the episode. These thoughts can distinguish one person from other people in the changing world, never mind to accept a change of 'sixteen millimeter pilgrims'. It is also an excellent example of the cerebral twilight zone; One that explores the mind more than the outside world. <br /> <br /> This episode is primarily not without errors in Lupino and Leicesen boots. Ironically, I did not expect much of a few scenes that I could imagine Lupino's unpredictability. Sterling takes into consideration the extent to which his character is written. Still Lesen does not know what his characters know too much, sometimes having them stand around the set-up doing nothing-perhaps it explains why Lupino will accept poor performances from half-time. Fortunately, Balsam makes a good job of covering the weakest spots, helping at least redeem the performance from the angle of acting. <br /> <br /> If I were in the past, if you're a fan of classic film, cerebral science fiction, it's not as bad as sometimes made. In addition to the above-mentioned writing, the episode also has some amazing photography (it's fine for over fifty years now!) And has a good enough set-design. Overall, the 'sixteen-millimeter shrine' is a great piece and you are definitely more considerate.
