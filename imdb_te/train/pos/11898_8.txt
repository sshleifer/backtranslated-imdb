The film is a definite description of The Nutcracker; <br /> Oh, and the costumes ... I especially love Marzipan, Tutu is adorable. Special effects were great (eg tree, bed, etc.), and I enjoyed a lot of rats. I love how they are not scary, but beautiful and hug. <br /> If you are a masculine person, you can not enjoy it, but it's good for all ages - it's not just at all levels. <br /> <br /> But there are some complaints about me. <br /> <br /> First of all, why do you put the partner of Sugar Plum Fairy in those awful strokes? If he is naked but it just makes a difference! And secondly .. why in the earth they have to make Culkin's outfit pink?
