I had to watch the whole movie last night and I found it very exciting. It does not like pop-out teen-slasher movies every now and then. I recall that the search for the killer and the hero's 'partner' relationship was on my seat at a particular scene in the movie. It's exciting. After a while, you can see the film again. ..
