In the best of the time, I have to say I am # 1 Christine McIntyre. The scene of the sham is in the case of poison and her reaction is really amazing. <br /> <br /> Even as a poster suggested, she was trying to catch Christ again in the scene, and she seemed to be a tasty recipe for laughter when Shemp was dying. <br /> <br /> Gon helps this stand. His appearance is a great cross between horror and jolly goof-ball. Anywhere I choose to join in a dark alley for that matter. I would have preferred a bit of true whodunit secret in this, but hey, when a little this is good, who's going to complain. Ear
