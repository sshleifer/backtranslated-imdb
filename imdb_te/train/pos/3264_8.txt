What was the damage done by director Emile Aardolino! He takes a light script, with right casting and editing, it will put a twinkle and shine like a star. Great dancing go and this particular star may not be bright in the sky, but it is definitely one that keeps you tune up to the end. <br /> <br /> This script suits the Cybill Shepard, and does not know how much after she started her very good big duds (luckily for her) when she needed a "new lighting" success to the new generation. Every bit in this movie is back in a still pining widow living with her daughter (Mary Stuart Masterson, living through the cusp of the star which is maximal with "Fried Green Tomatoes" two years later). She seemed to be too small for this role, but that story narrates the story. It is her image, but she will not overtake her borders. <br /> <br /> Shepard graciously takes Robert Downey Jr. very much with the film and shows him more mature comic flair than earlier movies. And has been supported by Ryan O'Neill (in his best role in years) and Christopher MacDonald. <br /> <br /> Argentina has pretty coastal areas of its own performances, or she makes her character get the fresh air with each word. <br /> <br /> Ardolino made his cast of sex appeal as well as with "Dirty Dancing", but the movie is not too big, so you can see if you are in the room with your parents. (Use your best judgment, they are all your parents.) Because I am a very friendly friend, I give this movie a high mark, romantic comedy enthusiasts are awesome, and they have plenty of access to them. <br /> <br /> Again, credit goes to Emil Ardolinochi Randy and Perry Hosez for making a fascinating script. (Where are they now?) Is a continuation of Ardolino's next film "Three Men and a Baby", but his last theatrical release (sister law) eventually earned him the nine-figure he earned. Mr. Ardolino, missed your movie touch!
