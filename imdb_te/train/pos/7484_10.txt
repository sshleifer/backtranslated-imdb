How the human mind is bizarre; This center, which builds and develops the reality of reality, and this is the most sensitive and complex process of sensory knowledge, the perspective of world hinges on the soft functioning of the brain. How well do we know about the inner workings of deeper or efficient work? What is this in mind that can understand the mind between realism and dreams? Or can we do it? Like Manat painting, our perspective is more than what we actually see, in which vanilla sky of his vision becomes our reality. It is a concept that Tom Cruise and 'Vanilla Sky' featuring Penelope Cruz, his most fictional and motion-change film, filmmaker Cameron Crow. At the age of thirty-three years, David Eames (Cruise) gets his father leaving the publishing empire. His fifty-one percent interest is interesting to control, seven of his board directors are members, each one of the company's lion's share of the young Me. <br /> <br /> David assumed David's attention to him. <br /> <br /> David likes to play; Still, he has control over the business and he sees fit, whether the board (he's referred to as 'Seven Dwarfs'), and no one ever dares to challenge him directly. But during a lavish birthday in his honor, one of the corporate advocates, Thomas Tippo (Timothy Spall), warned David that he was up to seven. At that time, though, it was the final thing of David's mind; He is friendly with a friend, Julie Giannie (Cameron Diaz), but he moves back to Burner when a woman does not come out of her mind at her party. Her name is Sophia (Penelope Cruz), and after she learns only one night, she becomes a crucial part of her life - it is going to turn upside down, and her party will decide the next morning to change her life forever. <br /> <br /> Director Cameron Crow has created more than two images. More than an image, 'Vanilla Sky' realized a vision. Starting with the first images appearing on the screen, he provides a visually remarkable experience, which is infinitely and cerebral. This is a mind-blinking secret that can swallow you and wipe you away; Emotionally, it's a rush - and it can make you feel like you need some effort to stay with it. But it is worth it. Think of 'Memento' with a driving rock n 'roll soundtrack and a powerful attack of colors presented by an impressionist brush's stroke. There is darkness and light, and sounds that pound and drive until you feel rushing through your veins and feel throbbing in your brain. And all played on a landscape of sophisticated reality underneath ever expanding in the vanilla sky. Easy to put, this is a real trip; <br /> <br /> Here are those who can see him as' Mission Impossible 'or simply' actor 'for those who do not get past the Tom Cruise's mind set as Maverick in `Top Gun,' or his Ethan Hunt, Have to think. As David Aries, Cruise has done the best of his career, and has to look for any doubts about his potential as an actor at the door. Over the past few years, he chose some of the most interesting career options, with the likes of Magnolia and Eyes Wide Shutt. He has just warm-ups for the real and complex character he creates here. And give him credit, too, for Vanity to take a role in scattering any sense; It's a cruise that you've never seen before. "Jerry Maguire" earned him an Oscar nomination, and this should be the same - his appreciation and appreciation of his colleagues. <br /> <br /> Cruise in this movie is not good, he's great. <br /> <br /> Penelope Cruz turns out to be exceptional, though not as exceptional performance, as Sophia of David's dreams. There is an impressive innocence that she works well for her character and brings this character to her upcoming and accessible, yet there is no hint of mystery that may be added to her 'special' something special. <br /> <br /> Cruise is sure to know how to get the best part of his actors and he certainly did with Cruz. <br /> <br /> He also learned what he did with Cameron Diaz, who was fully excited about Julie. She never seemed to be good, and was well packed on the screen. But it is not mistaken, it is not part of 'window-dressing' and Diaz offers a full package with this character. She measured the quality of the show, in fact, in effect makes her rather limited screen time. And she is so completely integrating personality with her underlying beauty that makes Julie so memorable. /> <br /> The supporting cast Kurt Russell <br (Dr. mekkebe), Jason Lee (Brian), Johnny Galecki (Peter), Armand Schultz (Dr. pomerantj), Noah Taylor (Ed), Mel Thompson ( `LE 'Man) , Jean Carroll (Woman in New York) and John Fedeev (Silent Ed). About half way through, this might have you questioning your own feel of reality; But the rest is guaranteed, at the end of the 'Vanilla Sky'. It's a reality-bender, sure, and a wild one; But it's the only fun to be satisfied - and the only one - experience, you have to look to believe. It's important, and perfect, the magic of movies. <br /> <br /> <br />
