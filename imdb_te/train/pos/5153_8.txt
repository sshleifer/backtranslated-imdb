In Hitler: The Rise of Evil, Hitler's early years of life and politics have shown some minor historical flaws and some exaggerated successive ways. The main purpose of the product is that the Hollywood movie is very natural as they have things like income that they will get from the movie. I believe that even if some of the audience is disappointed with such flaws, the majority of them are better suited to the rest of the movie. We should not forget that this film is not a documentary. <br /> <br /> Hitler is portrayed as mentally unstable throughout the film, making it very angry and very passionate about his ideals. But he did not play a super-villain role but as an ambitious politician. I believe that the film is not polluted by tons of negative emotions and it's a good idea that the film is aimed at some purpose. Yes he is a little insane, and his methods are rigorous but not entirely mad person in the film "Ingorios bastards". <br /> <br /> I believe that the film is more realistic with some of the fraudulent historical facts. <br /> <br /> The flow of history reflects well to the audience. Although the film's vision is around Hitler, let's see what happens in the country as a result of these actions by newspapers, public debates and songs in Jewish cabaret. The reaction of the society also reflects the film but is very limited. The fights of journalists Fritz Gerlich and Cabaret are fighting and entertaining but there is everything. Most of us saw his followers encourage him by making the blood of the streets. <br /> <br /> Another thing missing in the picture is information about the source of his hatred for the Jews. At the beginning of this film, some ideas have been given about this but they are very superficial. <br /> <br /> In the end, Hitler: The Rise of Evil is not considered a fantastic film for everyone but it is not unsatisfactory. If you can retain the directors who change the history of cash, it is an interesting film that reflects Hitler's personality as successful.
