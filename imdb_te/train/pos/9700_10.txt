However, the film will be exciting, luxurious and at the same time stirring the heart. Celebrities like Tony Shalhoub (from Providence) are brought to life. The story is also inspiring. <br /> <br /> Paulie begins his life as a baby parrot given to a little boy (haley eisenberg, Pepsi girl) with a speech barrier. While she learns to speak correctly, Poly will also do. Nonetheless, unlike many birds, he can understand everything he talks and says. The military father does not like the bird, so he's sent to the pawn store and buying old-fashioned artist Ivy. She teaches him the courtesy, etc., traveling across the country to find Polly's owner. Finally, the fate will continue with many turns until Pauli ends up in a laboratory where he finally finds himself hidden in the basement and the Russian guardian who struck through the bird's story. The place is a simple, metaphorical theme, giving the language a gift and curse. I want to say that the soundtrack is ridiculous. The film has a beautiful blend of flute, digital base and horns that extend the film to a pure eczema. The sweeping camera angles and the breathtaking scenery story is even more beautiful. In the end, the puppy is completely reliable. (Unlike Star Wars where Yoda is similar to a Muppet) this film is one of my favorite movies, the four-year-old added parakeet recently added comment. Overall, I give this film **** in four stars, two thumbs, and a big hug.
