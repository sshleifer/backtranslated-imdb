<br /> <br /> Now I have seen the film three times, and every time I show more personal and more emotion than I see. <br /> <br /> Acting is a wonderful actor, Daniel Day Lewis. Brenda Fricker is surprising though. <br /> <br /> She binds her heart to a physically disabled child and can not walk or talk as long as she is younger. <br /> <br /> I can not say good things about the movie, but here I will stop. I would recommend anyone who likes movies based on realistic programming or generally enjoy good dramas.
