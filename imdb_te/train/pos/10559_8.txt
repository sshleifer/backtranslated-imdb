I have not written a review for IMDb for a long time, though, I'm compelled to write this! I found a special review that I did not see this review when watching this movie. This innocent person does not care! Nothing is a wonderful picture, laugh complete and above all ... imagination! Are you ill and tired of giving the same old wheel of bubble-gum bad movies? Sometimes a movie like Nothing comes along and gives you something you have never seen before. If you do not like (even if you hate) I do not care, but there is no one right to ridicule the movie. The IMDb has the impact of prestigious losses and any disadvantage of the film should be unsatisfactory. Tell me why you hate it and why you hate it ... but do not tell people they should not see. <br /> <br /> If any of my judgments are good, I will say that most of the people who hate it will enjoy this movie. <br /> Get your mind to your baby for eye-candy! See nothing!
