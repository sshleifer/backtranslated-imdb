Before commenting on this film, when I saw the film, I thought I'd imagined and enjoyed the typical worst, horror, b-movie. One of the Jack Frost is not only distributed but actually one of the best I've seen in a long time. Scott MacDonald is great as Jack Frost, and in reality I think he has a mental attitude in movies with big time. MacDonald is a serial killer, he is a snowman by some stupid random mix of hilarious elements. As soon as the snowman moves around and kills people, you will not be able to laugh at it. The said lines are completely depleted but really funny. The fact that the rest of the cast is complete is the fact that the film adds to stupidity, but the stupidity is that genius. The scenery where the snowmen young girl is B-movie, is really classic in the horror movie fashion. I really hope there is a sequel and I'll be there to watch any of the cable channel. Of course it is only fun to see the first few times and it certainly does not work better with motion picture technology, but I want to see snowmen kill people. I gave it from 10 to 7, this is a great movie for dates and couples in late hours.
