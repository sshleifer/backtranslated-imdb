Damn directly ...... This show kick the ass back in the day and still continues back to cartoons today. I can not wait to keep track of some DVDs to share with my little person and look the same in his eyes. I already introduced Voltron (one of the 15 lanes of one of the lions) and laughed off my head when he told me one day "Dad when you were a kid .. You definitely watched some amazing cartoons!" <br /> <br /> In Hollywood Come, wipe this dirt and give a live action effort. SpiderMan may not be worse than 3 ... Man oh man ... 2007 was a pretty lame to date for summer movies. <br /> <br /> I'm going to shuddup now <br /> <cheers
