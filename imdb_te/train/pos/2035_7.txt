Well it looks like I'm going to go against grain in this film. Sit a self-horror fan and I did not know what to expect of this. After 2 or 3 minutes I actually was scared (very rarely). The film certainly has a small budget and is set around charging cross-station but does not distract from the story's money story. Yes story is a bit too far away and does not explain very well but Creep proceeds to slash and slash a class act and its way. Message for ladies !!! If you close your eyes, at least close your eyes or cross your leagues! You'll understand when you see it. <br /> <br /> All in all good films and frightened to see a good horror movie
