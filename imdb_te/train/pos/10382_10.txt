Like all other critics, the film is constantly in my mind 30 years later. All the books I can do in this story go to the library. I also wrote the PBS station for more information. Earlier, in the early 1900's, I was able to find a story printed in a newspaper. <br /> <br /> In 2002, there was evidence and copy of VHS image of it there. There are two other auctions but I have decided to win this film. A loser bidder asked me to give her a copy. Despite having a copy, I have found a site that I have searched for and finally sells a DVD copy. You can find it at: http://www.johntopping.com/Harvey%20Perr/War%20Widow/war_widow.html
