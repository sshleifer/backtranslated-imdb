When I heard this film, I made sure to see it when I heard it. The Taiwanese director prompted fame with "The Wedding Banquet" and "Drink Drink Man Woman" a few years ago and then went to "Sense and Sensibility" and "The Ice Storm". Now, he has turned his attention to another American icon - a civil war. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in the state of Missouri, with a sympathetic south of Missouri. They did not formally join the Confederate Army. Instead, they form illegal bands called "Bushwalkers", who have grown long hair and sometimes confiscate uniformed uniformed uniforms. <br /> <br /> The heroic missions of the killers of shopkeepers and farmers to help their moral confusion, time and union. There is no star in this movie, you are a singer and a young companion widow of "Jewel". <br /> <br /> Tobe Macwire pretends to be a young German farm boy, his legacy because the Germans union sympathizers wanted to. <br /> <br /> Jeffrey Wright is a free slave traveling with Bushhawkers because this young man is a wonderful actor. For his loyalty to the young man who bought his freedom. <br /> <br /> Some of the sticks in acting, especially in their long conversations with morality. And their outfits are very new. The "south gentleman" theme comes from a very bit of polite and hot-typing and respectable "Southern Gentleman" theme - they make a point to kill all men to pull them out of their women's hands, and then burn down the shops. "I do not think it would fall into one of the films, even if the slow parts and the longest of it, I attract it Anu 140 minutes. <br /> <br /> All of the characters who are real and incomplete human beings who learn what will happen next and hold in the forces of history. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
