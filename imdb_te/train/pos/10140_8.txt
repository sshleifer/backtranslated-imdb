Fans of the HBO series "Tales from the Crypt" prefer this MOH episode. </ P> <p> Those familiar with the basic arctiple tales based on classic EC comics are known to the right of this bat. <br /> <br /> The Independent Indie fan Martin Donovan (Still amazing writer - co-writer Apartment Zero and Screen Place for Death) is the kind of person she's going to either look good on everybody. He is really nice if the wrong-guy-side door, or he plays the same role as a creepy fantasy of corrosive sleaziness. <br /> <br /> Donovan is unhappy with a physician and unhealthy spouse, Abe (Julia Anderson) who recently worked with his mature office receptionist (Robin Sydney). When both of them were involved in the horrific car crash, when she returned from the unsuccessful weekend of "Making", and she was burned in a fierce fire, without enthusiastic enthusiasm from the spazzer on her. But Abe never had a fight, EC-theme comes up. Some shoulders - and wives - are always some horror (and shaky) supernatural sneak acrobatics, and this case is certainly no exception. If anything, sex and gore should have Bill Gaines pulling somewhere in his grave with joy in the randed up area. <br /> And John Esposito's original scripture prostitution angle just a little twist. If you're looking at only half the story, you're looking at the end of the end ... (I think you're living with more creatures and gazons, and there are.) <Br. It's not a bad attempt, but very good either. At least Rob Schmidt makes a slight improvement in Flair's performance here and there in particular direction, especially in a scene where the cell phone picture messages into a really horrendous experience! Like most MOH episodes, this follows a clapping and downward trend with a dominant theme this season, so it is not necessary to worry.
