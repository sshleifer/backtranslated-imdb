"They laughed all" is one of those short films that I always recommend friends seeking something simple. It has previously been crafted into scrubsball romantic traditions, but is contemporary. The initial 80s of the decisive atmosphere did not go too far. Bogdonovic puts the entire company on its feet, which in fact collapsed to the ground. But, this sort of sweet little image depends on the actors to keep it going, and the "TAL" is blessed with a dream cast meaning of the story's story. It is a picture that will not linger too long in memory if it's not the small moments provided by the amazing cast: Collie Camp simultaneously shouting orders at John Ritter and her dog; Bliine Novak breaks all the hair under her hat; And especially the moment Dorothy Stratten comes to John Ritter and "How ... strange." It's a piece of mayhem that does not want to lay it too much for fear of crushing it, but it certainly does not leave with a light heart and a smile on a face.
