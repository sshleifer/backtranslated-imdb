Looking at some of the negative posts, you really have to wonder what some people are doing for entertainment .... <br /> <br /> I am very lucky enough to watch the movie all too briefly during the theater run. The audience laughed its heads. <br /> It's unexpected turns of true patos, it's also sweet side. Lately, the great Royal Dano alone, his fortune-on farmer Wrenchmuller is particularly effective. Ariana Richards and J.J. Anderson is the greatest child. <br /> <br /> The martine suit actors do a great job, even though you're limited to <br /> <br /> Another thing to see is the background details. The film is satisfied with other SF and fantasy films, livestock and references. Take a look at the Martini outfit the next time. One of them wore a Marty McFly garment, another Ghostbuster, the third in the house Attraids uniform at home and the fourth one lost on the Starfighter flight route.
