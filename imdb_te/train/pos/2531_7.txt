A good horror film featuring the greatness of Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. Dr. Janos Ruck (Karlofe) is a trip to Africa trying to find an ancient asteroid. After finding it, Rukki is poisoned with its radiation. He will die and make him a murderer on Ruk's dark side. Dr. Felix Bennett (Lugosi) finds a limited solution to this problem, while he finds that radiation can be used to cure diseases by humanity. Two fiends will battle over radiation possibilities. Pretty good special effects. Others in the cast: Frances Drake, Frank Lawton, Bellura Bondi and Frank Recher.
