It's a long year and I'm down to review the last movie of 2004. Panaghoy SA Suba (Call of the River) is the second place in the recent Metro Manila Film Festival. MMFF did not do well at the box office due to the fact that many families were so fun to be a joint painter for a long time to watch movies. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to watch an image that is not in the Filipino or English language screen. I thought I did a good job at Cesar Montano. His great vision and creativity really helped the film. He was also a great actor and was able to express wider emotions for the film. Rebecca Latisio, a young actress who plays well. She portrayed Dewey's younger sister Bake. I think she can be seen in many other future films. <br /> <br /> I think the fact that she is in the local dialect of the film is really helpful to her. <br /> <br /> Some of the camera shots in the film are very well made. <br /> <br /> In the story, I feel that the writers will bow in a lesser role. Image. I'm not sure about the story of this film.
