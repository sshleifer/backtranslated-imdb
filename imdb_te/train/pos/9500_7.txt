I saw this film on television and I was attracted by the beauty of Jennifer McComb. It is neat image and you can watch Mccomb for the beauty of African and of course. At that time I was surprised by the film and tried to get the VCD for this film but I could not find it. Large African lions create their own images and correct the size of the animals and their merits. All the audience can see this film, especially kids enjoy the movie. But there are some scenes with the parental guidance of Makkamb troops for the film. It is an enjoyable holiday image for one and all.
