Corny! I loved it! Corn - 40 years ago as a TV show! Adam and Burt do not seem to have left the chemistry on the same screen! They show some backstage ideas that come back to old memories and are interesting to know the actors who have been acting since the 1960s. The 1960s TV TV has corny escapism for most of us, and this DVD is no exception if you're familiar with the original TV show. The fight scene with Boofs and Bams written or whatever is amazing !! The movie theater scene shows the villains clips away. Eventually, Frank Gorshin makes a look. He has long since gone on the DVD, and I believe so great, he played a villain role for Adam and Burt, as he did many years ago to Batman & Robin. He never lost his touch! Thanks to Julie Newark, who lives in a villain role. In conclusion I think that this DVD is for great memories, and I want to thank both Adam and Burt for recreating these memories for those of us who remember and recall the original !!! Thanks friends!
