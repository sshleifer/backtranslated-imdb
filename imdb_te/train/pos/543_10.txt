This film is not the best horror film, bar-nothing. I dump women into Stanley Lake. I have loved Judd Nelson's work for many years, and he was away from me. The mixture and play of horror, and the romance, not the most comedy. His nasty, yet lovely look to me right then there. That look in her eyes, I will never forget it. There is something about him, I can not describe it.
