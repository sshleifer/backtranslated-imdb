One thing I have ever lauded about Robert Ludlow thrillers is that when you find it, it goes in a completely different way. <br /> <br /> One thing I really like about director John Dull (Can Me Again, Rounders, and unforgettable) is that he has a lot of twists and turns in the film. <br /> Now, include Nick Cage, Dennis Hopper, Laura Flynn Boyle and JT. Walsh and you have a story that keeps their interest, and they make all the characters fit correctly. Dahl seems to bring out the best in folks, and this will keep you interested, and guessing, until the very end.
