Irving Thalberg has never tried to make this film. <br /> <br /> You are making a Chinese story with others like Paki Muni, Luis Rainier, Charlie Grapevine and Walter Connolly. <br /> <br /> The story is written by Western writer Pearl Buck, who won the Pulitzer Prize for her novel in 1932. Ms. Buck, daughter of Chinese missionaries, brought China closer to America's consciousness than the other person. Not China's political struggles, but everyday human lives and effort in The Good Earth. Unfortunately later, Pearl Buck became an apologetician for China's Cheung Kai-shek's Kumintang in all virtues and transgressions. The rest of the literary production is never matched with The Good Earth. <br /> <br /> The Sundores is a great explanation when compared with China by Peter Ustinow to Australia. When asked about differences, Ustinov said China was too big and was quite full and Australia was too big and too empty. <br /> <br /> In Good Earth, China is too big and when most people read it, she deals with them at many times. <br /> <br /> The Good Earth Wang Lang Story (Paul Muni) is a young man who can buy a wife from a large house with a slave. Woman O-Lan (Louise Reiner) has two sons, who see him all through good times, famine, drought, drought, revolution and a weather-swim plague. <br /> <br /> Lewis Rainier is the second of two consecutive Oscar nominees. Her record may have some kind of record, in which the dialogue's lowest level player has an Oscar appearance. She is experimented with experimental interviews, her performance may be in silent film with very little subtitles. <br /> <br /> I have only fewer words of John Mills in Ryan's daughter and he is playing a mentally retarded person. <br /> <br /> Muni is not always good at helping her in that male dominated culture. Rainier helps in the field, raises the bears and children, does the housework. When Muni becomes an asset for a man, he takes the second Chinese trophy wife, who is very distressed to him. Still Rainier has everything. Muni is not a bad guy and it is a tribute to his film and his acting and buck writing you do not hate him and the culture gap bridge. <br /> We have a group of oriental players who are more than kung fu movies. I was amazed that Good Earth of all the films was not rebuilt at this time. <br /> <br /> Until then we will allow the Chinese government to appreciate and enjoy this great classic.
