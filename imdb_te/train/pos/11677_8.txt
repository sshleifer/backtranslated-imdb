I love the Long Way Round and do not know Dakar as long as I see in the rims of my local supermarket. I bought it and after a while I decided it would be nice to be the first episode. Like other members of the crew, Charlie Bowman is the greatest. It's great to see him again with Evan. It's a fair bit of catchphrase but I do not bother myself. The package does not mention its mention. BBFC has more to do with a crazy exempt from the classification certificate. They only gave only 15 languages ​​per language. <br /> <br /> Many of the recommended series, I want more!
