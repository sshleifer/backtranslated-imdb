Blonde and Blender are in almost every scene Pamela Anderson and Denis Richards and you are completely unreasonable if you want more from one image. It feels like a last era, when the series is no longer fiery trails, but still more fun than it is, think behind or think England and you're not too far off the mark. Pamela and Denis are bubbles, fascinating and clearly knowing this is not a masterpiece they're making, although you give me a lot of things that you gave me. The supportive cast is powerful, although some of them are not good; I've forgotten to change the difference in a couple of Duff's couple already in a couple, so I can not see it smile. I really think Blond and Blender ace and I hope you hate me for that.
