It is an honest attempt to make a lovely sweet love story. A clear inspiration behind the successful TV series "Bevicad", this lovely sweet rom-com is a timeless treasure. Comparisons are clear. Jimmy Stewart is a fuzzy but upright "straight." Kim's novel binds him through a passionate love that loves a lovely charming witch. But if that spell breaks down by a strong witch, she is deeply depressed with the tasks running her shop, and she is eager to have her beloved pivovalka (known to her cat) by her beloved. You recognize the aunt and "Murder by Death." The film is pleasant and enjoyable, it has some amazing intelligence and has a nice witch feel. Worth a look.
