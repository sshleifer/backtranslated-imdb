This is a fantasy picture of children based on the Boogie Creek Legend. But I do not know why they called it. The bogey comes back to the creek as it is a sequel. The film is not associated with the documentary and its fantasy kiddie fare. Dan Wells is the mother of three children trapped around the bogey creek, and the two men and monster will come to their aid. Yes it is very silly and the plot is tough but this type of image is targeted at 8-12 y / o group. It does not have to worry about the harmless G-rated Kiddie Fare and leaving your kids alone when they're looking at you. For precisely 8-12 y / o set, older children are bored and think it lame.
