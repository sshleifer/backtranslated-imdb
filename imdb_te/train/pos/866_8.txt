Keep yourself in the shoes of Carla. She does not appear to be an unseen but good governing. You know her: she has three of the three superiors trained, knows where the dead bodies are buried and you can look back at the mirror even when you brush your teeth. Always better than most of the time and intense disability for the thankless work, she becomes the repository of coffee ownership owned by coffee. What? Do not you like to hear it? Well, she and you can not do until she can help your hearing. <br /> <br /> Carla (Emmanuel Deos) needs a change in his life. The work is nowhere prominent; Friends rely on her to meet their domestic needs, and almost no one can see the same way. She does not take leave - a deal is complicated - so is to take a single alternative assistant. Carla presented her real needs requirements: a 'well-groomed' person. This will give us an application to remind us to be careful with our request. <br /> <br /> Paul (Vincent Cassell) is doing everything wrong from the start of his job interview and hires his employer, clearly demonstrating Carla's interest in his job traits. She looks at the likelihood of this former thief and, as the story unfolds, increases in an unusual pattern of co-dependence on their relationship. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to come back to the world outside of the civilian prison walls and find himself in another kind of prison: the type of office and the other contractor to pay the old loan. His skills to help a thief have won a political battle in the office of the car. But as Paul reads his lip, Karla is looking for a witty world of skill. <br /> <br /> This is not a ruthless filmmaker, it's perfect for older teens. Carla grows more powerful, professional and personal, the story progresses and her disability provides her clear advantages over her remaining. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are intended for each other in a strange way. Without Paul, Carla is in his dormant role. Our sympathy, hopes and wishes even when she does not make the best decisions along the way. <br /> You can hear the world by your hearing, narrow sounds, and cars' ears when you can not see who you talk. When disabling with a mainstream, we look to replace Carla's excessive natural energy. And all of us can use that meaning to hear what people say, and they really understand.
