I saw this movie with my friend and we could not stop laughing! I'm not scary about this movie! It's all the lines that Freddie said! I think they also made a new nightmare and shoudln't just went to Freddie Vs. Jason. Although some parts are bulky (head shakes). And no Elm Street snaps 1- 5 from the film. This number is not even good. If you want a good horror, I will not recreate this movie. But if you have nothing else to rent, then you'll have to laugh alot. I want to see Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I think it's scary. Freddie's Dead The Final Nightmare Total Grade: B-
