This film will be done in a small Swedish town known to everyone for everyone. Here Mia visits her parents for her father's birthday, which occasionally is always with a tragedy, the question is only this year and you will be amazed ... this is a well-composed movie, with a perfect balance of humor and intensity that is rarely seen. You'll be happy, you'll be hurt, and basically everything in the middle. Finally, you can not help me fall in love with Mia (if you guess the main actress) as her other actors / actresses. <br /> Enjoy
