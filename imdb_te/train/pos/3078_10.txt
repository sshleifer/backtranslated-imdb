This presentation is ... smart acting, smart dialogue, great story with great people ... get it back or make it online ... we really miss this .. Hope Davis really shines in this program. I like the idea of ​​Six Drags ... It really makes sense in this mad world. Give you this stupid reality show second chance, please do not get it back but please do not bed! When it went into the air, I looked online and liked what I would see with minimal disruptions, in fact, when you enjoy online ABC programs, if you miss them at major times .... You want to get it back anytime, I'm ready.
