Morgan Freeman and Pazzagai are the unmatched pair of cars and do one or the other. Morgan Freeman is associated with everything, a human being, and the pacifier "10 items or less" behind the scenes that threatens customer intimidation and frustration from customers. They explore, find and learn each other together. To do that, they are certainly interested in change and have a sense of humor, all of which have both. I thought this film was realistic, I wanted this type of story to be more frequent, we did not need to go to the movies, and I realized that we could connect each other even if we really came from different backgrounds. The message of the film is in the open heart, and we will wonder about the possibility of another world we meet each other from there - a world where peace is possible.
