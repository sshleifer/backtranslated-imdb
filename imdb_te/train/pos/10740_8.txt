The French Brothers Jules and Gideon Knudet and Robert De Niro and Fireman James Hollon outlining this is a compelling and heartfelt story of how New York's finest dark day shines. At the age of 12, I was the first to see this thing, and I was still in that age. Knowing how far it really knows how to increase the overall effect of 9/11. Who are the leaders, who composed everyday lives, and found out how many people were just killing their lives in the way they were driving and their minds. These brave men put their lives in line and my appreciation for those looking at this will increase. If you can see, I have personally seen the best documentary.
