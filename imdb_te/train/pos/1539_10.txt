I saw it at the Mill Valley Film Festival. It is directed by Mrs. Blom, which is beautifully displayed and displayed. The big cast of characters comes out of the novel, Anne Tyler, which is layered with the back story and potential futures, missing notes, surprising self-motivated anxiety and extreme difficulty. If you see "Best of Youth", you can find out how well the stories are drawn through small movements, and the story moves along the story. I really hope I'll deliver it to America. I lived in a very sensitive film market and rarely get any kind of Swedish movies.
