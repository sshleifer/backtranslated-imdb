It was Eddie Robinson's 101nd film and his last, nine days after the shooting, he died of cancer. <br /> Even though hair and textile styles are quite a bit dated (note the video game shown in the picture), but the subject is pretty much timeless. <br /> <br /> Hayeston wanted to make a film for a while, because he really believed in the dangers of a high population. <br /> <br /> Acting is a top-notch, especially between Heston and Robinson, with good performances by Catherine and Peters. <br /> <br /> Music is absolutely perfect. Beethoven's, Grieg, and Tchaikovsky's puppets have some really moving scenes combined with pastoral visual elements. <br /> <br /> The theme of this film (or "point") is important. Yes, it's an image about the high population, but a more important note is a warning story about what goes wrong with the leadership of the Earth's man. This is where you find the actual message of the image in the subtext. <br /> Tell us what the soul says about "old days" (which is our present) and how does the nose mean how to tell what the soul says? <br /> <br /> This film is my first science fiction films of all time.
