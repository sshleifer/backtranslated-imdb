Okay, so it's not as deep and meaningful as the bigger budget like the Soldier Blade Runner or Terminator 2 but overall I seemed to be very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell created emotion at any time when his humanity was broken even more sharp. I found his depiction of the emotional development limited to movies (and when I came before) I was in Arnie's T films (and I know that Arnie was a cyborg and Kurt Human but the premise proposed by both films) , This short story can be a reasonable US / Brit cast meat. I can not say Gary Bassie and his two assistants are bad or goodies, so I could not decide if I liked them or not. The colony is not a bit realistic, it is not a group of misguided groups that are wiped off from being away from loved ones / gulbo / cowardly pigs or off-roaders and misconduct to each other. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell is a good person and unlike other comments that I do not think would have a negative impact on his career (sequels, such as fraudsters!). Sean Pertvy is truly a family of high-profile cybersecurity and his father's father has been proud of. And the rest of the cast people helped make this tragic band very bad and not too bad. <br /> If you see this on your TV schedule. I do not think you're disappointed.
