In this episode (much like Twilight Zone episodes), many sexist militia "uniform" have long since. And some things are so unbelievable, as the easy availability of clean water. However, take into consideration the time and time it's made, and you will quickly understand why this episode is unique when you're looking. It seems to be missing from a lot of twilight zones, as well as an interesting female role (though she is rarely spoken) in the twilight zone. The Twilight Zone is a great example of just 20 minutes, more than two hours of emotional and drama packs. And it's great to see two people who have become the first American icon in their careers.
