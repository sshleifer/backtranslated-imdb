I was originally in 1962 when I was five or six years old and I realized that this was really enjoyable. After being broadcast on "Disney Walt Disney Presents" on Disney Channel, I have recently had the chance to see again and again for the first time. I will forget a lot, and geared towards some kids, but still enjoyable. I can not wait to show my niece and nephews.
