I collect this image without reading the previous comments directly to the cable. Well, I paid to see it in a theater, and visually I'm glad because it's a fantastic picture. At the beginning of the 60s (except for Schulink's office), and if you leave the Nev Campbell scenes, the whole picture is a washed-in the early 60s. And the use of restaurants in the picture is lovely. For the first time the director, his background, I believe, is in the writing, has a great eye for him. In the first ten minutes I felt I had no plot, so I temporarily suspended my trip and went for a ride. Acting and father-son, mother-son, husband-wife, parent-child relationships, the film is spot-on. William H. Mackie, happiness to see, if this and Magnolia have any reference to the last Tony Perkins, the filling is vacuum. Tracey Ulman as a neglected wife moved me a lot. This is a three-dimensional description of society as two-dimensional. In fact, this can add Donald Sutherland to his unforgettable collection of paintings. Parents' description (Bine / Sutherland) reminds me of Vincent Gollo's Buffalo '66's indirect mode, yet a little too sharp! I definitely pay to see the second picture from this director. He has a self-discipline of the 50s b-criminal director (something P.T.Anderson never had!), Yet there is a way to actors who direct his visual style and attention.
