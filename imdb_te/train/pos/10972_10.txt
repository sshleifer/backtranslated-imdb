I have recently seen it but for many years I have learned about it and have always been worried by its title. It belongs to me as one of my favorite films now. The ridiculous thing Maysles discovered is difficult to explain, but everything works outstanding. It has so many memorable pictures and moments where you feel the occupy of the very private world. I fell in love with the characters in it. Motion picture producers cast audiences' spell and dragged into the weird world of extraordinary family. It has a live atmosphere and I feel I can stay away from my bedside table when I place my corn cooking on my corn. It is the air of the tragedy spreading across. Once the dignity of the family falls from the greatness. Money has gone but their air and happiness as well as their beauty. It drew me from the first frame and after the film finished I found myself surprised at their destiny. If I take a walk along the East Hampton Beach I am still surprised to see the silhouette of Little Eddie Dancing in the back window to hear the voice of the old Edie over and thick hanging. Memorable.
