I wanted this movie because I'm a new franc fan and wanted to see more of her work. First of all, his Irish accent was great. He has a great ear for dialects, it looks like. His acting is simple, excellent. Next to James Franine, I thought the film did well. It's actually * mess * in Northern Ireland. <br /> <br /> The two parties have been the victims of grave injustice, and the controversial men usually have little to say about their circumstances. Along the way, every man (or woman) supposedly struggles for his country, really * doing that *. For example, Kenny (James Franine) asked Gian (Ian Hart) why "it", Ginger could not get a morally acceptable answer. Why? Because Ginger is not for the great cause of protecting the rights of its country or his fellow Protestants ... it's for fun of killing ginger. He is full of blood lust and it's a perfect job for a guy like him. There are guys like Liam (John Lynch) who struggle to live just their daily lives and enjoy their families in the fight like this ... The fight will see all the guys just fighting more. Like Kenny, they are Karisma's full-fledged leaders, and they add fuel to flames, rather than they or not. Likewise, Kenny was honest in "reason". He believes what he's doing is going to make a difference in the future ... It's a bit odd 'His character looks pretty good. But, like most of the other seemingly brilliant men, he also realized and sucked into a gang lifestyle ... 'til too late. Then there is Ginger, no fight for any other reason but a Gangland type war may make him a worthy asset, some of which may be a pure mental for some perfect thrill, some might argue. However, in this film, Ginger has become a valuable and very dangerous loose artillery. <br /> <br /> Everything reaches a boiling point, guessing, ending is a tragedy. The film is worthy of being shown on both sides of this age old controversy. Being American, I can not begin to fully understand what all the fighting is about. <br /> <br /> All of us are acting, touching ... but unsettling.
