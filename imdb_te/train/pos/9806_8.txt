I agree to be on Capital City DVD. I saw this show only in 1994 and I fell in love with Rolf Sawson as Hudson Talbot. It's good to see Americans working abroad in the financial industry for change. I love Rolf in this role and he loves each character. This program has only 13 episodes. I liked William Armstrong as Hudson's glamorous friend in the series. It was delayed at night or at night when they were airing at the show in New York City. This program is less than an hour. I thought this show was no longer gone but the casting changes in the second season really made a little less interesting appearance. I did not care for Sylvia but lost the actress Julia Phillips-Lane in the previous season. I've taken the opportunity to this show and have often worked on it. It showed Americans who lived and selected in London. American characters are not proud or attempted to overcome their British counterparts. I also liked the fact that they all tried to make international appearances on the cast, rather than make them British. I liked watching Julia Ormond in the opening role. I thought this performance lasted longer. Sometimes I felt that the exhibition period lasted for less than an hour. They transferred to New York City and won the United States.
