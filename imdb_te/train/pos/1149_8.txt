The original "reality TV", fast speed and funny sarcasm about soap opera. The script written by playwright Robert Harling is filled with a linear and ludicrous scenario. The best of them is the climax, which can quickly lead to bad transmission and brain conversion. Kevin Klein is happy to murder his lines as he does not wear his glasses. "Her brain is then explored in the next few homes." Clever cast Klein is on the same page. Sally Field, Elizabeth Shoe, Katie Moriarty, Robert Downey Jr., Wooply Goldberg, Terry Hatcher, Gary Marshall and Kathy Nazimi. It's a treat to see cast cast like it in this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a classic that has fallen somewhat by cracks. <br /> <br /> Score bonus by Alan Silvestri. It fits soap opera with its gorgeous and dramatic airplay.
