An intense, expanding, rather dark story is somewhat reminiscent of John Ford's "The Searchers" - not a cruel film - for its time. The story starts quickly and there are several scenes of Stewart's Jeff Webster, a good dialogue between Ronda Castle and Sheriff Gannon. The film "Bend of the River" (1952) reminds me of a Man-Stewart work, but I'm a little sentimental and more interesting. There are some conditions: closing too soon (and sentiment instead); 24-year-old Corrine Calvert is not a very convincing French young man, and of course the film takes place in the legendary West, a land where the story and the story of the true laws of physics does not apply. But they are smaller. James Stewart is as surprised as a dark, retarded man, who is not cared for, and can not beat the mountain scene. Good western dress drama.
