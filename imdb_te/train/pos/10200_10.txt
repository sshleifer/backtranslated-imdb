The animation is all about what I heard. It's not equal to what everyone is expecting, but look like this. Would you expect perfection in hell? It is my belief that the animation is intentionally made of powder and sand. It's great to see the transformation of his character in the film, we'll get it anytime, it's close to live action. I hope for a sequel shortly. If we want to live action, we feel better with Chastity or Purgatori. I do not think Lady Death is going to transfer the film well. But about this film, my own personal belief that all weave about this film is dead is wrong. Number pun intended.
