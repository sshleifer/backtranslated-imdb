When I came to my N64 when I was five or six years old I was in love and my first game was Super Mario 64. And I liked it! <br /> <br /> I did not fully remember the plot, but Princess Peach Bowser was kidnapped, and Mario wanted to save her. The game is to get 120 stars from the curses in the castle. There are five or six challenges to get each star. There are server parts of the castle, where you can get more stars. However, you beat Bowser. * I have Bowser with three characters. Characters are starting with letters.Mario is the main character, and gets helpful advice from toad, so he is one of your only tobacco. I'm in the game of Luigi and Yoshi at the end. There are a few other characters, such as the main villain Bowser, and Bu and Goomba. The characters are so great. <br /> <br /> Graphics? The gameplay graphics are very important, and I totally agree. But he has great graphics, with great plot. Especially for time. I compare a whole bunch of other Nintendo games like 007 and their graphics with Super Mario.Bright colors, great effects and awesome sound effects. I found that the graphics were very good in water courses. Bowser is located next to the world, which is the best graphics in the game. <br /> <br /> Now, music is my favorite part of the game. When I play this role in a young age, I will make me sleep, so the music will fall asleep at night. Jolly Roger Bay which is peaceful and amazing. Especially, too, in once again, the worlds with Bowser, stick with me too and are my favorites. There are others There is a time when my favorite pastime, and I love this game. Go play this game 10/10 or ***** (5) / ***** (5) game!
