This is an amazing picture. The non-stop potter takes a number of observations to fully appreciate. The musical structures of Busby Berkeley are never duplicated. I will make this film easy for all of my other efforts. Jon Blondell and James Cognini are wonderful. Some of the humor will be almost push the boundaries of today's movies. Put a rational explanation on how they did it and this is fun.
