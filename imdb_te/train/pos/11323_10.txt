Fate / Stay Night is an animated series inspired by h-game. Some producers turn around to make this successful series without h-stuff any more. It is not as if the development of the characters is as good as the sequence in this sequence and that any change of it can destroy the perfection. (You'll understand when you see all episodes). Despite the relatively slow start (the producer took his time to perform the characters) things quickly and for the first time after the mid-series. The sequence of the series focuses on the battle of the Holy Grail in Fukui City over the last 50 years. The pilot will actually begin with the end of the previous war and develops from there. The fire that began in the final battle was just overwhelmed by the head of the city. He struggled with the two servicemen, who prompted his revenge (Holy Mark) to call the most powerful servicemen in the battlefield, Saber. His first contact with Sabre was "surprised by such a great beauty ... I lost words". <br /> <br /> You do not have to compare with anyone to understand the platform very well. The FSN offers more than just some cool sword fights, better animation, excellent lights, great soundtrack, which offers excellent character and relationship development. It provides changes in the events of the protagonists of the characters. This action reveals the reliable dynamic emotional and behavioral processes of individuals (not as the other type of linear usage), which are constantly evolving from the faulty characters, under the mask of perfection, to clearly discern their personalities. The saber character is linked to a medieval myth that has been changed to this series and must accept such. FSN should not think that you have not presented the viewer with historical facts, it is not adventure / fantasy series and documentary and you will enjoy the time as time goes on. If the end was sudden and unexpected and twice had several parts I would have watched them with the same breath.
