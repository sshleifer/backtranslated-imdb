It was the most daring and important in the "early-post" films produced in Hollywood in the 1930s. Unlike some of the pre-Co-Bond films that have never been allowed since 1934-5, the film has been thoroughly overwhelmingly full of fun-filled themes from the full range. The traditional morality of the late 30s and 40s is certainly not clear in the film, because the film is about no woman with whom she met a sleeping woman and no apology along the way. This "widespread" has enjoyed sex and can help all of her wealthy - you can never see in movies only after two or three years. Barbara Stanwick is working on her father's lead role. Besides her boss, she also encourages her to sleep with Pim and her local government official, allowing him to work illegally with the penalty. <br /> <br /> Daddy looks like his daughter's body is "renting" for a long time. <br /> Almost, the victim was his skull, Barbara enough and the big city heads. <br /> <br /> She is not harmed by killing and killing her father, but she thinks she is a prostitute and there is nothing to show for her. <br /> <br /> Depression, Barbara uses sex to get a job at a huge mega bank. She is working as a clerk worker, but as in a few weeks, she sleeps from one job to another - until she sleeps on the bank's head and her future son-in-law! All of this ends with tragedy, but the bags are not very well on these two men's deaths. In fact, shortly thereafter, she can educate herself in the life of the CEO and once again on top of her (probably more than one). <br /> So far, it's so wonderful and sad because it's wonderful picture. Barbara is a 100% solidarity - no morality and no conscientious woman - the desire to distance her life from her if she does not hurt her in this process. However, the brave writers and the producer were "getting out" and were caught in the end of the ransom. This woman felt very nasty and tear, and eventually the change of heart was a major disappointment and dramatically in the film. In many ways, it reminds me of the end of JEZEBEL - once again, the evil man has "seen the light" and changed the changes at a very simple conclusion. <br /> <br /> Please try my advice RED-HEADED WOMAN and DOWNSTAIRS. RED-HEADED WOMAN is like a very baby phase but at the end there is no magic transformation - the main lady is really a skunk down deep! In DOWNSTAIRS, a movie like the red headed Woman, characters have been knocked down and a guy (John Gilbert) plays the same role of Kannier. <br /> <br /> The film is an ultra-vulnerable Hollywood film with a short period of time, which is well worth the filmfills in the film. Also, note the Duke fans - John Wayne plays a very small role in the film and it is very unusual to watch a very young Wayne playing a very unusual role.
