If you want Star Wars / Trek, they'll see where they got their ideas and cinemas. It is my first 2 favorite films of all time, other-worldly future and psycho-thriller. The intensity of the source material (Shakespeare's "Tempest") was not covered by Wizbank Jimmykri (after La Lucas). As it was manufactured in 1956, do not assume that you can catch a flying saucer and watch the strings. This is not the first film you can not. Surprisingly, at the "A-Cinema" level, the economy and taste of that time were heavily stocked. And director Wilcox's previous 'hit' "lacy cum home". As long as I saw him, 'Fred Wilcox' became a nickname for a director, he was already known or later, but should not have been associated with science fiction at the time, which was definitely a "B" style. It's a wonder product or a very "fault" for those who run Hollywood Bankruptcy. <br /> <br /> There are large scale mets with direct action with almost microscope used by Lucas. Widely. The general mechanisms overtook the 'user interface'; "Computers", they are portrayed as a few futurists in later works. Star Trek's 'Transporter', visually, was not changed by Rodden Berry nearly 10 years later. And if the Trek / Wars TechnoBubble you're off, the FP's scientific references are not extinct and are all perfect, even today. The "Ship" set is perfect, alcohol is realistic, as good as you can see, the 'trek' for TV or film is more convincing than anything. <br /> <br /> Have you ever wondered how much of the movies and how to see the FP explain everything? This is not exactly 'Wagged to the Stars'.
