I highly recommend this film. 2054 Paris's Bladerunner-esquire is set in the future, it is a classic movie Nair script too: the woman in danger, the sister trying to find her, honest police fighting everyone. Fortunately, it eliminates stereotypes and combines a pretty good storyline with interesting and innovative visuals. Sin City's in the image look may remind you, but it is very solid, more graphic novel look I found really compelling. Every frame, every sequence seems like a skilled graphic designer may have pulled it off from the desk. In story and artistic terms, you have movies such as nineteen forty (or the classic views of Eiffel Tower and Soccer Coe) and Casablanca, as well as our statues governments. You do not need to watch this movie.
