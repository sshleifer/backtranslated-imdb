<br /> <p> I started to look at the film, I started watching another movie, but the first twenty minutes later, the artistic and the main character was not troubled, I really liked the movie, it's dark, pretty, and really touching. It's a bit slow but immersion done. The directive is excellent by letting us know the bits of the story that led to the belief behind Joey and his life bars. The music is greatly and well made in the scenes. The end is unexpected with a twist I did not see. This is not a movie we often see.
