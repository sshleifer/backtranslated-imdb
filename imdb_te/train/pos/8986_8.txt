Anton Newcomb makes this movie and he is the main thing. Looking at him if he did not show the whole album quickly showing a real talent. He thinks he is God, but it is very sensitive and interesting. DW does not really matter whether it is music or comparable. "Hey, do you have a driver's license?" , Tells Anton Cameraman, "Well this guitar goes to the pants!" Great use of archive / home video subject. Great to see rock docs still being made. A cool doc about the creative process. Watch Nirvana live if you like it! Tonight! Sold! On DVD. Anton is a good experience. 10 to 8
