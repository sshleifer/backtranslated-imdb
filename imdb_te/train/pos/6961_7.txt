The title caught my eye and wondered what I would come on in the plot like I saw so many "super people" movies this year ... And in fact, I really liked it, funny scenes I did not expect. Uma Thurman performed an average in the G-Girl role. Surprisingly, I was able to see his toes again in the wide screen (as in the beginning of Kill Bill). But while Luke Wilson was playing a bigger lady, the idiot was playing very well everyday, and I did not really get his condition. If you want a light touch of fun, you should definitely look at the adventures of G-Girl and Average Mat, to cheer up your partner. In my collection 7/10.
