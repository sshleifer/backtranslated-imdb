I saw this movie @ TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival). Hall Heart's fans will not be disappointed !! And if you are not familiar with the director ... no matter. This image can certainly stand on its own. I have to go for a second screening ... it's wonderful to have to watch again - and faster !! <br /> <br /> This film is very fun. The conversation was very smart, and the performance of Parker Posey, who played the Fay Grimm title role, was exceptional. Fay Grimm is the latest feature to revise the world and the characters introduced in Henry Phool (2000). Visually, the most important stylistic attribute uses the habit of the concert (or Dutch) perspective, which appears in several films appearing in the last Heart, available in the films: Hal Hartley's short works by the 1994-2004 collection, and The Girl From Monday (2005) in. <br /> <br /> On September 11th, I saw this film very apt. Fay Grim's adventure in this story has been changed against the mutated world since September 11, 2001. Never before going to main spoilers, this work and the story-world are rarely astrological politics, if ever, in mainstream film post-911 (cf.

Fay Grimm's character is Henry Fool At the end, wherever she is, Fay Grimm's role begins, but by the end of the film ... the knowledge and experience of Fay has changed and expanded throughout the story.What's for Fay's future and the Fool's family? I can not wait for the third part of this story!
