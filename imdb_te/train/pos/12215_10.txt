Finally, I liked this movie from the opening sequence on the right. <br /> <br /> I have found it very exciting and refreshing about the film - and so challenging - gender and class stereotypes. The idiosyncrasies strengths of the characters, and the lack of judgment were filmed - and the letters themselves and the consent of one - allowing me to embrace them and draw me to their world. Without teaching, and intellectual and sensual and loving humor, the film has the potential to open new opportunities and gives the world a world that sees and accepts people as separate and valuable individuals. I look forward to more offerings from this creative and talented director.
