It's one of the best ensemble comedy / musical "B" films I've ever seen (and now in my 40 years and I'm not an expert on it now, but I've seen all the well-known movies out there). When tons of actors get their leads for a minute, comedy interferes with humorous music bits, and most frequently the musical pieces interrupt comic flow. Call me crazy of mood but when I see TCM in Europe, I'm laughing with loud joy! So who made me laugh? Without a doubt Mischa Auer delivered me some amazing gut busting laughs, he also steals the end, it's great! L & H selling point (and I love these ones in their first hall roach, but I think this movie works because they are hooked to see them (hull roach), they are the minimum and ADULT fare on the fare (the standards of 1930, If read from the standards). Jack Halley is also great to see, I know he is from W OZ And I laugh at him at his waiter bit at the show.Patse Kelly is the "Ugly" Femme (I actually say it's a blink of real life) in 30 films, and musical numbers are a real artistic product (Basby Berkeley 'Aish) have quality, I can not fly from the ones I used in this genre Nga am. I went and nadavagalugutunnanu, but this film is very irritating. 8, 10 and I saw in Europe TCM and TCM USA again with my wife to see the record. Good stuff!
