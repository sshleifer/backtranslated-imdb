I am so glad that "revolution can not be broadcast". <br /> <br /> Twenty percent of wealthy citizens in Venezuela are worse. Eighty per cent of the decades have been making decisions for the poor, not centuries. However, their rebellion failed; The temporary government Supreme Court, and the Constitution, and Ombudsman, and the Election Board, and all civil rights abolished, no one ever took conspirators behind a barn and shot them down. They did not even go to jail. Major evils live in Florida. And the protection they have is the "Bolivarian Constitution" passed in the vast majority of Venezuela's people. It's not just Bites History. Democracy will give you a hell of hell if you lose it. And in Venezuela it is loose.
