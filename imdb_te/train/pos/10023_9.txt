After seeing many of Villaronga's movies, I have a clear clear opinion about him - he forgets too much in the personal dimension of the characters, forgetting about the rhythm of the film. That's why, despite his good critics, his films did not attract a wider audience. In the ARO he follows the same line, but really at the end of the film, the rhythm really developed. Frankly speaking, I slept through the first episode, the first part gives me the information I need, but the reason is really slow. Although the second episode is absolutely fantastic and the overall film is the best film made by Villaronga. <br /> Recommended.
