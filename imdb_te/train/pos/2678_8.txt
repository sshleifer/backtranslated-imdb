Hey now, I can not say that Jesse (Jesus) has seen all of Franco's pictures, and many of them are perfect, but this is a very good (and instrument) I have ever seen. I can tell you most sixty years late at the start of the seventies and the early seventies and most of my main returns is a bit too strange to me, and it takes a lot for me to declare. Anyway, it looks like a big bad dream, where some parts appear to be real in different places. This woman is performing for a praised audience (?!) And her dreams of having a "act of fake" violence in performances in some theater in Berlin, one actress or something. Catch what is true and not in this film is clearly the sharp vision of the real thing and the dream stuff is not. She seems to be in the state of DJ's Wu. I make this feeling a whole lot but it's not pretty wild and unnatural and entertaining. The shots of Berlin appear to be a lonely and creepy place, which adds atmosphere. The end is quite abrupt though, the picture just ends and the tape went black, I guess you do not need to let it over at that point. My copy is from an anchor bay euro trash collection, and I give more euro-trash, I say, that does not get enough of that trash. But good crap.
