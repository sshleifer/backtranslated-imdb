This is a ive British British comedy film and one that I could see again and over without tiring. Peter Ustinov never demonstrated in a bad role and this is no exception, especially with his dry wit but very clever master plan. Karl Malden was always my favorite since he starred in 'San Francisco Streets'. Although I'm Maggie Smith, the true actor of this film, even if everything she's trying to do is blurry, she actually puts her money everyday and found herself in her clothes. One thing that makes me worry, can someone tell me that someone can not buy this in a DVD or VHS format in the UK?
