* The Brokendawn Palace at Midnight Express and 'Return to Paradise' still struck a chord with me. <br /> <br /> Here is the story of two young girls. Travel through Thailand, and get arrested on charges of smuggling drugs. Not Clare Dances Alice? Is not Kate Beckinsale's Darlene? Beautiful stranger they met on their journey? This is not really important because it is the story of friendship and trust and they are enhanced limits. <br /> <br /> "For any reason or sensational one - it's not a real idea, it's" sand with realism "or It's not just sensational violence that speaks of "tough reality" but it's just a good story with some fine performances.Bil Pullman is weak with gravity of his laziness and talking - I'm very upset with that role. <br /> <br /> Kate Beckinsale, <br /> <br /> Jacqueline Kim is good, taking the preferred and defined characters and does not really work there. </ P> <p> But the mistake - this is a picture of Clare Danes As long as she's a fan of her work, and it's no change, she attracts every scene that she finds, and it's not for her, the film will probably bend into boring fare <br /> <br /> In this movie she has an excellent soundtrack. <br /> <br />
