This is one of the best movies about the truth I really love. <br /> This is not technically another film since it's the same two people and the same love. <br /> <br /> It is "love" in the real world. Well, most people are guided by the movie and are wise and eloquent. I know that most of the others are mad on reading other reviews, which are dialogue-based movies. And "before sunrise" is very good. The dialog is perfect. It's real, so appealing and funny. Jessie and Celine fall in love with the surprise, 'You fell in love with them at the same time. <br /> <br /> When one of my favorite scenes is in the coffee shop, they tell the best friend of their best friends, the other actress to pretend the phone. It's perfect. <br /> <br /> When you fall in love for the first time in your life you will be taken very long time. <br /> If you choose "Before Sunset" "If you look like me, you first saw" sunset ", it would be hard to cut the feeling of pity and mourning for two younger lovers in the entire show. Once again, the most romantic movie of my books is amazing acting, wonderful script, and beautiful places.
