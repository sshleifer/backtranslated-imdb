I remember having a pretty little respect for a venture like this when I first released it. James "Nott Jim" Balushi, a heroine kid actress, and a cheesy title in John Hughes Formula. It did not pay me to see 15 years ago. But when I wasted on Sunday afternoon, I started looking at it, and it hit me at a couple of levels. The Fairy Tale (Part Pretty Woman, Part Rivers Pretty Woman), very fragile, Elizabeth Perkins_Engeral_On_42 En_Street-acting actress Kelly Lynch, Espazism. Over all, it gently pulls some good strings. It's pretty hard not to fall into the story, to develop a passion for Kelly Lynch, to identify James Belushi, liking stiff bad guy lover, and laugh at the Curly Sue lines. All the ups and downs, and the message you want to hear. Wasting your time in this movie, it's worth it.
