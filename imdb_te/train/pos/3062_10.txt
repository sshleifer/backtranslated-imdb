A few months ago in the cable I saw this movie, it was wonderful. William H MacI is one of my favorite actors, and his appearance is just amazing. While he's clearly doing the wrong thing, you will take care of his role, and Neve Campbell has seen an actress this year and I will give a performance that is with a doubt the best performance. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland is like a maddy's father, and it is very nice to get caught in the middle of everything that happens to John Ritter. <br /> <br /> I think it's in the theater, because I think it's a viewable movie by a wider audience. It's a shame, because it's good to come to the theater with a lot of new Hollywood movies. <br /> <br />
