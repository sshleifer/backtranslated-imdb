It may be a bit misleading to open a review explaining a picture in terms of other images, but I think this is the best way to give an approximation of the location occupied by the election gangster style. Opus Yakuza of The Godfather and The Yakuza Papers kinji phukasaku (Without Honor and Humanity batsman AK) is somewhere in between, it's imaginative and realistic at the same time, it comes down to dark and gritty. <br /> <br /> The Hong Kong filmmaker has a unique touch of it. <br /> Every two years HK Treat makes a new boss. At this time only one of the candidates is not happy, and he decides to bring the rest of the triads and police concerns into his own hands. It's a brief story but the rest assured that it will go for more than that. Just like in The Yakuza Papers, it's a very handy, back-stabbed and inconsistent (and sometimes it's all the phone call - one of the most memorable scenes I've seen in recent times) is essential for a deep drama but makes for interesting plot and good character controversy. Fans of gangster artists are more likely to appreciate that. Elections are not acting as expected; Although it is violent. And I'm not talking about the glossy, glamor version of Hollywood violence. It's dark and terrible. <br /> <br /> If we love it or not, all violence is an integral part of us. <br /> If you're familiar with style, you should know what to expect. Pacing is relatively slow and deliberate. Cinematography is very similar to soft colors (wheat, dark green and orange), soft and dark, and soft tracking shots have a stronger quality. In the end, the elections have occupied a strange place. It is not exactly a role to study and it is not an action-based gangster movie. It analyzes a situation (the election and its consequences), but it's in style and realistic and fiction (the Triad celebrations in a special resonance of an Eastern godfather).
