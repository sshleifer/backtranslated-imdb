A woman stayed with a boy in this world and was alone. They are both alone because a boy is a gift and a curse in a package - he is capable of withdrawing the knife from his arm. This "gift" was always injured on his wrist - injury to the deadly weapon inside his body. First, his mother is constantly drinking and kills his father. Then he grows up and decides to find his true father. He is just as good at all times for a superhero - he comes to justice ... But society decides that this justice is not necessarily necessary and dangerous, not just like the Hollywood movies, but to kill someone else - in his opinion, the power to die and the authorities and the run Sasha (the main hero who plays Artem Tkachenko) kills if he accuses. He meets a girl on a runway from the authorities and mafia (who plays Chulpan Hammatua) and falls in love with her. Nobody should be viewed ... not to mention. This film is more interesting about feelings and emotions, but not about actions. This film is full of his full and main focus of his life.
