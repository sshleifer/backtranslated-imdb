Brokedown Palace is truly one of a kind. Thailand is a fairy tale showing two girls' plight for freedom against the judiciary. <br /> <br /> Alice Mornano (Claire Danes) and Darlen Davis (Kate Beckinsale), two friends, were caught in high school. They suddenly change their holiday plans from Hawaii to Thailand, and soon the young man is attracted by Nick Parks. He moves with them, suggesting that three of them go to Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> As soon as the two join the airport, they immediately look for drugs. One will remove rituals, and their life will soon change forever. They are confused about settling in their new life, they know about Honey Green (Bill Pullman), an honorable lawyer. <br /> <br /> An American girl who is familiar with the Thai legal system is free. <br /> When they go back or go, they will soon know when they go back. <br /> If you are looking for a great image for years together - go to the Brooklyn Palace.
