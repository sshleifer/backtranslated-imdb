I found this movie accidentally, but I was happy. Kenneth Branagh's performance came close to stealing from Helena Bonham Carter, but their strong chemistry was designed for a more fun film. The film was taken by Braug Emma Thompson. The star of Carter turned out to be a disabled young man who is trying to finish her, as I have long seen from a female leader. It is difficult to portray a disabled person, but she likes her eyes only to show her pain about her condition in life. If the film comes out of the current wave of movies with beautiful women, Charles (Charlene Theron, Halle Berry), I considered the Oscar strong if they were "disrespectful". If I run across the film last night on the night of the night, trust me, the lost sleep value.
