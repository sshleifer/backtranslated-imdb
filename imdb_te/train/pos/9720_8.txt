'How Friends Are Losing & Eliot People' is a wonderful movie. From the beginning to the end a hilarious image. A lovely entertainment. Irritating. Jumps up! <br /> Demonstrations: Jason is amazing. He has a treat from the beginning to the end to see him. Jeff Bridges is amazing as bass. He is a legend. Megan Fox looks amazingly hot, and offers good performance. But dude, she's a very hot man! Anderson was delighted. She is not old to all, is really hot. Kristen Dunst looks majestic and does a good job. Others are pretty good. <br /> <br /> "How do you make friends? Do not miss this movie!
