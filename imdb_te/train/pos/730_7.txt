I remembered that there are very well sequences in this movie, which I have in Rippa Randall (played by PJ Soulez) in her bed smoker song, and then Ramones singing in her room <br /> <br /> It's a very fun thing . <br /> <br /> It's fun, brisk, quirky and nice. Yes, I'm coming up late and I'm confident that it's very well ... but it's fun because it's fun. It's never sex, pat and rock n roll. <br /> <br /> I think it is a bad trick and this is the band .. I do not know if it's true
