For a long time in my life, I did not like this film or liked this movie but not much. I have recently seen (in sleep over, funnily enough) and since I was 6 or younger than I did more than I did. I'm even more congratulating now with some other Disney classics I've seen recently ("Sleeping Beauty" and "Pinocchio" or you spell it). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> Animation is good, often wherever you see other characters, you know where you are. The animation is also well illustrated with the themes of the background, in which the town (twice shown briefly). (I usually do not like Disney movies in comparison with the original story, but this I do not feel overly bothered and I think I made the necessary changes to make this a good Disney movie is often one of the most intuitive, I pissed some of their movies in Disney's way The idea does not change). <br /> <br /> You already know the story, Cinderella is the girl working for her terrible stepmother and steps. With the help of her fairy godmother, she goes to a ball and loses a glass slipper. <br /> This is a very picture that you see with other people. Immediately the family is not good enough. To enjoy this, I recommend it to you with friends (and instant family, if you like. :-)). <br /> <br /> I recommend this to people who love at least Disney, fairy tales and people who like rats. Have fun! :-)
