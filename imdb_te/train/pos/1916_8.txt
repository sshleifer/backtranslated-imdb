"8 fair rules ... for my teens dachter," in my opinion, an absolute ABC classic! I'm not sure I've seen every episode, but I still enjoy it. It's hard to say that this episode is my favorite. However, I think it's always funny when an innocent happens. I've always laughed that. While James Garner and David Spad were a good man, I loved the show when John Ritter was a prominent figure. If you ask me, his sudden pass is very sad. While everyone has always given a good performance, the product design is excellent, the clothes have been well designed, and the writing is always very strong. In conclusion, I hope some network show brings the air back to the fans.
