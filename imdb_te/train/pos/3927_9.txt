Well, a correction to the tag posted on the main page of this image first. Abe Lincoln did not walk with his sister, but stopped in the grave of his sister. The person who questioned was a close friend of Lincoln in his New Salem days. In fact, some say that Ann is, in fact, Lincoln's girlfriend, but there is no evidence to support them. <br /> Now, there are fictitious and fiction in the film. Hollywood has always taken a dramatic license with anything under the sun, and "Young Mr. Lincoln" is no exception. However, the court case in the film is based on the real incident: the William "Duff" Armstrong allegation of murder, and despite the fiction in the film with many name changes in the name, it is still a riveted screen for the audience. It's the golden age of Hollywood, with the finest drama, Henry Fonda giving the best Lincoln to anyone.
