The first things to do first, the woman's lead was very stupid to miss. Actor Wang Ju Xian is now 42 years old and very well elderly, who plays the role of Xiao Kwian in the film. It's always nice to review these wonderful times when looking at these old school Hong Kong productions. <br /> <br /> The film is one of the most influential topics in the 1980s. The mesmerizing of art set decoration and other aesthetic facets. More fantastically the film is black and funny. <br /> <br /> I had the experience of translating the second script of "A Chinese Ghost Story", and I thought the script was a good piece. . However, when I saw the film, I was disappointed when I first saw a different film from the script, such as small scale and more comic characters. <br /> If you see the Lord of the Rings, you will notice the similarity to LOTR in the film. Climax is a mirror with Miranda Otto with a ringwitch. It's definitely a laugh-out-loud. Bravo!
