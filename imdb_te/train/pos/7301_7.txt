I finally saw "Hammerhead" on DVD that I saw in my local DVD store, "I thought it was another cheap movie from Naou movie." Beyaz Davidson and they are surrounded by Lerner but not too entertaining B - Pictures in the last few months but produced some very disappointing movies. That's why I can not expect much, especially a few days before the "shark zone" disappointing. But "Hammerhead" became an amazing revival of the 1950s monster movies. We have a mad scientist, a group of people in a dangerous situation, a woman with ill men and a couple, man-feeding plants and of course a massive mutuality between the creature, a man and a Hammer head shark. Everything you need for an entertaining monster image. These types of films have only graphic sexual scenes and nudity you may have imagined, but it was designed for a movie to understand why these movies are missing. And it does not matter which cause "Hammerhead" action and horror entertainment is fine anyway. There are two reasons I've given ten points out of seven: the first is that the monster is not very frequent and the showdown is very fast and poorly, and the second is William Farsi's "Hero" episode and not the perfect guy to fall in love with cute hunter tie. Besides, I would recommend this film to any monster fan of the movie. Hold himself a cool drink and some popcorn, watch this movie and have fun. Jasper P. Morgan
