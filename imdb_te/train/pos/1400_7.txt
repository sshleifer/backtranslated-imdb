Bogwyster and others have worn it too. Shore Leave is really made up of the TOS's lightweight science fiction (which are perfect with classic Trouble With Tribes). It is the staff of Enterprise and its TV viewers who gave the necessary relief from the universe to the scarcity, for example, The Corbomite Manor. <br /> <br /> For a while, the idiomic M class that appears to be the most intriguing event takes place throughout the planet, and sends an exploration team to take a closer look. Suddenly all kinds of absurdities began - some seemingly emotional - but it's a fantastic mystery (gone by McCoy looking glass), mental thriller (Kirk is slipped) <br /> <br /> TOS is at least serial in all series in the Trek franchise, so how many episodes The first season is easy to forget to focus on heavy-handed, potentially dangerous plays Incindi. Unlike the next series franchise writers, TOS's production team was not literally afraid to go before any TV series. And Shore Leave, despite its occasional problems, is an example. My criticisms about this episode are not known how to handle this new wrinkle on the themes of the ST (specifically ridiculous comedy Shutner - contradictory). </ P> <p> The last scene is the whole TOS. One of the worst scenes I can remember from the run. My recommendation - See when watching the entire first season - it's in order.
