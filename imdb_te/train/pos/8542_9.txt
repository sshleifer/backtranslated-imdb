_Waterdance_ describes a wide range of life-threatening lives. Opening the experience of the disability, from the little anguish of fluorescent lights to sexuality, masculinity and despair. <br /> <br /> The variation of the central characters, the complexity of the materials examined - Joel, the author, Raymond, the clock with the black man, and the blues, racist biker. First, these men have nothing to do with the nature of their injuries but their competitive spirit. <br /> <br /> Joel, who heads himself from his fellow patients with sunglasses, headphones and curtains. When it comes to accepting changes in his life, Joel abandons these things and invades himself in the fight of men who share the ward. <br /> <br /> This dance title refers to this daily struggle, to keep a head above the water; Life refusing to leave dancing. _Waterdance_ moving in many levels and a powerful image, and I hesitate to recommend it.
