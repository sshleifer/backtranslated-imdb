I decided to go and see the movie because I was a fan of adult animation. When an actor can not mix a story or style with a cast or actress, it makes the artwork look like an art rather than a scene of different cast members. <br /> <br /> This story is more accurate than the style of the story. I found interesting story (a thriller that brought the story and atmosphere from films like Blade Runner and many anime films), which was a bit difficult to follow at times, and it did not seem to have come together all together. This is certainly a mix of French animation and Japanese animation. If the content is good or the viewer does not. Visually this film is a treat for the eyes, and that sense is the art of art. <br /> If you want adult animation or want to see a different image from most movies at this time. I would recommend it. All I can say is that I enjoyed the film experience but it came out a little disappointing because it could be better
