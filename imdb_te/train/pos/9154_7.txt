<br /> <br /> Acting is very good. Visuals were often very tight, but it helped create a mood for the movie as it painted the snowy landscape of the film. This effect was ruined due to the unbelievable ending. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you can not understand The film ends at 8 o'clock but after the film's first 75 minutes, the movie's producers end up making it look smarter when it slows down to 7. <br /> <br /> The film is much better than movies with big budgets and is portrayed as home cinema with some additional devices. Special effects are not going to the path, but it's great for suspense.
