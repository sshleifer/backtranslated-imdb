Okay, that's it. It's a horror movie. The plot (like this) is terrible, it's worse. But the film is a cause and a terrible Mario Lanza movies are just a reason ... all just listen to the voice of the star, in this case Pavarotti is in his lead. Well, maybe Lanza movies do not need him to hit women, but this film is about Luciano's hearing. That film alone is worth watching. <br /> <br /> "I'm Italian, I'm a big Pawarotti fan (including the base of his fans about Pavarotti) <br /> <br /> When I first saw this film, my life began to be the first time I saw the height and depth of Life's possibilities of love. <br /> <br /> The terrible, beautiful voice and memories like this film are deeply in my life, Talk again <br /> <br /> Yes, it's fun and terrifying, but the voice is permanent and timeless, and the voice is all about it, so I do not hear anyone listening to and hear and enjoy a new level of music and love, Since I lost it, I gave this movie a high rating and you're not eating Italy Istapadutune to try! Luciano Pavarotti Pep future boyfriend or you will be pleasantly surprised.
