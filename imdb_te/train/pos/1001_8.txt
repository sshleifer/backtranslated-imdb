The somewhat funny and well-acting thriller as a humorous, fast speaking hoodlum chosen by US Treasury agents (David Morse) is an excessive demand to release Jamie Fox on the streets of New York to find a picnic computer thief. Hazer (Dow Hutchinson) steals forty-two million dollars from the treasury and burned two guards. <br /> <br /> "Bait" refers to the second chapter for Antoine Phukwa ("The Replacement Killers") and performs the work, even if he is not in his first film. <br /> <br /> Even though his character was initially hurtful, throughout the film, I started to catch, but Fox was great. Above. Hutchinson is a brilliant figure who is a patient in John Malkovich and finally "Roman Man", such as Lawrence Oliver. Whether it is Morse or not, it comes with an intelligent plan for anyone to spend it for anyone.
