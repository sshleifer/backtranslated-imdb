This film is with all time classic. Music, camera shots and acting are excellent. The appearance of black and white imagery gave a better look and made perfect music like Psycho. Surprisingly how many people comment on this film. My opinion is that its hard film. I gave the picture 9. Watch the movie and I'll do it.
