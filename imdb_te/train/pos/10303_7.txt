The story of Bruce Allati Bruce Nolan is the average man who thinks that God is messing his life. God confronts him and Bruce shows his ways of error. Granted, giving someone the power of God becomes worse. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good, Morgan Freeman will appear at the very first rate and at the right in the house and the storyline is well adapted to the cast. Jokes always reach the goal, and sometimes they resort to a bit more on Carrie's facial expressions. The film is not actually black, but only God. I think this way, especially the clever freeman. There are some happy scenes, such as the opening cookie scene, others miss the target but still a good picture. 10 to 6/7
