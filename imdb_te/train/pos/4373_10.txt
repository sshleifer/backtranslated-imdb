I ask if they do not care for the film. Some critics say it has not taken enough action, some say it's too long. If you like Shawshank Redemption and / or Braveheart, you will surely love this movie! <br /> Acting performances are fantastic! Tim Roth, John Hurt and Jessica Lang are all done and Liam Neeson is an unacceptable job and is a very serious character due to his size. Cinematography is amazing and breathtaking. <br /> <br /> "I reviewed it in the top 50 or 100 films, so I felt very excited because I had to register with IMDB so that everyone could have a real scoop. I have seen this movie 10 times (every time with someone else) and everyone likes it! The first 30 minutes you'll be awake and the first 30 minutes to pay attention. If you have more attention than these juvenile kids reviews, you will love this movie! Come on ... All 3 Lord of the Rings Movies in the Top 9 and Matrix # 32?!? This is to show you the most critical age! /> <br /> It's the Top 50 Movie!
