The film at the box office is a disaster, and the reason behind it is the sweetness of the story, the innocence of the film. The music is great, the story is very simple and old, but such a story is very good, the director made his best effort. Abhay is spectacular and impressive and he once again shines in his role, he has done his best in the comic or emotional scene. Soha is very sweet in this movie. Relaxing star cast is just okay. Music and all songs are good, Himem is impressed by Singer here. Do not miss this movie, its amazing picture and feel good to us. Abhay best work to date. I will give Ahista Ahista 9/10.
