Unfortunately, the film is not available for long time (as stated by other posters), but it is one of the greatest dramas of emergency drama, a love line and a touching play in a majestic town. It shows performances by Spencer Tracy and Lauretta Young, the best of their careers, the director, Frank Borgze is a great example of how the psychedelic story of piracy and crime can be created around the elements. The horrific social inequality is proof that this is truly true and spiritual. The film shows how the love between the squallar and the disappointing need stands out and is entirely life-sustainable. A true masterpiece of this period, and a more widely known role of the character.
