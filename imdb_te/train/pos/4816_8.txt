The film was enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Audience audience can be abandoned and really historically very interesting to learn. <br /> <br /> Do you have an exciting, exciting, and accurate presentation of the shooting program? Prince Albert's contribution to the UK and the monarchy is not part of its intention but it is not clear here as a sanctioned warrant. <br /> <br /> The costumes and sets are particularly good but this product (certainly not cheap on the titles) is a British court historic manners rather than York Duchess? That means, when Princess Victoria really spoke to the Prime Minister in his Majesty company with his mouth, did he discover a full dagger / risol (?) In his mouth? <br /> <br /> 'The film is sympathetic to Victoria, or indeed does not really feel in his boots. And the characters of the principals liked it, its performance is convincing, so should the script really let us know better? I thought it was a totally different, unidentified outside observer, much more than "Mrs Brown" or "The Queen". To be honest, I can not get my eyes off the screen, except for some of the avant-garde camera technologies that are constantly focused.
