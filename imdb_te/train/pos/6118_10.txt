Jack Frost Really a Cool Movie. I mean ... its funny. Its violent. And very happy. Most people say it is B rated, but it is not far from the truth. It has great special effects and good acting. The Killer Snowman course is just the weird thing. I thought this was one of the best films of the last nineties. Most movies do not have the standard of these days a Clive Barker Masterpiece. That is, be original and give the viewer an unpopular one. Jack frost is very cool. 10 to 10 Grade: A +. The film also recommends the movie Uncle Sam for the fans of Ed Jack Frost.
