The picture is really recognizable and challenging your opinions of the community you live in. It is well made and very powerful. People in the movie reveal the world outside the honest and principle theory. I believe the viewer gives great insight into a sub-culture that shakes many of the society's thoughts. It's awesome at times and it's more powerful. It is difficult to see some parts are very real, but it will not be complete. This is the first time you see it, but it's better for a second or third time; It's your chance to close your mind to a lot of things you discuss and challenge.
