The story is a lot shaky and I'm just like my own parents, and I've really connected. It is once a powerful and emotional that anyone's body fails. And then there are mistakes they made and live to live. I loved Ellen Berstein's performance and who was Christine Horne? She is amazing! Real search. There is probably a very romantic scene in the film I have seen so far, but nothing has been shown - it's pretty. The overall look and feel of this film is an amazing emotional journey, exciting. Cole Hauser is very good in the film, and he meets the man to move down the man. Not enough to hook us up, I had never seen this sentimental sentiment, a lot of sentimental and filmmaker, but it was not enough to move on.
