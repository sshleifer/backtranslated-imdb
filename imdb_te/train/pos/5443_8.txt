This is a good movie. I liked both the Johns-Stamos ("Full House") & Stockwell ("Christine", "Top Gun"). They both give strong performances. The interest in love is okay, but the image of the guy is more than this good date picture. I love Harlis, and I hated that they had painted a good old Army Olive Drabe with a "lucky 14 crores rubbed with hand". Here is a short history lesson in Harley-Davidson Motorcycles, which plays a key role in World War II. I do not know if the training is like these flowers! The film retained my interest from being very slow with good action sequences. I love watching the population of the vote history - an 18-year-old man gave the film 10 (real bike lover, I guess). I can not give a 10, but I do not give a 8. I do not weigh each image at the same level. There are big budget movies with great actors, but if you look forward they do not get bigger. (Star Wars - episode is my best example) I loved the first three SW movies, but I was weak as compared to the episode. So I get a lower rating than this film. I hoped more from George Lucas.
