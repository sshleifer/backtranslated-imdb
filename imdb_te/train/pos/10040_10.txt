Personally, this film will fall to my top four places. No exemptions. James Cameron has proven time and time again that he is a master storyteller. Aliens, The Abyss and Two Terminators, is clear that he is the most intelligent and loyal director until actions and science fiction genres. He looks at a story and adds a strange quality to the film. But Titanic is very different from his other strokes brightness. The film is spectacularly moving and surprising, allowing plotting and development of interesting characters in the story that everyone knows. Cameron is the legendary Voyager story myth that she is sidestepping on her virginity, since it is a challenge to portray her sincerely, interesting and entertaining. The movie was a great movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio, starring Jack and Kate Winslet, starring Rose, with the release of the film, which became super stars in the release of the film and I was very angry at most films when I did not do supporting roles, but an old Rose (Gloria Stuart) Because Rose and Jack are the only ones to be the story Da, it seems clear that there was. Mentally satisfied and there is no dry eye in the theater or home. Music became iconic and epic. It inspired composer James Horner's best soundtrack and a great deal of film and audiences. After a long time this song became annoying but I still appreciate this phenomenon and this is the film. The only problem is the typical James Cameron problem, which is memorable but sensational but it is cheese whenever it is next to it. James Cameron offers a masterpiece and a romantic myth that will leave you on a journey of a lifetime. My heart is not from this.
