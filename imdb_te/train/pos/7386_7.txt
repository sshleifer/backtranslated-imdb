OK, so the Oscar looks just a little more hype every year. And I was rooting for "Gassord Park" (Robert Altman won an Oscar for years). I guess it's too late to win an African-American Best Actress. In contrast to previous reviewer, Halle Berry's role in "Mans's Ball" is more original than Nicole Kidman in "Moulin Rouge"; <br /> <br /> "I never thought of nominating any particular year in a year seeing" Mulholland Doctor ". <br /> One of the things I anticipated about the September 11 attacks; I know they're going to say something about freedom. Yes, yes. Robert Redford should be well known. Contrary to previous critic Wippy Goldberg, the host is not hostile (Bob Hope in past hostess, I do not respect anyone); <br /> <br /> "A Beautiful Mind" is the best film yet, but I am still happy with the "74th Annual Academy Awards" (I should confess, I enjoyed the Oscars than my own birthday). Many people who I see Jim Broadbent "was asking me, who was thinking when my Oscar was winning?" I Voody Allen attending Oscars at anytime - and after the day, as my parents and I hiked around the residences in Bundelier, New Mexico I'm wondering whether it will be.
