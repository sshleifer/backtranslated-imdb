Talented Detective Mr. Philo Vance (William Powell) takes his foreign tour to the hospital. He is suspected of having good reason. <br /> <br /> If the murder mystery goes to the movies, it's not better than just one. Compared to suspicious characters, all dog dogs are very good at killing the suicide victim Archer Archer, which is really difficult to find or to conceal around the head, before it was proved to be attractive to watch. Also cops, coroner and district attorney colorful, fleshed roles have been adding to the unexpected rainbow realism level of these trials and to prove amping its overall "fun" factor. I especially enjoyed comic scenes with Coroner (played by ANTene Guerdot), who seemed to be undoubtedly and unusually interrupting because he had always been found by corpses or injured men during this time. Eugene Palette's Detective Sargent. Heath is often the happiest joker with his expense, critical commentary on Vance research. In fact, I can not think of any valid criticism except for this film. Yet it does not stop the film from seeing it as pleasant and pleasant. Look and see if you wrap your head around a mystery. Try as much as you can!
