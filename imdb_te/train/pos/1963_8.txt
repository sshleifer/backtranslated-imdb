We will launch all of our reviews below. For the past 15 years, my wife and I have seen over 100 films. Recently, we have been honored by lifetime movies of any movie for any movie! So we can see what we want when we want it. This point is the CRITICS calculation for ZERO. National critics like your local critics or Ebert are different from you or yourself. The only difference is they are forced to write about the film and see if they want or want hundreds of movies.Therefore, our belief is that if you earn your money for two hours of pleasure it is good enough! We never hear or read critics. We only care about our friends and people who know us just as we know them. <br /> <br /> This film is great. Good but not very good. Critics have a few sedatives. They hated it because of nudity and language. It is worth the price of the ticket and all you can ask. Is not it right? Each film should not be an Academy Award nominee. Sharon Stone is a gorgeous and does a great job in the film and it mystifies me what critics want in hell
