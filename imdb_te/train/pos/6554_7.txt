OK I say: <br /> <br /> This film is awesome. I was a huge Nancy fan and I read all 1-56 original books and I went to read more. I am now 96 years old. Beware of villains to give this film a lower level. All clues indicate a fantastic picture! I loved the whole thing. So Nancy is in the present time. She was still old when she was in her books! Persons who have not read more than 5 books about Nancy's perspective are complaining. I read them all and I think Emma is perfect and Nancy is perfect. I have found parts of the movie horror. I chased the exciting car and liked the Aives. I loved the clues. I secretly fix it! It's really amazing. I suggest you see it as a good film and B have nothing to complain about N Barney about Drew. Let's see. It may not be an Oscar but it's a good image.
