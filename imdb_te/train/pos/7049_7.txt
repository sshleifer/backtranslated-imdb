In this satirical comedy of commercial and 'heartfeltness' of war, John Cusack plays the role of the former US president, the former US President of the Assassin sent to 'Turkmenistan' for bringing Omar Sharif, a former oil chairman who is struggling for the Vice President. In addition, the houser's commercial performance producer, pop princess Yonica (Hilary Duff) and the Nazi Liberal journalist Natalie (Marisa Tommy) must cheat her fake location. <br /> - Acting as expected (at least the main characters, at least) is good. Some of John Cusack's conversations were not explicitly written because he was often uncomfortable. . . Perhaps the dubious is more accurate. The Zone is a great, and often hilarious, performance. Marius Tommy, I've never been a big fan of her and worked well for the role. Hilary Duff, though, is pretty horrible. They need attractive middle-class (or Russian, or any accent) pop-star. <br /> As I mentioned above, the contents of John Cusack, in particular, seem to be a bit hard and unmatched in writing. Not too much, mind, but some. The story is a bit humorous at the points, which is fine for a satire, but it has reached a new level here. Fortunately, Cusax and Tommy have a relatively cool and quiet behavior, and it blends the film's dazzling and acting leg headings. <br /> Previously, Joshua Seftel has done a good job with the real credit credits, wide-spectrum film in his name. He has organized a small ($ 10 million) budget and has expanded to make it look even more appealing. Seftel was also able to mix the story's comedy perfectly. . . <br /> <br /> When going to simple satire, commercially its exaggerated form of war is made very well, especially the 'Golden Palace Poker' statements in US tanks. Moreover, this is very small, but in the end, it clearly shows how a genuine 'Mel Brooks' style is handled. <br /> <br /> Overall, well made for low budget and it's definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> This is not one of the great powers of the movie, but it's not the worst. <br /> <br />
