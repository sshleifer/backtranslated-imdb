I enjoyed this movie and I had little hope of all the negative reviews I had read before. I went because I was curious about this fuss because some of the posts were so angry with this movie and Koreans. I've kept some of my favorite movies from Oh and Korea. I loved the host but it was not my absolute favorite. Some of my favorite sci-fi / fantasy movies: It's not as confusing as the everyone says, and the demons looked good and the fights were great. There are some holes in the story but it really does not matter. I was tuned out of such items and stopped asking me long ago why I see summer blockbusters. The Korean myth was interesting, the rebirth stuff was different, and in other roles I thought that the main characters worn as suspicious as the Korean actors. <br /> <br /> Yes, it can be good, I hope in Korea that with some extraordinary quirk concept, some will bring a little bit of intense emotions and unexpected jokes. Variation of blockbuster style. Maybe a future host and a combination of Dragon Wars?
