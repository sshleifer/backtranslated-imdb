Robin Williams and Kurt Russell stood their marriage in their 30 years with their players moving their heart after their rival Bakersfield years (Russell's reluctant reliance). Williams was OK, but Russell Rimo Hightower Quarterback was as great as Toting. Holly Palace makes a nice and attractive turn as William's wife, who can live without this again. It is worth watching the movie to watch the famous Ramon in the film. Highly recommended.
