Screenplay written by Samuel Fuller on South Street is a rugged, ruthless, well-made film about Pickpocket's a pickup (Richard Widmark). Accidentally targeting top-secret microfilm and targeted to spy agents. Jean Peters also participates in the rigorous extent used as a courier by her former ex-lover Richard Kile. It's the best - movie nair, and the performances are all good, but its grand character actress Thelma Ritter steals the film. Mo Tired street peddler is amazing in the role the neck relationships (and who sells information) brought her another Oscar nomination. Its fantastic Miss Ritter has been nominated six times for an Academy Award and she has not won. This should be the character that copped for her!
