This film is awesome. This is the original concept (a bloodthirsty film Yakuza mob picture meets). It's a delicate and yet very dramatic and tragic film meeting about friendship, love, immortality, death and happiness. In the episode of Got Comuay, the role of the character of the character of Shah was superbly distributed, with Hydex being the best surprise in his debut film as a hin still humorous vampire. I also laughed and played the role of Santosh-go-lucky, with Toshi. Every second of the film I loved every second, especially the funny cigarette scene, fighting scenes, and most heartfelt endings.
