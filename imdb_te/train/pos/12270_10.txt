I've searched for this movie for years, and a copy in Ebay is not available here. <br /> <br /> It has clearly killed many camps in the forests looking for three young hunters and their bare three friends. They found a former Vietnam vet crazy that he found (he murdered some of his victims using a cover of a la Freddy Kruger long metal finger nails). Soon after night, one of the girls goes for a walk after a small argument with her boyfriend, who is killed. After one of the group discovered her body, they were in their tents in the light of daylight. <br /> <br /> Seven bodies are not gore but good murders, especially girls' deaths. The boys are killed in a slightly bloodless way (to blow up in the car, shoot to death, head with a knife). <br /> <br /> Overall, a nice slasher image from the end of the infernal TRAP 80s. There's nothing new, well-played, fast paced and some pretty ladies. 10 to 10.
