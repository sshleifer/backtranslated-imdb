I'm engaged! The story is amazing and performance is highly addictive, but I love it. I'm in Season 2, Disc 5 and I'll tell you that I've added a lot of letters now. They will seriously influence my vote for any event for their evil. And, Michael is now on my list. Kidding ... I'm very happy to see Season 3 because I'm very scared that it will end up with Disc 6. I can not wait to see the rest now. Thanks to the directors / producers / and the actors of Lost ... I enjoy watching TV again. Before I Lost I was surfed by going to sad bed due to my frustration in television through each channel, but I have to say that my kind of lost is fun!
