I saw this movie with some curiosity. I want to see 1) Paul Mui can play Chinese and 2) Louis Rainier qualifies for her Oscar. I got the picture out of thinking yes! I saw Muni very much in the same movie, and I guess that performance. I was happily mistaken. Although some criticized him in Hollywood thinking in the Hollywood concept of many child masses and contrary to the thought of Hollywood, I thought he was right in that role. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance to play the main character, he can play in the same way. <br /> <br /> I was especially impressed by the camera work and audience scenes, especially during the removal of O'Lan once the slave palace. The graphic and horror atmosphere of firing squad and drought has made all the epic and sophistication at the same time unlike others. The film was originally entangled from the end. I can not tell "epic" today.
