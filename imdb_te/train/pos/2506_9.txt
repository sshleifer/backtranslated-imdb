Moon Child is one of the more symbolic movies I've ever seen. I really liked the example of sexual immorality / death and barriers and guidelines. The vampire reputation of the film contains immorality and benefits for it. Humans are usually seeking supernatural abilities or eternal life. The moon will show the illness and unwantedness of the child's death, because the feelings of losses, especially almost all the characters influence the show and the key. With the release of the movie Moon Child, the film is close to all, guiding everyone and shining the way of others. The film I like is a morally good personality. The weaknesses of the film are in parts of acting and special effects, as the film is less authentic. If the role of more authentic emotions was introduced, the role of Tachi's death was more powerful and realistic. Some scenes with special effects such as gunfire are also more standardized than a single action video game. The sparks that came out of the guns seem to be very fake and I think I was either deleted or handled. However, I think the moon child should have a picture that everyone should consider looking at. The formal ideas and imagery that the film brings will be easy for everyone and the likes of many viewers. It's a lot of film and fun to watch.
