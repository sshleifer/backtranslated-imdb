Louis Brooks gives excellent performance in this well-built French play. Although she is in love with a man called Andre, Loyain plays the role of a typist, growing up her position in her life. She sees the opportunity in Miss Beauty for Europe, but Andrei was angry when she learned that she had entered, and she later sought withdrawal. <br /> <br /> When she learns that she has chosen Miss France, she is trying to get her entry back to find out that she is now going to the main competitor. <br /> <br /> It is love, loss, emotional finish. Director Augusto Genina and film Tutorials such as Rudolf Mate and Louise Nee are very powerful. The film is more like modern images than the Hollywood films of the 30s and shows a different style by the Europeans. There are very fast cuts and traveling shots, mostly with great skill and varnish. The first power of the film's third power is reduced to a bit in the middle, but reunited in the last 15 minutes. <br /> All the Principals of presentations are very good, but it is particularly memorable of Louis Brooks. Louise relied on her silent screen skills, even though it was a talkie, her silent style was surprisingly concerted, poorly felt, and she was transformed to better talk. Louis Louis utilizes her unusual expression eyes, as she struggles with a life that she never desires, as she gives her a very difficult feeling and alienation, and this affordable opening scene is very difficult. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with wonderfully painted, artistically painted, powerful and beautiful. Some of the best things in the opening days of this film. And the tragic protagonist is the only major tragedy for Louis Brooks, the worst underscore. It's not just a great beauty that she looked amazing in a swimsuit, she really has a major acting talent that is basically thrown away all. <br /> <br /> G.W. With less than his German films. Pub, but I think it is a good one. I'm a bit more familiar with this band's pub, and although it does not have the deep moral complexity of the Prix de Beatty pubst, it's very easy and it's a more sorted, over-the-task. <br /> <br /> The Bottom Line is a classic Louise Brooks film worthy of looking at, which is made by Louis's singing epics Edith Piaf.
