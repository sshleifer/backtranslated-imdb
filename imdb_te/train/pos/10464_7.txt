For everything you do not talk about: the film's largest [original] title; "Rabbana" translates something in "The Thieves". This fact is the main problem I have with the movie, it's not true about the thieves. This is about a young woman working for the biggest police investigations of exploitation. I think it's a simple desk job, but this girl is soon on the field that brought her into the hands of the story, as it goes in the story, and one of the burglars fired ... exactly: as we have seen before. <br /> <br /> "The fact that the film is done in all respects, the actors are so great and do not overtake and the director really is /> <br /> One thing I really loved about this movie is that music sets the right mood when it's needed, but does not attend the rest of the time, which is a good idea for the shootouts Michael Perbar Brabt is often one of the few greatest actors, partially injured when he does not play the heroine's role as a heroine and play a supporting role in the background. <br /> <br <br /> This will steal more money than you do from time to time Entertaining movie of 7/10
