John (Ben Chaplin) is a lone bank clerk living in a small town located a long way off London. Despite the internet, he approached the Russian company of brides. He finds Sophia (Nicole Kidman? Person alone and shy, but certainly has a good taste, is not he?) And when they meet each other, he finds that he does not speak English. Relationships between each other are fundamentally limited by gender (again, imagine, the worst thing for a person is, some kinky sex with Nicole Kidman!). On her birthday, her two Russian friends visited her. Then, very surprising happens. I liked this movie: First, it's almost impossible to 'label'. Is this black comedy, action, thriller movie? I believe that all options are correct. Nicole Kidman is as usual as usual, and I'm so excited about his Russian: is she really talking to a voice in Russian or just a duplicate? Anyway, I found an enjoyable image. <br /> The title (Brazil): "A Iska Perfita" ("Perfect Byte")
