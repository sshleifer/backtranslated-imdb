One of the biggest hits of 1926, Harvard Brown is an amazing comedy / drama featuring the sequel and football scenes in the role of villain Haynes as the main actress. It's all the way hines: he brides a smart aleck that wizes up everyone and turns out to be a person / hero and takes serious things until the girl denies the achievements. No one is working on this formula like Hines. With a stunning comedian (Mary Pickford with Mary Pickford, Show People with Marion Davis), Haynes swims through the face of the tragedy with a change in facial expression. He is in the film Tel It to the Marines (with Lone Chaney) and West Point (with Jon Crawford), who repeats the formula. Mary Brian girl is fine, Jack Pixford is very good as a weak roommate, Ralph Bushman rival. Edward Connelly, Mary Aldon, David Torrens, Ginn Williams, and Grady Sutton co-star. The film is now recognized for a homoroxic relationship between Haynes and Pixford, and for John Wynne's Yale football player (but I have never seen him). Hines was the first five stars starring in the box office in 1932 with the film. He was overly confident that he had forgotten much and lost most of his movies. He is one of the most appealing and talented actors of his time.
