<br /> <br /> The summary of my words of this film is 'nice'. <br /> Does it appeal to public viewing mass movie? <br /> <br /> The image that you are trying to take part in. <br /> <br /> Cinematography effects (Sauration, Freeze Frame, Blur etc.) > Acting is a natural tension. <br /> Acting is raw, fantasy and totally reliable. <br /> Looking at the movie Friendship; The title really gives the game away <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Many are <br /> <br /> We are not the ones we have experienced or really want to be. <br /> <br /> This is a love song.
