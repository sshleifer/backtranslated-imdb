I have demonstrated that the horror and great British Hammer Studios, which provided one of their greatest films with "The Devil Rides Out" (1968), was in the horror field. Hammer's short running TV series "Hammer House of Horror" (1980), the tenth episode of "The Guardian of Abyss", is really a creepy entry to the series. The names of the well-known names in HHH directors are not to mention two "Fu Machu" films featuring Hammer Owier, former director Don Sharp and Christopher Lee, "The Kiss of the Vampire" (1963) and "Rasputin: The Mad Man" (1966) Also distributed. The antique goods dealer Michael (Ray Lonneen) slips over the mysterious old screening glass. Astonishing glass is an object of a ghost-worship cult desire, and they want to use it for its satanic rites. When he sacrifices a beautiful young man named Aleson (Rosalin Lander), he faced a deep embarrassment with Michael worship and their evil leader (John Carson) ... This is my favorite "Hammer House of Horror" favorite sections (the best seventh episode, The Silent Scream "), which is very creepy and atmosphere. The plot has many interesting twists and the movie is breathtaking throughout. Ray Lennon was a good leader and young Rosalin Lander persuaded him to be innocent, and John Carson was really crazy as the hero of Satanism. Overall, "Guardian of the Abyss" is another interesting and creepy HHH story, and my fellow Hammer fans should not miss it.
