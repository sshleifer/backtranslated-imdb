I guess this film only work for people who have been stopped by Lord's giant hype of the Rings. Well, so I do. So I really love this movie. Especially when I like all those flawless superheroes from LotR is so completely and disrespectfully parodied. The most amazingly Gandalf (brave and intelligent and completely ridiculous known-it's all wizard) is the counterpart: Almghandi, the coward and the brain dead transvestite. Sauron's counterpart ("Sourousness" from East Germany of course) is wearing a bucket with eye holes as a helmet. Aragorns alter ego is yet another risk-driven idiot who tries to fix his broken knife ("Ulrike" Legend) by Scott Tape. And "Stranzedam" (Counter of Warmtong) actually had some strong comparison with Brad Doureff! And do not forget Grampli and Heidi ... huh-huh
