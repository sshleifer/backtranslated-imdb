This cartoon is fantastic, but the story actually has a slightly more depth and emotion than other cartoon films. We have a girl with a low self-respecting camp and she is just any other girlfriend, except a brother and sister, she is just a painful one. When she arrives in the ultimate little point and she gets a deal with a devil-like demon literally. I am very truthful about this film and even if things are not so bad, she sees what happened, she will repent and feel the changes, and then she learns the darkness and the spiritual beast's love of humanity. The twins are much better by helping small bears, and then they also get the value of self. There is a very positive message for the child, although some of the elements of the film are strange but it is still a happy picture. The music from Stephen Bishop (Totoei songs) has further improved
