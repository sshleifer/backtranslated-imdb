It was first released in the nineties and I have seen many times. It was a great mystery about Mary, a murderer who was murdered and murdered in a senior town in the high school of high school, Mary (played by Alicia Silwellstone), California. <br /> Marie Tony (played by Kevin Dillon) meets a police cadet, how bright she is and decides to work together to find a killer. <br /> <br /> Many suspects in this case. True Crime feels very "real" or true. I read a news review, where there is a whole suspension of disbelief and this is true. Alicia Silverstone is perfect in this role and Kevin Dillon and Bill Nunn perform a great job as other actors. The positions are correct and the author / director, Pat Wechki, captures some facts of adolescent life and some of Mary's loneliness (see Mary's waking scenes from Mary Dream Sequence after watching Tony's photos). <br /> I do not see any other movie like True Crime. 10/10
