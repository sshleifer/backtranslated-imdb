A pretty fast and pleasing crime thriller and insurance based on Ira Levin's play about two gay writers (Cain and Reeve). With the plot successful, two young writers, Christopher Reeve, decide to kill the lesser authors - only a little bit of changes. Southampton in Easthampton, Long Island, Lloyd Island, for example, allows Reeve. The plot of the play does not ignore the death of a small gossip or accidental death of Canon to tell the rest of the dead gift and the truth. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine is a Sydney Brul, MegaBucks production play, with its last four productions bomb and quietly new game, perhaps with Reve's input, that redefines its reputation. Reeve's scandal may not allow him to produce a play-a-cliff. What else? - He tries to kill. Eventually they killed each other and their neighbors took over by Tendorpp as a psychological hell, and she sold it to Broadway a million bucks. <br /> <br /> It causes a lot more fun for a number. One product model. The world's most valuable acre (East Hampton!) Is a magnificent set of multi-storey, multi-story homes with large grassy plains in eight. You can not buy a baby tent in East Hampt. The house is not the largest or baroque in its decor. Although it's a little tidy for my taste, it's so clean that you're afraid to step on a thick carpet with fear of leaving a footprint, it's just wonderful modest <br />, acting is rarely improved. Cain, Cannon and Fred Jones are terrific. Diane Cannon gives pitch-perfect performance, anxious wife whose slacks are very strong because they give her assets and they seem to be sprayed. Reeve, who restricted his talent, also found a comfortable niche in the role of a psychic killer but a sensitive character. Irene Worth is a bit hard to define as a supernatural neighborhood hell. She granted it - or someone like her - needed the plot, but, my God, what a role off her snoop, go around, claim, "I feel the pain in the jis Woom!" I think she's a little more interesting, she has a sweeping hat and a goofy hat with a bicycle reflector on it. <br /> <br /> You have to love Ira Levin's bitch dialogue. The bleak Cain Rei begs him to tell him why to tell him. "Because it's, Sydney!" Reeve, and Cain shouts, "It's not the mountains, the place! Some do not play the drama until some *** hole writes them!" Kain's call to police was great after his wife was asleep. As he reports events, he only serves as the torrent of sabs to talk, as the ambulance is urgently asked to be sent. When he faces his face, his face assumes his usual silent expression, he pushes his nose into his hand, and again leads all businesses. <br /> <br /> The climax, despite its apparent contradiction, is confusing and noisy and totally lacking the artfulness that Levi and Lemette brought to previous films. This score is mostly composed of lighting riffs on the harpsichord, which fits well in the film. <br /> You can enjoy it.
