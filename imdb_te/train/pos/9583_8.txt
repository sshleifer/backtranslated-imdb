I waited for a while to post this documentary review because I saw 10 years ago and thought carefully about what I wanted to write. <br /> <br /> "What did this set up to do, show me something that I did not know and kept me interested in this world exploring it. And the "balls" are just incredible to find out about them and these folks are very talented in what they are doing and how they will compete: Catty folks, <br /> <br /> When you compare the balls and the new drag rings that made more competitive categories than you are in each other's competition is jealous Talking about how it is used is the old drag queen, and the future of the balls when ready to walk on the runway They are also learning that will change. But living on the street in front of the opponent who hit the ball with two minutes to come to the competition, it is very important to them; then the sad stories, "home" and "house mother" of the best stories and prakasavantamainavi competition. <br /> <br /> After 10 years of watching this movie, I lived Madonna madly. I made spots of some familiar faces from this documentary that ended with Madonna in her "Vogg" stage and did that. If not for those people, Madonna does not have a "Vogue" stage, now I know. Credit DUE should give credit here. If anyone from mainstream America looks at this documentary, they are not considered "mainstream", and I'm wondering what they think.
