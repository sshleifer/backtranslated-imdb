Sudden Impact is a two-story story. Harry targets a mob that wants to kill him, and Harry favors the favor and shows them how it works. This little battle puts Harry on the suspension, even if he does not care, he goes on vacation. Now the second part of the story. Some killers kill and Harry pulls into this situation, where he meets Jennifer Spencer with a woman who wants to stay quiet for that small tourist town. The police chief is not a subtle guy and warns Harry not to take part or cause any trouble. This is followed by Harry Kalahan Trouble. As Harry goes to war, this group tracks the town and hell opens. However, the alert will attack again. Jennifer Spencer is captured and Harry gets his help in the film's climax. Sudden Impact is not a great dirty Harry, but at the time we give Harry, a anti-hero who is ready to go to war only to go to Germany. Not the best, but the most memorable line. Go ahead and do your day.
