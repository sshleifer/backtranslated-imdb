The cornerstone of the corner shop is clearly stated at the beginning of the film, the Balta Street in Budapest, but it could be at any location. The European design reflects a small number of sets, but it can be a shop in any corner. This film is not a business of Budapest or retail leather goods, but about the ups and downs of love that reflect most of the main characters. <br /> <br /> Alfred Kralik and Clara Novak have been members of the work, but their ignorant letters were filled with hope and expectation and romance, and the story is committed to bringing the two sides beautifully. The owner of the shop Hugo Mathewschek suffers from his wife, only the voice at the end of the phone. Ferenje Wadus is a secret affair. Elleno Novodny has a big friend who bought her lovely clothes. Mr Pirovitch's life is centered around his wife and children. Peppy Katona plays the role of Santa Claus for a girl in Christmas. <br /> <br /> The script is the best writing of comedy and drama. It moves effortlessly from the scene to the scene. This again is one of those silent films again and again and again and again. The dialogue reflects the role that is not common today. <br /> All acting is wonderful. There are definitely small characters like the waiter in the cafe and the police in the street. James Stewart and Margaret Salmon play each other. He really gets into his stride as an actor and gives a sweet and sharp performance. Margaret Salavan is an outstanding actor and appreciated today. She is worth capturing some of the other movies. Mr Matuschek, Frank Morgan is amazing. The truth is that his moment is very moving. <br /> The good line they do not make is as bad as they are used (unclear re-make 'you who gotta mail' is terrible), but in this case it is true. Director Lubitsch is fortunately not fraudulent but delivers a classic picture of the soul, charm and warm humanity.
