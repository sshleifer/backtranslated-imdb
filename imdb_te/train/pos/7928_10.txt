Let's get the first few things straight: if he wanted, the filmmaker would have walked them, walking, even zombies who might be hell. This is what makes the original zombie movie so good. Everything they did was quite unusual. I hate when filmgoers or fans like Romero expect everything like Romero. Some idiots are considered to be a typical Romero movie, and once a filmmaker can whistle the zombies he deserves. Zombies in this movie look very good at all but they are not just decapitating corpses since they are just freaking death! They are pretty confused and filled with chopped faces and blood. One of the coolest scenes is a half eaten cat. It looked like this because my daughter cried real. The film received good reviews at Fangoria and Ray Morga, so I want to see it. I'm glad I heard. They are always right when it comes to the taste of a true horror fan. 10 out of 10! Rent it!
