I liked the film when I was younger. Today is 17 years old one of my favorite time animated films. Beautiful animation and attractive characters are just two things to like about this movie. While most songs do not enjoy some songs, most of them do well and go along with the story. <br /> <br /> This may seem to be unlikely to some people at first, but in the end you will succeed Charlie, which focuses on Charlie. <br /> <br /> There is no kidding image in any way. Sometimes very dark and frightening. Dan Bluth is a treat for fans and animations buffs. But keep a tissue easier. ADGTH does not listen to me and does it for those who are sensitive to the film. One of the greatest Disney animated films ever made. Down downship down and along with my Neighbor Totto. <br /> <br /> The Bottom Line: A heavenly masterpiece.
