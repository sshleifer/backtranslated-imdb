Paul Rischer is one of my favorite personalities in the show business. I read his two books and I think he is great. Peter Faulk can provide the best punch line amongst them. The combination of the two is magic. <br /> This is true about a family. Through a road trip, the father and son family were connected to their lives for the first time in their lives. They do all the things they want to do in the life of fathers and sons ... they are only after a lot of life. Conditions are very funny, but in real life people really have the feeling of being (above or on the cartoon is not sustainable). This time I looked at Paul Ricer and believed in every emotion. <br /> <br /> GET FEATURES AND GREAT TALE AND STORY. It's a wonderful message of comedy and emotion ... Olympia Ducacas also does a great job :)
