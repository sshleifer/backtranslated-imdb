It's hard to tell more about this movie. I'm not expecting what I've seen, but it's a simple sexual play .... I enjoyed it ... This is a pscyho-sexual thriller, it's nothing. It is not new to Emmanuel Siegner, her husband, Polanski, the style (and nudity) directed by her. And a creepy performance from Torneon (actor Bernard Tavernier) (I say creepy / yes creepy). A Poblak Bruckner meets Roman Polans (better than Bitter Moon), a chabrol, or a closet thriller (I have seen Les Deabolic), but Georges Franz's Les Uyux sans visage (face-to-face doctor Phibes and more godfather). A gem! They are thrown into the Hollywood remake as they do with Nagwatch and The Vanishing.
