Ah, 1970s. When it's a swinger. To be honest, today is a good time to be a swing but it feels more potent. <br /> <br /> Joe Surprise offers a beautiful soft-core film. In fact, like today, some actors are popular hardcore actors. Unlike today, these people are good actors and the story and character development of these films. <br /> <br /> It's pretty much what you expect from a swinger's movie. One of the two couples who have open relationships can re-ignore the wanderlust from the MILF. <br /> <br /> In fact, when MILF is Jennifer Wells, it's a different story. Many more 40-somethings look undressed tasty like Mrs. Wells. It is worth the price alone to see her in Ms. Wells's mirror if she is Aphrodite. She is not "Stirling mum". <br /> <br /> I also digs Anna's Chris Jordan. Jordan looks like Elaine Joyce and she also feels like "Twin or Elaine," separated by her "birth." <br /> <br /> Unlike the soft-mainstream romance of the 1990s, the originality of the 70s romantic hardcore film (the soft-core of 2000, instead of the 90s, is music and canned orgasm) and is full of force. <br /> <br /> For those who enjoy the Quebec character produced by "Dukes Femme's Enr", you will enjoy it. Another classic movie on disc-in classics is the best $ 2.50 per month.
