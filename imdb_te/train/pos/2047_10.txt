The film reached home. At 29, my 80-year-old father works in a factory. If I work very hard, if I work very hard, I'll always dream, house, some children, and a car if I'm very proud of it. <br /> I could not get anywhere without a degree (without my father's departure from the ninth grade) and without the great feeling of greed and laziness. If anyone has this movie on DVD or VHS. It was made for TV, and I saw an hour ago. I can not find anywhere else! I love to show this to my friends, my fake friends, family and other relatives, see what they think and remember them, once the Americans work for a sense of honor !! I think the feeling is still there, but most things are made abroad in a huge downward spiral ...
