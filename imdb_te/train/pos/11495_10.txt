We saw one of the local art film theaters in the Mandrous area of ​​Houston, TX. It was a total surprise when compared to writing in the theater newspaper, but we both flew with artistry. Somewhere in the Munich area (German for Château) is pretty and (clearly) photographed. It is a very clear exploration of the sexual relationships of a group of twenty men and women separated from daily barriers. The higher the level than I can remember is amazing. <br/> <br /> <br /> The film came back home and talked to and talked at 4 o'clock in the morning. <br /> The version we have seen is in English (mostly) in the German version (probably its original). I searched and searched for video tape version but never got it. Absolutely love to have a VHS or DVD version of this. It analyzes a basic level of relationships and also has a great tutorial on how to get your partner involved. If someone is familiar with the author / director, please convince him to release the best of the day on DVD. I can not even imagine getting tired of watching the candid performance of all actors in their forties now. Please, bring it back.
