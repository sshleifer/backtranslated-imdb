As a big fan of romantic comedy, it is rare that a large number of these movies appear. In that case, I try to breathe through the laughter in several scenes. Love story is a bit thin on the ground, but I'm saying that this romantic comedy is strongly emphasized on "comedy", in any case it increases a bit more loyalty. Four scientists offered funniest moments in the film, but I have seen for a long time. I believe that most people use indiscriminately, so I believe that the maximum rating will lose its effect, in the end I choose a "10" on the "9" I'm also a big Meg Ryan fan, but it's one of the few films I've seen, I've said that I've completely covered it. She and Tim Robbins have appeared as Leeds, but the second sonata for the pranks of male nerds for me. A true laughing-louder type image.
