In fact, the original is better, but it's not as bad as told to everyone! Yes, it's made up of 3 stories, but hey, what's so? I thought it was good to be honest. I really liked that Anastasia changed a little when she fell in love and showed her love. Stories are not so bad. <br /> <br /> I loved Cinderella's voice. I do not have anything against his voice, but I think it's better here. <br /> I give Cinderella II: Dreams Come true a 7/10.
