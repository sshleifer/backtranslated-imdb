Twisty plot, beautiful girls, black gloves, sharp blades, and a bit of high bloodshed come together to make one heck of all Italian exploitation piece. /> <br <br /> <br /> <br /> A bunch of gialli favorites are both front and back of the camera, the best around but the Argento gialli work to make this one.
