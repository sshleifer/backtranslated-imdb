Jeremon Crab is the main character in this film. I saw this film 6 times and I'm still not tired. The film is in some ways like Flesh + Blood. Gerald Suiteman is a great writer. He wrote all of Paul Viehoev's Dutch films. Paul Wrohoven is one of the greatest directors. I saw all the movies except the Showgirls. My Mom did not like much but I disagree. I think all of my movies are a ride to see total total recall and basic instincts. Jerry Gold Smith Some of his movies include Total Recall, Basic Instinct and Halo Man. Jerry Gold Smith has never died. Dutch films are different but still enjoyable.
