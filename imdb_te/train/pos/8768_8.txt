I saw a shop in an inexpensive section in a shop. I really remembered seeing commercial and trailer years ago. The plot is interesting, Claire Danes has always been a talent in my eyes (even before I became a big Kate Beckinsale fan) "Hey Watt" and bought it. <br /> <br /> So two girls who are bang for a vacation in Bangkok have been sent to Narcotics (they are innocents) and then sent to a Thailand jail. This film is what is going on and sometimes their innocence is questioned. <br /> <br /> Claire Dans and Kate Beckinsale give great performances, and the plot of the film is extraordinarily wrapped up and some good moral discussion questions raise. It is a good film, but some improvements. It has long been ... It has helped to strengthen these characters and to gain more insight into the politics of Thailand's legal system. <br /> <br /> Despite this, it is a good movie with some good performances. <br /> <br /> You need to see pop-culture junk for a two minute role by Paul Pak Walker for PS. The first time I saw this film, I did not even notice.
