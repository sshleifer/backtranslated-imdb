Mystery Men is one of the funniest movies of time. There is "neat" for innocent innocence and characters. It has become part of our family "culture" and we often quote characters. My favorite movie in the past two years. My kids are 13 and 11 and we love this picture of three. Great acting and comedy. We love the galactic quest and monte python flicks too. Well, we do not speak here intellectually, just a family bond!
