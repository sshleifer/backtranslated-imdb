"Amazing Grace" It has a tired feel as it tells the contemporary story of different lives in an apartment building. The Hebrew-speaking language, but the play can happen in any modern city. It observes family values, romantic relationships, and age group experiments with the same experiment. It does not determine the roles that are struggling to solve their personal problems in this modern world, which will take them straight forward. The quality of acting is good, and the observations made on the characters are sophisticated and sharp. I'm flowing this movie too.
