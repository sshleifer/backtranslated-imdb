It's very real to the original name of the same name, sister (the tramps like the US) but it is still fun if you read the manga. This is a different kind of tail, showing a strong and independent woman who suffers as everyone else. However, due to her external strength, she feared she could show her inner feelings, and she suffered from her blunt comments to her neighbors. The only person who could really stand up to her and stay with her is her pet ... man ... mmo. If you want some different J-Dorama (Japanese drama) actors / Risis different than the usual boring stuff then this is definitely the series to watch ... and read!
