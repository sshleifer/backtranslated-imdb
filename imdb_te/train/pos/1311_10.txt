This is one of the best movies out there and it's being a lot for television. <br /> <br /> <br /> Helen Hunt gave such a crude performance. She played the rookie cap fully thrown in serial killer case. It was wonderful when she was separate because she killed another kid. She is alone, so he comes to her. When she talks about her mother! <br /> <br /> Steven Weber as Serial Killer was very surprised! He really brought her into his dark world. It's an Oscar-worthy. When he talks about killing kids, scary! When she realizes who she really is! <br /> They really do not like such things. It's a real thriller without a ghar.
