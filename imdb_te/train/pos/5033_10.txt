It's one of those movies, after watching it, looking at you and looking for months to come months. Acting is excellent for playing two kids (I usually hate movies with whiny kid acting). Bill Paxton is a miracle, the performance of his directing performance is better than I expected, "Game Over, Man! Game Over!" (From the movie "Aliens"). <br /> <br /> The best part about the movie is the contradiction between the actors playing a family and their "work". It really makes the film believable and memorable. <br /> Let's keep it. I'm sure I'll wait for more movies
