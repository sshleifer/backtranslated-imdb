You need to pay attention to 'twelve monkeys', but if you do that, you probably appreciate it. I know. The story is interesting and time travels. One virus killed many people in 1997 and Cole (Bruce Willis) found a remedy for the virus in the 1990s and 1996s. In 1990 he was arrested and placed in a psychiatric hospital. Where he meets Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), who has something to do with the virus. He also met him in the 1990s by Dr. Catherine Railly (Madeleine Stowe), an untrusted psychiatrist. When Colin was disembarked from a mental hospital he was locked up in a room and locked back in 1996, believing Catherine Cole's stories. <br /> <br /> This film will take time constantly. Cole calls a phone call and leaves a message in 1996, which has been succeeded in the future and "someone" can send. For a call that appears only in seconds after a phone call. Such things happen throughout the cinema and you should take care of it. You may ask a few questions but if you can not answer it, it's good to agree with the movie. <br /> <br /> 'Twelve Monkeys' is a fiction film, some great pictures and dark atmosphere, and it acts as a thriller. You are not sure what's going on somewhere and it helps the movie. It may be a few drawbacks in the story, but because time is about the fictitious thing like traveling, you accept the movie tells us and try to just enjoy it. It's easy for me.
