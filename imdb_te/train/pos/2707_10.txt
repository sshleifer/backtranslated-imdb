Cory Blmy. This film was a surprise to me because it was a comedy work. Billy Jane is as amazing as the central character, and everyone is organized to play directly enough for the naturally and easily comedy. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack is a pleasure to look very cool and set pieces. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to be some of the colleagues, some bottles of your sparkling, and to be surprisingly and fun. <br /> This is a real "B" movie tradition from the outer space of kitsch artworks like Plan 9. But it does more than the skill of the participants in the film. For example, Ron Perlman. I still laugh at my self-gaze in the scenes, where Jane almost stages the steps in the ballet style without any obvious reason. All a bit mad, and it's all good.
