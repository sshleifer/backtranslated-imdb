I feel like bathing here, it's too old. But it's still nice. The bike mechs are cool and the story works a lot. I hope the character 2 will work for themselves and my big complaint is that it will hit the macroscript. Not just the animation style but many role models. For example, all the girls in this movie appear as LYN MINMAY of macrosess. Mechs macros and similar characters. These little kids are not really made up of graphic violence, nudity and graphic sexual content. So I give this cool Macrosco-Knock-Off 7 Stars to make a long story short.
