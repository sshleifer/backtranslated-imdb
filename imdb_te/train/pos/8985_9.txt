Despite the DiG! The music industry has been praised for being the most fictional. The viewers misled the viewers that director Brian Jonstown believed he had disappeared from the face of the post-98 'post-mortem land. And the controversy between Dandy Warhols and Jonestown. <br /> <br /> The film is an interesting watch when focusing on both groups of talented musicians who create endlessly and create their art. One of the best things for this film is a unique perspective between indie music scene and big corporate scene. <br /> <br /> It is highly recommended for music and two fantastic bands.
