The 2005 Toronto Film Festival Report was official; <br /> <br /> The new "Takashi Mike" film's annual midnight screening, "The Big Spook War" or "The Great Yogi War" or "Yoko Diesens". <br /> <br /> Colin Geddes, a fearless programmer, originally stated that the picture was originally meant for children in Japan. Think of "Lord of the Rings" or "Neverending Story" for Japan. I can understand where they are going after the screening, but it turns around after "Takashi Mike". He directed '01 film 'Ichi Killer', which performed at performances show performances. <br /> Plot Summary: A young boy in a troubled home has become a "choice" and he slips in the midst of a great spirit struggle. <br /> <br /> It meets a group of friendly spirits with his children. In the show, these souls are sure to be blurred with some (friendly ones). It's like anything I've seen in the movie theater before. Naturally a fantasy, some very funny (non-dark) material. You can not get bored. Will it be hit in North America anytime? <br /> My rating = B
