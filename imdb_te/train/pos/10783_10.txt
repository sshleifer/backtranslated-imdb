I enjoyed this movie. At age did not see Andy Griffith, and he certainly felt it appropriate to this role. <br /> <br /> I'm not worried that Dotti's "anxiety disorder" may not be a verbatim from the psychiatric textbook. There are zillions of whatever-phobias and mental disorders, and this takes a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative forms. As understood by local Indians, she is clearly sensitive to extra sensitive forces, not by any Anglos. <br /> While it is a light "family image", it is more sophisticated than it looks. Moreover, in the end, the twist of Hiram surprised me a surprise and added all the previous action into the bundle. It is fun to think about such spiritual guidance.
