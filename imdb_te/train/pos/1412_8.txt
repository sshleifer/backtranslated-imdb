Why on earth should you explore the landscape documentary "Earth" mesmerizing? How much time do you have on earth, so why did I explain this to you? Well, I do not extend my review on "Earth" until infinity, but this should keep my ground on why "must see". This documentary takes on the nature round trip on three animal families: the paternal bear with a different parent and her children to hunt for hunting on her lonely way, which is a whale of a whale whale of an immigration tour for her baby whale, and with her young Elephant Mama (probably not too small, they are elephants) is African Migration of the child. Directors Alastair Forgeggil & Mark Lynfield also employed "this land" to extract many other animal species survival skills, including magnetic shots of our three animal family leaders. Cinematographically skilled team of Richard Brooks Burton, Mike Holding, Adam Ravitch and Andrew Schillier's are the animals in the camera to depict the natural scenery and natural behaviors of animals; No need to say, slo-mo are animal hunting shots u n b e l i e v v b e e. "Earth" also learned a lesson on the impact of global warming on animals; That baby baby boy is a poster boy. So fellow earthlings, it's time to take on the documentary voyage to visit "Earth" today! **** Good
