Of the Irish roots, I loved this movie, he is also hearty and honest guy and hot and funny. I loved the girl he fell in love with, she was beautiful. They're a beautiful couple. The end is very sad. Love this movie! Although it is a small dirt, it reminds me that the British or Irish version is important. If you liked this movie you should see the main. The same story line young guy comes to older women, the older women comes for the young man. Many of the ways cross, in the end, the best decision or work is done. Without destroying the whole picture, there is nothing else to say, although I felt French man was ugly, all was less attractive to me. Oops ... If you like Irish movies, I would recommend "Friends Circle", that movie is great. Quick quote, unless you see it you can not get "well, my dinner is corrupted." LOL
