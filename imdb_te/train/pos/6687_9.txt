Though I can not say that the comic book is fantastic, I read my stake, so I think this film is a part of the audience, and is not disappointed. This is eventually going to be steamy from the steam, which is almost filled with ideas, and this is like one of my favorite actresses Lena Olin, the cutting room remains on the floor. Furthermore, Hank Azareya's little Raja's little distance goes away. However, it's easy to forgive all of these mistakes when you're a very fun movie. All actors have their own characters, particularly William H. Mackie's straight-arrow Shaoul, and the explosion at the Janeine Garophon as the bowler. And unlike some, I found the city design to make the joke even ridiculous. I also liked how disco bad guys selected music; Something, it seemed right.
