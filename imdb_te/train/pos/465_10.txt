Marilyn Goris founded himself as one of the greatest directors in the world. This sensitive, visual image is based on the story of Vladimir Nabokov and the writer's dark satire. Giving John Turtero his best performance (I'm not generally his fan); And Emily Watson is also amazing. Well worth seeing.
