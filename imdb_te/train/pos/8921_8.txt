I'm on this page, and seems to be disapproving to me that someone at a true classics has to hear ramble and rant. <br /> <br /> The film should not be missed by any classic horror water, and many casual viewers around the world. <br /> <br /> It really is lost in today's world of CGI effects, especially age-old flair and greatness, but not why you like it. , Even today's standards. The whole ickyness is not a classic slam if the original audience is just too creeping to you, so if you're not given a chance. That's not the look, but with the criticism of the criticism. See how it's originally intended.
