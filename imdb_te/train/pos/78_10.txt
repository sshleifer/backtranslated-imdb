Although it is one of the standard "Revenge Price Plots," Vincent Price's work is my favorite. Galicia has the quality that does not appear in the most horrific film characters - the favorites. When you look at it, you feel for him, feel his frustration and feelings of injustice, and even if he gets scared of you with his original anger, you will be excited when you go for vengeance. As the film continues, his role is tragic. He committed his murder, but now he must be killed to cover him. To cover one again. And again ... as a beloved brother watching a hood turn as your stomach sinks with his spirit goes down its spiral. Although the story of the vengeance is outdated, Plot Devices are the real ones- Garc√≠o uses his techniques to kill them in ways more innovative. This guy does not have a shame to be ashamed of the house.
