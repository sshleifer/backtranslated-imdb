I was impressed by the British royal families and their history, my wife had to attend and she never got me cinema. Although the audience does not expect electrification, the film is well made and the visualization is no second. In many ways it helps dispel the myth that Victoria is usually the tedious unsmiling dump woman found in photographs. She is the brightest intellect and the joy of a happy young woman in her earliest years of history. Albert is the essence of her love of true love, and even if you count the number of her children (9), they should have a very exciting relationship. All of these have evolved in the film. In this order, the cast Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend were both well-chosen, with sound shows like Victoria and Albert. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler Warning) Historical accuracy is a matter of doubt for some time, get shot while defending Victoria. At least one attempt was made while they were together, but no one was beaten by shot / s. I also found odd that I had done little to extend suspicious relationships between the Victoria Mother and Sir John Conroy. This relationship was the unpleasant cause of Victoria's mother and Conroy. I realized that there was an attempt to visualize a romantic or at least romantic relationship between Victoria and Lord Melbourne. When he arrived at the throne of Victoria, he was 50, and weddings between adults and adolescents were common in that era, while the film deals with 30 of the Prince Albert and 30 rivals. Albert was clearly rivals, but she was not married to her station for a short time in her life, and Albert was only able to accept a case. The movie is a bad thing, and wheat points with my wife is not a bad thing.
