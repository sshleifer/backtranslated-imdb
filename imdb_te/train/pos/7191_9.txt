Reed Hadley makes the foppish Don Diego better than a dashing and daring Zorro, but the point is almost aside because any serial, ever bar none has the best theme song - and the best version of Yekima Canutt's famous platform. There are plenty of other good stunts, and many actions, and endless cliff-hangar chapter endings that increase eyelashes, but if there is any other reason, you should look at this film to see Stagecoach stunt, then slowly watch back in motion. It's pretty awesome, and despite this low-budget for the game's chapter, Yk turns out to be a good take on the stunt here than the very popular movie "Stagecoach." Indiana Jones eat your heart: this is a real deal!
