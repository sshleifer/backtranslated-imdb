A great picture and a true story. Don Jansen is the Greatest Skater ever. A touching and beautiful image can enjoy the whole family. The story of Jen Jensen's war with cancer and Don Jensen is his sister's love. His sister Jane defended an important promise made by Jansen who won the gold medal to prove his belief in speed skating in speed skating. This film is well worth the time. I want to make more movies for this quality. Thank you for a great image with amazing actors and amazing stories. It's a very touching story about a beautiful family support for their children and a special dream for confidence and their little son and his sister.
