One family (Mother-Patricia Clarkson, Dad-Jake Weber, son-Eric per Sullivan) will go to work in a few remote homes in the middle of winter. When they were driving, they accidentally hit the deer. <br /> In this case, some locals - especially Otis (John Spradakos) and the slowest things (very slow) are vigilant. <br /> I started looking at this topic. The bulk of this site's reviews is quite negative. Well ... I disagree. Firstly it's not a horror movie. The horror ending does not begin until 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> "Jake Weber is a terrible actor; WAY frightened the scene of a very wrong dream; wendigo just dolls into the picture and we are at the end wendigo 's clear view is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Good things: Pretty good dramatic script; Clarkson is a good mother; some great direction with strange sound effects which are slightly scary; the beauty between Clarkson and Weber <br /> <br /> Sullivan (just 10 time!) And very good acting with Spradakos and a completely unexpected tragic end. <br /> <br /> Many people with this film If people are frustrated, it's not so, if you ignore it, I think you like it.
