One of the most ridiculous and ruthless films I've seen, but one of the most tragic and moving ones. It has never been seen before an action-drama like the world. Sometimes the plot came close to my tears when I was delivering a surprising exposure to a bone-crunching blow to the guts at the next moment. Edison Chen Chilling Performance. The story of an HK-Cop and a Cambodian killer is hunting down each other, while their humanity is a bit of a bit bit of a bit lost. It has a very low dialogue for haunting film and sand camera work, "Dog Bite Dog" is pure HK-Blooded without heroism.
