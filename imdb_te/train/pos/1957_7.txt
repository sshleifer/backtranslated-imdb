<br /> <br /> Before I started commenting, I said, this film is very low. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone is amazing in the role of Catherine Trammel as Morrissey as Dr. Glasgow. An analyst who sent him to analyze her after a player's death. <br /> The acting is good (except the thellis) <br /> <br /> Stone has really the talent of this character. She is soft, naughty and seductive and does not look older than she did the first day. She really impressed me (like in the casino). Morrissey is good. He showed a lot of vunerablity in the role it needed. The tholis was lame. He lost his character and was the best way. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is as good as the first, but Stone is hard to see. Just ignore the tholis.
