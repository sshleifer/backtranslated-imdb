Why is this kind of compact, entertaining mystery not shot in the new century? It keeps visualizing the viewer and guessing all the way. The cast is a great combination. William Powell performed a true star quality. Who knows - perhaps he was practicing for Nick Charles for his future. He is a pleasure to see. You can also see why Eugene Palle created more than 200 films. He is a great assistant actor and fun to watch his amazing chemistry with Powell. Mary Astor is on average working in most meat. All other hands chip make it a fully enjoyable way to spend 73 minutes. I suspect Michael Curtis is a directing ball. Bravo!
