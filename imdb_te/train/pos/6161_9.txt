Children set during WWII, Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a fun pre-fantasy adventure, which is co-starred with Angela Lansbury as a disability witch, with the help of three evacuee children and 'Professor of Witchcraft', killing a Nazi expedition. <br /> <br /> With bright discovery and laugh loads, the film enjoys all children of the year with its great characters, exciting story and impressive tunes. Lancebery Aglantine, the most complete-perfect witch to have three children in a lifetime adventure, and her three young co-stars (Cindy O'Callaghan, Roy Snarst and Ian Weigle) are equally impressive Cockney. <br /> <br /> Special effects are some time old, but To counter them, the kids do not pay much attention to these things, they will be entertained for a long time. And entertainment, they will be. It's hard to enjoy this amazing slice of cinematic espazism with some amazing scenes, with bright live action and animation being a great influence, and adding more genuine movie magic than the one hundred Harry Potter. In fact, the musical number just out of the portobello road is not just the image's perfection, but it can be easily forgiven, easy to enjoy. <br /> <br /> In addition, UK television legend Bruce Forsyth has assured me a good rating as a 'flash' Harry style spy.
