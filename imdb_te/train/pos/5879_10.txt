One of the more intelligent comedies to hit the Hindi film screens. The reconstruction of the 80s of the Priyadars' Boeing Boing, a remake of the 60s Hollywoon Hit with the same name, Gauram Masala increases the comedy in the Hindi film. <br /> Akshay Kumar once again proved one of the best super stars in the comedy Hindu movie. He combined well with the new hunk John Abraham. <br /> <br /> John still stayed in the shadows of Akshay and failed to grow on this occasion. <br /> <br /> New gals are beautiful and full of their roles. <br /> You must watch comedy. Leave your brains away and laugh for 2 hours !!!! After all the laughter best medicine! Ask Priyadarshan and Akshay Kumar !!!!!
