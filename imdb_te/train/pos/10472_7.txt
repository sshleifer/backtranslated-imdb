Anyone who loves Ryostatics music will enjoy this movie. I have a few minor complaints, especially some actors who are not really convinced in their roles (not mary) about dramatization and casting, but I do not have a time review. I warned the cinematographer to watch this movie as a CBC television in Canada. The version that is broadcasting the CVC is like a reader version of WHALE MUSIC --- Do not see. It cuts from the whole scenes and subplots (if you have to) the image. CBC, which has not hit many movies, whale has taken half a million muses. I do not know why. It is terrible to what they did to the film. Rent a video or watch it on the theater, but do not watch it on CBC Television.
