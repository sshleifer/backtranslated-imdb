** Unlikely Spoilers ** <br /> If the biggest part of the dysfunctional image is silver, and if your title character fails, your image is generally not lagging behind. The description of the filmmakers of Wendigo's form is interesting, and can be menacing properly when properly painted - a fleeing killer sees Wendigo in a flash in his back view, for example - and tree-form is actually very good. However, as a monster character it does not really come to life. We can not get much explanation for its behavior, and what we see from it does not say with the story in the story or with any Vendigo Singing I ever read. <br /> If one of the main reasons I fail the monster is that it is not enough to make, in the picture. When you shoot this bone to its bones, you have a suspense thriller that contains a part of a psychic factor instead of a monster about a monster. <br /> <br /> While cinematography is good, cheesy; The filmmakers are used well for offering scenery, lighting, and the time and weather of the day. Otis's character is really dangerous and unpredictable, making him the real monster in the film. <br /> <br /> It may be more efficient to explain his behavior with Wendigo's starry spirit, which is more accurate representation of the true myth. When a monster suit is constructed, it is very heavy and uncomfortable hurt (it is to walk on the cloven hooves, on his toes) to walk, walk or Almost impossible to do. Thus many flashes of the creature still stand, and it's clear spade-up footage running. I'm stressing that these reports are not unified.
