Horror is perhaps one of the two subjects that have never succeeded in logic. We know that murders such as Freddy, Jason, Michael and Leather Face do not survive the pain and can not yet fight for another day. Many of us do not really believe in killing the dead and eating their brains. And at least some people know that when you enter places like Funhouses and Old Mansions that you think is not the case that amusing crimes are not against them. In fact imagination is successful. Horror, and usually most movies, our disbelief for two hours is suspended and just need to go with the flow. This is not usually a problem when I see the missing bounce balls at George C. Scott, or seeing three amateur filmmakers in Woods near Burketsville. But when I am a killer like a movie in this film I will digress the problem. The murderer is really a huge spoiler and takes away all the fun of watching it for you, but when the killer is revealed, it is enough to say that I really enjoyed this movie for the last scene. There are many events in the film that make the concept of a killer. But before this point, the 90 minutes is good and curious, with bloody soaked film, John Howe. If the film gave me a different killer, then I would actually be raving about it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this case, the cause of the film is totally asynchised to disturb the film, but believe me, that anyone who meets the film is sure to agree with me. <br /> <br /> John Cassaeates plays the role of Dr. Sam Cordel. He and his daughter Jenny (pretty by Erin Flannery) recently moved into this small New England town. Cordell is unclear how recently his wife and his wife were dead. A mystical lady (which only meant to be his wife) would see a lot of faint scenes there, which turned out to the ground during a revenge collapse. Her face bleeding and her eyes closed. Again, I do not know who this woman is, and I do not know what the story is like, but she is whatever. Cassevetes, which is said to be, is strange to say the least. Cordell is a loving father but his daughter seems a little more than just parental love. Some scenes represent unrealistic possibilities. This is true but it's just omnipotence, but somewhere just under the rudimentary rug. Thankfully the movie does not really explore on this topic but it makes you a little harder. <br /> <br /> Casevates appear to be a cross between porno actor John Leslie and screen James Ken. He has a cunning smile and a viral, commanding voice that makes you sit and take notice. He is also about disrobe during a trade dinner in every scene but he also appears. He was just that slimy, disingenuous, disgusting, unpleasant way about him. He looks reliable in the film. I guess it's credited to writers, director and cassaeves. There is always a pain to tell me about her role from anywhere. <br /> <br /> The story begins in a wonderful note when two viewers swim in the local quarry. Nearby is an old old changing shed and as we see, something or someone is watching them. When a little boy is disappearing from the truck, the young man leaves the shed. When she is there, she will be attacked. The young man pushes her to move her and he knocks with a board and nails. How shrewdly the young man comes in. The pitch sets us up for the pitch. He frantically looks like the scours of the room and his lover's lover bleeding spots in the corner, and then smacko, the guy gets it. This is a very difficult moment and it will start a movie on the right note. <br /> <br /> The young man, Tim, is also introduced to the tangled marriage of the story, a woman committed to a torture chamber that men dressed in their faces. Tim wants his dreams to be murdered, because every time he is killed he has another dream. A quiet and mud grandmother, a meretricious male reporter and a strong yet venal toss in the local sheriff and you have all the ingredients needed to build an imbroglio of Galen small town. <br /> <br /> In the movie, most people have been massacred, but most of the time, men are facing serious misconduct and raping women. This is my first weak (and cautious) effort, and I doubt it. It just did not strike the right string. <br /> <br /> Inkubus is a well-shot film. It is tough, tight, and the performances are very well done. I regret the dream of Tim and I worry about the killing of the story and the importance of the story. But when you look good in the picture, you leave that line of taste in your mouth. And the bitter pills are always more difficult to swallow than the sweet ones. <br /> 10 to 7 - It was nine. Very bad.
