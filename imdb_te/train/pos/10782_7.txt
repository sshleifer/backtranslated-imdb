Michael Sterns plays Mike, a sexually upset person with an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality. He has no problem ogling naked dancers but when women start having sex with those men when he loses. He believes when women really have sex when they lose any sense of "innocence" and / or "beauty". <br /> <br /> When he hunt the couple who love at a distance by the Hollywood Hills, he eventually surrounded strollers. Ultimately, the bodies were killed by a high-powered rifle. <br /> <br /> The primary reason for showing the presence of this film is that sexual relationships are reactivating over and over again. "The story" comes more of an afterthought. It is very difficult to create happy gender men with long-term scenarios of nakedness (where women see very good sans clothes) and treat sex for a large dose of selling. In fact, seeing a fair deal in its range can increase self-consciousness significantly. (For one thing, the mike shows the eyes for a minute before a trigger.) This is quite different if there is some weather environment on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The concept of worry is a commitment to enjoy a degree or another for the worst tendency. It also has a lesbian conversation that is disturbed by Mike and makes it uncertain about how to respond to him. It happens very slowly, but wraps with a very amusing sarcastic twist. <br /> It's a kinky and distorted rarity, somebody else wants to keep some viewers on the screen. <br /> <br />
