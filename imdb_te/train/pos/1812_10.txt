This is one of the greatest films ever made. I forgot about 12 years of film. When I saw an ad on TV for ADGTH and looking at it when I was a little kid, I brought back my favorite memories. And when I saw a few nights ago I became the image slave. I usually do not like animated family films but it's a perfect family film. <br /> <br /> The end of the film always touches my heart and kills me. The worst that the kid movies coming out for today is amazing better than all. I understand that the movie is rated G and it has a lot of hell that was filmed in 2 dogs, smoking, drinking, murder, death and movie involving gambling. The picture is good from what I believe is good. <br /> <br /> Today's movies are not intended to bring reality, they are made in the film. <br /> <br /> RIP Judith Barrie & Dome Duis
