This is a delightful performance. The Greek god Hemo (blood) animated with pride, pride, snobbish domination and innocent wonders. The coat (or scene) salty water fiction writer is frightening but moleifies the chemical ingredients so blood chemicals sees the hoam and segues when "hoses all these tubes ... you do not learn my secrets ..." and suddenly threaten the hemoks tires with the word "thallassa". <br /> <br /> A wonderful mix of entertainment and information makes this classic a fresh, fresh and rounded version of today. Motivation of interest and imagination is primarily meant for children to learn.
