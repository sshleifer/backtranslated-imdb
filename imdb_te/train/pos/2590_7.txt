This film is not the way to understand the meaning of the movie. The film is a favorite of any movie blockbuster Blackbusters and Leonardo DiCaprio. <br /> <br /> Wilder Napoli is a very small movie, it's unclear and maybe stupid at first, but it's not on the platform, it makes for the ingredient. <br /> <br /> It is a very useful tool for me, it plays a big role. Students in movie music can see how important film is in Vida and Wilder's life and background. Wilder's theme, Vida's theme, and Wallace's theme can all listen to the opening scene, and the lyrics are funny how to play some. For example, in the scene where men are singing as "Duke of Earl", the men will be with Vida Wilder when she sings like "She's My Girl", and then she goes to Wasses. She says "tension between the two brothers" is she "my girl," there are all the little implications of the film, and if it looks like a flop outside, the film is really.
