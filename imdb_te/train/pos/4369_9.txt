I liked this movie. The scenery is breathtaking, the plot has some nice twists and turns, and the characters are well rounded. However, "Rob Roy" scored more than an average in both fields. First, I rarely saw a "popular" picture of the quality of the conversation. There are many sound slashes and thrills along with bright choreography. I have been able to give you many examples, but why should I do it? Just watch the movie. Secondly, the film's principle is hardly detectable. For a play to be successful, it is only necessary for a hero, but really trustworthy villain. If you do not have one, there is not much pleasure in rooting for good guys. And "Rob Roy" is not one, but three - Mantros Earl, his assistant Kiliran and Archie. Not one dimensional villains, either, but completely fleshed and very nasty. It takes a little more patience than "Braveheart" - there are more conversations and the accents are a bit rigorous, but it's more intelligent and subtle. (As I said, I love this movie!)
