Peter Bogdanovich made a great deal of great pictures, and they are one of the best of all. The cast is not good to play this light but a little bittersweet screwball comedy. Interestingly enough, witty, light touch Bogdonavich so effortlessly gives the image instead of frustrating emotional core in the picture. Fresh and instant, the film definitely starts with any explanation. We do not have soundtrack music to queue. As we play action roles, and the Bogdanovich glides down the streets of New York, the film unfolds effortlessly. Robbie Muller captures everything with a simple simplicity that the camera thinks is dangerous, but not sure. The cast is amazing. In every way, a classic.
