Bill Paxton starred in this highly original film. For the first time I saw how good it was. The reviews I heard were okay. As a result I am looking forward to an average thriller .However, if you are a horror film fan of Perkstance 's excellent direction and acting, End credits. The strongest story of the movies is the story I have to say is the most original and as I saw before. There are also two young teams that show full emotions to this chaotic boy. I give 9/10 to this film and I will catch it all.
