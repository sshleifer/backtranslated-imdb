For starters, I do not even know about this show since the internet. I have never seen TV in my country once, and most people do not usually know about this performance. <br /> I do not provide 10 points to many people, but this is a show that really deserves all. 10 points. At first glance this may seem like a normal cartoon but remember that it is not a child-show though. When the whole story unfolds, you know that this is a real storyline with a spiritual message. This spiritual part of the story is based largely on soul-animals, an old Indian belief that has been preserved for many years. This shows you a truly twist that is not often seen in animated shows. <br /> <br /> The whole design is very different. At times it spot the spot similar to a bit in the sand design, and other times it takes more cartoony. <br /> <br /> I also believe that you have directed awe and chicken and have animated a section of the show called David Fees (he also attracted that part of the comic). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a mind-twisting performance, you should not miss a show that has taken on various aspects of reality, suicide, spirituality and life. If you start watching, you can finally see. A little fact is that it takes less and less content from the comic, but it's not too annoying. But where is this question on DVD only ?!
