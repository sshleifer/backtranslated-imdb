I had seen most of the series until I could see on television, but unfortunately, I started working in the evening. I caught some records in it, but ... I bought a recently released DVD in the full series. Looking at the DVD, you can see that the animation is a bit more involved, but after the pilot the errors are not correct. The voices are well suited to the characters, and the writing is excellent. Animation refreshes rather than looking back to reusable elements by reproducing adult themes. Thing is the way society has been in the past century, and you need to be a bit blatant by today's standards to become an adult-based program. The characters have a very real personality and are kept in situations where we often face real life. It's your typical sitcom, but humor is like a talk show ski or Saturday Night Live as you expect from television on the night ... when SNL is actually funny. Good job, DreamWorks. Perhaps you should work with one of the more liberal networks to continue this series ... and improve marketing of marketing for a series to help reduce costs. It's a challenge for a cartoon of a mature nature though. Oops ...
