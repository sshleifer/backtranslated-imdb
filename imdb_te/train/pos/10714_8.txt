Scotts excel at storytelling. The traditional sort. Many years later, I am still able to repeat the war with an elderly woman, my friend's mother, in the eyes of my mind. Her characters will come alive. Her hobby is an eye-witness. <br /> <br /> She had been years before she was born, but you can not imagine what she says. The same story is said in Scotland's length and breadth bars. I talked with a friend of a friend in Malliig, a local cut to give his version. <br /> <br /> Stories continue to close. Do not we remember the stories that our parents told us when we were kids? They are our invisible world. And, when we are old, they are still inspirational or emotional reservoir. Facts and fictional mixture with aspirations, character patterns. Warning stories. Ideals. <br /> <br /> "My name is Anthus, my grandfather and his grandfather." Our hero is introduced to us. And introduces the story that re-spreads through generations. It produces stories in stories. Stories that inspire Scotland's indescribable wonder, are covered in motionless mountains. The mythical thing. Yet Seach'd is actually rooted. It gives its special charm. <br /> Angos (Angus) visits his grandparents in the hospital shortly before his death. He was in despair. Some of him wants to meet in Glasgow in the twentieth century. <br /> <br /> However, he grew up in Western islands in Galilee speaking community. <br /> There is still a deep conflict in him. He uses the truth to know. His grandfather is behind the ancient stories. Where does fantasy end? <br /> He wants to know the truth after the death of his parents. <br /> <br /> He is dragged into a lucky journey to the summit of Scotland's most unlikely mountains. Can you say the truth? <br /> <br /> In this story about stories, we have accepted bloody battles, vicious lovers, ancient folk tales, and sometimes even more dangerous folk tales. <br /> <br /> Doing so, let's meet with Angus, as we spend our own life story. <br /> <br /> Seach: Unsuccessful Pinnacle is probably Scotland's most honest, unpretentious and genuine beautiful image. Like Angus, I was a little bored with the pretense of stories to hang on more stories. But, as Angus, 'I have seen the big picture once I've forgiven.' Forget Braveheart's box-office pastiche and its like. You can also drop the famous drama of The Wicker Man. To see the true picture of Scotland, this one is unique. If you can meditate too much on it, you can re-evaluate the power of the story, and the old question is whether or not to say some facts.
