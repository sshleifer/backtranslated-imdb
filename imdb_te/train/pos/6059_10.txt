It is a wonderful documentary, racing action packed with beautiful pictures and a great story. IMAX cameras provide a much wider perspective, which is perfect for DVD movie. When your speaker works almost all the time, this film is not fast and gives just 230mph natural feel. Of course there are some sound effects but I feel good, they give the depth of driving scenes ...
