'Capitol City' fans are happy! The first season of this series is now available from the Network DVD and I've just got my copy! Although the key 'Maverick' is an ensemble part of the trading floor roles, Capitol City 'each team plays a significant role in a separate center or peripheral platform for us through our first and second seasons. The head trator is a balanced mix of creativity, interests and personalities of the cultural blend of Wendy Foley's (Jonah Phillips-Lane) staff (English, Irish, American, German, Polish), for many people, financially sinking through the attractive performances of the cast The vague factor of trade. Originally contrary to Shane Longman's difficult and old-style senior management who represent Lee Wolf (Richard Le Pammerier) and James Farrell (Denis Hawthorne), a young team of warriors. I suspect I was unable to work as an extraordinary way of working as a team of Wendy's, which was not for the 'free spirit' Peter Longman of the youth who was in his youth with a thirty percent stake, and the modern business path became reality. Instant supervisor Leonard Anseen (John Bowe) follows the traditional method of running the company, but his impression of silver is that he sees 'medial' in most cases. The main interest in the series, derived from the romantic attractions between Douglas Hodge Declan and the cold self-assured blonde merchant German merchant Michelle Hoffmann (played by Trevine McDowell), is the audience continuously between these two co-workers <br /> I look forward, and hopefully thirteen second season will not be too long!
