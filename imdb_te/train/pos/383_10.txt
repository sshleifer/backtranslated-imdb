The film initially captured my heart when Quincy Jones first heard the notes or the powdery purple color of the flowers. This is really cry and dying picture ...! The whole cast gives me the best performance of the film I've seen over the years and Spielberg really overtook him! VPP Goldberg, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey (Oh Lord!), Danny Glover and others give us all the best and you'll feel it - touch almost! Goldberg IS Sealy, she gives her the feel and the feeling of low quality that she needs, and we are growing up with her, along with her along with her, and we will be with her success. Margaret Avery Shug Avery is the most glorious, even when she is very proud, and "sinners" actually show us "souls." Always sympathetic, handsome Danny Glover makes an amazing job at making people hate him and the amazing music (I'd say Sir) Quincy Jones adds more beauty to this wonderful movie! Photography, music, director, and music makes this beautiful, sensual, experience in life. You should not miss it! "Cista ... remember my name ..."
