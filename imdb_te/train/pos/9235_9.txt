Flavia The Harriet Art of undesirable work and maybe my first recommendation is that the euro-extortion film is underestimated and neglected. This clever and complicated film is pretty realized Surprise? Pretty damn perfect! This does not take much of meaningless insomnia or unwanted violence, and the Prevention of Artifacts that categorizes Flavia as a disturbed trash. Flavia is a beautiful 14th-century adolescent, forced to live a loyal saint in a tough convent. She refused to let her be less, because she was the woman and she blamed her for her brother's ability to cope with it. After an unserious attempt to escape, she is another rebel nun, and she also leads the bloodthirsty Muslims to the walls of the convent. <br /> <br /> Flavia is a vivid mesmerizing image! It is almost impossible to believe that director Gianfranco managed to make the mingozzi very realistic and uneven. I will challenge you with a title centered on the main topic of pioneer-feminism than Flavia. Several scenes (such as on the edge of the nightmare) are very shocking, like camera jumps in brutal rape, violence and malice. And yet this raw footage is not just used to satisfy the shocked gorhounds, you should be mindful. I strongly believe that they are involved in the declaration of 'flavia': Humanity (especially the Catholic Church) is historically proven to be a hypocritical and discriminatory breed and does not deny any sort. Images like "Flavia, The Harriet" are valuable to question and blame our precious ancestors and I really admire them for it. Flavia is because of its unusual and basic exploitative image, but it also brought in a spectacular musical score by amazing cinematography, striking clothing & scene and an excellent musical score by Nicola Piovani. Florinda Bolkin is ambitious and Headstrong is very persuaded as a nun, but this is Maria Casarez, who steals the show as her fame. She's a man who likes to urinate on the open ground-a nonsense and loud talk! Amen, sister!
