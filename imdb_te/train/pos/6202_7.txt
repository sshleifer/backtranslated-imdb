When I started looking at "Fay Grim", I did not know it was a continuation of "Henry Fool". Now, the next one is not the film I expected to be a sequel. But one has come, and it's pretty good. I think you saw the original, so I do not explain it. She lives with Phae (Parker Posey) with Henry (Thomas Jay Ryan), who lives with her son. Simon (James Urbaniac) is still in jail. One day, the son boycotted the booze toy to the school. But this is not a simple toy. It contains the mystery that describes what happened in the first film. <br /> <br /> Hull Hurtley is here to say that I am very impressed with what he has achieved. Maybe this one does not reach the original quality, but it certainly takes a good look at what is happening in the world. Moreover the closure opens up for another sequel. <br /> <br /> Jeff Goldberg also stars.
