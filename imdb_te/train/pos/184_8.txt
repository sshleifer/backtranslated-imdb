"Show People" as Meryan Davis (like Peggy Pepper) and William Hines (like Billy Boone). The introduction to Ms. Davis from the film was "clip"; She will reduce a scarf to express different emotions. My acquaintance with Mr. Hines is currently on the watch; However, I could see him in a less memorable role. Hines makes a stunning impression when he joins Davis for a commissioning meal - for some to skip his hat into the ring with some amazing bits at the dining table. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Dell's driving into Hollywood, with Dell Henderson (Colonel Pepper), some of her tinseltown's newest buzz. In fact, Davis and the already-arrived Hines become comedians. But Davis became a real drama queen. Davis left Hines, and was associated with an active dramatic Paul Rally. But, viewers love Davis in more comical roles; Perhaps the director is offering a case for life imitating King Vidor art? <br /> <br /> Complete Hollywood location footage on the set, and off. Full of great "comos"; At a studio dining room, in the table of strolls, Davis ran between Douglas Fairbanks and William S. Hart. However, the best "bit" athlete, Charlie Chaplin, has enough nerve to ask David for her autograph! While guest appearances are fun, they and episodic sequences, "Show Show People" become less important in an important film and an important historical document. <br /> ******** Show People (11/11/28) King Vidor ~ Mario Davis, William Hines, Dell Henderson
