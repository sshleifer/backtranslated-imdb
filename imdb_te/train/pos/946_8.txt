When Christmas is celebrated for years, while focusing on religious or secular traditions, time to think people are doing better. Do not leave Christmas, because the scout feels the whole thing. Humbug is there. <br /> As Charles Dickens says with this story, for the 20th Century counterpart, Mr. Potter of Bedford Falls, New York, redemption is not too late for us and a lonely ghost and three souls visit Scrooge and how to show him . <br /> <br /> Christmas Carol is a timeless holiday classic, the social commentary of 19th century Great Britain as Oliver Twist. The characters in this film are between the middle and the lower class. There are cratchits rings on street people in Acreber Twist, but they are struggling to stay there. Still do not thank the Guy Bob Cratchit works for their home radiation, love and pleasure. <br /> <br /> George Bailley made a decent sum of his life and Ebenezer Schaugge waited to have some good work on this subject. <br /> <br /> Patrick Stewart took his live performances and dramatic play into the most beautiful Scrooge episode. But in this film George C. Scott is pretty cool. His durability, but with a trace of sadness that will root us to change him. <br /> <br /> A supporting role is the best tradition of people like Revinhald Owen and Alastair Sim, who made Scotts remarkable remarks. <br /> <br /> In supporting roles I was particularly heartfelt and charming spirit of Christmas as David Warner Bob Crocht and Edward Woodward. <br /> According to IMDb this is one of the 32 versions of the Christmas article, and they are archived.
