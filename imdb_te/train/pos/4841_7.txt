In the colonies we were not familiar with Arthur Oscie, so I left the film (recently the TCM preview came up recently) because of the negative comments that I found in "Ghost Train". Completely annoying. I was surprised to hear that I could hear it instead. He suggests what you think if his baby Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen have a baby while distributing physical aspects of Aski's comedy and a time. Bad Abbott or the other general motivations of the humorous relief in the movies of this genre is not comparable to him. After 30 years, the thread that connects the Aki to British comedy is also felt. At least one opinion is evident from the American viewpoint, where he is more compared to what Monty Python's group is more than his. For the rest of the pictures - the more movies you've seen, the more likely you will be expected at the end, but it is still very entertaining and worth waiting for the weather and its next show.
