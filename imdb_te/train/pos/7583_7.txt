The last chapter in the razor triangle in Hanjo closes enough for this entertaining series samuraisploitation. Yuyuu replaced Yuzuuz Masumura (Blind Beast, Red Angel, Magi) in the director's chair, but with the title of the Shinto Cottu, the style is pretty good along with Anthoeiro. <br /> <br /> <br />> Hanja, guarding the treasure hidden under the lake, tells a female ghost. Hanzano was a Hanz≈ç, she was not a ghost, so he was raping ... Ahmad uses a revolving net device now known to him. This plot will also be taken by creditors, corrupt officials, sponsored wives and dual sannyas like hack and slash. Huizo's top executive, Oniishi and his two servants, provided general comic notes, and generally, it was common. <br /> This is a lot less, and a bit of a mess), less than a second, dramatic and bloody (the best in the Hanzo series), but still entertaining and valuable on its own benefits. Trade mark training is full of scenes, call for prosecution of rape, knife and a mysterious Hanzano, which ultimately caters to the fans.
