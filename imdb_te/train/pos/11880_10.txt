<br /> <br /> It has been criticized as being too strong, useless, over-the-top and all slow. These persons are people who compare to Scarface for The Godfather films. <br /> <br /> The technological front (cinematography, screenplay, direction etc.) is behind Scarfs' The Godfather. <br /> <br /> The absence of Scarface and other gangster films, the worst, the cleanest approach of gangsters. Latino gangsters in this film are much menacing and actually look more polished Italian or Irish gangsters from other gangster classics such as 'Godfather' or 'Goodfellas'. It is one of the main winners of this scarf and I am convinced that many critics have written this fact "tackiness"! I've seen the original 1932 scarf, and I must say that both these films are different from each other and can be seen in two different films instead of originally appreciating over the "remake"! <br /> <br /> Al Pacino made over the top and loud criticism in the film. But that's how the decisive film-makers wanted the role of Tony Montana! This angry young man makes decisions right away and throws every moment of irritation! He is not calm here by Michael Corleone. He is a very tacky, uneducated guy in Tony Montana, does not really think too much and gets angry all the time! <br /> <br /> Many 80s are expected for this film. Soundtrack is all 80! <br /> <br /> I love some of the songs including 'Zina and Elvira's theme', 'Tap it to the limit' and the title track instruments. <br /> <br /> About scenes: Al Pacino is angry with Cuban refugee as a refugee. He notes that Tony Montana is playing most of her entire career. It really looks like he enjoyed it in his scenes! A miracle on how to be without "scarfs" casino. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <br /> <br /> There is some eye candy featuring Michael Feifer in the form of Elvara. <br /> <br /> The director goes to the overboard in a particular part of the climax. Without revealing anything, I would say that it is the least part of my life that I did not manage properly. <br /> <br /> "Scarface" is one of the most entertaining and best ever gangster films ever. Out. Enjoy what it is: Drug Lords and their gangland's raw role!
