I'm always looking for something new and unique, I watched this movie online. I thought it would be another "B" rate, but I was surprised by the two main characters. All the actors in the film are very capable and well directed. <br /> <br /> The movie is not for those who are looking for sex rump, dumb and dumbbell, blood and guts. It is a tremendously sharp picture showing the heart of the heart as some of the most terrible facts of life and to make it interesting enough to keep interesting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <p>
