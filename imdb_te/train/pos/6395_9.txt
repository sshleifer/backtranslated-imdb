For me, this is one of the best films I have ever seen. By biting through life, he is not just a simple "cookie", Carl Braischer is a wonderful character to play, he keeps Cuban in his best light, best acting in his life. Nirvana who is a living legend gives something to the film. He portrayed his role in the film, but he gave a good performance to the film, performing great performances and beautiful Charlize's performance and always a big plus for each film. If you do not see this movie, I highly recommend to those who love the courage, the great desire to seek inspiration. You have to see this great play. My vote is 9/10.
