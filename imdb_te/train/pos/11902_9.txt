These pictures describe the life and times of William Castle. He built low budget horror films in the 1950s and 1960s, and he sold it with Gimmicks. In "13 Ghosts" you need to see the audience and the demons (they are in color, the image is in B & W). "The Tingler" had a bazaar theater seats while a monster prompted the audience to escape in a movie theater. If they were afraid of death, "Mabre" released a lifetime insurance policy for all members! The movies were very bad, but people were rushing to see the pair. The film also includes interviews with his films and his daughter's castles, inspired by actors. It gets him the type of his own life and person (he's a great person through all accounts). The documentary is affectionate, very funny and strictly inspired. It's too short (less than 90 minutes) and is not desperate. Must watch for a castle fans and horror movie fans. My complaint - There are very few scenes from his films. It's great beside it.
