It is low on low budget movie and location shoots with an unknown cast. The Philippines is a substitute for Thailand and no one actually goes to Hong Kong. A cottage at the old airport makes the perfect shot of Pacific Jumbo Jetland's stock shot. This movie does not require you to have mega budgets or star. This does not include gaffes or anomalies that are often flawed by young artists. Awareness of all aspects of film making and solid work from people who understand compromises between art and box office. Excellent part of work!
