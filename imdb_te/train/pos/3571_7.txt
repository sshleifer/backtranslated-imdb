I saw this movie twice with my teenagers who love me. This should be a cult fave! The best way is, "Your dress is great!" Prince Cinderella says. Kathleen Turner shines as step mother. I also like cars and motorcycles for a long time of 1950's. Great departure from the distinctive prince typical swashbuckler. He tries to stay cool, but fails to hide his love for fairy tales. She is not a slipper glass (true to the original story), but Cinderella will return from the heir to the throne. My only complaint is that it will not be shown further and is almost impossible to get. Hopefully a blockbuster or Amazon will soon start storing this one.
