This film is not your typical horror film. It's funny with some campy humor and death scenes. I personally did not like this movie because of its off beat humor. If you do not like to be scary and suspicious it's not a good super scary image. I liked the performance of Hillbilly man and Lester's ... very believable. I think I'm going to reddish my hair like that girl in Scarecrow- looks great! However, the overall value of renting for campy humor and general horror experience.
