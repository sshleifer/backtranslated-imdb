<br /> <br /> The film has a brutal confusion between the life dedicated to God and the faith and the pleasures of life on earth. <br /> <br /> Even in postwar France, it is also about the mortality of faith. <br /> It may not be the image of life, but it is a sin that allows it to fall into oblivion. Besides, Pierre Freshene is amazing.
