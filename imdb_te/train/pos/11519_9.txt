The only reason I did not give this 10 stars is the DVD format - no menus, additions, etc. However, if you have a dream to do something in your life, this picture is for you. If you believe in yourself and do not let your dream stop anyone or anything. This is one of the most worldly films I have ever seen. And magic. Acting is awesome, useful for the plot purpose, and the starting range is amazing. This is one of the films that tell about the "cult" status. This film is recommended for all my friends. Some love it, some will not be complete. I thought about the role of Alan Arkin in this movie, or I feel like it. He wants to do more movies.
