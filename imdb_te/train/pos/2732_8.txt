Herbert Clutter, wife Bonnie and their teenage boys Kenyon and Nancy have liked and respected their small town in Holcomb, Kansas - but fourteen brutal murders were killed during the early hours of 14 November 1959. Suddenly, suspiciously, the offense brought an opinion on the author Truman Capote, who moved to the scene and followed the case to the conclusion. As a result, the Cold Blood book was available. Controversial, shocking, and exceptionally well written, becoming international best seller and remains a touchstone to criminologists until today. <br /> <br /> The 1967 film version of Capote was also a book. The real-life locations have been filmed in black and white films, with little documentary quality, ice and separated - and the whole cast is unusual. This is an image of Robert Blake's reputation as an actor, and as appropriate. Like Killer Perry Smith, Blake traps you a deep distaste and unexpected sympathetic shock; It's a wonderful show from start to finish. Richard Hickeyeck, Scott Wilson is not cheap. <br /> <br /> Like the Capote book, the film goes to Kansas with Smith and Hiccock and returns home in a haphazard manner. In the course of their arrest and conviction as a result of the investigation is detailed in detail. The central part of the film has always seen what happened in the clutter's house; <br /> <br /> Director and writer Richard Brooks guides the film with a very powerful concept, allowing the picture to become a little bit preachy. However, depending on the overall power of the film, it becomes smaller and angry. Strong elements - and recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon reviewer
