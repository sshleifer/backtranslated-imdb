I flew through the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica, which has always been anticipated and brought to tears in more than one occasion. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> I had a sickly feeling in my gut a few months ago in the prequel series. I was scared that Battlestar's success as a successful successor would be reused in Capricorn, which would not work. The BSG story is gripped by a deadly band's extinction star cruise ships and guided by a series of prophetic vision and fake-wonders, totally congratulated by a cast of unusual music and actors. Capricorn feels different. BSG takes place after a great civilization collapses, Capriia portrays civilization in a cold and decadent civilization. The whole Vibe Minor report from Capricia is similar to minus-overly and negative theatricality. In the true BSG form, Capricorn has already solved the religious freedom, racism, the morality of the play of God and the nature of the human soul in its first few hours. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Each character is unique and distant, from an industrialist who became an obsessive and long-distance scientist, for his troublesome and fearless daughter, each actor and actress throws themselves into their roles. <br /> <br /> The power of the BSG also plays a major role in the campaign. Battlestar's powerful rolling drums and tragic doodaks have led its themes well. Caprica uses more orchestral sound, which is quite different from performances to the performances. <br /> <br /> New Capricorn is absolutely necessary for personal appearance, only from the Battlestar franchise. I'm looking forward to the full series.
