Masuuku Suyo is in the role of this good movie. After a good "Fancy Dance" and classic (in Japan, anyway) college sumo comedy "Shiko Funds", Suo succeeded with his own major footsteps success. <br /> <br /> The story is engaged. We laughed twice (nyato tecakaka hilarious because he was in two films of Suyo) and was really the source of the characters. In real life in Japan - but for me a big bonus this film gives the viewer in Japanese society. There is a leader to show real life activities with the suo-comedy skill. The result is a picture that you pull, you laugh, you think, and entertain two and give insight into today's Japan. <br /> <br /> Also look for the main 8 actors from Shiko Funjatta, who appear again from all the characters (taccacca) to different roles (for many).
