Very happy little image and just for kids. John Thawe is always wise (without any indication of Inspector Morse about him) is very clever. In every scene I could not persuade him, although William played a good job playing with William. I loved the feel of small villages and the slow feel of life in that period. I also thought of scenes from London, historically accurate, and London. <br /> I reminded me about a Scandinavian film called "Mother's Mother" two years ago. The film moved from Finland to Sweden during WW II. When asked a girl, his wife asked his wife, because she lost her daughter. Instead the boy gets it and she completely ignores him. The fact that the boy speaks makes the Finnish stuff more complicated. I recommend this film to anyone who has enjoyed Good Friday Mr. Tom, which has the same opinion.
