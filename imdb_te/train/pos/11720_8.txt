I do not expect much to be honest, I did not like this movie for the first time, but I found it again and realized that it was great. Sure, it's a joke movie but it's a funny gag. <br /> It may be good writing, it may be. I think the film is over the top of my cousin. But with an attorney instead of a horror host. Sadly it is a waste of opportunity. With a little writing it can be a classic. There is no reason why children go to Elvira. Clear reasons. Their relationship is great. It's a comedy, but it's a small disagreement that distinguishes between good and intelligent images. <br /> <br /> Elvara is always fun and engaging. Not to mention Flirty. Every time she smiles you will be very much. It is difficult to knock a picture when the main character is very lovely. And it really does not let her charm herself, she thinks that she is some sort of tart. She is well. But she's fine. That's the kind of person you care about your children. <br /> <br /> If you do not know what you want, you can not do it yourself <br /> <br /> "She is also a wonderful couple of legs.
