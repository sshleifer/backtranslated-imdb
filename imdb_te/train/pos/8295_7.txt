Robert Uriach is a good actor, and he makes this TV movie reliable. I remember seeing this film at the age of 15, and the second time I saw my opinion as well. In a computer rich California town, they lose when they enter this particular club. Urich try to figure out what's wrong with his family, and I thought of Halloween space suit, intelligent love. This film is about Sprite's War. TV quality, it's big budget, the Gangs of New York. Robert Uriach is a compassionate man who has played the most role in his film? I hope! 6 out of 10 or 7.
