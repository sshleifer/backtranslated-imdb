I started watching the TV series "What I Like about You" and I have a pleasure to see. I'd always like to see new shows go considering a lot of shows before you really get a feel for them. I've seen Amanda Bains since it's really a funny girl, what's best about her comedy is its natural and I mean that it's a good friend of a guy who tells her a good friend here <br /> I recently started watching the show and fell in love. I'm looking back now but looking forward to the next season. All the characters in this program give something to the whole story. "90210", from Leslie Grossman and "City Guys" from "Popular" It's great to see some old face from other programs I've spent in the past like Jenny Garth from Wesley Jonathan. The new character is very talented, Nick Jano has that appeal, and he loves him even when he loves you (bines). <br /> <br /> Overall, there are the right ingredients for this program to succeed, I'm looking forward to seeing growing.
