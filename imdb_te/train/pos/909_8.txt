I liked these movies. Another Yash Raj movie movie that you know is good on the screen, all the characters are always good or lovely, with an exception you know to be good at last ... Another rule of Yash Raj movie is hero or heroine; s only one or any other parent. Think about all of those movies .. MPK Suman does not have a mother, HMAPK Salman has parents and 90% chance that you see Alok Nath crying ... <br /> <br /> The movie looks good. First it's a little slow but keeps you entertained. There is almost no comedy but do you smile more often? The little kid (nephew of the hero) is well placed and distributed very good liners. The actress is very beautiful but you can not get in real life. The big family that lives in the big house is not in a big family, and I allow a good idea and film to be distinguished from other films. At the end of the cinema there are many women crying. There is not a strong message from this movie but its good watch. If you're married (set up marriage) this film will remind you of what you did. You can tell and be afraid if you can not ... <br /> <br /> A good looking picture overall. Large plot or turns but very soft image, like most Bollywood classic.
