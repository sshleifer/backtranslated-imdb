Well, well .... The rogue touches a nerve bit there, is not he? He is a genius when he has a list of his various characters descents for decades, but as soon as he has a redistribution (or some good advice), the evil old Catholic church may have been seen as a hipster-than-your-alternate film viewers will get additional murderers. Worse yet, the character of Teresa Russell - the spiritual - there is an explanation that her outwardly rationalist outlook experiences nothing but reluctantly going to face those experiences at another level. You know, the realm of intellect and superstition, on art-home cinemafills. Reiterated by what seems like uncomfortable divine intervention - thought it might be a particularly important commitment - oh, horror ... So she finds her marriage. People who find this idea could probably ask themselves why the first opinion is dangerous why they naturally jump into the attack mode at being challenged to take the thought of a spiritual dimension of their lives seriously. But they probably are not. Certainly, the film has some problems, especially the talent of Talia Shir's enthusiastic nun, 1950s-style costume and all. And the conversation between Mary Davenport in their late sequence and the young priest straight out of the Glib Interpotation of Spell School (Hitchcock's image is due to the fact that the pragmatic rhetoric escaped the rigorous secular credentials of Freudian psychology). But, sadly, Nicolas Rogge will also be copied a complex mauling asking the question for the possible answers offered by this film.
