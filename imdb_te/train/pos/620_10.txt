Stardust's beautiful story is written by Neil Gaiman (author of Mirror Mask) and this is really a good story. I think any labyrinth, Princess Bride or 10th Kingdom fan will appeal and yet it is totally unique and stands on it's own. The film adaptation of this story is much better than I've submitted in Neil Gaiman's original novel. <br /> <br /> The main character, Tristan (Triston in the novel), is a witch of a witch and a witch of the fairy goddess. The story begins a town near a wall that separates the magical world from the human world. Falling Star Tristan promises to return it for a girl. He does not know that he has taken the form of a girl in the fairy world and that there are others later. <br /> This is a very good story. It has humor and magic and beautiful, surreal scenes and visuals. It's beautiful and I feel I can see kids and growns of all ages. It's magic. It's a true classic fairy tale, which I have never seen in the 1980s since the movie.
