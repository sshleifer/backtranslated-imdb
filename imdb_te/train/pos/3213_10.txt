What does Kurt Russell (Sargent Todd) mean to have only 72 lines, and 104 words? What a challenge! Like a black and white photo, your mind's eye can have all the combinations to make the tops, facial expressions, physical play, emotional gestures, full effect. This is one of the top 5 films I can not live without the classics like this road warrior. If you like it, "Mad Max 2, The Road Warrior" and "Braveheart" are both Mel Gibson. Even in Soldier "Gladiator" with Russell Crowe and Connelly Nielsen. "Thirteenth Warrior" starring Harrison Ford starring Antonio Banderas and "Blade Runner".
