A great 90s film! Parker's Posey Manhattan nightlife is very exciting in this story. Posy gives an excellent performance as a librarian and one night crawler. It's a good, light picture on Saturday night before you go. The soundtrack racks and outfits are in this world, the script is funny and the actors make a great job. Deliverance value: If you try this world you can, just find your niche. I believe that Parker Posey is a perfect performer for this kind of role: the youth is amazing and broke. (You should see the movie "Clockwatchers"). If you look at a party girl you have a good time. Have fun!
