Jörg Buttegririt has gone a long way for my taste with his movies and themes but his films are always unique and hard to classify. Artistic designs are often deeply understood by its themes. This film is a good example of his work. <br /> <br /> This image is also very difficult to label. It is not a movie with a hero, it's a beginning, in the middle and in the end. This is not even a major role, but it focuses on 7 different suicides and murders in 7 different days. <br /> Some of them are different stories, others are 'interesting' and realistic than others. They are not necessarily connected, but still together they tell a story. The film does not feel confusing at all. All different stories have a different feel to it and Buttrett tells stories of what the words are (but also typical to his style), but instead let's reveal the clear images and clear emotional emotions of the whole story. <br /> Again, the product values ​​are not very high, and this may be something that can be frightening some people. <br /> <br /> This film helps to set the whole tone and the proper tone and atmosphere for its dark, disturbing and dull backgrounds. <br /> <br /> I saw 'Butterfly Movie' 7/10
