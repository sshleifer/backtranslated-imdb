I thought this was a continuation of the original "36th Chamber of Shaolin", but in reality it was as easy as "sister". Gordon Liu still appears as a hero in a quest to learn Kung Fu to defeat the troublemaking Manchu ... but it is light and funny at this time. The film is centered around a local color mill, where wages are deducted by the appointment of 10 new Manchurian officials. Liu plays the role of "Chao", who thinks the owner of the mill as the Shaolin monk who specializes in the magic kung fu. But his luck runs out, he gets fraudulent, giving Mil laborers the promise that he will go back to the Shaolin Ashram to learn kung fu and save them. <br /> <br /> The comedy really begins in the ashram to accept Chao's many convincing endeavors. This sets our really funny moments, and lots of great fighting choreography. Continuing in the "36th Chamber" tradition, we see all kinds of well and interesting (and hugely) training techniques in the mutt and wooden tops as creative weapons as creative weapons. A mixture of kung fu and a craft of bamboo scaffolding building. Chao Shaolin was not accepted as a student but was designed to build a bamboo scaffolding for the "ten years renewal" of the monastery. In the DVD I was a specialty in the bamboo scaffolding building and inspired the director La Car-league attracted it. It's a hundred years old (probably tens of thousands), and scaffolding in Hong Kong is still built with a large-scale bamboo, Western countries specifically use steel pipes and tables. As a result of his scaffolding work, Chao has developed a unique style of kung fu ... When asked which kind of he is, he's ridiculously "Paranja Kung Fu!" He first experimented with dusting with Monastery's Abot. The final battle with Manchu includes creative uses for bamboo poles and relationships. <br /> <br /> In the comedy perspective, I think it's best in the Kung Fu style. A kung fu movie is usually, it stands out ... I recommend it to anyone!
