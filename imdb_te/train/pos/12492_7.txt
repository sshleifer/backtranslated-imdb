After their daughter's brutal murder, Julie and Allen flee to the city to be alone and grieving in a lonely room on a distant hill. Allen's intentions are good, and his wife wants to get out of his wife by re-opening his photography. Look at the perfect creepy and deteriorating arrangement for the ancient prison and her photography. But when the photos are developed, they finish the dead and Alan quickly finds the tragic history of suicide in their new mountain. "Dark Remains" is a beautiful good indie horror flick. It offers some genuine fears and plenty of tension. Acting is good and cinematography is great.
