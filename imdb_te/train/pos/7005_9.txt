When its DVD was released, I came into the market and bought it. And I guess my money is in the right way to guess before buying. What I can say for Will Smith is a magnificent movie, as he has always been a wonderful actor like whether films are films or serious. Always give a record breaking performance. When I saw this film after August rush, it looked a guy. The director explained the story is really awesome. In his previous life and film, his new life was clearly elucidated to the audience. I found something wrong in the story or that they could shoot. I think its DVD must have a home because it's really a nice thing for your collection. Pop-Cornes is not an image for happiness, it's a lesson to be able to learn audiences. Now you can see what the text you see. If there are any criticisms about this movie, the film critics will watch this movie.
