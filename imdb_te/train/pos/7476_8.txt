I can say I really felt the picture in its right essence where the dream games from entering into the future surreal aspect of the mind games Tom Cruise faced. I do not think much about Tom Cruise's acting prowess but it seems to be impressive in every point in the film ... even because he has contributed to his self-important role rather than a stimulating storyline .. They merge and speak then and its beautiful. But if I do not get this film "random weekend", you'll pick it up randomly and be happy; It has strong moods and syllables, so do not wash the bottom part with your beer and pop-corns. It definitely needs more than that.
