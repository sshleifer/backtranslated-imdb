I had never heard of this film a few weeks ago, but when I heard it was of interest to me: an American man met a European woman in Europe last night and spent the night together to talk. It raised my interest, but I guess that this is never great. Before sunrise became a masterpiece, it was one of the most romantic movies on record. To my surprise, it was totally lost in the 1990s. There is no real plot to talk about, it's impossible to talk much about it (although there are plenty of interesting things you can talk about, my dinner with Andre, there's a conversation, but it's not just a conversation), but tell me what to say. Look at it!
