I caught this film in IFC and I enjoyed it, but it would be deliberate, even if the editing job was a little bit tough. I got a little bit of hard time figuring out what was happening at first because I seemed to be going for a little bit of a pulp fiction-style but linear plot performance. It seemed a little forced, though. I think that is definitely worth watching the movie, but I think I could have used a little clean up. Some scenes do not make sense after others. <br /> <br /> I was surprised by the ratings here. It's not the best, but it's not really serious. I gave 7/10. At least this film showed that Laurence Fishburn could act as he wanted. They did not mention him in the Matrix films.
