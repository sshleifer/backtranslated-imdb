This film probably did not see it in 35 years, so when I noticed that I was back in television (cable is not available in the video) for a long time, I made sure I did not miss it. Unlike many other images that seem to have lost their glitter when they finally saw it again, I found clear images from "Marines Pride" that I was apparently evident and efficiently discovered. <br /> <br /> Is this image so special? Based on the original story of al-Schmid and his fellow Marine Machine gun personnel in Guadalcanal in the Battle of Teneru in November 1942, the film's 95% truth is enough to counter the time limit of the motion picture by "All Schmidt, Marine" Roger Butterfield. This is not a "war film" of the action center, in fact the film is 10 minutes or less in the middle of the film. But a memorable 10 minutes shot in as little light as possible to portray a night war, and mock heroics or dysfunction usually affect the genre. Perhaps before its time, its natural drama about what happened has audiences attracting the war in a vague, bizarre, ruthless manner, and seeing the war correctly. The film is not "glorifying" the war; I can not imagine anyone looking at that scene and want to join the service. <br /> <br /> The film is really a concern that after the war, and how damaged men learn to recreate their lives. A dozen people have a wonderful hospital scene that discusses this issue, and I think it's another reason why this film has gained - it's exceptionally well written. There is a "Dream" sequence in the inverse (negative movie) that is almost as experimental, and acting is strong and is headed by John Garfield. Garfield was perfect for the role as his natural nature and Schmidz were almost the same, and met Garfield Schmidt and stayed with him for a while to learn much about man and his character. Cast can never be made, but added to the equation, another reason for the film's success in telling the story of such a difficult and unattractive story.
