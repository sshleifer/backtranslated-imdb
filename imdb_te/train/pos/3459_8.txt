In addition to Patrick McGohan and Robert Kulp, Jack Cassidy is an outstanding Colombo villain. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy Ken Franklin, plays a half-role of a murder mystery writing, based on two independent pilots, Colombo's first "correct" episode. . His partner Jim is talented, but Ken does not have the gift to reward the prize rather than a gift. As soon as Jim decides he does not need Ken's marketing skills, Ken sticks a story to kill Jim. Unless it is a new plot, the fact is that their murder is intended for one of their books in the real life of the heroine. <br /> Ken killer, but unfortunately another murder (ken romance and then kicking a key witness) has enough evidence to get a confidence in Colombo. <br /> <br /> "Murder by the Book" is wrong with anything but it is not the top line. I would say "publish or perish" on this edge: the two parts are Jack Cassidy and Publishing World, but "Publish or Lose" is a bit more time and unpredictable. But this is still a great part.
