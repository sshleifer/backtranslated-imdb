The newly released computer will go any day without an animated film, so now there are opportunities to see a little better effects. <br /> <br /> When I saw the Ice Age, I thought it would not have been a big influence on some of these genres of this genre. <br /> Now I'm Big Guy, the kids are much more enjoyable (probably up to 14). The story is very simple, and "actors" are funny in a beautiful way, without any raw or complicated humor. Even the "bad" is lovely, lush big cat with funny teeth. And the story is a happy ending which is a little disappointing for me (the main characters are doomed to devastation in a very tragic way) but it's great for children. <br /> <br /> Someone can not die unless a few cartoons (even when he is sleeping through a mammoth), which has the concept of cartoony. <br /> <br /> Computer animation component is nice, really nice cartooning scenes, when you feel like a nice painting or a nice painting of a comics. <br /> <br /> There are a few dresses that I have smile - I agree, the creators have tried to satisfy the elderly - but they are very difficult to detect (my opinion) <br /> <br /> That is a good movie, The ideal world, and the mush-to-animals-for children-is in Disney Clich√©. If you do not hate cute animals that make funny things, look at them at least once.
