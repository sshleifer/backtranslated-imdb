<br /> It is officially Disney's first animated science fiction adventure. <br /> I'm pretty awesome, I'm not exactly sure how accurate it is (i want to be stupid). <br /> <br /> It is apparently SO badly told Disney, "Screw, Let's Re-release" Spy Kids ". <br /> <br /> <br /> "Music and predominant special effects," Atlantis "will go out. It is a throwback to all CGI eye-candy shots in "Beauty and the Beast" and "Aladdin", which is almost the effects of the animator's best-performance. The characters are probably not that memorable (perhaps, for the ship's medical officer), and the plot is a little dull, but this is not a movie you're looking for in the plot. I disagree. The film's "failure" ("only" is five hundred million or more, compared to the fifteen bucks of the movie I know animators) compared to the popularity of "Shrek" and "Monsters Inc." Traditional animation is evidence of death. I do not think it's true. How do you make for "South Park" film? What about "Final Fantasy"? Actually, the story and the artistry are not everything, method. I do not know what Disney's comeback film is, but I do not think I'm still in the movie.
