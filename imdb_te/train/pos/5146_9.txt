I came from a special place as a German mother and an English father (who spent five years as a prisoner in the war camp). One of the family is one of the various Nazis and the other winners of WW2. These trivialities can not get a deeper understanding of each part of the mind of Hitler, and at that time the viewer should give a simple flavor and can once get the status of Hitler's mind. This is very well done in the series. Carllele, like a 'tool, is good, but I think that the party has got more information on relationships with others because Hitler did nothing to do anything. People who are around him kill him often without question and are absolutely in question of his murder. What happened to Goebbels, GÃ¶ring and Hess's mind? It was useful to learn more about these relationships. But I hope people will do more research. People can also understand why such people as Saddam Hussein are not allowed to come to power.
