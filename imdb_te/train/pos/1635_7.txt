In my high school days in Salina Kansas, they were locally named "The Brave Young Men of Weinberg" and film crews are popular for week. Finally, we learned that the movie was "up academy", and we bit ummm, "less brow" than we led to believe. <br /> I'm there, and the local audience seemed to be less than happy at the show. I am 17 years old, I thought it was an unrealistic effort rather than posting in a humorous comedy "Animal House" type. <br /> It has long been seen, and my opinion is a little bit slow. It's dumb, but sometimes it's a bit of "mad" magazine humor, as well as at least "Mad TV". Ron Lyman hates it, but he is almost perfect and unforgettable. To me, my favorite moment was a short sight on Santa Fe Avenue, where I retained my car and I bought some guitar strings. Pinto's brief presentation is very bad, usually cut for the TV. The new DVD did not see, but if my old pint appears, they got on sale.
