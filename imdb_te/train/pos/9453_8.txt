The fascinating, chasing and sometimes disturbing story by James Dickey was a fantastic film by John Bourman. It is run by four businessmen, men and Mao-bearers, who spend a weekend boat ride in the mountains. There, they're faced with every dark side of man's every human side and human tedious ... poverty, buggery and physical bullying too! These four are intended to travel to the river for expedition and excitement, but their yatra will soon move into Odyssey through a violent and lush mountain-landscape, completely separated from all civilizations. These items are actually one of the most nightmare movies I've ever seen. About everything that happens to these men, you will never have to remain in this situation. Pure spoken film, Deliverance is a very important film. John Boorman's finest (close to Jardo≈æ and Xlalber) - and still - is a very powerful movie and has many memorable scenes already appearing in many movies. Just the wonderful "dude banjos" musical score and, of course, to think about the unforgettable homosexual "rape" rape scenery as a pig. All actors (haha) provide perfect acting performances. Especially the zone otlite. Watch a movie!
