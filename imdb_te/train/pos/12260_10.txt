It has a wonderful start to Mickey Rooney's film career. Here his long-term life will come to him. The car and truck chase is exciting for the 1937 period. Andy Hardy series is an American treasure in my book this beginning. Spring Bytton Performance is as amazing as usual. Please, Mr. Rooney or movie rights owners, take the opportunity and produce it on DVD. I feel like a winner.
