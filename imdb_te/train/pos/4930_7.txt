"The fear in the Streets" is a good thriller, but I felt a bit disappointed by it. The city's main theme, which affects a city in modern times, is lovely, but the film does not really explore or develop. Its well-made and entertaining, but it's not as interesting as it should have been. The screenplay is really weak for the film and the whole movie comes down. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the film is so strong that it replaces weak scripting. Directed by Elia Kazan will make the film moving in a thrilling and lightning speed. There are some distinct scenes, particularly memorable chase climax. After several years of his directing with a better screenplay, the man did not make much mistakes. <br /> Acting is very good. Richard Widmark is always a watchable figure and he is able to do an underwriter role. Paul Douglass spends his time a bit of bit time but does a good job. Two villains of stamps in cast. Zeoro Montel is mainly known for his comic roles, one of the film's ultimate actresses slimy effectively. Jack Fountain is exceptionally, chilling villain. "The fear in the Streets" is disappointing but still worth watching. (7/10)
