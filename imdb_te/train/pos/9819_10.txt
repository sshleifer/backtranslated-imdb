This is a great film from the lost age of reaction to television drama. My all-time favorite actor, Robert Kalp is a plaque plot by skillfully encompassing the system with high level verification and confidence, orthodox conservation and criminal fear, and homicide mentality. Teens are a collection of pure sneering bad stereotypes, and the end of this image makes it comparable to the parts of the dragnet. But it really gains the great pace of the film, the fear of degrees and the construction of the mental disorder, as well as the whole California setting feel. The cars I remember are really good. I'll give a 10 to this film, and listen to every movie and enjoy it every minute. Remember, it's not a great art because it's designed for television.
