Like the Arabian Knights, the film plays with conventions, plot, plot and more plots: it opens a blind man's frame tool that tells the story of his life, and then bookmark us now, and we found that it's about half of the story. (It should be admitted that the second half did not live until the first promise.) Like most Arabian folklore, many Middle Eastern folk tales are a work. A free princess, a beautiful princess, a flying carpet, wonderful mechanical toys, sea rides, crowded markets, a bad vizier, jewelry ... Why not do it all, but it does. Everything is just beautiful. The sets are beautiful. June duprez is beautiful. The Rossa score is especially beautiful. As always, it feels like Hungary; But he does somehow convince us that he is a Hungarian language in Persian.
