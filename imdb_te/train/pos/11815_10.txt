When I was writing this article I saw from 15,000 votes and it has a 5.8 rating. Something is wrong with that picture. Personally I give it to 10. If I guess it's true for people who see this movie, it can be seen at a very low or a possible 8. It is a movie based on the comic book hero. The film won more than its awards. 3 Oscar wins. Another 5 wins & 26 nominations .... right tells me it's better than a 5.8. Some good actors, some great special effects, and in my opinion, come from some good acting, though not classics already in the coming years. Check the dick trick if you are looking for pure entertainment. Definitely a picture you can see more than a few times. Al Pacino is the Big Boy Caprais.
