D.C. Sunny and cocktail waitress in the area put a little bit. She runs an old clunker and rents a small room from a couple of gay men. Nevertheless, she maintains an important Arab's life, which takes a bullet that is intended for the officer. National press charm with her polite comments and her sweet looks. Drowning, U.S. She was founded by her presidential assistants in the Protocol Division of the Government. However, she is sometimes skeptical at times, but she tries hard and learns a lot. She attracts the romance of a State Department officer. But is there another evil plot for an Arab man willing to take another wife? Is a blonde one? LOL, LOL, LOL. The film tells Goldie that it is a pretty movie and dumb "like a fox", as they say. Sunny finds his way very well around the forest of the US government. There are also important things to say about her honesty and lack of her protocol surroundings. Perhaps, the Arab community is less than thrilled with this work, but for those who like to laugh, rent this day.
