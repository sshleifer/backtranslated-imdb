This film is what I wanted to call them and they wanted to enjoy it. It's very funny. Angelina Jolie is amazing as Juliet. Parents are happy. They are caterers and enemies. Kids play in parts of Romeo and Juliet. They fall in love and their parents try to keep them separate. After a party and do it. Surprisingly they still want to get married at the end of the movie. If you do not like stereotypes and do not see the defilement of standard literature. If you do not mind them, you will see it and explode.
