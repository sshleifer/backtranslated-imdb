Earth (2009) *** 1/2 The Big Screen Introduction of the BBC / Discovery Channel series "Planet Earth" offers the most attractive design of nature, some really jaw-falling moments of "This Footage ?!" of the animal's awesome scene of life It is cruel in the environmental messages of the ecological narrative (a great white shark like a quick meal Water cavity seal) and adorable (different children and their rentals). The vague tones of the foundation of James Earl Jones strengthen its 'eyes of God's eyes' and deepness. Visually removed from the footage of hundreds of hours, it should have been in IMMAX format and long lasting. Oh, well, the next time (Disney Studios produced this number in the next row). Durse: Alastair Fothergill & Mark Linfield.
