I do not really know what I will see to see this film. I guess it is better not to do what I do between class. However, once the TV movie attracted my interest. More importantly, Helen Hunt caught my eye. I was not really her big fan of this movie before. I really liked Twister and As good as it gets. But, it really made me feel about this film. I see it as a big fan now. I get high marks from this film ... me. Give this a chance, it does not allow you.
