The movie will attract you and hook your eyes on the screen. The author / director uses narrative parts and creatively and interesting camera angles and all the perspectives you have to hold on to everything. Insomach's Nightmare is original and refreshingly different from other pictures you've seen. Is this a dream or reality? This indie discusses twists and takes it through conscious and subconscious. It has a lot of sense with the dark explanations of illusions. Dominic Monaghan was really insomniac. He is a great actor who is not hard on either eyes! He really plays his whole role. My favorite this indie makes it shot from the storyline. I highly recommend it and eagerly wait to see more from this innovative, creative writer / director / cinematographer!
