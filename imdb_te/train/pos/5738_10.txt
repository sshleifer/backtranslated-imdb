I bought this DVD's DVD. DVD transfer last year, since 2001. This 1988 movie is really a great little film. Many people ignore it. I saw in the theater in 1988 and since then I loved it. I like Pittsburgh's opening shot (not as Baltimore as another user commented). Pittsburgh is one of the most picturesque cities in the world! And I must say, Pitts tour on the garbage truck with Nicky is one of the most scenic and interesting! Tom Hawls, as he tells everyone, is a magnificent and awesome actress. The DVD is a good transfer, no extra, but a widescreen format. I would recommend those who love the film.
