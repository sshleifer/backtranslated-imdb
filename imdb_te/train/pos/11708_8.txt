That's why people say that this movie is scared because it is !! That is what some viewers see. I first saw this movie and it made me frightened and thought about life and religion. This is not a bloody and gore horror movie, but you feel that you have the possibility for things that happen as the film is written. Of course non-believer will say its only science fiction film. Truth, it should be for a thriller collection, although it has a religious view. If you're a fan of classic thrillers (Omen..etc) this is one of them and should have it. I have never seen a sequel (long distant thunder), but I believe this movie will end.
