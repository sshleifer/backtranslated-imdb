I agree, for the first time I also saw cowgirls blues, I did not think it was any more memorable. But now that I have seen 7th time, I agree that it has grown to me. Sissy characters, Ms. JellyBean, and Countess became very fascinating. And romance between Sissy and JellyBank is very sweet. Though the plot is very weak, I think the satirical humor makes up for it. Then the Kick-donkey soundtrack was a wonderfully talented K.D. Long (me a little reminiscent of Pattsey Klein) she's fine. I can not think about the film that "grew up on me" after a very unpleasant first impression in cowgirls.
