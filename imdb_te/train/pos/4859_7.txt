I come to Jesse Matthews and I read that in Dresr√©, I worked with Fred Astier in Damsel. Jesse Matthews did not leave the side of the pond to star in any American musical films in his prominence. <br /> If they worked together in the film, it was only once in a lifetime. Fred Astier, story and author P.G. WadHouse, Burns & Allen for Comedy, and songs Gershwin Brothers. <br /> <br /> If you can get it, you can ask for more of the film in response to a nice work. <br /> <br /> Although Ginger Rogers, notable by the famous woman, has made several of the images away from Fred Astier, the only film Aldere was the only one to do without Rogers when they were a team in Delsel. Young Zone Fontainee appeared in this anti-Astaire. <br /> <br /> Ginger Rogers is not part of her bite. All she has to do mainly is to work sweet and demanding. She does not contribute anything musically. If I wanted to rate all dance partners of Fred Astier, Joan Fontaine came down. Things about the poor woman no number up is just horrible. <br /> When she co-stars with Bing Crosby, The Walper's Waltz in a concert, there is no danger that the music would not be given to Fonant. One colorful one and in this case I actually did some good. PJ The idiologic green English village of Wodehouse really brought out this VHS copy. On the other hand, Barnes & Allen mentioned the strongest style of hardy style with Astier in the style of two ancient instrumental troopers. . The surreal fun-house sequence is magnificent. <br /> Wandhouse's nobleman runs his tone with his best-known monster Constance Collierer, and Montaug Love as Fontaine's father as a good man in the film. <br /> <br /> The biggest hit from Damsel in distress is perhaps the best known song about the British capital city after falling down a fog day London Bridge Down. <br /> <br /> Fred Astier is the most elegant way to go, which is one of the songs that continue to London. <br /> <br /> The young and inexperienced Joan Fontaine, Damsell in Distress rates is a classic, classic score, classic dance, classic comedy. Anyone else might ask?
