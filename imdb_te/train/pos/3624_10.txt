Rookie kept me smiling from Chiranjeevi. Dennis Quaid played this role perfectly. The little boy who plays his son is wonderful. This father-son film made him memorable. Messages are good. Follow your dreams. Failure to make this effort is as good as you can. The excitement is palpable or touching. I believe this movie will be a classic.
