I'm glad I got a chance to see this rare little gem of a movie. I looked at an independent film festival and do not want to come to your town anytime soon. During the film, I was 10. They are very bad (in the south down here, they do not like to read the subtitles). The film starts slowly but is very rich in dialogue. <br /> When I finally arrived, I turned the screen up as I was riding a roller coaster. <br /> <br /> Chapters, specifically introduced chapters, are the characters that appear on the screen. <br /> <br /> If the future of "video game / comic book" films, I welcome it.
