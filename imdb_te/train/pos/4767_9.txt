I can not see how this show is in the OC. <br /> <br /> First, OC centers around young people and their parents are trying to get through life. North Shore is a hotel staff that runs a hotel and has a social life at the same time. Second, OC takes place in California. North Shore will be held in Hawaii. <br /> <br /> And why does Fox show one of its other shows on the same network? I think this is a great show with very good actors. This is a good storyline and plot. The events and the people I happen to care about and how I like them. It is surprising how the episode story worked recently. It's not as predictable as many stories in many shows. <br /> <br /> I'm fox in the air.
