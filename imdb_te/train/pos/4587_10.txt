Although John Woo's hard-boiled, my number one favorite movie. But I must say that the story of the police is my favorite number 2. When I jumped on the train on the top of the Escalator at Jackie Chan Mall, my favorite part of the adventures, fights and action surrounded me at a pole that surrounds the Krissam lights and the poll has dropped. Through a skylight and finally the hard marble land reaches the ground behind him. Precious stones Buy at Amazon.com for 14:98. (Or 14 dollars something.) VHS new line home video. Feel free to reply to any questions or comments. (I'm only 14 years old, but I know where I can find pictures). If I look for a movie everywhere, give me a reply. Thanks and good night!
