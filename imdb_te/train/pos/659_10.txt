One of the last classics of the French New Wave. Directed, cineaste Jean Eustach drew from the simplicity of the movie of the early century; For the story, Estacha painted her own complicated love life. Many things are about the film - eclectic; Selfish occasionally happier; Mentally drying ... etc. In my mind, complaints that complain against the film can easily cover many of its strengths. Any music video voicing, a soap opera-like plot turns, and arrest conversations make a point for anyone who is ready to conduct a 3-hour film without a student, writer, or any sudden cuts. Everyone should worship: the film (brief, intelligent, surprisingly funny), acting (everyone, quite simply, in their respective roles) and in the general direction (the director feels like a casual observer in the movie) is unforgettable. This is a picture that is undoubtedly yours.
