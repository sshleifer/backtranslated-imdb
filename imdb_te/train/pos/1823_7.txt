I remembered watching my movie with my friends when I was 4 years old, but then I had never seen it ever since. The other day I had never seen Baby and my cousin All Dogs Go to Heaven so we rented two movies and watched them all day and he really liked these movies. Many memories started looking at the movie again and I also agreed that it was a bit shy. I am 22 years old, and I still get the end of the day. All Dogs Go to Heaven is one of the most touching animated films and I'm honestly shocked by this rating of 5.8, I thought the movie would bring good memories to others. I agree that animation is a bit distinct, but the story is very lovely and fun. <br /> <br /> Charlie is another gambling dog, gambling dog killed by carpets. But when Charlie seeks a vengeance, he can not stop turning the land back or rest for the rest of his life. When he and his best friend, Itchy, look for carpets and spies on him, they learn how Carfus gets his money, he learns a small orphan girl talking to animals and who can win races. Charlie takes that girl, un-Mary, and makes fake promises to get money. <br /> <br /> When Carrface returns him back with a vengeance, he learns that he must first put Anna ahead of him. <br /> <br /> All dogs toss to heaven, it's not Disney, but this is a wonderful family picture to watch. It's not just beautiful and touching. I'm ridiculous and some people call me crazy, but I believe that dogs have souls when this film is my child. How are they not? They are very dear, I'm going to cry again. But anyway, I would recommend this film to anyone, it's a pleasant movie to watch. <br /> <br />
