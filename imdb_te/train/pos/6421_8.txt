The true story about a proud and continuous Black Navy diver (true Cuban gudging junior) is certainly a great movie touches both and entertains and it's the perfect cream piece of the new millennium cinema - "Honor Men". Exciting acting is the main reason to make this film truly unique and beautifully enjoyable, excellent experience. Attractive Robert De Niro is a rigorous, horrific and hated chief Billy Sunday - the role he has practically written. The film's latest two solos, along with the fantastic "15 Minutes" (2001), is still one of our best actors. On the other hand, "dignified men" have a good show from Cuba Gooding Jr., one of the best black actors from "Boyz En The Hood". "Honor Men" goes directly into the company of "Jerry Maguire", "As Good Goes It" and "Instinct". Cuba Gudging Jr. is a talented and amazing actor and I'm ready to get more amazing movies from him. The "dignified men" are also the most exciting story-line and the most exciting diving sequences in film history. This is a great, lovely picture and I can only recommend it.
