All Kira Reed fans should see it. The protagonist of this film was unanimous romantic novelist Kirra could not come up with any new ideas. She is also divorced. However, she meets this guy at a restaurant and helps her from her shell (and clothes). They go into a corner room and they will do. Fortunately, the Kira Condom Out (now it is not to say that these playboy images are durable piles of soft-core soft fur.) Later, she was surprised by her publisher, but she did not get her name, despite the fact that the guy finds her and they continue their kinkle games. But in the end she wants to know her sneak tires and more Naru. She when all hell was broken, and I leave it. It is the best films I've seen this soft core Playboys. This check, and marvel at the richness of the crack.
