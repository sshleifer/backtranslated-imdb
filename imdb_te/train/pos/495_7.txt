<br /> Star Trek is Canon - it's too. We know the history of the future from Canon. Technology, events, places, new organisms, names, dates, etc. <br /> <br /> The Entreprene's Estuary is prohibited to be very standard. The unfortunate reality for a long time fierce fans. One thing, I thought the producers would look at the first few episodes of the TOS and at least look from there - but much like the technique, the stage gun is much more modern than the one found in the TOS. An old style Starfleet laser gun, a slow gold speculator transporter effect - which I want to see. In addition, TNG I did not expect to hear the pure beep-based sound effects, but far away from the TOS sound effects. <br /> <br /> The first sight of the TOS (original pilot: The CAGE), we see a starfight as an official military unit - a bit of the old terrestrial Navy. With ENTERPRISE, we see a shocking denial for rank. <br /> <br /> It is better to be in compliance with the requirements of Captain Archer Universe (many are Kirk rather human justice), but ENTERPRISE looks like everyone is equal. From the experience of traditional military service than what appears in the ST series, incomplete, absurd, far-off - and much much! <br /> <br /> ENTERPRISE is a fun, warm-mess of human relationships with us in a historic, bold, sandy, high-risk exploration. Looks like to show search. <br /> <br /> When I was Captain Adrian Paul, I was appointed as an old man doctor. Nevertheless, most of the actors I liked. Linda Park, an excellent ballroom dancer from Boston College, is perfectly well developed. <br /> Enterprises has launched stronger run of its run than the last three Star Trek series. Let's hope for a better future!
