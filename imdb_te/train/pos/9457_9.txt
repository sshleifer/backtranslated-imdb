How to properly and correctly and how to touch this picture? For several weeks, this DVD hit me from the shelf every time - as Steve Carlle had seen in previous movies, I did not like to smear my thinking - so I resisted and resisted, and I finally got it 'What hell!' I caught it. Attitude! I was amazed! I bought it earlier. It was three times in two days that I was laughing at the widow struggling with the three daughters, and since she met her beloved wife and met anxious woman, she was eagerly laughing. <br /> <br /> The guy realizes that his brother is suffering from a girl. Contents - Dawn was ridiculously prepared and filmed with a heartfelt angry, his "someone special" family saw his brothers' life as well as bringing such fun and pleasure to the family. <br /> <br /> When the blind date comes with Ruthie Draper - it turns out in Mary's estimate of Don! When she repeats her opinion, she does not like Ruth's appearance - Green-Eyed Monster! Imagine a delightful scene where two couples compete in the dance floor! <br /> <br /> Don is returning from the Book and Tuckle Shop faced by his brothers, and other gut-forming sequences begin. <br /> <br /> When his youngest daughter Lily Suzanne celebrates his last wife and their love, he sings in a talent show while playing the guitar of the guitar .... His voice breaks a bit while he sings the song. ... perfect gem! <br /> <br /> "What is happening at the end of his daughter's picture ... They love their father and want him to be happy, do not deny her love for Mary; <br /> <br /> Because he fails his daughter in the disappointment of Don, he is their peak, their strongman ... and just a few words tell him more than he is. <br /> I'm going to leave it now - maybe come back and add more comments here in the near future ... but I'll end it .... <br /> If you want to see a movie that feels weak or cross with the turns of the comedy, it becomes the real character of the person who invented a new person - with only one woman or his family , <br /> <br /> Dan in Real Life - the well-known cinematic experience with a score of 9 out of 10 for lerce sondri, touch, performed by the ensemble cast. I can not wait to see this again and again !!
