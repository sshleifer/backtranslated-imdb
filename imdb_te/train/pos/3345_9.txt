I guess: A thicker and more elaborate description of a sport-mad guy and a disillusioned role of his favorite gas and suffers when he is the second bananas for his overwhelming enthusiasm for his favorite sports team. <br /> What have I done: Guy and Galan both have a desire to live with themselves and to the story of each other. <br /> <br /> This story is useless but with non-stop comedy and amazing performances! Barrymore Classic Barimore: sweet, strong, and adorable perfect compound. <br /> <br /> In this film, Fallon is a good surprise. He brings to the role of sports nut's perfect mix of appreciation for the general aspects of life to care for children and his girlfriend. Fallon offers his lines with subtle perfection. The film "has made me" ("You walked me in the field!") And the same breath in the red soaks ("How can grass feel? Kinda sponge"? The film is made of the character of Fallon. <br /> <br /> Hey, that's what I did with my wife I've seen it with my wife, but it's been a fine microphone by Feron - a baseball fan - and she liked it as I did - it's not "Guy Flick" or "Chick Flick." It's an amazing make-you-laugh film Let's see!
