What can you expect from the film 'Surviving Christmas' and 'Festival Fun', Ghandi or English Patient? There are a lot of things I love about this film, which is funny, it's well cast and awesome. I came to the film as the Kaplan / Elfont Fan, but doubtful when reading the plot, it's ridiculous. Ablek (like Drew Latham) plays the whole matinee, knowing that he has earned everything in life, not just a minute as a child-adulthood, but rather what he really wants. In fact, we are increasing in this film, he realizes that their lives are not as good as they meet the envy of their problems, and he sees that his own is not too bad. <br /> <br /> There are fewer weak or dude scenes than many other comedies seen in the movie. The hardest of any other type of play is the comedy or it does not work or the lesser the comedy writers are correcting it every time. I love the play of the play, especially where the parts of the family are written. The joy is in the reaction of Tom Walco (James Gondolphini) and Brian Valco (Josh Jackerman). This may be the bite of Greedy Tom Walco, who can bite his tongue, wear silly hats or sing the Christmas tree to earn a prize for reading the movie. <br /> In addition to the daughter Alicia (Christina Applegate) brings a joyous romantic perspective and why not in the Christmas movie? Of course its corny and contrived; He is rich and beautiful, her beautiful and single, and thus inevitably end up finding her and face falling together with Afflex Snow and face themselves. Great! One thing I like is festive music to boost the atmosphere but I can not really complain. I got what I wanted.
