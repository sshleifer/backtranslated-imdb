Absolutely stunning drama and ras is top notch ... I highly recommend this film. Her performance, in my opinion, is the Academy Award! The only real sad fact here is that Universal is not available in any video format and does not see whether it's a tape or a DVD. They are avoiding a very good picture. But Universal is sad in the DVD in its library, which is sad. You have the opportunity to see this somewhere (it's hardly even why the cable will run), see it! <br /> I do not come into the story because many people have an opinion about the film and many "critics" spend time writing about the story, which is available anywhere. !
