It was surprising that the film won 4 prices, even though it was the soul of any soul, that it took 20 years to bring Paul Ricer for 20 years of his ideas with Polymer Falk. <br /> <br /> Story: 10/10 When Sam Klimmann wrote a letter from his wife, she found her son, a road trip to find her, and they love the friendship, family, and love of each other . You know what happened in the beginning, but no one is easy enough to start the story, it's a ride between father and his son and husband and his wife. <br /> <br /> Actors: 10/10 Well what you say, hey Peter Falk is a myth Everything he makes movies What do you think when you use Peter Faulk in a romance / comedy? The exact result is that the film is accurate and has won so much prices. The son Paul Paul did a fantastic job though he did not always mean that he did not play the role of Peter Faulk and Paul Risser, although he was not always a great actor but the rest of the cast was good enough but you do not see them more. <br /> <br /> Music: 10/10 This does not always work when you use music, it is not enough, but the movie is not the subject, the music is perfectly tuned and the movie becomes more compelling. This part of the picture is as good as other parts, perfectly soundtrack for a romance / comedy. <br /> <br /> Overall: 10/10 The most romance / humor films are tapes, DVDs, Blu-ray and nothing, but this film is one of the specials. It's not a day that you can create this story, it's been years of thinking and it's actually a great part of the human soul to buy it, see it when your old man is old and you see with your father in old age, this film will always spark.
