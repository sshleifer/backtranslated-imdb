De Sika has become one of my favorite directors, but this is a hit and miss for me. A smiley idiot is the leader of the illegal Settlers community in an orphanage area outside the Youth Milano. Surprisingly, the boy is surprisingly a magic fantasy story that makes it a descriptive and shiny story full of innocent capitalists and trigger-happy police forces, but the boy develops absolutely unlimited superhero powers. I'm 10 minutes later and I have come here with a smile, and when I take the magic, I leave in the dust. There are so many amazingly featured shots, very good characters between settled, that I was thinking the film was not more serious with its material. The combination of neoarialism and fantasy is the subject of a fully developed piece / work as an experiment of "work-whatever-can-even-even-mum-mum".
