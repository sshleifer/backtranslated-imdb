Well, this film really does not know, it is not too bad, many say, really like, the idea is very simple, and not boring, it's not. I enjoyed the soundtrack (Bryan Adams), which really goes with the movie. The second plain story, the play of the soul will draw your attention. One thing I like the most is that they do not give a human voice to interact with other horses mantra, which is not very realistic, too many animations now they look realistic? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, one of the most beautiful animations in 2002, I recommend to all, it is not only children, but relaxing.
