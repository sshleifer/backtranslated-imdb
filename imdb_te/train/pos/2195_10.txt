I loved it! Fred McArhy Skid Johnson, a saxophone player in love, is a little proud, proud and more at the same time. Maggie arrives in a ship and they meet in Panama after a bar with Anthony Quinn. She was drowned in the nose while thinking of her loose woman. She took her hat openly. Big Clash and Maggie get caught in Panama. Romance. Carol and Arthur are great together. Maggie will always have him whenever he needs her. She asked her to go to NY, where (see film and learn). She has these amazing scenes in her hands when she plays saxophone. I would definitely recommend this.
