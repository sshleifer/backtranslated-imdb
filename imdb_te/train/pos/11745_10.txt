If you have a chance to watch this movie, you should see it. It's a lot of surprising parts and really makes you think about the most important issues, but it's not idle. In my opinion it is a piece of art ... beautifully portrayed, with many styles fine music, usually the impressive level of acting comes from a BBC drama. The Natalie Press (known as the Natalie Press) convinces her character as a young man who was exploited by a male classmate. Celia ereary sometimes offers stability and audiences that can be of the nature of the unusual actions, which really means 'normal', but the real star is always a Timothy spell - definitely among the greatest actors of our time!
