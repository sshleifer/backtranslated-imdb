I wanted to do this film very well. What happened in the mid-1950s seemed to me perfectly. It is well cast and believable. I normally look at this film type because they do not have any depth, but I thought I was in the role of the characters and how they felt, you really got to know them and took care of them. It took me back to my youth and remembered me about the innocent time. The film can be enjoyed by both men and women and all ages. After the end of the film I thought it was a part two. I wanted to know what happened to Danny and her family. This image is an authentic. If you do not see it, hold it on TV or try to rent it ...
