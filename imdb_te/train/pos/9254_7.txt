There is no movie with Dennis Hopper, Gary Bassie, Erica Enicic, Tom Berenger, Dean Stockwell, Marilie Henner. Miss Ms.Eleniak, except for being imprisoned, is much easier, a poor mass version of movies such as 16 Blocks or Timeless Midnight Run. Tom Berenger runs another terrifying, independent military type and William McNarra plays his rookie with a well-laid fracture. Ellenic must have escaped and escaped, but it was amusing the face on the face because it has good characters from all of the above actors who feel the amusing feel-good image and film rolling. It's not really a family film because some swearing and a rare rare nude scenery, but it's better than other guffs at this time.
