The humorous and sincere comedy (Bill Paxton, Julie Warner, Kevin Pollock, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Matt Craven and Diane Lane) about Canada's former campus (Alan Arkin) about a large group of reunions invited to spend a week in a camp in Ontario, . Writer / director Mike Bieder felt his experience in the same camp was the main source of creating sensitive and perceptible yarn. Moreover, there are many funny moments for this movie, some of which are my favorite awkward, one of which is using a masking tape. Newton Thomas Sigel ("The Usual Suspects", "Three Kings") provides the film with some amazing images from the Canadian forest. In the cast, Sam Raimi, director of "The Evil Dead" and "The Gift" director, appears to be the male musician of the Orkney. The other thing is that the film assures me that a camp is not a bloody murderer.
