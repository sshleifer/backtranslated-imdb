When I consider myself a 'woman in prison', my mind often goes to the enormous Italian / Spanish productions by directors such as Jess Franco and Bruno Mattei; And these films are often very serious, they are also very similar and once you find one; You may have seen them. I accept that this kind of movies is not generally my favorites; But in many cases outside of Italy and Spain, women's idea behind bars is very well done; Roger Corman's New World Pictures are some of the best of them. The caged hot Oscar winner director Jonathan Demme has directed, and it has a fairly small image with plenty of entertainment worth! Obviously, the film caught the criminal and sent to the women's jail, where she introduced violent prisoners. The prison chair in this prison is imposed by Superintendent McCune; And she takes up the crime for dancing with the girls; <br /> <br /> The film is much easier than the one I used in the jail film. But this is what ensures more than just replenish by some great action scenes and dialogue and everything is cached heat entrustance. It should be noted that the plot is not specifically original or prestigious and that it follows a similar structure for many women in pre-jail films; But that's not a big problem. The film is never boring and is peppered with standout scenes; Including an attempt to escape when working in a field and a bank robbery. The Silence of the Lambs and the film helps direct a man who will stand by a great performer; In the role of prison prison Warden, including all the famous legendary Barbara Steel. Overall, the Caused Heat has never left the viewer in the end; But anyone who enjoys this brilliantly entertained little grindhouse image and this kind of movie surely want to track it.
