"A Mouse in the House" is a classic classic cartoon by Tom & Jerry, confident in their tradition, but its jokes. It's lively, cheerful, very entertaining and very fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Butch resides in the same house and he is only a cat in the morning - and it's a cat who catches the mouse, because he's also trying to catch the mouse. <br /> If you ask me, this cartoon has a lot of funny costumes. When two lazy cats are sleeping, I'm glad you're enjoying Siasta and she's not, because she believes that she is satisfied with two cats gasp. There is another funny gag when Tom is slammed into Butch with the disguised as Mommy To Shoes and then Fuching Pan, and Butch then makes the same trick to Tom. The real mommy looks like two shoes and two (dumb!) Cats have seen each other in their mommy disguise and then they are both "behind" her attack - lol, even more ridiculous than this. Naturally she gets mad and once she gets mad, she is not someone to confuse her. But Jerry did not win at this time, because he also boycotted her.
