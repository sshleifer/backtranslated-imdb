Good, funny, straightforward story, wonderful Nicole Kidman (I always love movies). It's a good "vehicle" for those who have two comedy comedy and drama skills. There is a romantic comedy surrounded by two criminal stories, great shutting lines. Chaplin is very nice here, another good, non-popular romantic comedy ("Truth About Kates & Dogs"). Perhaps they are not very afraid. Ebert did not review this. The great "screwball" comedies are clearly not absolute ("baby upbringing", etc.). If you see a frightening comedy, have you seen them all? Or maybe people are ready to move from the 1930s. Abnormal. Birthday Girl The movie I enjoyed many times. Nicole Kidman may be the "killer app" for home video.
