Early trees enjoyed me in their innovation - the Archers logo, the introductory disclaimer, the way to the camera on the camera. It is strange to think that it's 'wonderful life' throughout the year. There is no great coincidence: the 1940s are split with golden-and-ground images; <br /> <br /> When we look at Alfred Jung's sight, the silent cotton dazzling and the angels in the competition, and the more wonderful ideas sprung upon us. I'm not a great fan of mixing color in black and white. Almost always seemed hollow when one of the other visual schemes is placed next to one another. Not here. Powell is diluted in monochrome and monochrome in color, the most natural thing in the world, the change of palettes. <br /> For the story ... It may be the best script of the pressbgger, or at least it's over. The logical result of previous events. And yet it's hard, but I'm still going to do more than here. Is heavenly thing true or imaginary? (Or both, perhaps this is true, perhaps Carter dreamed of a fantasy) everyone would say no answer or answer to this question, but I did not see why. I'm intending to ask a question. The film gave us evidence - in fact, the problem is very much and they are the first to show in different directions. The fact that other things should also take over our minds is not to take us too. <br /> <br /> Abraham Fahlan (Heaven's Prosecution Lawyer) Check out a cricket match showcasing a radio broadcast. Voice of England, 1945. 'Dr. Reeves (The Defense) exhibits this presentation very embarrassingly and then produces his own piece: from America to the Blues song, he finds that he has a lemon in his mouth. <br /> <br /> <br /> Well, I do not see why it's snobbies to condemn blues music - whatever Powell and Presbyger does. While playing the song, we get a shot of American soldiers we hear: many of them locks their heads at home. It is not incomprehensible. There is something valuable about the song and no one knows Reeves or Faralan. Reeves probably learns so much. All English viewers (and all Australian, Indian, etc.) are aware of the lack of value in cricket broadcasting. When Reeves understood, he could not explain it to Faran - so the blues stream reveals that people can understand each other without any understanding. This is a clever view. <br /> The last thing. I found David Niven a bit cold, without his charisma in his career; But even after I started this action, the film caught my heart very quickly.
