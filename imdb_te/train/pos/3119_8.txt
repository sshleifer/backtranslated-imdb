"The Bourne Ultimatum" is ignorantly mid-chase and tracks down the principals behind the CIA Black-Opes that turned out to be the perfect killer in the final attempt from Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, absolutely amazing). Learn his true identity. <br /> <br /> David Straighten, a devastating ice, has been added to a "man behind the back" for a regular return role like Jon Allen (amazing) and Julia Styles (not existent). <br /> In the series, I wished Paul Greengrass was angry at hand camera and would go at least static for a few minutes. However, this is a perfect way to capture the claustrophobic feel and the occasionally chase scenes on the feet and ceilings with the big car pile, which confuses the confusing of combat scenes with close hands. Up. The entertainment section of the Bourne series is a stable globe-hopping and manipulation of technical and speech refusing laws of physics and current capabilities. Bourne films appear in some light-hearted hyperlinks filled with technology-based magic. <br /> <br /> Everybody is not in the right place at the right time and I'm not a blast to see them there. <br /> <br /> The authors of the Emotion and Franca Potenet are trying to create some emotional attachment between Damon and Stiles, but she has never been a leading actress. However, unlike "apologetics" and "supremacy", this exposes everything except "Ultimatum" and finally learns about the Bourne past. It's entertaining and satisfying ending of the series, and if they have any good sense, and Damon gets his desire, which is the perfect end to it.
