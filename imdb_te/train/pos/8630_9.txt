"Necromantic" writer Jorg Buttegrett's second feature film "Der Todding" is a powerful masterpiece. Is centered around a chain letter originating from a group called "The Brotherhood of the 7th Day", which shows 7 parts, each day a day in a day where the alphabet is round using different letters and conditions. <br /> <br /> If you like Hollywood movies or music, you would like to be happy or remotely like "normal" movies, <br /> <br /> The ban, the avant-garde approach of Der Todesking, explains why the bans of Buttgereit's films in Germany, their native country, during the normal 80 years and 90s are well illustrated. Der Todesking is not really the focus on the characters that appear on the screen, but the meaningless apathy or depression are the lives of most people. <br /> <br /> Butterreut's movies are usually the reasons for a lifestyle, the only reasons for stopping, and when you die, you die of the king, Der Todesking. Classification and der Todesking are no exception. Along with the same band, the same cast in all of his films, "Art Film" is the closest interpretation of every time. Der Todesking has the original method to shoot, create mood and maintain the central object in almost every scene. In one scene, the camera slowly pans in a 360 degree circle, where a person lives in a small room in a small room for a day. At another point, Butgatriet uses sound and film corruption, which depicts the mood of the downfall of a man who is in despair. <br /> <br /> The episodes of films (especially the names of the third, seemingly pleasant scenes shown in Germany for the film, the age and the actual suicides of the individual are shown, one is only blindly connected), usually suffering from anarchism, and der Todding is no exception. Although the episode of death and the consequences or consequences of all episodes, there are very powerful parts, and an episode or both appear as complementary, partially emptying the entire energy of the film - still, the jaw-dropping, broken body narrative is tremendously powerful Intermissions do not manage to keep the image together Dee and clean the condition of greatness to cleanse from more vague moments. The general atmosphere is confusing, awe-inspiring, extremely frustrating and sometimes frustrating - a lot of people are in dozens of people left in the middle of a movie in a movie that I attended at the Film Festival. <br /> <br /> This is an image that leaves a lasting impression and I strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a special experience and something they will definitely remember in years to come. It is not recommended for heart rate or does not show timing fans, this is a small, different picture that really increases feelings among the audience. <br /> <br /> "This little indie staff is the best of my opinion, mystery, surprise or hype," Dai Fhult Inside Reach der MensendraMamer Part I-III "666-pieces 8" vinyl edition released, which is now very much wanted, And yet you have the "nicromatic" soundtrack CD, the film-in-the-art synthesizer music is dark and aggressive, almost vague, An important part of the tune, and you have something to hear very, very rarely.
