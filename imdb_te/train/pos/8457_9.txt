Gundam Wing becomes a good anime for me. Moving a bit slowly (especially in the middle of the series), but enjoying all over. Now when someone has flown over me and called me "winger", I saw the original Gundam, Gundam 0080 and 0083, 08th MS Team, and Gundam Seeds. There are some problems with the story telling and some characters can be "Rip-offs" (ie Gurkham's Charcieck Marquis), but this is an alternative universe performance based on the original series. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this series, Look at the original round and then find out that you are watching the AU series.
