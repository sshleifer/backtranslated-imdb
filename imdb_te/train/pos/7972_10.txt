I'm watching this movie from time to time. I looked at the family ages 3 to 87, and with everyone in the middle; They all liked it. It really shows the real sights that have a dog, and you get a pet from love and loyalty. <br /> <br /> It is great for those who love comedy films, tanny-jerker movies or pets. <br /> <br /> Music is awesome, animals are fantastic, scenes really thought, and the characters are perfect. Shadow (old, a golden retriever) is a witty-looking comic character, mainly a puppy with a dog's knowledge and opinion-minded Chance (American Bulldog Puppy); And the sassy (the hymanian cat) is her real cat, showing what a true cat can do for their true master.
