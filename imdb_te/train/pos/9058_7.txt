I read the book 5th grade and a few years later I saw the film. <br /> <br /> 10 billion worms in 1 day 7 hours a day. Suppose he wins all the worms and then get 30 dollars. <br /> <br /> When Billy eats all the insects, Joe needs to go to school with worms in her pants. <br /> <br /> In spite of the changes, Joe has gone to the film to enjoy the movie.
