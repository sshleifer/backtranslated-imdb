B Movie? Yes. DIY? Yes. First movie? Yes. But Northeast A +. This film must have bad sound / editing / lighting / acting / etc. Issues etc. However, there are many positive things about this film. First, the most annoying character will die first! Second, its parody / funny B rated horror film. Our murderer comments to his victims, me and my friends laughing on the ground. <br /> The problem seeks to take an independent image for everyone and it treats it as a masterpiece. Take what it is, and their first film is a group of children in high school at the right. It's really good.
