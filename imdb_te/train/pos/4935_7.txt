In New Orleans, an illegal immigrant suffers from illness and poker leaves the game when a short-term criminal block (Walter Jack Palons) wins. He was killed by Blake and his men Raymond Ficht (Zero Mastel) and Poddie (Guy Thomas), who killed Blackie and washed his body into the sea. During the autopsy, Lieutenant Commander of the US Public Health Service Dr. Clinton Reid (Richard Widmark) finds that the dead man is suffering from rats and he has been in the forties to prevent human epidemic-hours. <br /> <br /> The City Mayor suspects the Council Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) to find and kill the plague killers. <br /> <br /> "Fear in Streets" reveals a simple story, but it is still effective and with a great villain. The cheetah's plot did not date after fifty-seven years. Jack Falcen performed a despicable dilemma in his debut and camera work was still very good when trying to escape Zero Motel. My vote is seven. <br /> Title (Brazil): "Piniko Nas Ruis" ("Panic in the Streets")
