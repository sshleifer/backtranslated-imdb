I saw this movie and saw the series, but now I am refreshing my memory! Very funny movie based on this classic series! Johnny Knoxville and Sean William Scott are happiest together. Bo and Luke Duke Uncle Jesse executed Moonshine in General Lee. When Bose Hug takes the Dukes into their farm, Bo and Lulu will look around the local construction site of Hog and find coal samples. They soon realize that they are in Bass-hog strip-mine Hazard County, unless Dukes can stop him with the help of their beautiful cousin Daisy. My only two issues with the film are not part of Burt Reynolds boss hog, and the sheriff Rosco P. Coltran way is very serious. Other than that, I highly recommend the Hazard Doubles !!!
