I'm excited when I hear Patrick Swayze finally returned to his acting career with King Solomones Minus. I look forward to a great Indiana Jones type action adventure. I've got 4 hours (with commercials) epic is very slow. The second and third hours have completely fallen and it does not bother to the story. The ending is good (no spoilers here) but I still wanted more. Swayze makes "roadhouse 2" better, so he can come back to the popular action genre. If Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone read more than 1985 version of the book or rather than your fan of King Solomon's mines more than just about four and four minutes of your life instead of just 4 hours of your life.
