As a lover of bad movies, I'm not sure about this. <br /> <br /> "Never a bad movie." First off, Rudy Ray Moore was fat and slow when this film was shot. Special effects have gained momentum of combat scenarios, slow motion with instant replay scenes, ten feet high on the wall (falling behind), naked men running from huge letters, and sexually upright Rudy Ray Moore is actually full of gratitude and random comedy club scenes where Rudy makes fun of all the users, some odd dancing, many things about the film are bad, but they are entertaining If bad, and you close your eyes, you may lose another mistake. <br/> <br/> The actual value, 10/10 cheese factor, 10/10 mistakes and goofs, the average to 7/10 for bringing out.
