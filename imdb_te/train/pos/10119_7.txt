Think twice about making this true independent director's first experience as the newest of the most talented Takashi mike's. This is a very basic yakooja thriller, with a morally vague cap followed by a gang of his brother's brother, writing his own sensitive material to the script, following the work of Michael's work. . Whatever the origin of the same old-age film, however, is a very extreme attitude in today's film and some of the horrors of horror. And it's not a good cold, pure violence for the movie lovers in America - this is nasty, painful, and hurts! The pace is breakneck, the characters are just unusual without the burden with stock extremes, the sense of humor Miike also tells you and the most unexpected moments, and it's the camera you most expected, stay away from the screen, he's showing you! It's not the end of "Dead or Alive"'s "Ohmgoad", but you do not worry, now it's time to get Mikeque's bond before some of the Hollywood studio's "New John Woo" shopping list ends up ...
