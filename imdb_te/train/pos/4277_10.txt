"Coo to Tome Pewa" is one of the best movies I have ever seen. World War II is a tragedy with very profound effects on the fate of mankind shown in the eyes of a very simple and ordinary people from the province of Serbia, It has a very limited distribution in a small movie theater in Russia, and I have not been able to come across ever since. This amazing movie is almost forgotten now. I searched for a VHS or DVD copy several times, and okay - nothing could find. I am very grateful to the other fans of the small gem of this film for reference to ways to buy a copy.
