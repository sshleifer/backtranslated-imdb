When it came out I somehow lost this movie and thank you last week for a friend's recommendation. I can honestly say I can not remember another dramatic film, it does a lot of things. The writing is crisp, realistic, active, and even captivated. Cinematography and editing are poor but inspiring, creating fantastic intiments and imagery to surprise the visual heroes, alienation in loneliness and the most unpredictable. The performance is amazing, and painting becomes real and harmful as the most compelling ways to visualize all the pictures. They reveal their innermost weakness with insecure and raw vulnerability. The real success of Roger Mitchell and Hanif Kuriesha, and the rest of the team. Serious film lovers must watch.
