Alain Chabat is a fine actor, writer and director but maybe misled to take an 'idea' credit for a story that maybe they might have them rolling in the aisles 'before' and 'c'. But, as I mentioned, Chabat is the best actor and he can make the charm when he needs it. I am also gradually overflowing with an aversion to Charlotte Gainsbourg that turns into a accomplished performance. If you have the pressure to be fully informed, the 'Plot' is the person with more than the content of his forties and the individual. It does not sit well with his mother and five sisters, and he makes an arrangement with a colleague's sister to take him back - for fifteen thousand euros - his new girlfriend, romance, marries and hooks him, so he hooks off. Naturally they are closing together but some sub-Benedic and Beatrice duo along the way and all the subjects it is considered a beautiful painless ninety minutes and may not be from a sequel query well at the French box office.
