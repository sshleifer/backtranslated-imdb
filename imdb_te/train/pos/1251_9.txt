This documentary was published in 2006 by Peleger's latest book "Freedom Next Time". It reveals the surprising expulsion of the locals of Diego Garcia, one of the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean. The islanders are technically British citizens, the British colony of Diego Garcia, which is Mauritius, the nearby island, where locals have been expelled. The United States Army, based on the bombing of Iraq and Afghanistan, has now neglected their request for their return to their homeland, as they now have a military base. <Br /> As always, peleras coverage is scary, in particular he writes the current poor conditions of treatment and living Islanders. All of his interviews were fantastic, and the Parliament's representative was his best to use the government's own information to close him. <br /> <br /> Piler also uses a dramatic reconstruction to separate a series of recently released documents that bring out the British conspiracy to eliminate the locals. This footage with the interviews and musicians of the Islanders really increases the image's influence. <br /> It's not easy looking, but John Pillar is the best "steal a nation". Recommended.
