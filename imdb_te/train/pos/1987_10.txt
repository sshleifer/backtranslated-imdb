That movie is awesome! I can not get any of its songs. I think it's too old for music, but the film plays some credit here! My favorite favorite is Jack Wild. For me, a british actor lover, you can not confront me from the young people all that nice-looking fresh face. I never knew Jack was sixteen when doing that movie! He appears at the age of eleven. He is small, it helps. Try posting your replies and fellow posters, so I can tell you your experiences. Oh, and about Oliver Reed, that guy, Bill Sikes, I think that drone look is really good. Any idea he's acting before? If so, please post it, I really want to know.
