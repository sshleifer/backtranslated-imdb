This made for crime for the "Not Own Own Own Teen Movie" for the school. 2 frivolous gangs fought with each other and among themselves I laughed all the way. An unsubtle comedy using jokes and gags over I kept rolling all the way. I thought that the biggest gag in the whole movie was not going to leave the characters that were trapped in the 30 years.
