I can not see too romantic, but I love romantic stars. I love the Gothic films. When I heard about a romantic-star cord film, I was really excited. In fact, it was a few years ago and when I heard about all the stuff about making a film, I did not really see it. <br /> <br /> Previously, I did something wrong. The story is set in Ireland and is called Samhain, but the story tells of the Sunny Bean lineage from Scotland. So why not just set there and skip the third grade report about Samhain / Irish migrants / Halloween? Also, you can break the rules of your own, claiming that the trails are safe, but then cannibal mutants just start flowing everywhere. This is not clear how many cannibals we deal with. There is a large stone fortress that is clearly ancient, yet nobody noticed before. The self-conscious horror film hints are annoying and so are the characters. The heroine has predefined movies for her late friends, which she does not always have a MET role. Not to end. <br /> Gore! Surely I would have liked more, but it is refreshing to see such a nasty movie that is not afraid of a gore image. Two murders are on top and Taylor Hays is a nice nuisance scene. Two jungle murders have been extended on extended DVDs. I'm always in the mind that Gore can overcome a stupid story and reinforced Evil Bread.
