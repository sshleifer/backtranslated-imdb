Secret. Exciting. Dramatic. Explosion. Complex. Epic. <br /> <br /> The cast of each cast member is well-chosen, and their characters are very good, you love them or hates them, from acting to rare visual effects, to the mainstream performance of television on television. Or <br /> When visual effects are used (which is very rare) consider the general product of the programs Take. <br /> <br /> As far as the story is concerned, this show is not comparable to the larger complexity the audience does not like. Tolerance for me. From the end, the continuity is virtually perfect, the characters develop, the ever-evolving story gives the answers to its questions slowly. <br /> <br /> Overall, there is no mistake in Lost. This is what sets the bar for dramatic / science fiction television for comedy. <br /> I am patient, intellectual, <br /> <br /> See this presentation.
