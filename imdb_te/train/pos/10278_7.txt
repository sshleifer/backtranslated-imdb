"House of Games" is certainly not without its flaws- plot holes, tight acting, late scenes- but they do little to deduct from the fun of watching a thriller so methodically messes with your head. "House of Games" makes almost everything to do a good thriller. In fact, this is not a great faith, we are dealing with a loyal world and they are damaging. So even though we do not know what we're doing, we never know what we like. But that's what makes the game worthwhile for them; <br /> There is a definite Hitchcock slant. The film spends some themes, his 1964 attempt to be considered a false turning point when releasing "Marne", but is now considered one of the master's more thought-inspiring works. Lindsay Crowes's character, perhaps more than ten years after Tinpie Hendrine, can easily be considered. Both are a lonely single lonely and inspire to walk near the shark pool. In the role of Cross's oppressive role, "What is life without adventure?" Keep your reality check in the lowest setting and swim with sharks!
