<br /> <br /> The film was directed by artist Vincent Minnelly and directed by Jean Kelly. The main lead. Both of them returned a few of those days, one of which was probably their best. "The Place in a Son", "A StreetCard Named Desire", "The African Queen", "Qua Wadis", "The Blue Wheel", "Death of a Salesman" That year, when you look at the movie it will surely be entertaining, thanks to its beautiful color look and many good roles in this movie.Music numbers also work well, Vincent Minnelly And Jean Kelly, is not a big surprise when it comes to work. <br /> <br /> Did we really say that there was an hour or less in this movie? Hmmm, we know that where the film started, It does not just drag the film to any part, but it makes a bit overlapping. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of the MGM musicians without its flaws <br /> <br />
