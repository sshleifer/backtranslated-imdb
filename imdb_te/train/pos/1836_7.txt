Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Priyanka Chopra, Shefli Shah, Rajpal Yadav and Boman Irani. Written- Atish Kapadia Rating- *** <br /> <br /> Eureka! We got it! Yes, ladies and gentlemen in Vipul Shah's 'Vakht'? We found the first scene this year. With all the necessary ingredients of a commercial Bollywood fare, 'Vakt' is everything that you can take for a movie to click with Indian audiences. It feels happy to have a distributor and think about his next Forené tour! In this 'story of Indian emotion', we have three happiest families (not always?). Eeshwar (Amitabh Bachchan), Postman-turned-millionaire (how do you ask ... when the characters are distributed and there is something about selling all the dolls - who is bad - who is damn!), Sumi (Shefli Shah) is the father of Aditya (Akshay Kumar). A serious decision should be made about his son's neglected attitude towards the life obligations of Ishwar. But Aditya's love, the grave problem resulted in his procrastinate. However, when faced with the situation, he is trying to test his race, except that he is out of the house, no alternative, and new difficulties may be more conscience in his life. But this is likely to become a problem in the expected solution, the controversy between the loving father-son and the fences continue to grow. <br /> <br /> You do not have to be a rocket-scientist to find out that the story delivers the possibilities for a comedy and drama heroes. So, in the beginning of the break you start funny, then annoying comedy track by Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav; And there's go for your handkerchief moments between the post-break Abi and Akki! Writer Atish Kapadia (The original Gujarati drama 'Awzo Wala Fary Malisu' based on the film is also a good job, and the dialogues are different from time to time and the songs appear to be like acne on the young face and do not help the activity mark. In the direction, Vipul shows that he has a natural talent for story-telling. ' I do not know how to do it, but I do not know what to do with it. Amitabh Bachchan is always reliable, his strength is visible and his age! Shefli is a graceful act   ిన మైదానం మరియు ప్రతి దశలో సూపర్స్టార్తో సరిపోతుంది. బొమన్ మరియు రాజ్పాల్ ఇంటిని వారి histrionics తో తీసుకుని. ప్రియాంక హీరోయిన్ పాత్రలో నటించటం కన్నా తక్కువగా ఉంది. ఇది అన్నిటికి మరుగుతున్నప్పుడు 'వక్ట్' అక్షయ్ వాహనం. అకికి పాత్ర అతనికి సరిపోయేటట్లు నేను ఎల్లప్పుడూ మంచిదిగా ఉన్నాను. Put him in 'Mujhse Shaadi Karogi' and he is a wonderful person, but he is bad in 'Bewafa'. Here, Akki is probably his best. Whether it's his comic timing or his emotional translation, he is near. There is also an action scene for his fans! Ironically, his best effort is in Ankene - this is the director and Big Bigh on his side! <br /> <br /> 'Vogue' is not a memorable film. It does not appear in the good films of our industry. But it is one of the people. <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> ************************************ ************************************************** ****** * Looks good ***** Good <br /> <br /> 22 April 2005
