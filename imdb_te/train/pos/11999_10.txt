I have seen this fantastic product and I think nobody can tell me about the actress who plays a blacksmith's wife-I'm not sure the name of her character. I went to BYU with her and met with her-her virgin name Kim Luk-and I would be surprised if anyone had any information on her. She is not listed in credits. This product is the best, all-tear-jerk on all accounts, amazing performance. I do not want to put it in the general category of 'acting', such as 'experiencing the wonderful events that led to the start of heaven for the last exclusion'. B. Let me know if someone has work with Kim or have a website or something !!! She is amazing in her role, by the way ... Melissa Thorne
