This is a well-built movie. Acting, first and rate all of the script and camera-work. The music is great, but it is very early in the film. There are not really super stars in the cast but many faces are known. The whole cast makes an excellent job with the script. <br /> <br /> But it is very difficult to see. It is now better for the British to ban Hindus and Muslims from each other and then separate them from the two countries. There is some merit in this perspective, but no one has been forced to mislead the Muslims of each other during division. <br /> <br /> The British are sensible enough to look at the tensions between religions and to plunder their own ends. <br /> <br /> In this situation there is a lot of cruelty and irrationality, remembering and watching on the screen is very unpleasant. But not black-and-white case. <br /> <br /> Both of us, she had ruined her life, but really loved her, and her family, who refused her, then came looking for her. <br /> <br /> The film is a respected, both Muslims and Hindus with their grave flaws. Since the India / Pakistan border does not have a real reconciliation, the reality of the division makes it more futile. In that sense, it sounds like "Mr. and Mrs Iyer". <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, we are happy to see the movie, even if the film is damaging the heart. If the UK and the US deal with their own history of racism with this kind of frankness, they are absolutely fine.
