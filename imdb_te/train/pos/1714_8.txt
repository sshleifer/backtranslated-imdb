I'm in a very moody state, this film is also lighter, but the ending of this movie is not anticipated, which remembers a long-term memory. <br /> <br /> Abbey and his professional registrar are witnesses during the marriage. Soha is not married and she is not her boyfriend, Soho is going to go home alone and there is no need to live in this situation where Abi has become a helper for her. <br /> <br /> The rest is just watchable and the story is about to end up at the edge of the seat see that? Dialogues and music are good for directing good songs and the screenplay seems slower to you but it's good to watch the story's demand. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br This is my rating 8/10
