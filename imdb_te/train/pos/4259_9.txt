Solino really moved me to its deeply drawn characters. Being a general story of animosity between the two brothers, it's not about hatred or jealousy. I appreciated the film, Gigi was taken back to his mother in his hometown of Italy and unable to attend the Film Film Awards. She was frustrated by her innermost feeling to see this character who struggled very hard between her artistic dreams. Even so, he is very daring to make another attempt to reach his father. In real life, most fathers can not reach their children their children. I have a gangster, brother, more self-assured and big brother and can find many insecure. A really beautiful picture that made me laugh and cry.
