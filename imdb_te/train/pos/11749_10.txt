Finally we will get a TV series, let's see where the acting talent is! The episode is an amazing one! The script gave us a little more than that, yes, there is still "I'm not your father your father and omigod you cheated me!" The trash but the script actors actually feel and let us live with real real moments rather than show us what most TV soaps feel like-like. <br /> <br /> The camera work has also given a bit more than usual, hours have no angled boring scenes, and unnecessary 'artistic' edge in shots or hand-held camera trunk which gave us what we need to see and even some beautiful scenery images as well! <br /> <br /> The real people are real dramas or dramas with realistic realities Tony Tillay, Sam Miller, Channel Ten and all the cast and crew thank you for the excellent work! Please keep on doing what you are doing. Your efforts will be valuable And be recognized!
