This is a milestone in American comedy, as it is the first sitcom featuring all Afro-American stars. <br /> <br /> The Evans family is a poor Afro-American family living in a tower block. Dad is called James, who tries to run the house, but his wife Florida always improves him. Three children are artistic JJ, Moody Thelma and young intellectual children, Michael. <br /> <br /> I saw two episodes in this program on YouTube (Black Jesus and Sex and Evans Family - both on the site). Why do you think because the English viewer has never seen or never seen in his country The answer is this. In 1976, Britten first called all black sitcom "the foster", only two series were made and it has now been forgotten. But I saw the episode and really impressed me. Then I learned that the scripts are equal to "good times". They were exactly the same characters but with different names - Sam Foster's father, his wife Pearl Foster and three children Sony (a young Lenny Henry), Shirley and Benjamin. Pearl's Gassy girlfriend is Wilma. (I wrote a review about it for reading about fosters). At the time of looking "Good Times" I had only two things to anger. The first theme tune was initially (awful) and the second was the audience laughter. I want to laugh at the audience, but this is a bit of fun and the audience will go mad and get clapping. It's a rather funny show. <br /> <br /> We hope to release "Foster" on DVD in England. <br /> <br /> The Best Episode: Sex and the Evans Family - Series 1 Episode 6. The Foster Episode It was called Black in the Black Community. The other episode I saw, the title of an episode of the Black Jesus "The Fosters".
