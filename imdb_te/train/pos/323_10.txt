This is a truly fantastic picture (in the form and content) of a non-discarded message by any fan of the French New Wave or Underground Film. Just opening or closing loans - we have just removed the art, revolution, and youth in the world. The film is very low for the documentary and is more interesting with our ideas of advertising and actually playing its relationship. Realistic and true facts crossed the familiar paths with images discussing the documentary, but at this point we do it for use and marketing, the truth is not to explain.
