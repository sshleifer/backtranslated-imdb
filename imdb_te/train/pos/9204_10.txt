The story of Hare Rama Hare Krishna is actually in the mind of Dev Anand, who saw the hippies and their fallen values ​​in Kathmandu, who visited the Calcutta after his protests against his previous priest. Some of the suicides were made by Prem Pujari's posters against him. <br /> <br /> <br /> The life of Happy is a story to pick up a picture of Dev's mind. <br /> <br /> Dev Anand is perhaps the best directing effort. The film was a blockbuster super hit at the box office and had a tremendous impact on Jeanette Amen Dev's sister. <br /> <br /> Dev Anand has called for retaining their moral values ​​in the country. <br /> This is a favorite of the monastery-based Indian family and his sister's brotherhood. But with the mother and the jasser (jenath) with the parents, the conflict and speech (dev) leave. <br /> She repeatedly tells her mother and brother that she is dead and she believes that she has never seen her once again. <br /> <br /> To visit his sister, Dev went to Kathmandu and met Shanti (Mumtaz), and later wanted to marry him, and in fact Jasbir was joking with a new name and new identity. <br /> <br /> Dev is suspicious of his sister Kathmandu who is suspected of robbing and all other events that followed his life. <br /> This is the story directed by Dev Anand. We see more about Jenat Aman than Mumtaz. But Rahul Dev Burman composed music. Dev first composed music by Sachin Dev Burman, but did not want Burman da Devi to do so. He is very close to Dev and his previous film Prem Puri, but he is good but opposed to Calcutta. Dev wanted to try to be a light thing because he wanted to revive the anger of the people against Buffon Da Dev Dev. <br /> <br /> Asha Bhosle has won the award-winning song Dum Marum. Returning to Kanchi again is another good number back. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is good.
