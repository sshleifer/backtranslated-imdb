Large cinema, enough laughter and action for all the audience. <br /> <br /> I am here because the last person who posted on this film is to call them and call them to comment on the Woody Allen Investment. /> <br /> The film follows a rare duo, Johansson and Allen following the instruction given by the ghost of a recently deceased English reporter. Their search takes them to the killer's home, and eventually comes to somewhat tragic end. <br /> <br /> Directors are at a certain age They really get the right things. Clint Eastwood, Allen and Pollock are all preparing the most imaginative work of their career. Also, since watching the movie in a deal theater, you can simply tell people that Woody Allen really love and really ready to make him back. The second audience went ahead of the audience on the screen. There is just something about the man and he really shines in the scoop. <br /> Check it out, it's worth the trip.
