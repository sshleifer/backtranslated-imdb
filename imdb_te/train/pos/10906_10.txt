I have a two year old son who is suffering the same condition as Johnny Kennedy. I did not get the chance to meet him but I did not say anything bad about him. I hope to see how much this mood of making this program helped his fellow victims by raising awareness of this terrible situation. This man hit people in a million charity papers. I believe that it is essential to watch these schools. I also agree with other comments - what am I grieving about? He took everything he could throw in his life and could sense the sense of humor. Bless God. I could not see a part of what was shown to have changed his drawings. I had trouble with my son.
