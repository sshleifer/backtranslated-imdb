The most disturbing about this film is that the school's killing is actually a description, but the truth is they have normal families with call and ordinary young people like Andre. Ben Cocoo is able to bring the hands-on camera technique to bring in two friends through the use of La Blair Witch, Ben Coccoo. They appear to be typical - most people hate high school, so what? One part of you believe that they will fulfill the most thoughtful hell in Zero Day. Surveillance cameras in school at the time of the shooting are more powerful. You can not believe this is really happening, it really happened. The hand camera technique also creates an illusion that this script is not an image of the idea and is not an outstanding idea.
