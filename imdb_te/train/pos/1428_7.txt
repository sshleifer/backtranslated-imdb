Scenery and animal range Here is some amazing, heartbreaking beautiful photography, from Arctic to tropical and everything in the center. Camera techniques are diverse and can be traced back to the air force. Editing is extreme and commentary is very much on the world with the correct tone about our world and some dramatic and repetitive facts. Seasonal patterns, climate change, individual animal stories, and hunter / hunter interactions in multiple environments - a bit of a film that attempts to cover and integrate four elements. In the end it gets a bit awkward and confusing. Overall, especially the issue of cover issues, but the Oscar material should not be expected.
