British architect Amicus is commonly known for the horror albums, and the Amenx product that I have ever seen is the best of the great amnibus known as "The House that Dripple Blood". "The House that Dripped Blood" has four delightful dark stories, a similar horror building. These four stories are brought to you in a gorgeous Gothic atmosphere, and one of the best of the best combination is imaginative. Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee (Cushing and Lee) are both my favorite actors, and DenHelm Elliott and Ingrid Pitt, who wore the film - it's likely to lose a real horror fan. No one, of course, and the film is just too much to offer than a great cast. "The house that dripped blood" revolves around a strange rural building, where strange things are happening. The four parts show the four different stories. <br /> <br /> The first story, "Murder for Murder", is the story of horror novelist Charles Huller (Denham Eliot), with his wife. After shaking, the writer suddenly worries about manipulating his own creation ... In the first section the film has a great kickoff. <br /> <br /> In the second story, "Worksworks" goes to retirement businessman Philip Grayson (Peter Cushing) and suddenly a mysterious wax museum in a nearby town ... Great Peter Cushing once again performs a spectacular performance, and the rest of the show is very good. The story is fantastic, and the third is the second best in the film. <br /> <br /> The third story "Sweet to the Sweet" is the most intuitive and most intelligent. John Reid (Christopher Lee) moves with his younger daughter. Private teacher and nanny mrs. Norton, whom Mr. Reid was assigned to order his daughter, was worried about his employer's stiffness towards his daughter and was interested in knowing what would be the reason for growing parental opinions ... The best section deals with the most creepy atmosphere and the real scary plot. Christopher Lee is as good as ever in his role. Nari Dan Porter Nanny is also very good, and my special appreciation goes to 11-year-old Chloe Franks. <br /> <br /> In the fourth segment, horror actor Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwy) leaves home with his sexy mistress. -Star Carla (Ingrid Pit). This fourth story is surreal, in fact it's more than horror. This is a very fun cinematic movie, though, and there are many references to other horror movies. Henderson at one point indirectly refers to Christopher Lee who played in the previous, third section. <br /> <br /> These four divisions have a lot of humor and great atmosphere. As mentioned above, the third episode is very serious and great, but the remaining three are also humorous horror stories of the atmosphere and every horror lover. A true atmosphere, the horror concept of humor, the true maneuver and superb cast this must see. The smallest: "The house that dripped blood" is an incredible horror-omnibus, it is not possible to loose the beloved of British horror. Highly recommended!
