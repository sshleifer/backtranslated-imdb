I was engaged to the Phantom Lady's hook as an extraordinary movie that does not appear literally until half of the star with this top billing. Curtis should be convinced somewhat cops when he is just as skeptical as Scott Henderson, when he comes home first (perhaps he must shaved his mustache) and looks somewhat tough to be sympathetic towards his behavior. While another commentator had a problem with a franchtone tone like Jack Marlow I played the role of the character. He is not a stock villain. Super journalist Elisha Cook Jr. is at the top. His drumming in musical lyrics added a welcome touch of romanticism. Henderson, who is a lover of Carol Richmond, is the most efficient and beautiful Ella Rinieni. She certainly has talent and her screen presence is in the tradition of Lauren Bagel. This is the first thing she has seen and she is sure to see other characters. The remaining cast is also effective. It is intended that all the most satisfying film noir secret will not only be fully dark and complex urban world when all today. Recommended, 8/10.
