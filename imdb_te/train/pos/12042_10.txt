............... When I see this movie I never saw this movie, it's not a bad movie, but I'm so scared! As I mentioned, I was 14 years old when my English teacher decided to show us. <br /> <br /> "Kid finds his soldier under his pillow, and he's also frightened when he says that the child's voice is" This is for you " <br /> <br /> When I see that movie, it still takes me 7 years. <br /> <br /> If you are easily scared, remove this film !!!!!!!!
