The film was rented as a joke. My friends and I are very funny luck I found a copy and used a copy and bought it for me. Now when my friends search for a funny movie, I'll give them a saucchatch hunters. It is a rule that made a very good picture but it is necessary. If the words do not repeat in the Saskwach chapter does not speak in the film. At the end of the film I liked the credit. "Jeep for the jeep, Tom!" Whoever I'm telling you because you did not make this film without your jeep. In short if you are looking for something to laugh in a great image. If you want a good image you can look for someone else, but if you do not laugh at the cost of a person in a monkey suit, hold yourself a copy.
