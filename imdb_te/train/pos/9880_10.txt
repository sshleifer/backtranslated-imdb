The film took place in 1943, when I was at his peak of Judy (intelligent). It is often said that her previous film For Me and My Gal is her performances. Well she looks perfect in this film. She is very beautiful and shows that she has a talent for comedy. <br /> <br /> The film is particularly joyful when trying to establish an audition with John Thorne Way. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, one of the funniest scenes was a compilation of Lady Macbeth's Judy and when she was searching for the John Party to give her a spanking (lol). <br /> <br /> When I fell in love with John and Lily in a critique I had a hole in the plot. <br /> <br /> When I'm Lilly, I'm angry with John but She is not ... it just does not make sense. <br /> All in all, this film should be given to 10, just amazing and almost perfect.
