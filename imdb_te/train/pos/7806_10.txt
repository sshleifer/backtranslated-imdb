"Cry Freedom" is not just a movie. It is a historic narrative, heroic story and insight in the cultural background of a major event in history. Denzel Washington makes a wonderful job of being a stimulating, stealth leader, but he gives a message to the public about the horrors of South Orpheus apartheid. Bicco's story, influential leader, and his main "influence", Donald Woods, is the heart-mongering. But the ultimate victory of his life is beyond the attacks in South Africa. "Cry Freedom" manages to communicate with the optimistic aspect of the seemingly unintended plot to its audience. This is due to the great images of horrific events in history, the great leaders who tried to end, and to educate people in the future how to avoid it. Because of this significance, "Cry Freedom" is a fantastic picture of everything.
