How can you make a mistake with the amazing Ramones? Both of them have already died. This reminds me of Dennis Liarry Joke about the great musicians who died in the kitchen fire when the poor people lived forever. I'm paraphrasing here, but you get the idea. <br /> <br /> Rock and Roll HIGH SCHOOL tells the story of a group of disenfranchised kids fighting against the administration of their brutal high school. It's a very silly thing, but there's an optimism about it that is refreshing (they're a resort to blow up the building). Who knows this is actually a concern for the whole world? ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL believe that people are still important in music and it is an age capsule that is a variant of the larger society. It does not have the correct answers to complete the kids who know the power. <br /> <br /> But, the most important it is pure exploitation. <br /> Do not take anyone seriously. Just have a good time to go. This high school life should not have been the same as the seventies.
