It's a cult stuff. My friends and I will be together once a year to enjoy this movie. Its very funny and very dry. I saw dozens of this move and did not enjoy it. The actors are funny and it's good with each view! If you enjoyed "morons from space" you will love this. Great game in War of the Worlds. I love the Red Neck Rampage to break the speed limit by aliens, hood bug, DOD, popular aliiserator, mine field, red como, 1800Mph! "I'll get the bucket!" Very funny. I love to come out on this DVD! Review negative reviews for yourself!
