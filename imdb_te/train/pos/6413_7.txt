All the actors and actresses in Robert de Niro, Cuba Gooding Jr., Hall Holbrook, and "Men of Honor" are added as a good film. <br /> <br />: From the beginning, you have seen the goose's, loopholes and over-dramatic heart string bravery, and I had to make a pledge to sit back and enjoy the film. If you could do it, it's good for _really_is_. <br /> <br /> Karl Braheer, a real life hero, has inspired the hero to live a lifetime. See him on the Internet ... The whole story that the director admits in his comment is far superior to the whole movie. World War II has only three African-American US Navy divers. However, the U.S. Nobody came to the status of Navy Master Diver. Karl Brazer was the first African-American Navy leader to master. And he is the first deductible to be certified or recertified as a US Navy diver. <br /> <br /> In the negative side of the film, I am only in "loopholes"? Yes, I have this response as "spoiler" and will do it ... Initially, the crucial scene is the helicopter radio hit hit and sink into the sea: Mark V Diver, "Even a few minutes late" There is a time to save the pilot. <br /> <br /> So, for loopholes, goose, and over dramatization, I was able to lower "Men of Honor" from a perfect 10 to 7. <br /> <br /> Do you think the truth is not good in Hollywood? I doubt it. Very bad!
