The Royston town is an unusual but wonderful place to visit. The characters are just wrong and very disturbing but the wonderfully clever masterpiece means it works, and it works very well. Many people recognize the touch of some characters, but the stranger-hating employers of the local shop are the tabs and Edward, or the pen which is considered "dolor" - with many contempt. There is only some of those strange residents. There are three series on TV and Christmas special. There are references to many horror films, such as The Wicker Man. A more recent addition to the series of works is a film, the League of Gentlemen Apocalypse, I can not say much but I highly recommend it. All gentlemen are a lively comedy show with all league writing and brilliant bonkers characters. I will say that it is worth looking at it as you regret it regrets!
