For the first time I saw this film, I fell in love. The weather first attracted my attention. I imagined a gore fest, but instead of the sounding soundtrack (which is actually my ringer: p) I got to see the most brilliant killer mess in my head. I could not expect him to die and a big plus in my book when he disappeared. Predictable horror films endured me. Now, I know the storyline has some differences, but if you're like me, you do not recognize them for a long time after the movie and you're molding on the bed, motion. Finally, as I mentioned, the soundtrack is timeless. This is my favorite theatrical scores, so I'm very glad to hear that Rob Zombie is not touching in his remake. Speaking about the remake, I know that Mr. Zombie has respected John Carpenter, and I have great confidence in this classic. The film is great at any time to light a moon, but it's a perfect addition, the opener, and finally, you have been named for All Hallow's Eve Movie Marathon. :)
