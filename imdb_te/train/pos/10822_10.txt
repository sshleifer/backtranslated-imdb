I was fortunate enough to see this film in England many years ago. I have seen hundreds of pictures, but I never forgot. Even though Sinatra does not play a very fascinating role, he is so great in that role. He has not really come up with "From Here to Eternity" to his role, but in my opinion he is a magnificent in Conch. The other character of my mind sticker is William Conrad. I have never seen or heard before this movie. Conrad plays an incredible role in the film. He remembers his deepest and throat vocals and he speaks with a man who sets the tone of his character. He appears to be around him whenever he appears. A fantastic movie and my only disappointment is that I never had the chance to see again. It seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth. I'm looking for the title that I see in the film is black and white but when I see it is full color, I remember the blue color of the Sinatra.
