Roger Strauss from his classic images of the French middle class to tell this dress about the troubles of a noble woman during the French Revolution. More attractive about "La Angles ..." (more about the narrative) Although the pictures are digitally decorated, they make them look like the Baroque images. In a few moments, you can not really tell whether Louvre is watching a series of movies or films in Musci. <br /> <br /> My shot: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> ---------------- <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
