Look, this is probably one of the best movies that will provide the rest of the world. Hates this movie hates freedom. I recall that in the early 80s there was uncertainty. The economy is weak, communism threatens us all, and nuclear devastation is almost perfect. In that chaos there was a hero, stroker ace. Ned Betty's performance in the film showed that he was not re-cast as a dimensional victim in the jungle. His success is an inspiration for all. The chemistry on the screen between Burt and the chemistry has a clear similarity to Brad and Jennifer. Jim Nabor is a poet. Go to the movie tonight!
