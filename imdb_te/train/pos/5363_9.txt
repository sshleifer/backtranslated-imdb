It is a classic action film from the '80s starring Arnold Schwarzenegger in his most memorable characters. Set in a future police state controlled by the government, including television networks. One of their most popular TV shows was "The Running Man", where the offending criminals were hunted and killed for millions of fun. Audience was set up as a game show for trained killers who viewed spectators' vote for their favorite "thieves" and killing the show's unfortunate "competitors". The viewers also win prizes for predicting exactly who will be killed. And did not play other than hosted Richard Dawson of the hosted feuded feud, he is a well-known game show experience. When Ben Richards (Arnold) is accused of mass murder, he is forced to play this cruel game. <br /> <br /> The classic Classic Arnold One-liners return to the front of the Arena, and he attacks a gunman with a flamethrower, "How about a light?" I've gone but I do not like to spoil the movie. Whether it's meant to be, this film works as a great adaptation of today's "reality TV" craze. There are already many programs that show that they are suffering from shame, and court cases have also been broadcast for their "entertainment value." What happens if the reality is hit by reality reality TV rock, and this is a scary image <br /> <br /> Overall, Pleasant picture, I highly recommend it 10 to 9!
