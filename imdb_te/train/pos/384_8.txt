<br /> <br /> The film version of Alice Walker's famous emotional and influential 1983 novel (written by God from the main character Seli) is a huge Oscar win and is exactly the same. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Seal of Wicked and Wake, Wopi Goldberg has done his best screen appearance. She was not as lazy woman as Oprah Winfrey as Sophia. Walker is more intimately introduced in the role of others in the cast - ally Danny Glover, Sulli's abusive husband; Shug like Margaret Avery, a force for good change; Willard Pug and Rey Dan Chong as Harpo and Sweek; Susan Beubian Cornicon, the teacher's wife; And promoted as a far-off Samuel Carl Anderson (otherwise known as Judas in Jesus Christ Superstar's 1973 film) Samuel. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 'The Color Purple' opens the story of a motion-long drama audience with a beautifully and delicately written text.
