Dragon Hunters should be the best-looking animation film I have ever seen. It's jaw. The world is gobblower, impossible enormous dragon, who sent a quest to go to the ends of the ground to talk about a girl who dreams to become a couple of rogues, fire their weird haired blue dog, and dream of becoming a horse, and they kill in the movie for some cash. Honestly, it does not matter about the movie. Because, jaw-dropping is beautiful. The gravity of this fantasy world is different, so the cathedrals and castles and villages that surround the structures and spheres of the globe float between them and floating lily paddy forests. The world is so creative, that's especially beautiful and it's a sort of mute storybook. The world appears to be a set of beautiful images. Demons also have spectacular views as a fire dragon with an amazing bloodbath crowds. The plot is not a bit original, as the main characters who want their fields of rats and men and never appear to be able to make the world; But beautiful graphics, some seriously bad scenes, and the emotion-motivating dialog makes this movie spectacular.
