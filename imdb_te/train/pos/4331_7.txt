Murder in Mesopotamia, I always thought it was one of the better Porot books, because it was a very creepy and an ingenious ending. There is no doubt with some lovely photography and a very haunting music scene, with the TV app appearing as visual apparent. Like David Suchet Hercules Pioreot as a non-sinister, the episode's highlight was a good fight with a mosquito in the middle of the night, and Hugh Fraser was good as Captain Hastings. The remaining actors turn out to be good performances, but these two leads do not obscure, and some christian imitations are at stake. Part of this episode is very creepy, the scenes of one episode are as tragic as five little pigs, and I've enjoyed much more than this. Louis Leidner puts it in music while looking through the glamorous face through the window, especially creeping. In relation to simulation, it's very confident in the book, but I tell you that there are three things that I do not like. The main problem is pacing, it's slow, and very few scenes. I did not even like Joseph Muradu as a murderer. In the book, I made him a rather nervous character, but made him a murderer of the idea that interfere with the idea, and that has made him less impressive character, while I'm happy he did not miss his drug addiction. (I also realized that her writer was murdered when she was murdered by writer Mrs. Margarado). She believes that she is the next victim of the murderer.) The other thing that would be nice if Amy was in line with Ltherore's perspective, as it was in the book, Amy looks less gentler . Overall, despite some misuse of the writers, I liked Murder in Mesopotamia. 7/10 Bethany Cox.
