It's sort of crazy, but I'm both from TCG, the German version of MGM's "Anna Christie", and the tape from one of the English ... But I came to see this first, 'I have seen it many people <br /> , I can not compare them, but anyway it's an excellent early talkie with direct-to-heart performance by Gorbo. The film looks beautiful, her face is shining, especially the cameraman William Daniels, that gets her pretty close. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere of the film is very similar to the typical MGM stuff from that age, thirty to French or German Expressionist films, and in 1929, a great French director, directed by Garny in "The Kiss", directed by Monsieur Jacques Feather. <br /> <br /> Theo shell is awesome and Anna's girlfriend, hard-boiled, tough, sailor, gives an absolutelly incredible performance as a kid in the body of man. <br /> <br /> Hans Junckerman gives Anna's drinking father and Salka Wiretel, which is a good, minded old cheaper floozie. <br /> <br /> With most enjoyment, Garbo speaks in a foreign language ... 'All other films made in Sweden or Germany were during the Silent Era. <br /> Serious flick.
