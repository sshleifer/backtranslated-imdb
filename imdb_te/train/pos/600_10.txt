Michael Bowen has played an innocent young man who runs a thousand miles to visit his unseen millionaire's father at a spacious, grass-rooted Ranch and is trapped by his small, intriguing and seductive mother from his youth (Clare Ren ), Causing trouble for the family that has not already worked. An experimental, stylish and exciting game that was not promoting and sent straight to VHS and cable TV - I first saw it. It is beautifully written, cleverly driven, and directs from the script that you can pull out of your nails. I can not really believe it's really unpleasant critics. It is an unrecognized classic.
