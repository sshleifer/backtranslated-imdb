As well. Who brought the cheese. I loved it. It turned out to be a phenomenon during the run. Anorexic twins are popular. Bob Sagat started the form of a cash (instead his true funny stand-up). Dave Coweller knows who. Life is good and simple. This is one of the great American classic. It was funny and always brought home a good lesson. I am indifferent to these commitments: I've been in the past few seasons. Home Improvement, when you are older, you have a lot more with the script. I mean ... it's gone for a lot more. But somehow. Because of its healthy, funny stories, and Bob Saget I gave it to 8/10!
