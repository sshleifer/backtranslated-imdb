The picture is very realistic. Definitely, not Hollywood cinema style, where each line is specified in a perfect manner, each movement is accurate. Actors playing the characters in the characters do a great job of representing the characters' feelings and ideas - the adventures of their everyday life. Overall, the film climaxs the viewer's status. The whole story is realistic. This is what we are supposed to do. I can say this movie ends in a bad note. We'll see, we'll learn, we've experienced it. This is probably the moral of this story.
