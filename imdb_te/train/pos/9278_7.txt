In the White Balloon and Crimson Gold, I saw JFer Panahi's two other films, director Guns, surprisingly, the deepest on the surface. In Offside, I do not think Panahi's Sereo Chemical tribute to Iranian women standing for their rights. Not that he is not, of course (and it's not pretty bad as the Iranians can not see, like pretty much every other Panahi movie). But, shortly thereafter, the movie feels flat flat, and it's also 90 minutes long. I do not like it but do not like it. The actors are awesome, and the celebrations in the end of the film are infection. But this is not an important task, my opinion.
