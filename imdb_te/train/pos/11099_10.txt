Chase created a real phenomenon with sopranos. <br /> All castes are strong, but Falco and Gondolphi earned every inch of Emmy. Anyone who doubts this need is only a sample of some parts; Especially in the first few seasons. James Gandolfini is completely terrible, completely terrifying, and you still love him - enchanting by her. <br /> <br /> Many people talk about sopranos (and who have not seen it) say, "I'm not a fan of mafia movies / shows". Whatever. Run - do not walk - and get it. The same people are usually "E.R." But I'm betting that they can not take care of the hospitals ... it's not about the case.
