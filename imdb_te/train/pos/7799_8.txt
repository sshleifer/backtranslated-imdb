Very slow, but internally constructive and ultimately touching a lot. <br /> <br /> A small, very real real life form of a small Florida beach town in the winter is dead - I'm there, it's absolutely perfect. <br /> <br /> This is the first feature of the actress Ashley Judd, and she has a big impression here. I believe that the film is about 12 years old - I remember seeing in theaters, and recently I rented it to "Ruby." Except for the 80's looking clothes, it is very neat. Ashely so bright and touching here, it's hard to think of his next career without winning it. Talk about the boy failing to fulfill your previous promise! This elegant, natural beauty is for anyone interested in all kinds of interesting films and serious performances in "Ruby Paradise" - instead she has become "Go" for mute action films and biting movies! <br /> It is not for everyone, as some other commentator says it is too slow. It's not an action movie, it's not really romance. Director (William Ellenz, "Ulysses Gold", another fantastic role study) considers the life of this ordinary young woman with deep respect, allowing her story to be built slowly and with great detail. Thus, I would recall that I was one of the most moving and respected younger women stories about this - not about Ruby's sexual awakening or "how she lost her virginity", about her life choices <br /> <br /> It's a lovely picture to take time to look at it ... Teenage and young girls (or boys for that matter) <br /> <br /> In this film director Neena The special splendor of the song, which he wrote the script, is very realistic and well-descriptive, which I believe is a female writing novel or history based on that movie, but in fact it is Mr. Nunez's original work. Rated in 10th of 10.
