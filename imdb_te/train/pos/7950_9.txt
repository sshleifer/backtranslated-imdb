First of all, I liked most songs by Bruce Brettton's music score, and it was added to the film alone. The film's best feature was voiced by three animals, Michael J. Fox, Sally Field and the Last Don Amème. When Fox has funniest lines, Amée plays a rather non-breeding character (voice of reason), and the field always adds wit into a character looking at the chans off. Humans can not be engaged, and sometimes dragged the cinema, but my only complaint. This beautifully beautiful movie, with beautiful scenes from Canada, I believe. Although the film is too long, there is always a confusing moment, which has benefited from voice work and well-written script. In all, with me a 9/10, a beautiful and possibly underestimated film.
