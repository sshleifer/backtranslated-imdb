<br /> <br /> I have never attended a seminar on the premiere of "D-Tracy". <br /> <br /> If you look at the film, sharp visuals, bright primary colors and strong characters are no doubt evoked into your brain. <br /> <br /> As director / star / co-writer / producer, Beatty is working in a movie and has shown it here, the new era of taking the American icon to replicate him. Also set in the 30s, Tracy has timeless quality as all the best films. I've seen Tracy how many times have I lost the track and every time I'm new I've caught something new. <br /> <br /> Others like Paco's Big Boy Caprais Madonna's Breathless Mahoney can also serve her in the appropriate environment (GASP!). <br /> <br /> However, the same themes still remain in the family, contrary to self-reliance and goodness, and MacKayvelian themes are also explored. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Dick Tracy" is a standard one. Compared to other images of this decade, it makes a strong statement. It is a good, strong image that does not depend on blood, violence, pornography or nudity. <br /> <br /> There is a lesson to learn here. <br /> Ten stars. Great Scott!
