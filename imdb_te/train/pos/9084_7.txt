Yes, some people say this movie is money waste, but I'm a hard hard dragon / world end / sacred garbage action movie fan <br /> <br /> If you take from my stand point this film is some of the best action sans are pretty good at dong . But that kind of film dropped sharp at just the right time, or just when something bad was something to fall down to save them at the right time. <br /> <br /> The 3D graphics are great. I have 3D effects for this kind of movie! The big battle shown in the trailers is what the hype is in the picture. <br /> Finally, the fight between good and bad, I was longer, and a little better, is still quite good. <br /> Now I am. It is good to initially show parts that lead to larger wars. <br /> <br /> In this film, I really do not need to watch this movie in the theaters, this is a DVD ... <br /> <br /> Overall, I liked the movie and it is strong enough to fit.
