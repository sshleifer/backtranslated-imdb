This is a great British film. The cleverly examined script with many playful lines that capture the magic mushrooms in a weekend that can do what man can do. According to Phil Daniels, there are many British actors Jeff Bell. Peter Bowles with a joint hanging out of his mouth is a casting masterstroke and Gary Stretch that brings the strangely atmosphere of pieces that looks his cultivation. Although it seems to have been billed as a biker film, I'll find audiences outside this, and it's been there for a lot of people and a T-shirt. A great original soundtrack with the blinding version of Freebird. This truly can be a 21st century heir to the famous Ealing comic. Weird in Welsh fields: It's a grower!
