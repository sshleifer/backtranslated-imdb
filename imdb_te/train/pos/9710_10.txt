I'm very proud of being British. It's the most ridiculous thing on TV. The league consists of Jeremy Dyson, Steve Pemberton, Mark Callis and Reis Sharzmith. This horror-comedy perfection, completely underestimated. The letters are gorgeous and coachfrage bizarre, "hello dave". <br /> <br /> Everybody just wants to watch the comedy. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the gentleman's league is that it always matches and always pushes the boundaries. It does not rely on coachframes to be funny (unlike little Britain). The fact that the league is undoubtedly ready to kill their most famous and iconic characters, shows us how they've got balls of steel.
