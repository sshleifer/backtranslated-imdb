If you're a fan of film Noir, I feel they can not use it anymore, here's your answer-they're not Mum in Hollywood. We must convert to French to remember how satisfying, subtle and amazing images are from that genre. <br /> <br /> I read my Lips for loyalists from Emmanuel Davos and director Jacques Aidard, who has a sharp storytelling and good performances from Vincent Cassell. <br /> <br /> The basic plot may have been written in the 40th century: Dumb but confusing is frustrating and desire to develop each other to meet their own ends, complex love / hate relationship, cook, while ex-con and glamorous A smart but chaotic Femme the fatale (who turns out to be ruthlessly ambitious) to discover each other is exploiting, dual crosses, close call As it happened, and a lot of money. All the action takes place in discouraging, seedy and / or poorly lit places. <br /> <br /> In fact, Audian is building some modern twists. Femme Fatale is an office worker who works unnecessarily, which is almost deaf and she uses her lip reading ability to take revenge on herself. And you can expect sustainable love scenes that you can know that both characters are sexually embarrassing and immature. Add in a bit of modern technology and music and it seems like a contemporary film, but wrong - this is the old school picture noir. It's as good as any film from the genre and is one of the best movies I've seen all year.
