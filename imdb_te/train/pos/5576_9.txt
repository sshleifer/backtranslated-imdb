This movie is happy! I saw it with my friend and we had to see it again. This movie is not for those who watch the movies you have been nominated for the Academy Awards (you know who you are.) I've seen from other reviews because I'll recap it. <br /> <br /> "Wiped" is a lightly ridiculous, laughing throughout me. It's not too tight and your friends are not your girlfriend. It does not win any awards, but it should be appreciated. Truth, jokes are some toilet humor, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. Everyone can use it sometimes. Some people are easy to see and see "Wipped", which is not. <br /> <br /> ***** 1/4 out *****.
