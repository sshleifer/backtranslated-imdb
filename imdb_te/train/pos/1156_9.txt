Years ago I followed soap on TV. I'm so excited about this movie and I gave it a reward for finding it. It is a fantastic spoof of jokes, general actors insecurities, and soapy all kinds of soaps. But than anything - an amazing cast and a fantastic script. How can those top-lyric actors play in such a silly film? And how did this little film writers come to write exact lines? I do not even agree with anyone talking or listening to this movie, but it's wonderful and I recommend that I watch it. Sometimes when I go home I will throw it down, sitting on the bed, watching, laughing and experiencing absolutely surprising things. Many compliments have made it all.
