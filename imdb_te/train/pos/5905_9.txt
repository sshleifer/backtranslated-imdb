This is a well-made film. Sumitraveev has done a good movie and she is my favorite movie. The film was to win the national award and represented India in the Oscars. <br /> This is a thousand times better than 'shaws' from India this year, going to the Oscars. ) The lack of IMDb and sometimes wrong. Sadashiva Amrapakkar plays a very important role in the film and he is not even credited in these pages. The rest of the cast and crew did not mention many. Though Sonali Kulkarni won the Indian National Award for the film, the film did not receive awards and nominations. Not a single vote for 'Dokhi'. <br /> <br /> "Dokhi" is not a Hindi movie. It's Marathi, and thanks to the song and dancing scene, the glamor and half-witted designer did not get into the ware. This is a real life story made with a rare understanding and respect. <br /> <br /> "Dokhi" translated by 'Two Women' is the story of two sisters Gauri and Krishna. In fact this is a very simple story. Sumitraveve has not participated in many sub-plots, directing a very difficult movie. The entire movie is set in an inseparable remote village in Maharashtra and the screen runs rarely from two rare characters. <br /> <br /> This image opens up and we are introduced to the whole house preparing for Gowri's wedding. Groom and Krishna's father, who works as a worker, is full and happy; There is nothing wanting in their normal lives. However, Gauri's husband's husband encounters a dangerous accident during the wedding. Gauri's father can not bear the news of the bad news and suffers a major stroke. Without a compulsion, a worker may have left the house but Gowrie's mother was responsible for the responsibilities. She can work and she can, but can not. But her life is still easier than Gowri. People try to forget superstitions, causing Gauri to bring bad luck. <br /> <br /> Gauri's mother wrote to her brother. Desperate accepts her advice for help. He takes Gowri to Mumbai, where she works in brothels. Gauri earns her money and earns money and improves their conditions. <br /> <br /> When Gauri came back home to Krishna's wedding, her mother did not come out to meet her. She did not allow her to be dark and did not allow Gowri before Gauri. She loves Gowri but fears Krishna. It breaks down Gowri and decides to come back to her unfortunate life. But the dark gown is going out. She prays back to her beloved sister. Krishna promised to stay with her. Will they promise to face the world? <br /> You do not need anything in this movie. Everything is needed and sufficient. When Gowrie goes to Mumbai, what does she mean? Let us know what subtle conversations are. It's just a simple story and its simplicity is deep. <br /> <br /> <br /> "Daggers" The thing that it handles is respect. Is this a respect for the audience? It does not have a four-year mental capacity. <br /> The first rate of acting. Is the direction amazing ?? Silence can carry the story and have any words. <br /> <br /> Anyone who praises a good movie is like 'Dokhi'.
