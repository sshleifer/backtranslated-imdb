I recently started watching this show, and I said it really laughs. You should congratulate all things on the subject. Some of these should be accompanied by real reactions of other people. If you are going to approve bringing Nade dead back to life, you have to accept the other completely silly bits performance. I could not help laughing after every episode I saw. I really think it's great to have a presentation there to make it a lot more strange and really great to see. I absolutely love the narrative, I think the whole show adds extra bit of fairy. Authors can not always compete with older presentations for its newcomers, you have to have its own entity. Give it a chance for sure, and they just enjoy the ridiculous parts just like that.
