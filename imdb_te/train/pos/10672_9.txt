Anyone who has seen this film and it is properly reviewed, I refer to Roger Ebert's review of this film. He was one of the most respected critics in the industry, and he gave 3 1/2 stars. <br /> This is a great image. It's neither perfect nor wonderful, but I enjoyed it. The Chorus line is not a story because Broadway is a group of stories about hopeful lives. I read the reviews of people who have wasted time in love between Zach and Cassie. This is a wrong opinion. This is another story, along with all the stories of Broadway enthusiasts. Broadway's dancers fail to realize that people go through the same things that the ordinary man is going through. And I really think the point of the whole show. This particular dancer's performance is only to showcase, but to give us some sharp things to think about life in general. It's about life as a Broadway Star. Those who dreamed of becoming a Broadway Star will have relationships with anyone, because they have done exactly what the characters did. <br /> This is a great music. It has its slow points, sometimes confusing a little bit, but in all the stories, I'm totally enjoying it. Take a closer look at this picture and you will understand what I'm talking about.
