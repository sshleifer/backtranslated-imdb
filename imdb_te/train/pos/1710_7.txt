The film is an accurate representation of a TV series in the Indian television channel, which was broadcast at least 15 years ago. This series is called "gabberry" which means bubbles. Each episode is a new short story. కథ అద్భుతమైనది మరియు అసలైన స్వీటర్ మరియు అభయ్ డోల్ ఒక మంచి ఉద్యోగం చేస్తుందని "ఒప్పించి" కానీ "సాధారణ" మరియు "మూడవ తరగతి" గైల పాత్ర (అతను ఈ చిత్రంలో తనని తాను పిలుస్తాడు) గా సరిపోకపోతాడు. /> <br /> Shayan Munshi and his hair is short <br designer clothes without the role abhays placed sayanku up with it does not have the talent.
