The bold film moves in secret with some brilliant casting and explosive soundtracks to depict the damaging effects of criminal charges and criminal charges against 2 innocent young brothers from the southern city of Tincoco. <br /> <br />> Film debut album Danila Rios is a seductive emotional dancer Gracia, working in a new short-wavelength nightclub at Alejandro Trejo in Chile's film production. The elder brother, played by Nestor Cantelana, is easily set to become the mainstream leader, after a night in Strieklab he easily convinced his younger brother Victor (Juan Pablo Miranda) to celebrate the seventeenth birthday. <br /> <br /> Since opening the scene, the film explodes in the Naya-Noir search that the outside world is not generally viewable in this country, so it is absolutely traditional and Catholic. <br /> <br /> The three-way fantasy romantic circular narrative Trezo men and the major international drug contracts between 'Gringo' and Eduardo Baril revolve around the linear character, while honey bees attract three men as bees. If the outside of the community is incorporated into a small family, power relations become an important subject. The prostitute has had an adultist for all Chilean men in the film, emerging from the spotlight of society, and holds the key to three men's futures. Relations between Trezo and Cantillo are important because boys' parents are clearly visible because of their absence (they still live in Tameko). That is why he made 'Trezo', El Pedro, he 's in the canyon and makes him a man in the city. Miranda is rapidly disappointed because his 'father figure', based on cantile√±a, grows much more by envy on the beautiful Gracia. However, Milan is still trapped in school - he relies on trinja based contractions, for money to survive. Trejo is under the thumb of 'Gringo', and his wealth is collected by drugs and his strip clubs. <br /> <br /> Grazia deals with a beautiful fireworks time bomb, where she holds the web of a beauty in her patriarchy, but this habit can lead to a climax. <br /> <br /> As head of tensions of power relations, Grecia is blurry. It is not clear that the audience is committed to her. The film ended tragically and explosively, which reduced power relations and major male protanganists. The last shot of Miranda's hitting the face to speed up the Panmericon road was dismal. The boy was sucked by the movement of the underworld of the city, and still lost his only visible family, and his woman, who is the portrait of his only friend. He is nothing. Excessive metaphors are bold and brave. It is a gangster film in Chile. The feelings of the family are prohibited before the wedding, and the hard facts of the other side of Santiago's coin are displayed in their savage glory. Trezo Rios is worse, Rios and Miranda beat love in a movie reel room - she knows very little with a whore. <br /> <br /> The Gringos is believed to be economically conservative on this small Latin American country, but not by copper mines, in the illegal way of drugs. <br /> <br /> Waissbluth's success is this dark underworld, which increases many social questions, such as Sequo con Amor, Taxi Para Tres, and El Chocolate Tech Sentiment, in a film that is strongly featured in a soft, soft shot of the film, recording successful sex con Amor Chile is better and truly artistically alive and 15 years after the censorship of the military administration There are graphic evidence that the later kicking in the transfer period.
