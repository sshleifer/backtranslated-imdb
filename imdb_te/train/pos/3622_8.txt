I know I'm going to see this when I see the first preview. Dennis Quaid is a cause, but the theme holding me in your dreams speaks to me. People talk about this as a film for kids, but it will happen to us to think of a film for baby boomers coming to terms with aging, weaker parents, our own deaths, growing up and leaving our children, and the other things we never considered. <br /> <br /> The film does not come into the trap of tragedy; It's about real life, what your dreams live. <br /> <br /> Quaid is too small for a pitcher, but he looks good, and Rachel Griffiths's wife makes a small piece in a brilliant, layered performance. Camera work is slow and sweet. When they put together the film, they left without a need. Very nice.
