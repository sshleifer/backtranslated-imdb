I saw this movie and I was very impressed. It is very creepy and has many moments you will jump out of the seat! I smoke many "emergency" cigarettes to intensify my nerves! If I have to criticize, there's a lot of jumps, if any, perhaps. <br /> Every new scenario is climaxed with a jump and has a gradual stupid effect, because what you've come up with is new. <br /> <br /> It's every cliche in the ghost style, all of which are hard and fear-managing. The Shining, the 6th Sense and the Changeling (specifically, The Soundtrack reminds me of the Shangleling). <br /> <br /> I would recommend this to anyone who looks good old-fashioned fears!
