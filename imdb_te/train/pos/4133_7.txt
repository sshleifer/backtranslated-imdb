Excellent English film for many reasons. It was originally a rare comedy Laurence Olivier in a light comedy. Although his performance was not authentic, he was the second of the greatest actors of the 20th century, and he was absolutely reliable as the hoodwinked barrister. Historically, this film has a great interest, where and when it's shot. There is no big budget in the same period of Hollywood movies in English and it often shows, but the fact that the film is pre-war is more interesting and shows that England will soon be going. As we look at this today, let us look in terms of modern morality and the film and its closest American counterpart 'It Happened One Night' were like 'Fatal Instinct' in their day. But after watching and enjoying this film I can not help it for the first time but I feel sad when I see today. With half of the film in the 1950s, saving the rest of the movies is hard choices, and such unfortunate movies are often saved in movies that are most important. The color transfer, the lack of difference, and the quality of the print that normally most often appears. The film, along with `It's Happened One Night ', is a cold evening and a watch on the watch is cut in love with one another, or why is it not a double feature.
