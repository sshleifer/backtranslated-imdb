It was beautiful when it came to America, but I recorded it from the TV and looked again and again, and I remembered the whole thing. I'm still quoted today. The show was very happy and a number of well-known characters from Sylvester Stallone were given to Mr. T from Frank Sinatra. Voices are great, and they are similar to the characters they portrayed. Even though it's a little creepy, puppets have done well. I'm surprised to know that I recently learned that Robert Grant and Red Dwarf's Doug Noulayer have written me a lot of fun. As another person wrote in the previous comment, I did not even bring back this great show "friend". I wish I had enough demand on this program to guarantee the DVD release, but enough people heard it. Oh well, maybe i will try e-bay ...
