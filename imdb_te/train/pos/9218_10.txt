First and foremost, I want to see this film for about a year now because I know Angelina Jolie and I love her. But my love picture for her is not in my opinion. However, there are no video stores but fewer and local library. I loved it and loved it completely. Yes, there are Italian stereotypes but it is well and funny. <br /> Every actor and actress did an amazing job. I worked very hard at sexual humor. Overall, it's good to see if you can find it. It's adorable and just plain fun to watch. I rarely gave the 10th rank for the films but I will give this 10 people! <br /> Find it and see it!
