<br /> <br /> The film is an average thriller style. It has some brilliant editorial scene and some scenes really wrecking really nerve that will bring you to the edge of your seat. Best view from the movie; The museum scene and the killing of the elevator. Some minor sex scenes and film pace are not adequate enough for the general viewer to fully appreciate the film. So this film may not be suitable for everybody. <br /> <br /> This story is also great but it really is the style that works with the movie! It may be only for fans but casual audiences should appreciate the tension in the film. <br /> <br /> Good role is played by good actors. Michael Cain is an interesting actress choice and co-starring Annie Dickinson is good for her (not bad for the age of 49). <br /> <br /> Other D. Palma, like his score for "Body Double", is very good is. <br /> <br /> Brilliant nervous breakthrough thriller. <br /> I love di Palma! <br /> <br />
