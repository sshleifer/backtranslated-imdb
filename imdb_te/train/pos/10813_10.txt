I am surprised by Ethhel Waters, I'm reading it's autobiography. Pork chops and watermelon instructions When I start rolling, I agree that my jaw can fall, but this film can not be seen as a stereotypical or racist. Blacks are pretty small by blacks, while the entertainment industry is very different and the generalizations of the people are jokes of their time, the old trends are exaggerated for humor. Modern black films do the same thing, but there are new trends (stereotypes), "hoos" and "hood" and so on. If you look back in eighty years, I think today's movies will be racist. The audience will appreciate the film Waters and Pent-Szied Sammy Davis Jr.'s talent, he removes his contemporary, Shirley Temple, and looks as face-to-face as he did as an adult. This is a lot of fun for everyone involved. What does it mean instead of what it thinks?
