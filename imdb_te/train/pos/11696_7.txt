"A Thief in the Night" is a film that is neglected by cinematic fans due to the low budget of the film (obvious) and its subject matter - the rapture of the true Christian Church and the fate of the remaining ones. Nevertheless, it is a gripping story to hold a viewer, to do or to review her relationship with Jesus Christ. It touches every one - even a pastor who teaches the sentence, but can not believe it. This film, and its continuation of "Thunder Thunder" movies. With the new "Left Behind" series coming out, with the same story telling a much larger budget, the effect is still the same - "A Thief in the Night" broke the plot of the genre and always remember it.
