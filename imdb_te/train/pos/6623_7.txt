First things first, the film is overwhelming. One of the lightest / composer on 3D CG images, the visuals kept me away. I was surprised that the screen was on every second for the story, well, that's OK. <br /> <br /> It does not set the world, but if you want your future blade runner-esquire stories (and who will not do that?) then you're good. <br /> <br /> I thought the voice acting was particularly muted and removed from the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I saw in English cinema, but I hoped there was a French version floating around.
