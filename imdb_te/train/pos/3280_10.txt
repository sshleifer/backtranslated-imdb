Ten years ago I saw this film only once. I bought the DVD two days ago and I think it's better than I remember it after seeing it. <br /> <br /> The paper house is more than just horror. It has an excellent level of emotion and is a great role by running it. I especially thought that Charlotte Burke was really good here. It was a pity she did not do anything else as an amazing actress. She played a role in the emotional role throughout the film, especially when Mark died, and she realized she was alright, especially having the right amount of doubt to get the message. <br /> <br /> Many scenes have been made for me by the modern junction (which is rare in horror films), especially the scene in the bathroom, the strange father and her bit legs in the background of Anna's father <br /> <br /> All in all, .
