As the film opens, two thugs will kill another exploit. When the body was detected and the autopsy, the man realized that he was suffering from pneumonic plague, even when the man was shot and killed - a very nasty and more dangerous version of the bubonic plague! <br /> <br /> It is time for people who have met with the dead person to face them immediately, otherwise a disaster may arise. <br /> <br /> Unusually, I know a little about the pneumonia plague, which taught me the lectures of my history classes. The film did not really do much good to get facts about the disease, and saw how little people would look at it. The biggest problem is that this illness is very strange in the 1950s they are not really allowed to show it. Sure, there's a lot of bleeding and explosive vomiting - high fever and cough (they got this right) but blackened blood - along with the lymphatic lymph nodes like all you want to get with the bubonic plague - all purply and gross! Why did they not go away? In addition, I'm sure the federal government has had a much greater impact on disease control and treatment - in the film it is maintained at a very local level and everyone is bad and a bit dumb. No one seems ready to believe doctors! For acting, the film has some amazing actors here. Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas respectively, public health physician and police chief. He was a good actress but was also well known in the 1950s. However, in his very first film the horrific Jack Falance (still his original Monier, by Walter Jack's Palace) as well as relatively unknown (at the time) Zero Monel. The Palace is great - very scary and physically fit in his own fight. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film has been completed for a long time, but not everything is correct. And there is excellent acting - and well worth it.
