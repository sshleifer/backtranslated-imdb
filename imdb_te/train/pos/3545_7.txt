Big Splash image of Broadway music. Nathan (Frank Sinatra) prefers to make dice rolling and illegal rubbish games. Blonde loving Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) wants to marry him if he gives up craps. He decides in a final game Sky Masters (Marlon Brando!), Who is the big wager, town. He was unable to attend Mission Activist Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) to work with Havana. <br /> This is a real mixed bag - here are some amazing things. The songs are good and the dance is fantastic. The real display is in the worst game at the end of the stopper. Even Brando is really very good here - it may seem strange to think of him singing and dancing but he pulls it out. I have to confess the big one, Brando was a lot of fun by dragging some hard dance moves! Sinatra is pretty good and Blaillin is as good as her long-suffering Girlfriend. <br /> <br /> For now Bad Parts - Jean Simmons is a wonderful actress but she is stuck with a brownish colorless character and can not do much with it. The 150-minute film is too long - the scenes between Brando and Simmons should really be small and dragging. Most characters speak in a very precise English - the contractions are not used. <br /> <br /> While trying to be fun from the mouth of gangsters, I found it and threw me out of the movie. <br /> <br /> It is valuable to hold for songs and dances, and after a while you get it. I will give 7.
