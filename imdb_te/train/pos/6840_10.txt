The fact that the film is speculative is not a problem. This film is like a beautiful painting enjoyable. The museum scene is like a nice music video. Appreciation sex scene is a well-known scene for all of our adult lives. But this film will not have interest in me without Keith Gordon. Keith Gordon is perhaps one of the most infamous actors of our time. Almost everything I knew about acting came from studying his eyes too much. He has the most compelling face. His character includes features I see in a person, sensitivity and dedication. Keith Gordon is gorgeous. BTW, I wish he'd shave his chin now his lips, jaw and Adam's apple were his prettiest set beside his eyes.
