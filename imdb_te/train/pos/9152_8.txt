99% of this period is a good picture. <br /> <br /> It is filmed in a very innocent style. It was made clear to create a more chilly experience for the film - the loneliness of the film is very clear due to this technique. <br /> <br /> The fierce characters are well acting and most importantly the 'nutcas' joe. <br /> <br /> However, these absolute (simple) characters are very curious at my will - granted, they do not come across enthusiastically, but it will take a little OTT. <br /> <br /> The movie begins slowly with the innocent camera work 'B' movie smacks) and quite common but you get a sense of coming cruelty about what's happening right away. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If the film is kept with the final film, the film would have been given to 9, but it was only 7th in strength and the nail-busting scenes in the film. /> <br /> Give it a watch and forgive the end!
