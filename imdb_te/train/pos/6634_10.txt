How can you rate this movie with 10/10? I will admit that this film is not very entertaining but the goal story is not telling history! This is the first 'real' film of film history ("Le Prince de Gales" is the first non-technical knowledge!) And it is undoubtedly a huge international value. These people you can see to complete their working day in the film have the opportunity to participate in a historic moment, seeing the first person moving! And a beautiful shot above all the shot! When you think about the first people, it's very moving! What moment! Historical history of science (because Lumiere's brothers first invented the cinematographer for scientific reasons) and later for the art. An image to appreciate!
