I was impressed by Doug McGrath's film version of Jane Austen's novel "Emma" and I loved music by Rachel Portman, when I went to the video store one day and two "Nicholas Nickelbe" I rented it without any other scrutiny. <br /> I read the book, I do not know what McGrath could do for the over-critique of Jane Austen's adaptation. I do not know what Miss Arthane's work and the main plot elements are to capture more fully, especially the two-hour film's limits ( Some people complained that it was too long!). And as far as Gwen Paltrow's accent is concerned, I was not sure when I first saw this in the theater, and I was convinced that she was an English actress! <br /> <p> I took back those who criticized the film for its lush scene. I look forward to seeing one of the things I enjoy and the long pieces set in the English rural area. The beautiful themes of the film are the main reason for its appeal and success. <br /> <br /> The English Country settings are as attractive as the cast and are lovely, combine with the story and the soundtrack for fun makes you tire of repeatable views. <br /> <br /> McGrath is awesome when intertwined with subtle expressions in the narrative of a complicated romantic plot in this story. <br /> <br /> This refreshing film may also be a clinic for how to make a film like minus sex, violence or even anti-villain. <br /> <br /> The story is very fun, lovely, and sometimes very touching. <br /> <br /> I have seen many potential Jane Austen book simulations but this is not my favorite question.
