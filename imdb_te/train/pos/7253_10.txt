It can not be said to be called anti-war film, it shows a high level of war. These are the superior forces that know what they are doing and it will be a great pride. Even though they are peaceful, they still experience the level of skill and defeat their powers, even if it is fighting against a peace camp. Movies are slow and unlike and battles movies go-so so many today's standards, like body parts flying off like modern movies. It is cruel in other ways, even if you're killing at a personal level. More of the image of this thinker. Once you start watching, you should not lose anything. The idea of ​​the movie and the thoughts of men in their interaction, what about the film- is not war or a big exciting storyline. <br /> <br /> If you are in the skill of war, if you read or saw programs about SAS, want to watch this movie !!!!! <br /> <br /> Compared to Cliff Robertson with Sean Connery, 49th Parallel (1941) The Hill (1965), The Naked and the Dead (1958). Everyone is unusual in their way and performs a battle at a personal level. Have fun!
