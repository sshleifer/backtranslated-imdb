Jim McKay has done one of the best movies you see in all years.The silent simplicity of this film will attract you from the early shot and never go. The whole picture does not have a bad note. There is never a hand-held camera distance and where there is no where. Three young girls are always true whose lives we are following. There is no single beat that the audience has remembered, we see the role of actresses. Only the real girls are trying to find themselves. There is no political agenda here, hidden or otherwise. It is the most fundamental level film and it is only seen by some film makers who deserve an extensive release. Special hats to Hugh Hefner provided grant money to grant this film to the producers of the film. I can not wait to see what happens after Mr. McKay.
