My room mate turned back and ordered back and finally came around watching. It's bulky. This is deafness. It's pretty dumb ... but it's a lot of fun. I mean, we were very happy about this film from the "Walking Dead City" of the years ago. It's like being in an old drive-in theater! You could tell the guy who liked this movie all the terrible dubbing zombie movies. All the stories and tricks of these films are shot in one place and it will be fine because it helps to be like that. Cheese factor is high, Gore flows and rolling laugh! Go good from sloppy, with the name one being torn in half by one man and one where both man gets shoved by his heart through his heart! Acting is really cool from horrible. No more plot, just lots and lots of gore. After the zombie movies from Italy and Spain, I acted in this film, as in the film, they sleep forever on macro scenes. If you like Troma movies, cheezy B-grade stuff, then you can make a mistake by looking at this one. A good way to waste a Friday night!
