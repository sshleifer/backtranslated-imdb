I saw its preview in Oscar night and I was drawn to this film. When I read about Kay Pollock, I hooked it up. <br /> <br /> I understand that this film is a huge draw in Sweden. As a very regional American, I guess only the reason. Perhaps Lennon's character is in the beginning of the film and I think it's the same appeal everywhere in wealthy societies, even though it is a joke that can be triggered by other social commentary. /> I like this movie's message like Titanic cinema. Life is small people and no one really knows what it's all we've got. It can be taken away at any time. So when we spend a lot of time behind the walls that separate from others, are we afraid of sadness? Waving walls is painful but it experiences alive lives on the other side of those wretched walls. The risk of taking the risk of being alive is worth. Give and receive you. <br /> <br /> Many people are criticizing the film. I'm saying you are all pseudo-sophisticated. <br /> <br /> Join a team or band or help build a home or distribute food. Less fortunate than you. Spend some fun when you come out of your fellow man and make the world a better place. Writing a check is not enough. We are a social race by the way. <br /> <br /> You can also influence yourself in ways you never imagined about your fellow human beings. <br /> <br /> Rugged personality is in place, but it is over-rated.
