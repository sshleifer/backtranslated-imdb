I feel like a big movie buff. I was ill on bed and popped in this movie. From the right side I looked at the astonishment of these great actors, I have never seen, and have said great words. The filming is beautiful. This is what I needed. I hope this message will be heard on any bad comments written by others. The director has a heart and it is struck across with his actors. Thank you for making this film a movie. Beautifully flawless and elegant at once beautifully beautiful characters. It was great. Since I can not post all these 10 lines, I would like more from this director than I want more from some other writers from all the actors in the film. I did not want to finish it. End
