Well after all is a nice surprise. While its trailer does not expect a good image, it's also a bit misleading. Part of the Jeff Bridges in particular is a positive surprise, well written, stupid and funny. Even though it is less true, I do not think I'm the one who thinks that I have shown such worthless signals for everything that his current firm has sustained. Suddenly, he does not succeed at all. At the end of the film, Dolce Vita's performance, very wheat, clich√© and very frustrating. And of course a person like Peg's character is not the last in his first week as a Blitz New York magazine like this. I hope one day I will see a good role written for Megan Fox, where she hoped she saw a poor actress playing a bimbo. And by the year, see why she is "sex symbol", I see hot girls on almost every cover of each magazine.
