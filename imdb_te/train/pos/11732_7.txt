Well, why did I see it when I saw it in the theaters and I do not know why. I did not see it yet, but I ended this page because I was thinking about the film - I do not know why. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This makes it easy to do the right thing, but it's wrong ... is anything worse than bad comedy? Steve Martin, pay attention, you are falling in this category for some reason. <br /> <br /> Elvirla Mistress of Darling is a must for me to remember this movie. With quick speed, with the tongue in the cheek, it is learned that it is not a fidelifie story, it's done from the beginning. Brain Donors is exactly the right one in this category (sans are very thankful boob jokes). <br /> One controversial position - the end. The authors / directors do not know how to complete comedy. The end, tries as a love story, and somewhat reduced the rapidly-paced conversation with that agility. Then there was the "awkward" scene. But it (male opinion) has to be seen, it's the shock that comes out of the top and place. <br /> It is not a comedy genius like Spinal Tap or The Producers or The Holy Grail. But if you do not try to divide it out, just pussies and fun are coming to you, you laugh, I promise.
