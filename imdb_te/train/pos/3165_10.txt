It is one of the funniest and greatest comic strikes to hit domestic television. Its unfortunate program is not really placed in the great comedy series. The actors have an excellent job and are on display at its peak of a thru six of the seasons. Although Season 7 is not as big as the last six years, it's still funny. Season 8 was repulsed without a tower Grace or Ashton Kutcher. Other actors are not as great as Danny Maesterson, Wilder Waldramah Kurtwood Smith, Debra Joe Rope, Mila Kunis and Lara Propop (Don Storks and Tommy Chong are too great). This will have the same effect. The inclusion of Randy (Josh Meyers) could not help because the performances did not come well. If the program ended a year ago it was sure that Sitcom would have run out of history as one of the greats. Season 8 is a little disappointing, but the ending is fantastic. I'm missing in the show, I hope to take one day to miss the show, and I'll lose it in the 80th appearance with the same actors because I will lose it.
