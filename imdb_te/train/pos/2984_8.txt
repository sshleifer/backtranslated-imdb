David Zucker is one of the most enjoyable comedies of the year with this goofy farce. Yes, this is related to the purchased flavor and depends on the wealth of sophomoric garments, but it is very fun as recent fun attempts. The film is filled with all kinds of jokes, which clearly does not appear clearly, you should pay attention to everything in the frame or you will lose them. Like their previous efforts like "Airplane!", "Top Secret!", And "Naked Gun", humor flies almost every second. There are many moments of work, it's easy to overlook some to fall flat. This film, which differs from other pedophiles in the spoof style, is a realistic story. While others are based on some of the most famous films (please, please "Mafia!"), The film tells a new story with characters who love it. This is usually because of touching the special sports industry on sports movies and instead of making specific movies. "South Park," its creators, Matt Stone and Tray Parker, are indifferent people even made a good couple leading actors with natural chemistry. Athletics, Sports Announcers, and other distinguished characters, especially using Robert's stock's "Delightful Mysteries", make a delightful bit more effective. By the way, be with credits for the last joke with Bob Costas and Al Michaels. Overall, Zucker gained words in sports mink sports, home dunk.
