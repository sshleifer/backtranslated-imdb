Despite some negative comments, the film is received in IMDb pages, a story about survival between two different individuals with different psychoanalysis while still in the fascinating and difficult task of the Panamanian forest. Peruvian director Louis Llosa will take along with us to see this thriller set in Panama. Beckett has some good moments to eliminate a brutal drug cartel head and corrupt army general who has recently become the next president of the country, taking the veteran sea and new arrival. <br /> <br /> Miller, a new arrival in the jungle, is fighting against infiltrations in the gorilla war between wild and drug lords. American intelligence men learn a valuable lesson from Beckett. <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger is an actor who does not quite register because he is proving in this movie, but in the context of the movie, he looks good in theory. Some words are a man. <br /> <br /> For fans of action movie "sniper" takes about 112 minutes. The trim bit was more satisfying.
