The Midnight Cowboy did a big fuss when it was released in 1969, which drew an X rating. According to today's standards, it is stressed to reduce a R rating. Joan Buick, Joe Buck, is succeeding in his role in the town heck out, wanting to make big with ladies in his New York City. He meets a CD Street Hustler named Ratso Resio, who loves Buck for his own purposes. The two finally duplicate a touching and enthusiastic bond. Like Rosto, Dustin Hoffman just shines. Hoffman is often brilliant, but never in this role. He is comparable to everything around him. Losing an Academy Award for John Wayne was one of the most ridiculous decisions made by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Director Schleininger has an ingenious hand with his production, but there is a serious underbelly that loses bad taste in the viewer's mouth. It is worth seeing only Hoffman's performance.
