Based on Saint Louis of Robert Louis Stevenson, the film describes the story of the young French houser Captain (Jean Marc Bar) during the Napoleonic Wars. He was captured in the war and was sent to prison in a war camp in the Scottish Highlands, run by Major Forker (Richard I Grant). In short, he falls in love with the local girl (Anna Farell), friendship with Major, and learns that his long-lost grandfather, who fled from France during the Revolution, is coming up the road! Spirited shows from all actors and some memorable lines make this an average submission.
