I love this show that it follows the lives of modern witches and there is an explosion to experience their daily love, humor and adventure. The literature of magic is diverse, portraying the ideas of classical, medieval and modern wizardry such as Harry Potter and Sabrina. With Sabrina the Teenage Witch, the show is very fun because it feels great for us a modern wizard, worth seven seasons! This show has great features and is happy to see Sabrina live in her moral life and "other" country. I would recommend this to any family because the television series is clean, funny and adventurous. Classic!
