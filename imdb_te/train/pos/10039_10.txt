Titanic is a classic. I'm really surprised that the overall IMDb user ratings did not have a solid 10 overall overall. Perhaps, it's good not to give the Titanic credit right now, but it's really something when it comes first. When the movie came, people moved to the theater. When it comes to my sister in the video, I watch twice a month. It is safe to say we are engaged and good for good reason. Some of the disaster scenes have been forgotten as a frozen infant, or someone who committed suicide after killing someone in an unruly crowd. Many people died on the ship, and it was a tough challenge to James Cameron in the film with immediate urgency and emotion. And do not forget the amazing love between Jack and Rose. Whether their relationship is as predictable is that it is lovely. They only know each other, but they die each other. They believed each other. They certainly believe that hell gave runs to Romeo and Juliet for their money. "I'm Jack, let's go." Titanic is very large. This is a powerful story, with amazing performances, amazing cinematography, beautiful music and full staff of hard and dedicated workers. It really melted my mind when someone told me to hate this movie.
