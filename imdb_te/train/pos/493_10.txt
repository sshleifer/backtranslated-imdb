As long as I can remember I'm a Star Trek fan. I'm very happy when they announced the fifth series and the premiere. <br /> <br /> The Enterprise's Premier Waiting is well worth the wait. It is well done with a thorough setting and great acting work done by all the characters. NX-01, enterprise is the perfect role to show the beginnings of many people who come to love. <br /> <br /> Scott Bukula is ranked as the captain of Jonathan Archer. Jolene Bllok gave a commanding performance as a sub-commander T'Pol. It is boldly the two people of this wonderful new crew to take us into the great history of Starfight. <br /> It looks like Enterprise is going to be a good series worth looking at well, and I like it. Look.
