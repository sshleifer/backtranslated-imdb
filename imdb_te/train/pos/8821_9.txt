The question is, does not this entertaining really be considered a "bad" image? The fact that my husband and I have the words "Vestronine Pictures" on the title and the box picked this up at a used video store for 99 cents (Vestron I received the "Subdivision" and "Class of 1984" mythical images from the first to be considered the highest quality since). We can not imagine that this film is not complete. Your basic plot is as follows: This Gragosk Thug, from the planet Earth, strengthens the "Moon of Bank" and punishes the penalty colony and other minerals in the remote planet for bauxite (not even remember the name of the planet). The "governor" of the colony and mine owner are exploiting the prisoners to the workers. Walker is a bountiful hunter (the only one on the entire planet is only one of three) Remains prisoners who have only one shuttle out of the planet and they have to escape, because they have to deal with. An unnamed "Colonel", then a retired bounty hunter suffering from a haunting reoccurring nightmare. Most of the films around the "Futuristic" car include a group of explosions (dunebuggies with plywood pitching on the sides). The planet is also suspiciously seen as Heming, CA or other dirty Inland Empire settlements. But the film is really shining and it has a number of LA punk bands between the 80s that make a surprisingly awesome soundtrack. I'm suspicious that this soundtrack was always emphasized to the vinyl, but it is buying a movie for the soundtrack. I can not remember the names of other bands (they were listed in credits) than the white muesos, because I heard it before seeing this film, but I'm sure I'm sure <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is definitely not waste your time and the best beer 12 pack and Some of the closest friends will be enjoyed.
