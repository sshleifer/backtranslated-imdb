Although the film has performed a drama in the center or dramatic, the story is beautifully and deftly and the performance is fantastic. <br /> <br /> When Yarra is studying at Princeton, her oldest and beloved friend, Talia's funeral, returns to her native Israel. As her mother died, Yara practiced with her friend's parents, and she lost her foster sister. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, this is death. Without sight, she has insight. Even if she can not see it, she can see what she has seen over "normal" people around her. <br /> <br /> The Taliban's past and present in the house of her paternal family, in tapes, diaries, and people, with a view to recollecting memories of her relationship with Thalia, is also from her perspective, because what she heard, She believes, and sees her imaginations. The mystery is not a solution to the solution, but the search is maintained with such microphones, and the pat moment is easily forgiven and beautifully and without a fan-provided answer. The facts are neutral and more evident, not only Thiaia's life, but also her relationship with Yara. As Yali, Tali Sharon uses her mobile face and voice effectively, and is entirely reliable as adult and young. <br /> <br /> The places and activities are repeated with very little variations. Acting by small roles, and an interesting decision to represent Talia as a teenager. I'm Gary, Talia's last boyfriend, with Yara's final announcement with the edge on the hill, but when it goes to the edge, the film is very sharp because it's more than a memorable thing to remember her words.
