- After the death of their sons in prison, Adelle (Debbie Reynolds) and Helen (Shirley Winters) fell because their sons easily fell off because the phone receives threatening phone calls. The couple decides to go to California to escape trial and start a new life. They will soon launch a very successful dance school. One of the students was married to a rich married father. In the meantime, Helen rabbits are busy breeding and the evangelist is very low on the radio. <br /> <br /> This is just a time before both men fall apart and women are in the mad world and murdered. <br /> I can not help, what is the meter with Helen? Shelley Winters, who has sleeves in Auntie's room. In the presentation of the movie Ruth, the film was almost imprisoned, and the film does not capture Helen again. It's a good deal when running the movie, but once she gets hit, Helen is a bad mad munta. You should not mess with her. I thought it was impossible for winter to enjoy her performance. I'm going to spoil the movie, but Helen is fully capable. <br /> <br /> - Winters are good, Reynolds is excited about his golden role as excavator pump dancer. I thought she felt in a film that was nominated for some awards. This is not Citizen Kane! Leave a very serious acting. <br /> <br /> Hey, Debbie, you do not realize that you are the victim of Winters' insanity with the main purpose. <br /> <br /> These former female-stars - their career horror movies. What is Matter with Helen? Any fun.
