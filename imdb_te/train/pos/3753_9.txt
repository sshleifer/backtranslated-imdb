This short film will soon stimulate the full-length feature - The Madness Madness - a joyous piece of struggle against cartoons that provide many authors. After being removed from his job, Edward the Spatula is struggling with a nasty spoon. This campus allows for some funny things near the beginning, but it is not available for the remaining features. The 15-minute running time of this film is perceived by some odd-ball comedy and a small musical number. Unfortunately, it is very small. There is no time to show the plot really set. But it is much better than most high-budget hollywood films. This picture is worth watching at least a few times. Take it for anything, and do not expect a deep story.
