Ralph Micker's offender role (Lawson) tells the story of Barbara Stanwick's Helen, after receiving the perfume's hamstring taken from her husband / husband, in Tijuana ...! This line cracked me, and looked like a metaphor for this movie - expensive than expensive because the cheapest perfume-2 person who has 2 x 4, is the longest-looking good man! I agree with some other comments about Helen's attraction to Lawson. Even though she wanted to keep her out of lassen, she was attracted to her fiery nature and the passion that was moved in her was no longer wet!
