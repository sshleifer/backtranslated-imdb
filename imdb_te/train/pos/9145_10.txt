In this semi-autobiographical film featuring little stellar home life, Prince is starring, but a comedian young musician. Acting (avoiding Morris Day and especially Clarence Williams are both pitch), but the film is still great and is the best since the 1980s. It has the best soundtrack of many movies over the last 50 years, the most exciting lines, and the dumpster scene Helios! Plus Apollonia is just simply amazing. It was not a relationship, and when I saw Prince in concert in 2004 he stormed the stadium. <br /> <br />] Producer Robert Caballo, & Director of Photography Donald Thorin; Theater trailer; "Cherry Moon Under" Trailers and "Graphite Bridge" Disc 2) 12-minute feature in the First Avenue Club; "Purple Rain: Bachstage Pass (I'll review the half hour scene of this film on its page);" Rifs and Revolution: The Impact and Influence of Purple Rain "10 minutes feature; 30 minutes MTV premiere 5 Prince Music Videos A Star and Purple Rain) by a music video for The Time (Jungle Love and the Bird) and Apollonia 6's "Sex Shooter" <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: A Oloniya shows her fine ass pieces
