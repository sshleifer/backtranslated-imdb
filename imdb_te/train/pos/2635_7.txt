My Take: A funny take on the Lion King, as a sequel. Surprisingly amusing. <br /> Surprisingly, "The Lion King 1 1/2" is actually another funny simplified video that is valuable for theatrical treatment. Why Disney did not release this video directly, and did not see releasing the thriller films like "Chicken Little" and "Return to Find". <br /> <br /> The films appear better in video movies (rather than in the "new releases") than watching their theater posters outside the theaters. The events in "Simba Pride" have not yet been done), from Timon (voiced by Nathan Lane) and Pumba's (voiced by Ernie Sabella). They will watch the events in the first film. Original songs from the first film, such as Matthew Broderick, Vaughy Goldberg, Chechy Martin and Robert Gillam, rewrote some vibrant comedy, such as Julie Cavner and Jerry Stiller Tamon's mother and Cruzham Mama, returning to their vocal roles from the first film. /> <br /> So this sound is not fun. Maybe not now, but see for yourself. It makes the fact that it is not so serious in its story. It is similar to MST3000 with Timon and Pumbaa. <br /> <br /> Video Movie Rating: *** 1/2 of 5.
