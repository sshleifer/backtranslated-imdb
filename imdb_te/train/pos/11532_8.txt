Well, this is one of those movies that I caught on the chance to turn off, and it was good enough to record it when it arrived at the next time ... Like me, since you are a little committed to enjoying the horror flicks of many of the 80's (ie not another glate of the general sequel) You can enjoy it. When the bad guy eventually turned to the person, I did not want to see him perfectly! Overall, I can not go out of your way for this, but if you like the genre you see it and have an hour and a half to kill you, I guess. I'll give 10 to 6.5.
