Daughter's words poetry: "I can not go another year, I've come to a hotel room." "I lost my blue shawl in the ocean's sea." "Rauls and cats have become a little boring for a long time." "The nest of the little rat, the mouse hole I like the best "And there is wisdom in the words of the mother:" ... Yes joy is all mine. "" This little book preserves me directly and is directly a color. " Everything you need to do. "" Where did you come from? "" ... I have some professional music with my little radio. "" I'm your mother, do you remember me? " .
