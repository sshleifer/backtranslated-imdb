"The Woman in Black" is one of the easiest British ghost stories. A young lawyer came to a small town to manage the client's dead client and chased a mysterious woman dressed in black. The maximum effect is possible and distributed with very strange atmosphere and frights. The action viewer is deeply involved and keeps the end very disturbing. Acting is amazing and tension is almost unbearable at times. A truly creepy horror film gives you a look this if you want to look. I dare anyone to see "black in the lights" only off the night lights. Highly recommended 10 out of 10.
