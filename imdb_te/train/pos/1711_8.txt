The second directing of Abhay Deol, by Immigi Ali, was Shivam Nair's first directing venture. Soha probably plays the role of her first (?) Mamitra in the mega flick away from her house and waits for her to meet her boyfriend Dheeraj (Shayan Munshi) at the Registrar's office in Delhi. She looks forward and stands up and finally recognizes herself as a young girl in distress by Anushu (Abhay Deol). He pulls her out of a sad condition on another day and finally falls in love with her. Then the boyfriend comes back! Hoof pardy par deckie! Sound familiar? This is another adaptation of Dostoevsky's white knights with a bit of borrowing from Le Notti Bianchi (though small too - it keeps the love lovers separated by her dead boyfriend!). But it is a different and realistic (duh) adaptation than a very relative and capable Savari. <br /> <br /> The Delhi settings are fantastic - Old Delhi, Jama Masjid shots from the roof, Connaught Circus, Rickshaw Streets (What? How?). The colorful light games in the hotel is enough to tell you a seedy joint of rooms for hiring through the hour! <br /> <br /> I have seen Abi's more this young man. In this second film he is very good for the hire witness who is given a benefit in the life of a beautiful woman. Soha looks beautiful, and when she laughs, she plays a role, but I can not believe her in more extreme moments. She does not know exactly what she is to be a great actress, or she ends up like her brother. The music is not great for rehashmya, the fact that the film's songs are sunk, which kind of interrupted the story and did not sit well with the characters trying to sing them. The supporting cast is amazing and I want to give you a thumbs up for this White Nights adaptation. BTW - The fact that I love the lovely portraits of Abhay Deol is nothing with my rating.
