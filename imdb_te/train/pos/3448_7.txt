<br /> <br /> Let's say this comment is more than spoof, and it's commenting on Japanese society. This film is continuously an absurdist documentary, when it comes to a steady vocabulary, it goes faster and is poorly translated - in its current festive version, which appeared tonight at Copenhagen Cinematek - it is still very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> But for the patient, and really patient and open-minded, I'm talking to you that Jim Jurassou reunites the fans, I believe this is a movie for you. <br /> <br /> Very beautiful, and very kitsch and very Japanese sub culture. And very experimental. Static 2D in a 3D world. All in all, fun for those who want to see a Japanese movie with Japanese food culture spoofs. If you are in the mood for something different then a thumbs up.
