The documentary Big & Little Eddie Biel follows the lives of mothers and daughters, who lived in their family building in the mid-50s in the mid-70s in East Hampton, NY.

"Little" Eddie often seems to be trapped in the past, focusing on the choices she has made decades ago, and she displays the younger images, where she is clearly visible. Her mother resigned her fate and found the rest of her life in terrible circumstances. From the pictures of the older Edi's grand picture next to her bed, pictures showing a joyous family, there are definite references of the two beautiful life that women once lead to.
