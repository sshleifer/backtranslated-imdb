The British Air Pilot George Taylor (a gorgeous depiction of Guiseep Pambaye) was beautiful and brisk by a group of thugs after a forest night in Hong Kong. George Sweet and Virgin is falling in love with Dr. Amy Wang (charming and lovely performance by Chai Lee). George reclaims his health and returns to work. When Emy fails to hear from George for a long time, she succumbs to frustration and becomes a prostitute. The film does not have anything to do when the director / co-writer Bitcoin Alberini really delivers the satisfying amount of delicious nudity and the consistent soft-core sex, but your routine is flawless. Instead, it's a surprisingly thoughtful, touchy and tragic love story (especially bright and lovely as Emy Wang) between two well-drawn and most attractive characters. The movie is bubbly and happy, but the tone turns into a tight and tough mood for about two-thirds on the way. After her mistaken belief that George left her, he was of the descendant of Emi, with an extraordinary regret and a hearty surprise bummer. Of course, the story is definitely dramatic, but not too silly or tragic. In addition, sex scenes are very tastier and realistic. Fake Italian porn star Inna Stallar has a good role in playing a good role as George's jealous and unemployed secretary Helen Miller. Guido Mankori's polished cinematography offers the most striking shots in exotic locations. Niko Fideno's funky, throat score groove spot. Worth a value for those seeking something different.
