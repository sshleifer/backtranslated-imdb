'Moon Struck' love story. There is not a romance, at least three, but they belong to the same family. Loretta family. Loretta (Cher) is going to marry Johnny Comerrie (Danny Io). She does not love him, but he is sweet and good man. Loretta meets Johnny's brother Ronnie (Nicolas Cage) when he visits his dying mother in Italy. He and Johnny did not speak to each other in about five years and Lauretta wanted to invite him to the wedding. <br /> <br /> You have to look at the story and love stories of Loretta's parents, uncle and aunt developers. With the cher as bright star among every seen, there is a pleasure to see. She won the Oscar for that year. Cage is pretty good, and Goofy, and Olympia Dukakis Lauretta's mother and Vincent Gardneria are excellent as her father. The film is funny, lovely and very enjoyable.
