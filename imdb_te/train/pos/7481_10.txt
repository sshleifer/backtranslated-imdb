I still agree with quote, "This is one of the best movies ever made." If you think that Vanilla Sky is just "re-made", you're not more wrong. Visually, musically, and emotionally, the film has an amazing depth. <br /> Visually, the film is smooth and sensitive at most times (early sequences with Sophia) and other times powerful and intense (Times Square) <br /> The music and sounds are perfect in the film. Nancy Wilson created an emotional and eclectic score for the film, making it more positive for a dream-like theme (Although I could get my hands on the original score for $ 60), The Beach Boys, Josh Ruiz, Spiritual, Sigur Rose, Monkes, etc. are also Crowe's other music choices, The film has exact matches (Croue has great music). <br /> More importantly, the emotional stuff in the film <br /> <br /> The best part of the film (as good as it can) is very cleverly evolved, the time you watch the movie , You catch something new - so look closely, and prepare to think! <br /> It's Cameron Crow's best work, and totally ingenious work. My filmmaking and musical inspiration came from this work alone. I honestly hit my life because there is a tendency towards honest art. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: Vanilla Sky is in its league. Own.
