<br /> <br /> If you like rap or hip-hop, look at this movie, even if you're funny, it's a simple comedy if you do not get the instructions. <br /> <br /> Most of the Highly CB4, but I have not had this little standard heart having seen. <br /> The worry is not heard from the people involved from it. This movie is very good for the spinel top, it's not too bad, I'll do so many conversations, because it's very valuable because I'm more into rap than days of rock thesis so that's my own judgment club. <br /> <br /> The rap songs are as funny as hell, and it's not all your face, primarily for finding a hint of the movie, ie physical comedy and <br /> <br /> It's very fun, where there is always a movie watch.
