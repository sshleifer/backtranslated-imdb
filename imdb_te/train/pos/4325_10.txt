This version of the Bleak House is the best adaptation of a classic novel I know. Chanchari court is a miracle to represent a character in the play. The performance is magnificent for the DoodLax, Smallwid, Crockke, Miss Flyte and two young lovers from Dulkinhorn. But the Spider Web Chancery is the whole thing, and cinematography is amazing. What version did the BBC have for the BBC to understand that this version has not seen this version in the UK for many years? I tried to learn from them, but encountered a stone wall. I finally got a DVD copy from Canada.
