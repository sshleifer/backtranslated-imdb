Cinema scenery master Cecil B. De Mille goes to Master of West. Buffalo Bill and Jean Arthur are portrayed as a nice fruitless jane as the three main themes of the old protagonist as its leaders (they never met), Gary Cooper Wild Bill Hicklock and James Ellison. The story works only for DeMille to turn off some fantastic action scenes, such as the big Indian attack. If you look at the slightly over-the-top performances of the cast, look at the role of Anthony Quinn, a young man who plays an Indian brave character who plays a very small Big Horn battle. This episode has identified him at least in Hollywood.
