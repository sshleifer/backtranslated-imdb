The film is very straightforward and scribbled in the premise: Haj to his son, an elderly Muslim young man from his old age station wagon from France, to Hussein, Saudi Arabia, where he dies for his holy Muslim responsibility. The father is clearly in faith, but the son is unsatisfactory; He agrees with the responsibility of his father than the religion, he'd rather be with his (non-Muslim) girlfriend. In many things that the son does not understand, the father is very strict and the fragility between them is the instrument that plays drama, which is very rare. However, such a good road film includes oddball letters that are faced along the way; For example, when asked for questions in Belgrade, a woman behind a woman in Croatia has expressed a word that is just a word, but it can not be found on the map. Another man in Bulgaria confirms that he can speak French but provides a broader commentary in the Bulgarian language. Occasionally there is humor - the egg sandwiches in a country want tires and meat - they gave a goat, but unfortunately (perhaps luckily for the viewer) the father flees before the Muslim leopard. They eventually make it Makkah - the Muslim equivalent of the Vatican, but very large. It's not as bizarre but lovely to western countries. The film is not trendy but it looks beautiful in its own way, a kind of National Geographic with the Spirit.
