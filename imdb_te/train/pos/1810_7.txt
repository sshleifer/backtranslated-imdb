Why some people liked this movie and why some people can not do that. For me, though, even if I notice some good bits, and impressive bits, I really like it. The animation like Charlie's dream is indeed amazing. Finally, the mixed bag, which was voiced by Judith Barrie, was the best Anne-Marie (I was physically ill when I read what had happened to her), and the carf√©s was a very spectacular villain, especially the spectacular Vick TiBack (especially "Morans I'm around Morris") and Rasputin and Warren Dan Bluth along with T.Rat is the most memorable of the villains. Charlie and Itchie are not the same sparkle, but I loved King Gator and his song. Annabelle is like "You can not come back", the film still frightens me. Unfortunately, there are some bits I do not like most. The story was blunt and vigilant, but Disney's Black Calderon suffered the same problem. There are also some dark landscapes, it seems that little children are perplexed, but the end is very sharp. Whatever the biggest flaw is the song and songs they have sung. With the exception of "Let's Make Music Together" and "Love Survives", none of them, and Burt Reynolds Pandaleau and Dome Dulise were a great singing. All in all, a watchable movie, would have been more, but definitely memorable, and I would definitely see again. 7/10. Bethany Cox
