Man on fire, definitely one of the best drama / crime thrillers I've ever seen. The slow-moving story is amazingly complex and intimate, and it sticks well together. This is the definitive role he has for Denzel Washington, in which he is known as the Creepy, who suffered his past torment and was an alcoholic but never gave his latest protector, his destiny to save Pita. The Dakota Funning plays the role of Pita, very clever, enthusiastic little girl loves so many things, and works in a very persuasive manner, she is ahead of her great future. <br /> When I say that this story is somewhat complicated, you have to look at it twice. <br /> <br /> This film is made in two parts, the first hour is, nothing is wrong, everyone lives their lives just happy until the kidnapping of the pita and where the creepy is almost killed. Then the second part, the rest of it, suddenly becomes complicated, and when killing and killing "Hermannad", responsible for planning and killing many criminals and "La Hermannad" Displaying the talent that works together with many talented stars in the future Shows him as. This is a real shame that the film is not well-recognized, and Washington is truly another Oscar worthy of his performance, and Fanning and director. <br /> <br /> If you like exciting, slightly disturbing, breathtaking thrillers, this is one to see. The most amazing thing is that the elements of this film are actually true story and true characters! 10/10
