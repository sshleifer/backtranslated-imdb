In all the seventies of the seventh, no one has ever captured the essence of the evil war as good as the Sentinel. I mean, yes, movies like the Exorcist, and the other ones; But none of them captured the human element of the character. If you have time, check it. You may not be able to get the dated devices out of date, but it's worth the entry into the story. Then there are all the stars and the stars asap. My absolute favorite is Eli Wallach, Sylvia Miles, and Burgess Meredith. There are subtleties that lead to what is then happening. Take care of yourself. I had to look four times to grab all the little weird ads like 'black and white cat, black and white cake'. Plus, the books are really good. I'm sorry that the second book is going to be a film. It is very scary to overcome this film.
