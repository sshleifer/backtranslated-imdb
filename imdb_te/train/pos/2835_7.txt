Thanks to Hong Kong VCD / DVD distributors I have paid US $ 1.4 and I have such a surprisingly joyful experience. <br /> <br /> How common is it in our modern days? Eva kidnapped her two children and kidnapped Nick after Luis and Charlotte reached Italy. <br /> <br /> In this small indie production, Vivian Nafee has been dealing with teething problems in a modern wedding. A light heart. How can people in the physical, psychological, and technological areas deal with marriage in the fast food, which is now more mobility? Many people ask for respectful commitment to the cost of choosing to surrender to circumstances. Nick once believed Charlotte but he fell for Eva after the abducted journey, and he had to experience much improvement. <br /> <br /> Eva and Nick are so happy that many viewers can be pleased with their wives' betrayal. Anyway, I want this sequel, and I want to see how the four after this exchange develops. <br /> <br /> Good acting and good looks. Two young child-actors, especially the boy, should not be neglected when he's at the reception of the hotel in Venezia. And of course, how do we forget the city's "Bella, Bella" scenery.
