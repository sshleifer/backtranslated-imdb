I remember, George's lyricist and brother Ira Gershwin gave the film a Gershwin catalog and was produced by the producers. In many ways, it helped a lot from the 50th film music and Jean Kelly, directed by Vincent Minelli through the Freed Unit in MGM. <br /> <br /> Gershwin, not all Broadway musical teams But, in my opinion, George is the greatest period of all American composers, as long !!! Jean Kelly, of course, is one of the two greatest dancers in cinematic music (the other one is an assessment?) And I can never imagine his casting doubt. But I think the rest of the cast is needed for some explanations: Oscar Levant is a popular personality of his time and as a true friend of George Gershwin, he should be in the film. He is a talented pianist and a moderately talented composer and well-known nervous and unhealthy and here he always plays himself. <br /> Leslie Coron is unknown at this time and she is the type of French "race". For the talented dancer, she is not always a real beauty. George Gower, who plays Maurice Chavalier, who is Henry Barrel, is not Greek and French but he is definitely a French bouquet, even though it is too short. The voice of Jean's hoofer is the services here but Gu√©tary has very good voice materials. Jean plays a very good role, where he also says he has some heel where he is in "Rhine in the Sinte", although Jen is good. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, "I Got Rhythm "There is no witch with a scene. <br /> <br /> But the highlight of this film is clearly a long ballot, great French Impressionist painters with sets and costumes based on the title music of the title music. <br /> <br /> When artists struggled, I realized that Jean and Oscar were hard to believe, and Gershwin Music worked very well. <br /> <br /> The DVD should have good graphics) and the mono sound is good but a worthless shallow.
