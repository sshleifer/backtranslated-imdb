Well, I say everything in summary, I simply adore the movie and the cast ... I gave an Oscar for each actor ... great, great movie ... I'm now 25 and I've seen 4 times different times and I always do not cry And I always say, about 2 or 3 times ...;) meryl s. It is definitely brilliant, Jeremy fabric is also amazing ... I wish the film would receive more awards ... I really did not know who did not know it and did not love it ... also, glenn is close to amazing. .. The story is beautiful and sad at the same time ... I loved the fact that despite everything Clara and esteban too loved each other, and the fact that Blanca is closer to her parents ...
