I'm a little surprised at this movie because the highest score in the IMDb - the average rating of 9.0 with over 300 votes is the highest rating for any available silent film! How did I hear about this movie before this website? Well, you can not always trust ratings. Main, Brown Haynes as well as Climbridge will do a good job at Climactic Harvard through fine actions - this is good if I have any indication of the transfer of the paid VHS. But the story itself must have appeared in a gorilla chestnut in 1926 - Yale football game. The wicked, self-centered and charismatic person goes to school and puts him in place, becoming a caring, self-sacrificing friend in the process; I guess that in 1926, people found that the last few reels were really exciting in predicting predictability. However, it starts very well, and remember if you do not praise the heavens. <br /> <br /> Now more than a thousand voters are Harvard men. <br /> Now editing 600+ voters, the score has actually reached 9.2! Seriously, folks, there's a ballot-stuffing here - I'll explain to anyone why it's a better film than "Metropolis" or "General"!
