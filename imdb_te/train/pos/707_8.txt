Be honest and tell me that I have not seen many independent films, but I thought I did this very well. Direction and cinematography are drowning without turning into a distraction. The angles, settings, and lighting used were successful, in which the main character was trapped. It happens long after your long and memorable pictures in your mind (always a good director's icon).
