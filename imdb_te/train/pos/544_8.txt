I liked this movie. This is the first (cabin of the lake), not only killing women, but also killing men. And the scenes are very interesting, the first of my favorite scenes was in Stanley and Allison Dancing Club and before Kimberley's last moments before she was dropped in water, and secondly, in the dungeon when they visited Stanley Allison, before they kissed her. Those scenes were very intense and inspiring to me. I thought this movie was not bad, but since the movie is not bad, it is as if the movies are usually portrayed as you see that nothing is wrong. Shot, you can not see the "live" camera shooting, but then, much less, you will notice the filming mistakes. What was wrong
