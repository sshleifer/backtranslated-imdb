<br /> Each star wars have an idea about Fan, I, II & III, because the atmosphere and the characters of the original trilogy, I get good points of "The Return of the Jedi" and some related bad points of the prequel ll. <br /> <br /> The original trilogy and we get to us in this special film: - A strong environmental concern - Military positions - lovely ideas about the Jedi order and force - cute creatures - Harrison Ford's smile - killer scene: At the end, Son and Emperor The malignant haze reflects on his black helmet. When locked up and handed over to his master to protect Luke, he will hurt his own life! What's wrong with Primal Inmo: - The whole "human element" element that pushes the original cast is somehow - much more than force superpowers and knowledge - too much jedis and a lot of light on the screen - lack of actors experience Most often threatened the add-on of the plot <br /> <br /> You are the Obie Web (Obi Wen, I mean) and Yoda described the Force Enjoy okka theory, then you should read some books about Buddhism and forms of ancient Japan. <br /> <br /> Star Wars, IMHO has a continuous spiritual legacy primarily from his employer to his apprentice, despite the difficulties of his father, his son. "Day Mo Mama About Ton" (from my soul), and finally Jen Master writes Bezard to T. Decimor.
