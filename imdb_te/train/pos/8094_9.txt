The first is nothing but the book as good as it is when you deal with a master writer like Tolkien. This adjustment summarizes Tolkien's universe with the 1970s skylichia, aesthetics, and modern culture. Yes - animation and background painting is sometimes a bit "hard" in its technical implementation, but it does not appear to be less and beautiful to give a unique "sense of place" for every single scene. Above the absolute distinction in the films, absolutely outstanding voice acting - FAR's superior performance for new live action films. Although cell animation is not very "technically talented" animation, it captures the expression of acting body and face gestures. Background images vary altogether from the traditional "fantasy" motif, but the transition to the compiled settings is always encouraged by the narrative and greatly contributes to the themes of the film. If you have an extensive computer language in a picture, you can imagine everyone else for you, then you can see how you do not like this movie, but you can see this film with superior acting, infinity, and JRR Tolkien.
