I enjoyed how to deal with the reality of this film's innocence and the reality that has a powerful animal in the middle of the characters. Gorilla is simply amazing, and the eyes are especially lifelong. It should also be a little scary at times and a little frightened without going up the kids. Ren√© Russo plays a brilliantly feminine role. This type of grass-man villain usually needs to create a grass-man villain, but it's just the enemy gorilla. It's an interesting form of how some animals are close to people, how they feel the same emotions, and how they should not be. There are many movies in this territory and it is valuable to think of human-animal similarity.
