I went into The Strait Story, a sad / happy type of drama with good direction and some good acting. This I got. What I do not expect is to try to face human existence. <br /> <br /> Make a simple story about a 300 km journey to the lunch and convert it into a microscope for human situations. <br /> If you do not mind, look again. Alvin joins the age of the people, by driving through the land, giving him the reactions, the negotiations he holds (the first of the miscarriage and the child, the last one out of the graveyard). The last road he goes down is dying in this case, which is thinner and his fear and fear is mounted. <br /> <br /> Last mechanical failure is the death, and the miraculous reincarnation of his engine in relation to the rest of his life, where he achieved the desired reunion. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />]
