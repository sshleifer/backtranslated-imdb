Other critics have illustrated the film Noir. I'm "Whew!" A reviewer commented about Elisha Cook's apparent coke-fueling drumming episode. This is a betrayal, I must say. Cook deserves some appreciation for his crazy performance. <br /> <br /> I'm a bit trivia: Cook 1941, a waiter in the film Barbara Stanwick, "Ball of Fire". Barbara singing and legendary drummer Jean Crupey became very powerful, he was a waiter at nightclub. Cook's drunken drumming "Phantom Lady," was inspired by Kuppa's writing in the film, much to suggest that Cook had seen 3 years before? <br /> If you look at the "Ball of Fire", you may notice some of these body movements. One thought that he was not affected by any drugs at that time!
