It's the best series of its kind I've seen all year. <br /> <br /> I am unable to help myself feel that I'm lucky - 6 series (and next year) will never end the stable streaks of the rows and cookie-cutter cop episode. Reasons new tricks were successful. The scripts are good, and the combination of characters works amazing, acting top, and comedy and drama mixture. All of the stories are not that memorable, but I can not reason to see the performances like this. <br /> <br /> The theme song is a favorite and we are disappointed because it is not available in any published issue. The great thing is that the success of the concept on the BBC-sex-appeal (who is the eye-molie from the young Constable, and he may, though, still work!).
