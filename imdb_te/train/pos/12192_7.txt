The 1947 film stars and directed and starring Rita Hawthat with Orson Welles (with a funky Irish accent) and less attractive little blonde hair. So, I was hanging with Orson at Target before torch of Evil and Citizen Kane and Third Man, but this was my first Rita Hawthart interaction. Our first meeting was well done, a terrific job she played with frightened / cage Elsa, married to a disabled millionaire attorney. Mike (Wells) and Elsa fall for each other. He wants to run with her, she does not know whether she can live without buying money. Elsa, her husband, and his partner, the bait and bite and Mike, attacked each other and proved that his previous judgment was very real. We follow in this murder mystery with many turns and turns that come to the climax of fun at home. (Think of the shootout that ended in The Sun with the Golden Gun, heavily borrowed from this scene). <br /> <br /> This image is like shrimp in garlic and lemon. The dish centers in the ocean, miniature, sour, and deep are the greatest effect. These are the best, not fresh shrimp, but good quality frozen shrimp from Costco. The pure sauce of flour shrimp adds you to a healthier filling, but more mundane, alternative fare alternative filling. 7/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
