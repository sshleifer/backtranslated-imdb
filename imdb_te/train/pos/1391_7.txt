It is considered to be a low budget, and the DAY Time will ultimately carry out its budget with a surprisingly good special effects work. <br /> <br /> The story is a discrete part-energetic dwelling place in their solar mosaic desert in southern California, which is just a trace of motorcycle vans. But their little daughter (Natasha Ryan) began to look suspicious stuff - a green pyramid, strange humanoid dolls. Recently, a trainee star has produced quite astonishing aurora in the light desert skies from the explosion. <br /> <br /> The family under Jim Davis and Dorothy Malone face themselves with the strange alien forces they are facing. Due to the excellent special effects of David Allen's, the ending of Speed ​​Odyssey and Third Connection, DAY DAY, was interesting, despite its obvious flaws and uneven performance. Desert arrangement is very suitable for the closest movements of the film; And while the film is not comparable to Kubrick or Spielberg, The Daytime Ended Today is much better than other 2001 / CLOSE ENCOUNTERS knock-offs. I gave credit to the ARCHNOPHOBIA, the precursor to the 1977 Thriller Kingdom Director John 'Bud' Cardus, which ended at least 7 days in 10 days.
