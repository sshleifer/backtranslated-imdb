"The Streets in the Streets" is a well-known little film from director Elia Kazan and was preceded by his classic masterpieces like "A StreetCard Named Desire", "On the Waterfront" and "East of Eden". Before the film, Kazan had already won an Oscar in 1947, so he was not fully aware of that time. Furthermore, "Fright in Streets" is an image approved under the radar. <br /> <br /> The great thing about this film is the Oscar winning script. There is a good feeling of crime / film-noir elements and its amazing period thriller material. <br /> <br /> The cast was not well known (especially when it was released) but it still is Zero Monel and Jack in one of their first films. Hailed as a tough gangster owner with a very powerful face. <br /> <br /> The film still drags at some points. <br /> <br /> The film starts well but after the start of the film slowly decreases and the pace is not the right decision making and is based on the story's opinion. <br /> <br /> "Streets" is a fully-featured movie, which is a belief for the film to be viewed as a film due to its stern script and powerful dialogue. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie to watch for fans of thriller style. <br /> <br />
