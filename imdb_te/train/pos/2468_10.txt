I saw Hamlet because I was in the midst of jobs. I match 4 hours will be great, I'm Branagh fan; Dead Again, Henry V. Direction, acting, cinematography have captured this film. Other reviews go as fast as 4 hours. Bragg does not play Hamlet, he is Hamlet, he was born for this. When I see this movie I'm constantly trying to find flaws, I looked at goofs and did not notice them. How did he show me how to move the camera and the camera out of all the mirrors? The film was shot in 70 millimeters. This was shy because Columbia did not release this Widescreen version in VHS. I have a DVD player, and I'll take on Titanic today. So if you are listening to Columbia, the movie is to be seen in the movie. And I do not know what happened in the Oscars. It won Best Film, Best Actor, Best Director, Best Cinematography. What movies do they see? He was pardoned for Branagh in the Oscars when he paid tribute to Shakespeare on the screen. Branagh should give a tribute to bring us one of the greatest movies of all time.
