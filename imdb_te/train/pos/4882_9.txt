It's a funny business, reviewing movies. These days, "inner feelings" and "emotional restraint" in accordance with the ideas that are flexible, it is difficult to be confident about your true feelings. /> <br /> The jury of 58 tasks to complete the berlinello <br made immediately after the screening I <br /> <br /> I have the theater hall, blue eyes, men, women, and came out from the reviewers. /> <br /> Director of binilel <br, gattipaina as a viewer of the film, also admitted to have sounded sentimental experience and the inappropriate way in three quarters, was crying himself. <br /> Next comes. Despite being engaged in the film, many critics are polite and emotionally in their work. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p>> Pre-War Japan, kabiyi story of the Imperial will, "thought crimes" as abhivarnincinanduku After being put in jail, a writer's family revolves around and revolves their fate. Long by emotional scenes, Yamada man, his loyal wife, and two daughters, as well as the three men, was introduced to the characters, the man of the beautiful princess, a former student of men, and the uncle of a forest? ? <br /> <br /> The story moves slowly though slowly, and the heartbeat occurs exactly at moments. Expected. <br /> In other words, you will learn to love the family and their supporters and their unfortunate sympathy.

I did not read in my breath. In the final analysis, "Kabiei" is more than a film about a family that breaks up with an empire on the edge of the war. In fact, a common man has a fraudulent scrutiny: how much we think about the secret concepts of people who are close to us. <br /> Now, the most common criticisms about this film are technically great, but there is no innovation. I guess what happens when the reviewers put their caption idea cap. With Kabei, I believe Yogi Yamada knows what trick he wants to employ to touch a unique element of humanity. A bad old trick he applied smoothly in the Tara-San sequence, and later used by Tasagara in Sebi. <br /> <br /> After mocking the audience in the audience composing zone, he rarely explores the emotions in the movie. <br /> <br /> It is the most efficient cinematic tool for all of my life.

Human emotions. Pure and simple.
