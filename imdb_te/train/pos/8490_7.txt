Recently I saw this film in my international business class. Imagine my surprise when I get this film, actually a picture, which does not expect anything other than the other boring documentary (I would not say the documentary does not love the documentary just bad luck just bad). <br /> <br /> The film is about cultural differences in the workplace and tell them how to get them. The culture of conflict shows how different the world is, and we can perceive ourselves to come and call on us to wake up. I would recommend this to anyone in the business or to laugh, because yes it's funny. <br /> Okay, it's about it! Cheers
