Following the lives of the Tigerland group in 1971 to fight in Vietnam, <br /> <br /> At this time, America is fighting for a losing battle and director us through a 16mm handheld documentary shot of many employees' lives in 'Tigerland' training camp in Louisiana. <br /> <br /> The film is not a real plot of movie study, but it is a clever and clever man who is trying to escape from a key camp character Roland Bose. <br /> <br /> We have received many characters from the unit to hear this story. <br /> <br /> This is a great story to say about this Vietnam, notably the army. And very memorable. As well as the use of the directors of the film and style works very well, cause you seem like a lot like the old movie footage looking in relation to Vietnam. It is great to see how the film shows all the internal issues and issues that are very important for the fighting. When looking at how a teacher is using a radio for a special scene coming out of a training mission, everything is just about a brief war ... it's futile. <br /> <br /> Excellent image. Not just about the Nam, but by being in the army, it is determined to be morally appropriate. </ P> <p>
