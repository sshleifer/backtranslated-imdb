I think this film is very well integrated. Voice-overs are also great. I liked how they crossed their contradictions and reached their goals. I would recommend this film to anyone. It's definitely time to see and worth the money. Atlantis laughs at some funny scenes. Other scenes were sad to me. Others were pleased with me. It is an image that can enjoy at any age. From the moment the Milo foolish "Professor" or until he collects up the crew for excellent voyage under the sea. When I saw the movie, I read the book. It's fine, but the picture keeps good pictures in your mind. It looks like a book. But go ahead and see this movie!
