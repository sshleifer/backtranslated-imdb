I love this movie. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra is not very likely to sing much in this movie but it's still not another Frank Sinatra movie. <br /> <br /> I actually thought Melanel Brando would use his own voice, he was in tone and could not see the gangster feel with this great voice. <br /> <br /> Stubby Kaye's "Sitting, You Are Rockin" The Boat "Pat-Toppin", Pade-A-Long I loved it. <br /> <br /> Vivian Blaine is simply wonderful in this episode and she likes her songs "Adelaide's Lumenth." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "We are going to make you feel like you are doing this. I do not change a thing if it happened in 2008. <br /> < br> <br /> <br /> I think the movie is well cast. I gave performances in these regional forms and it was one of my favorite of that time.
