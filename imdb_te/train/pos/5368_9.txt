This is an amazing action movie with great liners from Arnie! It has the fullest and most generous actions to be satisfied. The characters are awesome, and Richard Dawson, the main villain, is very scared. Yes it has tons of plot holes, but it is a great entertaining and great ending. It's a great story, it's a lot, and Arnie and Maria's exact Alonso have great chemistry together. Character development is pretty good with some amazing performances. Good to direct! Paul Michael Glaser makes a pretty good job here, with the most awesome use of colors, keeping the stylish across, awesome camera angles, and keeping the image very fast overall! Good job. Gore is quite a bit. We have some bloody gunshot wounds, exploding head, rupture throat, bloody chain slices, skinless corpses, blood, and supplements. Performance is great! Arnold Schwarzenegger is always Amazing, he is amazing in the acting department, having tons of leisers a hilarious, that ass kicks, and is always a big physical presence !, and tons of fun to watch! (Arnie Rules!). Mar√≠a conchita Alonso is right here, she is really beautiful, and with Arnie has a good chemistry! Yaphet Kotto, here's the good, what he's doing, it's not too much. Marvin J. McIntyre, as good as Geek Man, is great! Richard Dawson is the main villain of the main villain, and is very horrified, and is happy to see him. Jesse Ventura, Jim Brown, Ernand van Liddt, Gus Rathwiesch, and Professor Toru Tanaka, they should do well as Stallers. Overall a must see! **** 1/2 in 5
