This film is about this wimpy guy who decides to become a spy for the glamorous high-tech company named Digicorp. This wimpy guy, Morgan (Jeremy Nordam) is happy with his painful suburban life and his demanding wife so he decides to become a spy. He visits meetings from other top technology companies and wants to know all the company's plans. Instead, Morgan himself was attracted to a beautiful lady (played by Lucy Liu) and the two companies worked hard by two companies that he could become a double agent. How does Morgan come out of this? Do you believe in the beautiful but mysterious Rita Foster (played by Lucy Liu)? And more importantly, Morgan can be made alive? Wow! A nifty movie! I'm totally sucked after 15 minutes watching this movie. It is very curious and can experience Morgan's fear and confusion, doing his best to stay alive. The horrific instrument that they had on Morgan's head scares him to the brain, which is very majestic and frightening. Morgan slowly passes through personality transformation, which is not clear until you think about it after the end of the film. <br /> <br /> From a wimpy person who has bad hair and glasses, he becomes active in his life. <br /> <br /> End, Wow, the end is wonderful! Twist is a lot of fun! It's so crazy that I'm crazy! <br /> <br /> I'm doing all the good performances from Jeremy Natham, Lucy Liu and Nigel Bennett.
