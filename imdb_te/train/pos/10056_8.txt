We have seen women in many societies dealing with my women's health issues, and I absolutely love this film. I will try to see the copy of what I see. The story is very touching and I would recommend to anyone. I am a fan of different cultures, this film is all about me. This is a picture, even if it gave the whole family a rating. This is a picture that I show to my children. The professor of our class has given a lot of attention to the film primarily about women, but this film is more than that. It keeps in my mind forever and is one of those movies that will be a favorite.
