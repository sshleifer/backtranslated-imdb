For the first time since I bought the 1976 film "Snuff", I heard about the film. I said the devil's experiment was much better, and I naturally went ahead and ordered the Guinea Pig box set. <br /> <br /> The devil's experiment with which story I am really interested in is that Charlie Sheen is trying to ban this film or the other, with a little film without any character development. . Only a woman is harassed by three men for about 45 minutes. She beat her and forced her to drink her wrist and she heard her a 24-hour high-pitched sound, cracked her hand with a mullet and burned her with fire. <br /> <br /> The film is a fake like most fake scenes I will say. But some of you have actually gotten a lot of money. Scenes around the woman in circular shapes look at me and scream at me. Or it is painful to think about the scene where she was forced to hear a sharp sound for 24 hours. The worst eye scene. I did not shut down when looking at it, but thought, "Damon is very good for a low budget movie." I enjoyed it but I do not know if you really do not really recommend a lot of horror style. 7/10
