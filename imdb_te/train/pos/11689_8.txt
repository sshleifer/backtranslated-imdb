Hopefully the score has changed now due to my bright and fantastic review, all of which motivates you to go into the movie and "8" will create an instant chore of the real score of the film. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock the King! I'm not the forerunner about him before watching this movie but now I'm banging on the doors of Chris Rock to begging him to take me as his savior. If the film does not look funny to you, you can not see the movie funny, imagination, imagination, class division, love, wealth, job, dreams, comedy. <br /> There is a little disappointment for me. Going into the film, it's not actually realized that Warren Betty was a remake of another good movie "Heaven Ken Wait" in 1971. I was very surprised when I saw this film and suddenly the plot started to unravel the old picture that I watched on TV a few weeks ago. Regardless of the film this is a good version of my opinion is just covers for both of them and any day in any week Chris Rock than Warren Betty The fact that you are lucky ... you get the picture. <br /> <br /> Cinema to the original plot. <br /> Do not spoil the experience for yourself! Do not read the plot! IMDb has two reviews because it has a madman, so watch a movie and watch it because it's a laughable thing you can see for a long time, it's a movie experience because it does not smile at the cost of movie tickets. Let's see this is a good movie!
