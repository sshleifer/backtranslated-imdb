The 1936 film, which plays the role of the famous classic actors and especially William Powell, (Dr. Lawrence Bradford), "Mr. Roberts", is the doctor and detective. Dr. Bradford once married Jean Arthur, (Paula Bradford), "Shane", and divorced, and they lived together and fought at all times. Paula wanted her husband to investigate a mansion and convinced her that she was the most important. Jean Arthur plays a rather nutty type and has plenty of 1936 comedy and murder mode is something you never believe, especially with a jockey in a California race track. Robert Armstrong, (Nick Martell) "King Kong" gave great support as James Gleason, a bookie along with a detective who needs help Dr Bradford to solve this very strange murder. If you see this picture, remember that it was produced and directed in 1936 and in those days people in the audience felt it was great fun and it really was in those days!
