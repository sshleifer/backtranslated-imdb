I like the Verhoeven film because in his film, I enjoy a brilliant pscychosexual story that I have seen before in "Basic Instinct" .I was an incredible thriller that really enjoyed a lot. <br /> <br /> His blockbuster was his predecessor before hitting "Basic Instinct" and I was very curious to watch that movie, and yes, the movie fulfilled my hope and expectation. <br /> <br /> The film "The Fourth Man" is a bright pscychosexual drama, a bit complex for some audience. The film's story revolves around a gay writer named "rave" (crab), a drinking man who lives through his own moral values ​​and a variety of dares to warn him from a future threat. After the end of his sermon, he introduced a seductive woman named "Christine" that had a mysterious past that did not want her to reveal. She is a boy and sex in her home. In the morning, she's on her table to see the image of sexy, macho boyfriend on her table, the guy he met at the station. It is interesting to meet him and tell him to invite Christine to his home. <br /> This is all. <br /> <br /> In particular, I have played brilliantly "Krabbe" as the character "Reve", and I want to expose that story. "I fully realized his character and yes I was like his lovely face because his acting was primarily. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />]
