Jimmy Perry and David Craft, the best program of TV ever written by Dads Army, during this battle of Sitcom, Dads is not as good as Army but still very, very funny. <br /> It is about a concert band India. For many parts BSM Williams (Windsor Davis) is trying to get the concert party, he is referred to as a punch's bunch, posted in the forest. The obscure Colonel Renault (Donald Hewlett) and Stupid Captain Ashwood (Michael Nobles) are the big fans of the concert party. Piano player Gunner "La Da D" Gunner Graham, aka Padarouski (John Clegg), singers Gunner "Lofty" at the University of Bombardier Solomans (George Lytton), Gunner "Gloria" Beamont (Ed for Melvin Hays) Sugdened, Gunner Parkins (Christopher Mitchell) (Williams Parkins considered his son, he was very wrong), the big eater gunner "Nosher" HPV and animal impersonator's (Kenneth MacDonald), he was Percy Edwards. Ram's excellent support with Char-Walhah and Punka-Wala (Dino Shaffiq and Babar Bhatti). <br /> <br /> In this program, like Dodd's Army, many coachfrases have been dropped. Rangi Ram is used to say his Punkah Vala "Do not Be Such Clever Dicky" and when he "deals with a very old Hindu nationality, eg, wife's wife, it does not stop, it's too late for me to catch your house fire" Although Williams is too coachframes. <br /> <br /> "Dodds do not show the same identity as the army did, but it probably could have caused a question of flavor: it appears to have been tied up." Williams said his men were "puffs" Although Williams has been a bore, some people have been there by Michael Bates Rangi Ram (bats but actually born in India) I think the racial discrimination topic in humor is the majority show of people who have watched the bit of an unfavorable neo show, even if half of you agree that Indian is not racist, and they are not slightly offended and I agreed as much, putting it on too much When I see an episode for the first time, I laugh more than I do for any other sitcom, but when I see the round for the second time, I do not quite laugh at all, but how many times have I been in the Dads Army <br /> Episode: The Road to Ban, Series 1, Episode 7
