One of the many musicals about vacationers on vacation, which meets the simple sailor girl, difficulties occur, the plot is sorted out happily. This is done smoothly enough but it will also drag in places. <br /> If this conversation is not 'zippy' as 'top hot', Randolph does not replace Scott. It includes Irving Berlin's singing songs, including 'Let Yours Go', 'I boss all my Goods in One Basket' and 'Let's Face the Music and Dance'. It has Fred and Ginger, as they dance and take any movie as heavenly heights and do not despair here. They are single actor, a smoke dancing, a knockout comedy dance and a trendy lovely dance! <br /> <br /> It also has Harriet Hollard, who is good in his role. She has a varied career, which became the most famous Harriet Nelson with Ozzy. Here she is without a sentiment. Her two songs were simplified and efficiently distributed. She is good contrary to Ginger but do they believe that they are sisters in the film? <br /> <br /> The film is further enhanced by a tightening. But that's fine.
