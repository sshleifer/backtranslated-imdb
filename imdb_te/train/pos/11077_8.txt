First of all, the revolver does not go into expecting another snatch or lock stack, this gangster movie. <br /> There was a different kind of <br /> I saw the other night's ceremony and the film broke up the audience. What is the type of film which left thinking about half audiences? It's terrible, and what does the other half think about? That's cool. Personally, I do not understand movies, i.e.Mullholland drive, and like normal suspects, I enjoyed Revolver. <br /> This is not exactly accurate. I saw the coming of a mile at least part, which is a great turn, and sometimes a few loose ends go unnoticed, a good revolver leaves it a lot of unexplained questions that it seems. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> I thought acting was excellent from all the major actors, Jason Stratham, Ray Liotta, Vincent Pastore, and even Andrei Benjamin (who was a pleasant surprise). This film is definitely an interesting, great, enthusiastic, action pack, one after another. When Ray Layotto is put under the table wow ... you have to look well. Soundtrack is great as most Guy Ritchie movies. <br /> <br /> If you are a little awesome than the films like Fight Club, Mulholland Drive, and Simple Suspects, an awesome fast paced, mental, action tones of many twists and turns and scenes, you will remember long after the movie.
