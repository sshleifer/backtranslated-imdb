The only show I've seen since 90210! Why did they stop it? It's the only demonstration that captured the essence of Hawaii and you feel like a part of all of you! At least they need to be released on DVD! <br /> <br /> I checked such programs, but nothing came close. The cast had excellent chemistry and I looked forward to each episode with much anticipation. <br /> <br /> They made a big mistake by pulling that presentation. If I have any information on anyone who can get North Shore's DVD, please post a few lines here. Thank you! Aloha!
