Critics did not like this film. It was bombed by the states and resulted in limited performance in Britain. It represents Britain rather than British humor in the UK and needs to be shown in Britain for the first time. <br /> <br /> Nicole Kidman looks great and fully convincing Russia. Dustin Hoffman character from Ben Chaplin 'The Graduate', and has at least 4 scenes in 'Birthday Girl', which reminds the viewer of the 1960s classic (although it is completely different!). <br /> Absolutely it changes from comedy to comedy to thriller to thrillers - but this is a breathtaking, moving and fresh air breathe compared to a mega-budget blockbuster. <br /> Open mind!
