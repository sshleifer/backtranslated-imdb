<br /> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> I thought actresses and director had done a wonderful job in this film. <br /> I did not have the pleasure to see the actress before and I was unable to set it back on an amazing job. I say the most reliable film I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> I do not see why everyone has such difficulties for choosing drugs in the attempt to commit suicide, the choice of actresses and her stupid choice. I do not understand, a movie written by someone else and directed by anyone else, so I can not see how the actress's error is. I felt like a real reliable film that I can see again and recommend. What are the opinions and its very bad are very very closely minded. <br /> <br /> Busy Phillips is finally the highest paid actress and I hope she can laugh at everyone who criticizes her! You go girl!
