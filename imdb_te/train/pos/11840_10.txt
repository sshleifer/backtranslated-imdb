I recently enjoyed the spirit and have seen 4 times in HBO and buy DVD. The negative reviews given may be 'Vanishing Point' another car chase film and 'Telma & Louise' may be another chic movie. Though the endings of those films are darker, I feel somewhat pertinent; Freedom and personality are very important and anyone wants to stay away from you. <br /> <br /> Another review here is that the film is about how the film is associated with the theme of civilization occupying someone else. Home. <br /> <br /> I thought the animations and stories were fantastic, as the animators were really visible. The Spirit's emotions are clear when the story progresses (yes, I know that they will make horses a bit manually, but it's fabulous). In some scenes you will present the forest stream and heat from a forest fire. Other more quiet scenes (which is a lot of time) allowed you to enjoy the backgrounds. The story does not speak of one of the big things that really works, the animals singing the way. If so, it will be away from the power of the story. The stream of the story instead is said by an occasional narrative by the main character, the more punch is added by the superb soundtrack. Another plus is not they afraid to give a somewhat tale to a dark side (which really made this movie watchable). <br /> <br /> This film is not prevalent through the whole movie. Moreover, fitting and stimulating the end of the session without sessions. <br /> <br /> Those who appreciate horses really love this movie, but a little more than a horse. I do not think this good image to take kids if I have grown inane fare that I gave up today. They love this movie while they are thoughtful to perform compelling stories like Lord of the Rings and Black Beauty. Hell, I'm 35 years old and still love thing.
