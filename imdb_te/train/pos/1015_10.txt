I look forward to every new episode, look forward to everybody! I hope I can never end the new look of science fiction created by Stargate SG-1. A new twist that fascinates the past with the future. Season # 9 should have a thrill. I think Richard Dean Anderson is more frequent in the new season, because I love him as Jack O'Neill in his role in his role in his role. Other roles will be a winner, adding their own specialty to a season-breaking show. You will cancel this program in the next three years, and you will make a serious mistake. Also, you need a big role for Asgard - they are very good.
