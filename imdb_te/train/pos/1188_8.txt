Initially, I am skeptical about this film (that's because), but the greatly drawn characters, the fairytale scenes of buffalo hunting and the dramatic ending it looks very valuable. I first encountered trouble between the two buffalo hunters, but as the film grew, they separated themselves. I'm still chasing the last scene.
