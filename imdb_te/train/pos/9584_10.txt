Yes these films are tops. It will recommend more. Its great doco strait for anyone who likes gay or film. Very funny, sad and interesting. Nirutsahapadakandi. Great entry. An image of interest and interest in the subject matter. Some of the shows and just amazing. It's still worth watching if you see this movie only on VHS. Great. 10 out of 10. I've seen ten years ago in this Daco years and I can not understand what I'm looking for. Interviews are revealing about the performers' exorcists such as heavy-weight boxers trying to push their way too badly. The filmmaker is clearly a first timer so what a success. Cool. Keep track of it.
