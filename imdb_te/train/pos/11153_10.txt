Viral, but innocent, big Joe Buck leaves his home in Big Spring, Texas, and hustles off to Big Apple in search of women and big bucks. In NYC, JB meets with frustration and "Rassoo" with Rizzo, an unbalanced but natural con artist. <br /> Anyway, this unmatched pair is to survive every other survival, both of them battling with a sandy, sometimes brutal, urban United States, leading to a sharp finish. <br /> <br /> The funny and depressing, our "Midnight Cowboy" storm runs toward the whirlwind of cultural change and confirms the viewers of 1969, who stayed away from innocence at the age of 1950, in the 1960s, such as Dorothy and Toto, The film is directed by Master; Casting is accurate; Acting is top notch; The script is crisp and cogent; Cinematography is engaged; And the music increases above all. Deservedly, it won the best film Oscar 1969, and I would vote for that storm's decade's best films.
