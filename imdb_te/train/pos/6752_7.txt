A detective (Dana Andrews) is murdered by the reputation of torture (Craig Stevens) suspected of murder and attempts to cover it. The film directed by Otto Peeming is very atmospheric, but this story is dropped when the dead men's wife (Jean Tirne) fell to Andrews. He was digging himself into a big hole and himself, but she was too light at the end of the tunnel for a noir film. Gary Merrill, engaged in bringing Scales, Andrews down, and the tension between them Merrill, Andrews, and Neville brand gives a scene, especially a scene, its power and drive, and the time outside the Bellville Hospital outside Rendezvous, how it should be the film's resolution . High marks for the atmosphere, Andrews, Merrill etc ... and the general character of the underworld, the love angle and the simplest good cop evil copp Elements do not help.
