I enjoyed it as a fan of the original stories, and I always wondered what the story was like - it failed me to enjoy it. I love the fact that I do not recognize a person from Eric Stoltz - this is refreshing, much like the BSG. It introduced me to the wealth of the new talent - should not wait for the series to start broadcasting. Well done by Ronald D. Moore and team - excellent job. There are special effects, dialogue and acting, and I'm emotionally involved in the story. I know I'm confronting my expectations that I'm going to expect remorse, but I thought Caprica was superior to the sophisticated material produced in the last decade.
