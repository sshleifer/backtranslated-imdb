I have never heard of Layos Carracks in the past years in the Merde segment in Tokyo and easily found his three stories. This is not my favorite of the shorts, but it's very special, and the most iconic one. "I love the bridge" is the first of its full length features that I have seen, a virtuoso romantic film that uses the film and music to communicate with an exuberant young love that poems into poetry. Although he is classified as a neo-nouvelle vogue, his films have a lot of money for silent film like the 60s experimental narratives. <br /> <br /> He is closer to Jean Vigo than his films "L'atlante", Jean Coctuto and Guy Madin than Goyard and Traffat. On visual representation to show emotional states. He combines Madin's exaggerated worlds, but in reality it is not as cacti-like, but by its expressions it sinks into more accessible, emotional and Vigo films. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Boy Meets Girl ' The boy, Alex, played by Denis Lavant (the role played by Alex in the next two films of Caracas), was beaten with his girlfriend, who fell in love with his girlfriend. In the first scene he almost kills his friend on a boardwalk but is killed. He remembers her surrounding sounds of her neighbors, her girlfriend and friend's daytime dreams, and sounds near close friends. He steals records for her and leaves them in his friends' apartment, but leaves them without consulting one of them. <br /> <br /> He moves around and finds his way to a party, where he meets a suicide girl, and the film becomes "Breathless" and "Limelight". <br /> <br /> He later signed the sign language "Talk to you ... forgot about how people in the youth talk today." The old man gave a story about working in silent film and a camera before the camera became confident how lucky "lion". Film Tips In its hand, but the silent film open reference is because it replaces the style of the film style (silent and expressive), (a lovely young man trying to work diligently and really do things he wants). In the beginning Alex is painful, and he gets out of him at the end of the romantic words, he is immortal, from the moment to the nail is not easy, thanks to the lion making his interior feelings bigger in the pictures <br /> <br /> Escaped from the desire to fall in love. In the film, Alex rebels entered the room, where guests stopped their children and children, filled the room, and he switched on the tape of a children's performance that was silent. Unfortunately, a Gillis TV will end up playing her mysterious bathroom camera, and Hoose throws her down. Carax is self-regenerating and even self-frustrated self-frustrating, he also has matured enough to watch through the opening satire to the lovelorn in everything, even trying to say (whining babies full room), the film crosses the image. Even the great old, the ball was a brother who missed her in the hour. On another scene sappping a cocktail in a former astronaut silence he stares at the moon once he walks in his youth. <br /> <br /> When the Talkies indebted to the films before, the Carax pipe was invented, Dead Kennedy's "Holiday in Cambodia" or an early David Bowie song, the sounds of the person playing the piano or a soft humming girl. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Standing out of the astronaut of the Miss Universe, or the 1950s Miss Universe, due to the bullet in his brain. The film's lack of connection between Jean Pierre Jenut, Michel Gondry and Wes Anderson, whose stylized trees and motion stories of madness, are in parallel with various visuals, musical and emotional references in these Karaoke films. <br /> Each line of the <dialog, each piece of music and every effect and amendments in the picture resonated with me at some emotional level, some I do not have words to pronounce. There are many stories of a boy who met a girl, but rather than finding the simplest details of any particular event, the film binds the ecstatic truth of teen love and despair. Other movies you would like to watch are waiting. See it first. If I make movies, I want them to be like this, in fact I like all the movies, occasionally life becomes bigger in life, and life becomes a dream too.
