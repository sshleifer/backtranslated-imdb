With a special telescope, Dr. Janos Ruck (Boris Karloff) had an unfamiliar but powerful element in the years leading up to Africa. Dr. Bennett (Bela Lugosi) created the Ruk-led tour to identify the element. Unfortunately, Rook finds "Radium X", which is much stronger than radium, and most radiation and carolof is contaminated and can hit anyone by touching them. Sparks between the lugosy and the carlof in the classical science fiction film during the Second World War will really fly away. Director Hililler was shot at the same time and used some standing sets from the "Flash Gordon" series which inserted some footage of electric machines from Frankenstein. People do not know about the special effects that Universal used in this great classic film. Carlof and Lugosi are their best and they both work together and be enjoyed by future generations.
