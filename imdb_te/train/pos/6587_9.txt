Master Blackmare, based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's short story "Charles Augustus Milworthton," was the first feature of Jeremy Brett that I saw in Sherlock Holmes's story. The story is interesting and dark. <br /> * Spoiler * Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are attempting to uncover the identity of an illusion. Blackmail, which destroyed some of England's most prominent families by publishing individual letters, could destroy their lives in one way or another. Eventually, he finds Charles Augustus Milverton, an art dealer, after some tragic consequences of unpaid victims. Our heroes must help the next lady Eva Blackwell, that she or she will be abandoned very soon. The scene of Holmes and Watson Milverton's house was bad. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwick (as always) and Robert Hardy are the most popular performers (such as Cornelius Fudge in Harry Potter today as most of the audience can recognize him), as Lady Eva Blackley as Serena Gordon, Lady Swinstead Sophie Thompson (the scenes involving her and Holmes) are Norma West and Agatha. I'll give it ***** out *** 1/2. Insufficient inspector that my only complaint was missing. (I think they were included in the scene at the end of the short story, where he gave the two thieves, one of which is Watson.)
