I liked this movie, beautiful and funny. I realized that this film is a good family film. This is a movie that has been suggested to New York Yankees. To understand that the NY Ranks are a bad word, you need to be in the Red Sox country. Tell the Yankee fans this way. I recommend this picture to the whole family. With your distinctive romance / comedy film, the moment in the movie, I'm in love and what I do, but this movie will be in all slapstick moments. At the cinema show, fans at Red Sox Country (Fenway Park) were stuck at the end of the season at the age of 86 and how to love the love of Sax and another man.
