It's a very good movie, I like it. I thought it was a pretty perfect look at bulimia and it's not about dieting, it has so deep pain that they have a way to deal with and they choose this. Beth has a very strictly portrayed character and she faces confronting her mom about her eating disorder in the scene where you see the pain inside her and hear in her voice and you know how deep the pain she is feeling. I shout at one of the best lines of the film, "This is not about you." Her mother. Those words are very truthful and added to that view in the movie too. I think that scene is definitely an important scene for that scene.
