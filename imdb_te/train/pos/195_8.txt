"Show People" is a full delightful silence starring King Vidor and starring Merian Davis and Billy Hines. Two boys are in this lovely comedy about a young girl named Peggy Pepper, whose acting Savana is trying to do on the big screen. Although she succeeded in comedy, she would "art" what she would like to do, moving to the High Arts studio. <br /> <br /> Soon she became Patricia Pepper and her friend Billy was very good. <br /> <br /> In the quiet era, many stars starred in "Show People", including Davies, with Giver hair and makeup. I'm sure when people saw the film in 1928, they were all involved in an elaborate meal scene; Unfortunately, these days, it is not even for cinematic cases. In an episode of the film, she meets Charlie Chaplin; In another, Elinor Glenn's author pointed to her, and in the film Vidore played a guest role. John Gilbert, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Letraise Joy, Bess Flowers, Renee Adore, Rod LaRock, Aileen Pringle and many others are popups in the "People Show". <br /> <br /> Davis is adorable and a lively comedian. It left the critic William Hines movies - he was a beautiful and powerful, unfortunately the greatest star of the day. <br /> <br /> "Show Show People" is a simple story in a humorous way. It also has a look back at an exciting era in Hollywood history and has two magnificent stars performances.
