This is a wonderful comedy with great performers. John Ritter and Katie Sagale were cast as parents, and the kids were great. Cali Cuco Bridget is a good choice to play, a tough-down version of Kelly Bandy from children with sales. <br /> <br /> Sadly, John Ritter died in the series. They were forced to change the show and bring in more cast members, and this was in an uncomfortable situation, but they managed to do well. James Garner is good. <br /> I especially liked it when they brought them to Ed O'Neill in the guest spaces. That's great. <br /> **** ****
