David Duchovny and Michael Forbes play a pair of young journalists who want to go to California, but they really do not seek, so they try to save up with another little couple (Brad Pitt and Juliet Louise). Brian (Duchovny) is a writer and Carrie (Forbes) as his photographer, the Seed Killers are Pitt (Early) and Lewis serial killer and girlfriend to stop them in different murder areas where they took place, he agrees with him, but I do not care for the pit as a rule, but he He did justice to the psychic characters. That's awful Mitante he did them well, in front of him, no, The Killers, but with pretty much the same opinion. Anyway, going along the road trip, Carrie has predictions that others are about to get out of money, but Early has always thought something cash ..never he died here and somebody misses leaves. Lewis is one of the most bright orphans, not that we do not understand that she does not have to give her character, she has a good heart but she does not mean that she does not give up with the loss of something that she does not like. The other couple of Cary's emphasize put out at a gas station, and unfortunately she is at that moment where she sees a news bulletin that she tells them they've ride-shared, which then go downhill to them at a faster clip. This is not a great movie but it is not bad ... I watched what was supposed to be in the 'rated version but I wonder how much cut out the rated version, because this seemed to me fairly, really ... If it's family fare or anything, then it's probably Manson Family Except that it does not. 10 to 7.
