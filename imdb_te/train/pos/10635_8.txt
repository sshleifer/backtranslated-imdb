I appreciated photography, textures, colors and often, without comment, lighting. I have no coherent storyline. I often found it confusing, badly edited and difficult to follow at times. My version shows up at 110 minutes, IMDB 125m. Perhaps the cuts and subtitles did not help. I appreciated any images of the escape from the Hollywood mold, but it was disappointing. Miss Gillian is bright and all of the performances are fine, I wanted a little more dialogue. If anyone wants to see another picture that is somewhat related to this film, try 'Hide the kink' with Kate Winslet.
