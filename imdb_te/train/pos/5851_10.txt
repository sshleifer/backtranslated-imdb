<br /> <br /> It was the first pay-per-view in 1991 as Royal Rambo, and I gave the exact 10. It's memorable, not just reusable. <br /> <br /> The opening match between Razor and DBB, as well as Ludwig Borg vs Marti Jannetty is only the lowest points. They were just enough, but DBAS was right at the end of his payout. Nowadays, in such a match there is a big climax for push-ups and racer's first pamphlets. Also, the Intercontinental title is completed by Jannetti, who has a good competition with Borg. But I do not think anyone really thinks. <br /> <br /> The IRS and The Kid are great as they are Michaels and Perfect. I won the perfect, no Michaels. Right afterwards he left the WWF, so he did not have a job with Razor. Bret Hart has two great clashes with Dionic (against each other's best match Hitman) and later Lauror. Their competition is a classic; Why the Feud of the Year is Brain Why? <br /> <br /> Stearners-Heavenly Bodies Match is the best of the year. <br /> <br /> Many people say that the Undertaker-Giant Gonzalez wasted the match time. But I liked it. Keep in mind that the old WWF (before WWE) made a mixture of athletics and freak show. <br /> <br /> While the main event is somewhere in the near match, the main event is not bad. They led Lex Luger well, but opted to keep the belt in Yokozuna. He was the first heel after superstar graham holding more than two months belt. Nowadays, heels are champions of all times. But the WWF was initially lost by the WWF of the 90s, and you lost the heel title rule. <br /> <br /> As an old school wrestler fan, this one and SummerSlam '88 my favorites.
