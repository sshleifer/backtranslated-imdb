This is the best film I have seen about Bulimia. It's really about Bulimia and it's not always about skinny and dieting to hit the exact spot. People with bulimia showed how to think about life, friends and their attitude. The best line and part of what Bulimia's problem is, when Beth says, "This is not about you!" The problem really showed a lot about the role and the others with the same problem. It showed that this issue is not a problem with someone with bulimia. It is only with them and with them. It's time to talk to someone about the problem instead of focusing on themselves. Beth showed that she needed to call for attention at that point, and she needed her mother's attention at the time.
