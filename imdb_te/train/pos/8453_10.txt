I want to write a big enough comment on the characters in the Gundam Wing, each of whom will be in line with their internal contradictions. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As per the 49 golden episodes of happiness we get 8 great leads. <br /> You have a conversation that can last for months on your head ... go back and years later, a new meaning, written in the script (though it has a distinct anime feature that has an inequality between the subtitles and the English dub). <br /> <br /> Relationships between motionless men and women who love women are a lonely item of the series. The relationship between Heero and Rilena, and joys to see Millerardo and Nayyin. The apparent rejection of the male is filled with the inner crisis that makes women's love (a word never mentioned) that they need in their tough synar environment. Women rarely chase the aspects of human beings, all the more prominent men are more troublesome. This is Hero's total of 49 episodes, but he is there, and when he's doing, its big pay. <br /> <br /> After that there is a big robot fight. It's fun to see the amazing complications like any Hollywood epic combat scene. My friends have become clear when trying to recommend this range, but they are wrong, any less client updates, a big robot fight is seen as a crazy cartoon function for kids. <br /> <br /> Giant wing fights in Gundam Wing have a large number of dosages, usually young rebels who are struggling to defend their beliefs against a repressive society that is not useless. <br /> <br /> Stabilized tone and emphasis will not be boring wing through each episode, it is an attractive, thought-provoking study of the human mind and body's ability.
