The most beautiful and interesting composition of Coleridge's haunting verse at the show "Remembering the Ancient Mariner". Wonderful cinematography combined with the two centuries of collections to describe the classic poetry of 1798 by Michael Friedman and the famous narrative of Michael Redgrave by world famous artists is worth the time to see this spectacular visual work. <br /> <br /> At the age of television, such works are an invaluable tool for young students, as well as to impart adult and to appreciate the value of great poetry. The best of my knowledge, this kind of work is very rare; This is unfortunate. I think the great epic poetry of the world literary and former college professor and academic adviser, Coleridge's "Ancient Mariner", was "translated". Although not a film critic, I would recommend this fine product without any penalty as an avid reader of classic literature.
