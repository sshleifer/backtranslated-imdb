<br /> <br /> If you do not know what you want, you can not do it yourself <br /> <br /> Initially the film's best line, Robin's character Jack: "I'm that SOB!" <br /> <br /> It is a pleasure to see the DVD in a wide screen / letter box format on DVD a few years ago. <br /> I'm not a football fan or a true sports fan. But you do not need to be like this film.
