This is a very long time since I saw it. <br /> <br /> About 18 years ago <br /> <br /> The film tells us about the human body and blood circulation system. Very professionally - Disney-style animation, plus human actors - directed by Frank Capra, for Pete! <br /> Kind of an Overkill. Am I wondering how much more productive value is worth the value of the story value of the information in the human body? But the child learns to learn those children: now remember that Dr. Bagter Hemo challenged himself. The doctor immediately answers "sea water" to indicate what is normal compared to human blood.
