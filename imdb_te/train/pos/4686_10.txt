It's my favorite movie from time to time. It is mainly because some of the most vulnerable to touch other mainstream movies is not afraid to delve into some of the most politically incorrect things (such as spanks and female submissiveness). The film does not have any limits because the director is developing the story free of chance without the viewer's disturbance. However, I do not think there is nothing here that can be used to teach someone with shock value or to be fully intentionally. Sean Young is in an exciting and adventurous performance. Most mainstream actresses have not accepted this role or asked some bigger script changes before accepting it. Other actors also do good jobs. <br /> <br /> Did you notice that the film did not appear in the paid cable after a calculate brief run for the year after the theaters were touched? Why do you ever wondered The obvious reason is that it just does not fit into today's political climate. Some premium channels now have soft romances (which are close and close to Heart Ashta) but do not have a mainstream film like "Love Crimes". <br /> <br /> Although the film is only 11 years old, it can not be done today. <br /> <br />
