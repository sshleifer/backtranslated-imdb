I thought Grinch Stole was a pretty good movie. It's not terrible or it's not great, but it's happy to see it. I thought Jim Carrey got a little inconvenience at times. When he was a special educator, he wanted to be bad and deceptive, but he was busy. The Grinch scenery is beautiful, I've laughed in some places, but I thought it was just a matter of time. This movie is very good if they change "the personality of the grich", and they have more laughable scenes because how much humor is not funny How Griffle Stole likes how Christmas, but it's not anything to get excited about seeing.
