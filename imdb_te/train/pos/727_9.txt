Not one of the best rock and roll films. And it's not just mindless fun. There are a lot of really brilliant jokes. Of course I love the Ramones. <br /> <br /> "The Anarchy" and "I Highly Hate Hate" are not so much of the film, it's great about it. In the spring of 1980, and I saw it again recently. I recall when I went to high school in the late 1970's. <br /> <br /> I said, this film is not bad and does not like many other teen fees of the seventies, eighties, and nineties. And to speak, it's not really dirty or bored. PG rate only. This category is rare for an image. A great cult classic and a really amazing time capsule.
