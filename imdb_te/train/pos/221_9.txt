First of all I must remember when I first saw the film in Radio City Music Hall. <br /> <br /> With respect to George Burns (RIP), Walter Mottau really deserves an Oscar for this film. His appearance was fantastic - he gave the fact that his character, Willy Clark, was more than 20 years old. His habits are first-rate. ("What kind of songs he wrote? Sh * t!" And the Spanish-speaking man at the front desk saying: "No! No enchilada !!") Absolutely hilarious! <br /> <br /> I do not want to have a remake with Woody Allen, which is actually no matter what it is in my DVD not.
