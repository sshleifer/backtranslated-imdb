I first saw Samurai's blood in the premiere at the Hawaii International Film Festival. Wow! Blood has its perfect verve, gore, vitality, gore, excitement, pain, thoroughly campiness, and more gore, and all blew us away in all this wonderful funn! Especially when you enjoy the Japanese chambara samurai and ninja movies, you can definitely see the blood!
