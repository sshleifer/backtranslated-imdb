There is no doubt that Viktor McGlagen won the Oscar for his Best Actor by three installments between Clark Gable, Charles Laughton and the rebellion against Franchtone's bounty heroes. But if it's not, John Foward is still a fine film because his first best director Oscar is not earned. <br /> <br /> Based on the film and story of Liam O 'Flehetti, it has a poorly illustrated man named Geo Nolan who is a member of the iPad Republican Army. . He pulled and wants to cashiered out and back for some imbecilic stunt. If he is down to his last pence and he can not get it back, America wants enough for the passage. Twenty pounds were rewarded for information leading to the arrest of a former colleague of Frankie McPlep, played by Wallace Ford. In a weak moment he goes to the Black and Tan Constabulary and provides information on McPhilip. <br /> <br /> IRA is out of macpileep and is very concerned that they know that they are McLoglen. He does not really know how to cover his own tracks. He makes a weak effort to influence another person, Peter Mulligan, by Donald McGill. <br /> <br /> The complete action of The Informer begins in the evening of the sixth day of Dublin in 1922. A need was shot in the dark and shadows, which probably made the first Nair thriller. It was followed by World War II. Informer is ranked as an excellent noire classic, like a man man out or the third man. <br /> <br /> John Ford is good to know this world. He took some time off the rebellion and was in Ireland at that time and had a brother in the IRA. <br /> <br /> Preston Faster plays the role of the Irish commander Dan Gallagher. In Gageghar's book Foster is more difficult and less man than he is here. In my opinion, John Ford wanted to give some fanfare interest to film fans in his role as a genuine sympathetic character. He specifies that the Foster Informer should be removed by the Black and Tance grabbing him and earning him a little more from him and keeping the entire company in danger. <br /> <br /> IRA is the highlight of the scene picture. When Foster is asked whether Donald McKay finds their court authority, Mack does not say anything. King's justice and writing can not be run here. It was clearly illustrated at the graphic at the graphic, even though the army was deployed and stabilized, even if the British lost their hold. <br /> <br /> In fact, John Ford is in a terrible story of Informer, rather than what you expected. Although Mölglönen spends his money into a drunken sediment, the IRA is constantly looking at him and calculates every fallacy. <br /> <br /> Informer is a story about Ireland during a terrible and tedious time.
