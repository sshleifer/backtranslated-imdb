I do not know how to explain the "dreaded room" because it really did not do justice. This is a simple liniest short film with two cute girls in a strange and mysterious situation. This small thing is definitely against the "The Elephant Man" or "The Straight Story" at the end of the Lynchon Spectrum's "Mulholland Drive". It is hidden on Lynch's website, as well as the search value.
