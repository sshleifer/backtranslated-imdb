I did not remember it when I first heard the film, but six years ago I rented it, which is still one of my favorite comedies. I agree, if you do not know anything about rap music, you probably hate this movie. But if you're a rap fan, even a casual, you love jokes and suggestions inside. One of the best lines of the film is the difference between a B **** and a h **. I still use this line and laugh with it. One of the best performances came from Larry Scott, who played Nerd Lamar in `Revenge of the Nerds'. Miserable that the film never received DVD release.
