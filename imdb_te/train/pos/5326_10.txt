"Birth of the Beatles" is the best industry ever for a US television movie released in late 1979, telling the story of four franchises from Liverpool, which revolutionized the music industry and the world. As former Beatle Petit says with a best view. The performance from the whole cast is awesome, particularly as Paul McCartney as Stephen MacKenna's John Lennon and Rod Kulbertson. The film was built by the legend of the Rock and Roll era, Mr. Dick Clark. A year ago, another TV movie was produced in 1978, which examined the time in which Kurt Russell was cast as the lead character of another musical myth; "Elvis". The film was directed by director of the film "John Carpenter", directed by other successful films; "Halloween", "Escape from New York" and "The Thing". The same is told by Director of "Birth of The Beatles", Mr Richard Marquand. He has directed many other theatrical blockbusters such as "Star Wars of the Jedi", "Eye of the Needle" and "Jagged Edge". The only backdrop that I know of Fab Four is the 1994 release of the Beat Beat in Theater. Nevertheless, critics did not care for it or make people, because it was not a long time life in the theater. The birth of the Beatles is very attractive and simplistic, which begins with the essence of myth and ending with struggles & hardships, ends up being successful when joining NYC, and I recommend this movie in the 1964 edition of Ed Sullivan.
