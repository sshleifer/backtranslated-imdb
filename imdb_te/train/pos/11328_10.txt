This image is good. If you're enjoying B-Class movies, that's it. This is a classic college 80's slasher film, in which the entire song is displayed in the entire soundtrack. A terrible picture, but happiness is worth to rent, or just older men watch pop out of the shelves with swords. Kinda is funny, if you ask me.
