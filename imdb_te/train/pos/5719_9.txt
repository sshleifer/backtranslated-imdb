I have seen a lot of IMDb comments, some critics have the intellectual intelligence of each film they see, which has their own sense of mind. I am not one of those individuals. If I look at an action movie, I want to see explosions, shootings and heroics. If I see comedy, I want to be laughing in my eyes. You got the idea. So looking at the horror movie, I need to basically be scared. Grudge is a horror movie, which is well under 'jump' scenes and it has creepy images. I've been a horror film fan for many years, and I'm talking about masters like Dario Argonto, these days are the directors of the treadmill teen horror flicks outdated. If you are scared, watch this movie. Unlike the original Japanese 'Ring' movement (which I think is also a great movie).
