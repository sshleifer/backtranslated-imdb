This is a complete art form of women's life and needs in this era. Everything is important, and they are more stylized, more than words on the image. For those who have considered it a boring geisha film, I'll suggest you read a bit about this community before you make a conclusion that the reality is out of now. This Kurosawa work is life, and I'm sure the director understands the quiet meaning of the right intellectual range Kurosawa piece.
