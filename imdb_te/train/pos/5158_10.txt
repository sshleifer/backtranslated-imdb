This episode is compelling and bizarrely believable. At the very beginning, a certain planet is created by knowledge that will explode in a few hours. <br /> <br /> Kirk, Spock and McCoy have come down to evacuate residents, one of whom has gone to an unknown librarian, excluding an elderly librarian. <br /> <br /> The Liberalian's polite but tipping advice is that all citizens, all three members of the band are accidentally interrupted by a crisis that has been dashed in the past of the planet's past. In comparison with Kirk 17th Century England, Spock and McCoy are trapped in a desolate, frozen wasteland. <br /> <br /> The men are finding themselves in between these two stories, and in various hazardous conditions, and are now recovering the possibility of an unpredictability, while the planets are being reduced to explosives. <br /> Imaginating writing and fine acting depicting this episode, Mariette Hart as a woman exiled to the Ice Age, and Iber Wolfs with a touching performance as urbane librarian. Some reminiscent of the classic episode in City at the Edge of Forever, this time travel story is a great and compelling ending for the series, which concluded an episode later. This is one of the best in the entire series, especially in the third season, generally less quality.
