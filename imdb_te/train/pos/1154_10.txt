I think it's a ridiculous movie I have ever seen. Robert Hurling's script is accurate, just check the "quotes" section; <br /> <br /> Sally Field is a comedy, over-the-top performance that does not appear to you and has never been seen anywhere. , And Kevin Klein is effortlessly hilarious. Robert Downey, Jr. is generally intelligent, and in a very small role, Kathy Nazism is a costly and expensive riot. I've never seen Elisabeth Shoe's fan, but she's great as a * real * person with a group of cartoon characters on "The Sun At Sets" set - Hemingway's rolling in his grave as you feel below. That is, or he is really laughing. <br /> Five stars. Funny, funny, funny.
