If you remove the first twenty minutes or so of the film, you leave a wonderful comedy. It was, I still seemed to be a pretty good movie on it, which is a small feat considering the coma I put through the opening sequences. Put a little, this film is not even remotely funny, or even upbeat at a daunting start. But once things get stuck, you still remain with a well-protected comedy three decades later. If you're a young fan of Lemonone and Matthews, who would like to see their previous work, it's perfectly inspecting.
