Through human spacecraft through space ships - immediately travels through intelligent and sometimes horrific adventure. We can not forget Robbie, mystic doctor Morbius, his beautiful and innocent daughter, Altaire, and we will learn about the planet's predecessors - died at night in the Kremlin. Or are they? <br /> <br /> If you realize that the planet is clearly featured in the film studio with painted backdrops but the feel of the threat of claustrophobia that I feel and the music of Bebe and Louise Baron's electronic music more < This film is not in more than 250 IMDB movies.
