I saw this movie as a child and it broke my heart! No other story ended incomplete ... I grew up on so many great anime movies and it's very unusual because it's one of my favorites - the story about injustice, cruelty and loneliness, life, and choices and the need for others. When Wolf kills his mother alone, Wolf is alone, Chirin follows him uphill. Woolf would kill the lamb, saying every night he said, "Tomorrow I'll probably eat you." I have the tape break down and degrade from age and use. I repair and film again something one day and it's just as difficult as I did when I was young. Such stories, these depths and feelings, and this complex, very unlikely to understand. It's a sad story, but I've faced any Katriss that I've ever done beautifully. I'm glad I saw this movie, and I'm glad I saw it as a kid.
