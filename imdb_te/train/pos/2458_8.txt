I was in a cold mood when I took my seat in the film and it was not planned when it was changing. But this film is a dramatic powerhouse. I'm in sweat and need a shower later. So what do we have? The theory of a young Turkish girl who is theoretically living in Denmark, Copenhagen. It came to my mind immediately that the plots seemed to be adapted from the very "Beckham Bend", where we had an Indian girl spoiling football and spoiling her sister's wedding. Here we have transferred it to a Turkish girl who disperses her brother's marriage by doing kung fu. And we have a love story and of course a competition. After I accepted this, it really became a persistent, emotional drama and it shows off some cute kung fu (though I'm not an expert). The main actress was not only the female winner of the semi-Turan Denmark, but she gave it a wonderful performance, so that she was the first film to be considered as an actress who feels that she has a number of autobiographies that have been credited as her first film. The rest of the cast support is okay, camera good, kung fu serious. Sidenotes: - Male turkey has shown respect to the audience they should have done something right. - Our heroine finally fights back and burst into the audience when he attacks a brother who hits his brother with a vengeance. - Chinese Cinematic Kung Fu Instructor / Actor (Hidden Tiger, Crouching Dragon) is the lead character of the main character. If you have the opportunity to watch it in the movie, maybe you have a good and intense experience and if this little screen works as well I do not know
