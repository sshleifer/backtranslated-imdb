"The day is out" is a fantastic picture. In some ways, it's better than "the third kind of closer". (I prefer cheesy independent flies to big budget spectaculars.) Special effects are cheesy, but a big part of the fun. Jim Davis gave an amazing performance in the film. It is probably one of the best roles he has in a feature. Music score is great. The story does not make sense. But it only makes it more connected. Like the finest works of art, the "day is out" is not afraid to be subtler and obscure. "The End of the Day" might be a low-budget indie film, but it is not too much to compare with the "existential" European films of the fifty and sixties. (These include very low budget independent productions.)
