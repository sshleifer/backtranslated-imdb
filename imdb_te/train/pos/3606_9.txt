I really enjoyed the Girl Fight. It's something I can see over and over again. The performance was fantastic and I thought Michel Rodriguez did a good job in the film. I can say very convincingly. The picture shows how to stand for women to do what's going on in life. She has a very compassionate and still hate at the same time. Dealing with the child's father really does not help her too much. Although he loves her, he really hates. Her mother died when she was younger and suffered some of the role. Love story is a part of the film that I really enjoyed in the film. I am interested in one another. Then again the drama sets and after her like choosing between her boyfriend and her life long dream. I thought it was just right. This is the ultimate way to decide what happened to them in the future. All you love based on a sport you want to check this movie with good plot
