I have read many mixed reviews, and most of them are filmed in the film stage. Initially I was interested in this project because I was directed by Tony Scott and I was very interested in his work after Man on Fire severely affected me. Before I start my review, let me first tell you ... The film is wonderful to be boring and simple, and writers and Scott have chosen another way. <br /> <br /> Just say, it's not boring. Many of the Hollywood films give the 'true and true' plot to discover that people connect, and often create a high likelihood of acceptance and profit of the film audience. This is one of the most interesting things I've seen for a while. Just for reference, I see 'The Weather Man' and 'Lord of War' and I say that these films are fantastic and that the plot is boring both of these films and you want to do what you say. They do not take any chances, and after they've seen a fair amount of American paintings they are very predictable. Domino's plot is interesting and you're thinking in a way, "Oh man, they're scrapping now". I think there are too many drawbacks in recent movies. It has a lot of depth in my opinion, and it gives you many things to ask when looking at it. <br /> <br /> I think the characters are accurate. Knightley portrayed a beautiful woman, who was inside and wanted to see what she was doing. <br /> <br /> Choco is very believable, in his unwillingness in Spain, lack of Damon's love, as well as his jealous issues in the team ... They feel me real, I think his role is realistic. <br /> <br /> Rourke's role was very interesting to me, but it is still true to me. He tried to look like a normal person. I hope the filmmakers are trying to fulfill him, because I came out of it. <br /> <br /> Claremont / Ladies: I believe that they will provide the most needed heart. Story. They wanted money to buy a Bentley that they were just real problems, and others wanted that goal. You are associated with them, because they have no problem with this child's illness any other solution. <br /> <br /> Mubster: They only seemed so bad for the heroes. I really liked that piece. <br /> <br /> They are the Christopher Walken / 90210 boy: <br /> <br /> They have provided a humorous relief in a very serious film. . Walken's awkward statements contain 90210 guys have ceaseless instructions-beens. Their role in the film was very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Cinematography .... Yes .... cinematography. The film seems to have lost many fans. But in my opinion I felt intellectual, the use of the camera to translate the mood of the current situation is very effective in my opinion. I thought of the way I was correctly identified but always used to improve, just like anything else. I congratulate and congratulate Scott, editor, cinematographer and photography director, both in real movies. Although they went far away from the show, they went much further. A terrible and grungy look that provided the 'look' of the light, very light and very dark film is certainly less like 'peachy or' clean 'like everyone who demonstrates that, as demonic hunters and their life, that depicts the life of the mob. If you notice, if there are fewer camera tricks in less stress or controversial times. This Scott and his crew are trying to achieve something with this look and just do it for the heck. I realized that many people who have seen this film do not expect it, and many of them cause this to change to the film, but I think Scott has taken this approach. Hollywood films are fantastic and fun. Many of them have the same twists and turns as well. <br /> <br /> This film is not for everyone, but it is no worse and nothing to offer. I enjoyed this film thoroughly and I am happy to spend money on it. I would recommend all of this, but I'm sure some will only press a string. When I say that many of those who refuse outside the MTV sphere do not appreciate the film, I have to admit with the earlier poster. We should try to enjoy it for Scot and co fact. Some took the opportunity and tried to deliver something that was different and unique. And in that mind, I think he's amazingly successful.
