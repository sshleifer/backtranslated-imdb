Wang Bianlian Sichuan is an old street performer known as the 'king of masks' for his mastery of change art. Actress and Wang as a famous artist of Liang Sichuan art is an artist and an honorable person. Long does not die with a valuable art Wang and he kills the seed of an heir in Wong's mind. The film contains obscenity, male domination, art, values ​​and especially warmth. </ P> <br /> I can not recommend this image adequately. The whole image is in loops. Everything is of importance. The length of the story is quite correctly modified, the length of the film is just 91 minutes. Total satisfaction. Five minutes it's an artistic film, the next five minutes its a sad film, the next five minutes its thriller. It changes its mood as it changes his character into his face. The last scene on the cord is unusual. The story and script are flawless. The actors are good. The heroes are both artists and their performances. Very nice. It has not been nominated for Oscars. In that year, 'English Patient' got the best film Oscar and won the foreign film category 'Veliya'. 'Kolia' is just ok and less about 'English patient'. See it 9/10.
