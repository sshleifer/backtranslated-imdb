Apparently, many people do not see this movie, no one will post more comments. This is not a missing image. After all, it won the George Peabody Award as well as Humanitarian Award. Paul Winfield should receive an award for his excellent performance in the film. The technical director of the film True Capote, The Glass House, co-written by Eugene Logan as the co-writer of the TV movie, was also lost in another film's film on the human image. This image is now available on DVD. If anyone is interested, I'll post another letter telling me how I got a technical advisor on the image of an amazing man like Eugene Logan Truman Capote. Thanks for reading this and I hope these two movies will find a way to view.
