Arthur's middle-aged Rich 'Kid' was like a fish. Arthur feels his opinion and tells what's happening in his mind. He was great about his riches and knew he was a spoiled brat. He spends money on people he does not know and finds everything funny. <br /> <br /> Arthur must marry a high-profile girl to receive a big fortune, but he falls in love with the poor waitress Lisa Minnelly (she really hates). I have seen this film because of the character of the most famous Indian film 'Sharabi' Arthur. Although 'Sharabi' is definitely inspired by 'Arthur', I think they are two different films. 'Arthur' is fun. Sometimes it is very cold. One of the most spectacular in the film is the liners. It's not a laughing riot but it has some amazing moments. My favorite scene is when Arthur meets his fianc√©e's father, he talks about the 'moose'. Dudley Moore certainly has some comic timelines. He is very good with words and body language. I loved the scene where he sat in the hotel about a small little country and said the pair were standing and he keeps talking to husband and wife in two different directions. John Geelgard received an Oscar for the film. I do not know the actor. I do not think he has done a great job but I agree that in the future if I have more work. The film has some flat patches but it is not too long. Looking forward to the sequel.
