The film is light, funny and beautifully portrayed. <br /> <br /> It is the best of sentimental comedy, beyond the US and French standards and is better than English. <br /> Every character is touching, and the description is close to perfection. Isabelle Blaze is awesome, Silvio Moreau is better off in the Catherine series, Stephanie Gagnon is lovely, Emmanuel Bilodo is the greatest of his weird character, and best friend by Genevieve Laar!
