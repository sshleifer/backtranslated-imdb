Overall this film will be exciting for its time and will be interesting for many generations to come. Although the plot is not 100 percent accurate, most are right. The picture is crossed too far and makes some important parts miss. I've found the book and I'm ready and I wanted them to make a movie (and I did not even know about this movie) but later I found the movie in a bargain bin at Wal-Mart and decided that I wanted to buy it. Overall, I give these movies 10 to 7 for good movies (relative accuracy and overall intelligence) and its bad parts (big time skips and small but noticeable bugs).
