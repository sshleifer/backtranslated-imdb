Looks good. Powerful and very exciting. The most compelling documentary series of war. This is often the opposite of the Gang-ho attitude to Tone World War 2. More than just gripping the horrors of war, it allows Laurence Oliver's silent voices to be brought back to the true images of war: everywhere are corpses, explosions, terrifying civilians and soldiers, broken men, diverse politicians, thousands of wrongdoers and innocent people. Absolutely everything is really capable of removing all the general rules of "civilization" for mankind. In the true state of nature, there is something specifically Habsburg about the human being, who will still be back in more than 60 years of shock and more fraudulent form of crime. There may be really a century that really frightened a series of "twentieth century" in the twentieth century. It happened with the deaths of about 50 million people, and I think this has happened to produce such such constructive and exciting sequences.
