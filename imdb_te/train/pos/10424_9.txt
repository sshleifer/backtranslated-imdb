Musicians have gone out of fashion and are too expensive to do all the necessary talents in order to make the studio one of the deal, because I suspect Enrico Caruso's real life story. <br /> If all the others are in place, there is no Hollywood studio work until Mario Lanza under the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer deal. <br /> When no one else was able to do it, no doubt that it will ever be tried again. <br /> Why should it be? I was satisfied with Enrico Karuso himself how to portray his song on screen. His life is his reason for his life on earth. <br /> <br /> It is easy to find freedom in his life. Karuso, like the man who portrayed him, was a very hungry person despite his self discipline. He has many relationships with many women and has two wedded sons who are not in the film. <br /> His efforts to the recording industry are almost unrealistic. He was shown in a recording studio late in his life. In fact he started recording at the end of the last century and recording industry with the Irish tenor John McCormack for RCA Victor. <br /> <br /> When you're at Karupo and McCarmer at their altitude, the ticket is legitimate for you to see some of them live. But most Italian and Irish families have a phonograph and these men have a record or three. <br /> <br /> In this film, Mario Lanza is some pretty performed opera arias, where he has a car's discipline and stick to the opera. The Great Caruso won an Oscar for sound recording and received nominations for design and set design. <br /> <br /> Mario has been helping him promote the film with the song RCA Red Seal from The Great Casuso. Unfortunately, the contractual responsibilities we did not get realistic with Unt Bit, Dorothy Kirsten and Jermila Novotna. <br /> <br /> If you see the life of Enrico Cauroso, it's not. If you're doing a great artist at the height of his career, you should not miss the great carousel.
