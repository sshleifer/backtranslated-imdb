Save Grace is a nice picture to watch a boring afternoon, when you're looking for something different than simple scripts and some have fun. I mean, the whole idea of ​​this film and it's all craziness such as marijuana! This theme (Drugs / Marjuvana) I did not really criticize, it was the first film that made jokes about it. Grace Trevittin is U.K. A widow living in a small town, and she had a lot of debt due to her deceased husband, who committed suicide by completing her debts. The problem is that she does not lose all of her things, she finds that she needs to pay all of her husband's pounds, especially she loves the house very much. She did not work in front and was in a tragic situation until her gardener found her smoking pot, until Matthew, deciding to share her with the sale of marijuana on a large scale.
