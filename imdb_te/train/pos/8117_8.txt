I first saw this film 40 years ago on my first television and it seemed to be a disappointment in the future. Wells restricts private freedoms as a good thing. ("No Private Airplanes", because the film was not a 30 year plus war, the film was not shown to be a battle of the future, and Kodada is the true stars of a future film. The combination is entirely from the Fabulous comedy series. Bass negative personality Churchill ntavaraku is similar to the time of the war.
