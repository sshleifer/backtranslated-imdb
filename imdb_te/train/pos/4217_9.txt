A detective is always satisfied when a case is closed and a criminal book is brought. In this case the climax gives me more pleasure. There is no doubt about her guilt for discovering Abigail Mitchell's face being wiped out when she finds her victim. <br /> <br /> Please understand: I'm Ruth Gordon's performance, her character really, * really * irritates me. She is selfish and demands. She gets her own way by putting the embarrassing 'little girl' on the woman in her old age. <br /> <br /> When Colombo is very close, he tries to meet him by killing him. Speech to a high-profile women's audience. <br /> <br /> He makes sure that the tables are very warm and human speech about the reality of police work. <br /> There is no need to do justice to Colombo. Abby's last appeal was rejected because of his good nature, because he had no self-respect to his job. Here is a situation that you are foolish from Mitchell!
