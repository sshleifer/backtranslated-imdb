Makers have chosen the best people for the job, and the scene is set wonderfully. It tells you about the inner part of every house. The period 20s (first story), the current story (ie 1950), or 1910 (final), clothing and settings are lovingly examined and created. I love two old ladies fussy costumes in health - smoother lace replacement by delicate shelland shawls. Roland Culler as Ashenden is very attractive, but never mind soppy young lovers, it is Raymond Huntley as the person who reaps the health and independence of his wife's crops. He normally acted in cometal and pompose, but here he is nicely and convincingly and very impressed. China sees the story from Mr. Seas (the great 30 film starring Gibb and Harry), Mr. No episode (and also a story by Kipling). I saw a nautern vase like a jealous husband - he was looking for a good moment in a Mexican hat. I also love the posh bird that plays his wife.
