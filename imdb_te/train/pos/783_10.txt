The first word in my mind after seeing this movie is "beauty". <br /> <br /> All of the actors' performance (Andy is good), the red line of well-designed shots and writers - Love. <br /> <br /> I find Kenny's character only white in these three womans' otherwise boring and predictable life. His interaction makes Andy's character interesting, making it possible. <br /> <br /> It is not true that Andi's success from this loss is not the truth, but rather the success of life. <br /> <br /> Another reason I love this film is that it is in all areas of the British - all houses and "fogs" and accents :)). And Andy is doing amazing work again! This film is a shame that got less marks. Ten to 10!
