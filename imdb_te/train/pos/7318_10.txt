John Carpenter's Halloween <br /> <br /> Is it the greatest horror film ever? Not .. not everyone, but for me it will always be and always. The film is pure and has a very special place in my heart. <br /> <br /> The film did not see the film within twenty years of its release. But after twenty years many slasher copy cats have come down. Then it must be done. My dad suggested before I saw the Halloween H20, I rented Halloween's 1 and 2 to get the full story, and I saw the rental hallow and it was set clear and slasher gener after watching Halloween. The plot of the film is simple, and in 1963, Michael Audrer Myers killed his sister Judith with a big butcher knife with cold blood. Larry Strood is an elegant bookworm, an all-bracket a tough talking satire and a beautiful: Linda van der Clock is a beautiful: Dr. Sam Loomis treatment he has been incarcerated for fifteen years, he escapes and sexually intense girl in his hometown of Haddonfield where he begins stalking three young girls. Dr. Loomis tracks Michael here where he is with the help of Sheriff Lee Brackett, whose story about the mental killer is skeptical. Michael becomes compassionate and begins killing them every time until only the sweet and innocent lorry that remains the main target of Michael's list. <br /> <br /> The cast of the film is excellent and all actors and actresses have performed top notch performances, with Larry Stroed and Donald Plejans Loomis playing Loomis in his short role as Jamie Lee Curtis in her first film. Michael played the role of Michael, making an unusual and unpleasant job as a lifeless and bad killer, and his walk and body movements are perfect. <br /> <br /> In the film's greatest headlines, it has created one of the most notable horror themes known today by John Carpenter. Blue lighting is creepy and efficient and one of the greatest moments in the film, when she saw her dead friends when young laurie was crouching on a wall, and she was cast in the shadows behind Michael's face. One of Michael's masking stuff sent me down my spine, too, white emotional face work perfectly. <br /> <br /> This film does not look like a cheery film like Friday cheesy which makes it very great 13th films, in fact the film has a little blood and works instead of suspense and tension. <br /> <br /> In this film, at least once in your life to see this film I have suggested that this is a milestone in the film and is not great among the greatest horror films from time to time.
