The film is the best film made by Jim Carrey. Cary does not make her simple face stuff in the film. He is both funny and sad. Carey Bruce has portrayed Nolan, a journalist. Nolan God (Morgan Freeman) blames everything that is wrong in his life. Then, God comes from heaven and Bruce gives his powers. As I said earlier, Carrie has done a wonderful job. I also felt Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston were great supporting actor / actress. This plot is good because it contains many subsections in the main topic. The film is funny (Bruce's dog) as well as sad ("broken"). The script worked well. I'm glad they did the sequel in this movie. I will rate this movie 9/10.
