"The Notorious Betty Page" is a woman who always wants to be an actress, but has become the most famous pin girls in American history. Betty Page, one of the first sex icons in America, is Gretchen Mole. Modeling Betty Page in the Nordic and Slavery led to the US Senate investigation in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> When coming out of the film, the 1950s provisions of pornography. You can now go on the internet and portray a lot of disturbing and surprising images, footage quoted in "The Notorious Betty Page" is almost innocent and innocent. Betty Page has yet to be found, having a lot of footage nakedness, including slavery, when we have sexually obsessed women who have sex with two animals. <br /> <br /> In this film, it is very beautiful to watch this video in today's pornography. <br /> I'm pretty impressed to be honest. "The Notorious Betty Page," I found that the film is very well and interesting. The movie trailer is exactly what you believe in it and one of the first female sex icons in America has a very interesting look. Gretchen Mole looks like a Betty Page and gives a lot of performance. Because the film was filmed in black and white films, it seemed that the film was realistic because the film created in the late 1950s was believed to be believed by the audience. <br /> <br /> The only time that my only complaint about this film was, cut and appeared there were a few scenes that seemed a little shorter than they should have been. I have seen this and it seems to be cut from a 10 minute film from its original performance at the Toronto Film Festival. Even the ending was pretty good and I was expecting more to come on the screen telling the audience about the Beetie Page life where it left a little more or perhaps a few paragraphs from it. <br /> <br /> The film is notorious for directing, but the play is very important, especially Gretchen, and the other two are not complaints. <br /> <br /> Mary Hornon, "American Psycho", is one of my favorite films, The Notorious Betty Page Director and Writer. I think Mary is a very talented director who knows how to create and create great films based on characters as "a psycho", "Batty Page" is a role model and the best in it. Haron's 40s and 50s easily captures all the characters as well. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: "The Notorious Betty Page" is definitely worth a look. In the United States, as well as the world's pornography, it shows how accurately it is. The film provides a good performance by Gretchen Mole. And the look and feel of a previous era and top it with a talented director who was able to have a good picture of your hands. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> </ p> <p> MovieManMenzel's final rating page for "The Notorious Betty" is 8/10, an interesting character study about one of the most famous pin-up and sex icons in American history.
