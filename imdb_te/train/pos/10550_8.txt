I saw part of my course at Aberdevitt University and informs me that it is not for the distributor in the UK. In fact, it is not because this movie is not a Hollywood movie - it is original, creative, active and funny. <br /> <br /> No one really wants to see this kind of film today, which is quite simple, not too young audiences in accordance with the generic conventions found in a movie. Written a review for IMDb for age but felt this film was inclined to give a special mention, it was also a minute during my 30-minute break! Basically, it is nothing, because the two main characters are nothing in their own world through the world's hatred. The brightness here is that the director has the most interest in having two characters, and only half the house in Miss-En-Scene and a vast white space. <br /> <br /> This is one of the reasons for the performances of star performers, both of whom are great laughs, and at the same time can add significant emotional depths to their roles. I'm still writing some more but it's too late. Anyway, I encourage anyone and everybody to try this movie. The creation of a very fun film brings a unique concept to a screen in a coherent and well-executed fashion, combining good performances, strong script, nice sound design and (most likely) impressive visuals. It's not shy, some people do not know about Nothing ....
