Baakal is right here - especially the second film. It was a hit between two successes: "Have and Not Have" (1944) and "The Big Sleep" (1945), both attached to her with Humphrey Bogart. Granted these other movies are not equal but I think through her own fault. I'm a bit misleading to play the role of British high-crust lady. There is no voice. I thought all the strange sounds were disorganized - Boer was certainly not a Spanish man. <br /> I really liked black and white cinematography. The mood is used for a great deal - especially I liked the smog scene. Lighting also makes a great job of adding conspiracy and tension. <br /> <br /> Bacall is just beautiful. Boyer did not fit me in the role of a romantic figure - so he and Bacall were a little strange. Not a great chemistry - and certainly no bogey and musical magic. But I still really liked this movie. There is great tension and it moves along well enough. <br /> <br /> Katina Pacquino and Peter Lorre stand as a supporting cast. Pacquino, a hotel keeper, is completely villainous and evil in his role. Ms. Muckerji left man after she broke up a scene where she was maniacally laughing and the child murderer was quite disturbing. Lorr√© is also doing a lot better in his slimy, snake shooting of the hunters - and finally a smoky coward. Wanda Bendrix did well to play the role of Child Elles - most notably her first film, and at the time she was 16 (although she was too young). She was later married to Aai Murphy, who proved to be a short-term and serious marriage.
