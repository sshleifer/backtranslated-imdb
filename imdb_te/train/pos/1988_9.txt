First, I would like to make another review of this film, which won the Best Film Academy Award in 1958 as 'Gigi'. It won 'West Side Story' in 1962, 'My Fair Lady' won in 1965, then won 'Sound of Music'. This film is absolutely fantastic. The story from the novel has changed somewhat, but they have not changed back to the version they portrayed due to the limitations of one stage. However, I do not mind. In fact, I think it would flow more than the entire production novel. I take Nancy Oliver to the bridge and die in the apartment later. The subtleties in this film make me laugh. I love the moment to start Bimbles and Mrs. Bumble from Gambhir's office. That moment is short. Ron Moody, a fun and funny fagin (this character worked better than the book), and Shani Wallis, Nancy's most vulnerable and most painful one, with my favorite actors Jack Wild, Jack Wild, the best cheat in the film's version of the film Version containing Give this film a substitute instead of 9 instead of 9 because the two big product numbers, 'Consider Yours' and 'Who Will HOW'. I always hate choreography when performing daily performances and music performances. It's awful and cheerful when it comes to normal choreography for these scenes, especially when dancing at London Mont Ko. However, the film is rare, with us, permanently and permanently.
