With some amazing performances from Martin Sheen, Tracy Skaggins and Ian McShane, "The River of Souls" was a very good Babylonian 5 film. This is the episode of the series (without humor), but it is one of my favorite stand-alone stories. <br /> <br /> Personally, I have always preferred Schuggins Christian, the JMS has not written much of her lineup and bore the Byron / Telepath Plot. In the scene, the brothel, the humorous movie about the "poor" actors, is a great thing. Probably the favorites of my movie are my movies, but not bad.
