As an adult I really enjoy this one. My 2 grandchildren and 3 1/2 years old were amazed and spent 15 months in mice. <br /> Music is fun and the animation is amazing. The sequel did not return to Neverland. A good follow-up to Cinderella's story; But what happens to a dressy? Another sequel? I hope!
