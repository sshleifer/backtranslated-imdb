Sensitive acting, good acting, good presentation, touching emotions etc., a delicate good movie. <br /> <br /> The Bollywood movie that I can appreciate is such an impact on me that I have literally been thinking about this film - The film features Urmila Matondkar's great performance and some from Manoj Bajpai. Urmila plays a girl in northern India in the face of the division and all the problems are sweet as compared to the problems she faces. <br /> The must-see image. The technically superior Bollywood product, I think, is comparable to the best films from other countries in the world.
