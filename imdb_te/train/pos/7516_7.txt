The first two-quarters of the fetish model Betty Page's biography are very interesting. Betty appears to have played with enormous truthfulness by Gretchen Mole, appearing as a fun, girl-next-door type of thing that she does not look bad (and is definitely "wrong"). Bettys rebuilt America by mixing old black and white stock footage with new, worst, black and white footage, "I Shot Shot Andy Warhol" and director of "American Psycho". Started working with Betty lands and Bunny Yager in Florida, the color is introduced. Betty's scandal is largely the result of Paula and Irving Claw (Lily Taylor, a great performance, and Chris Bauer), as well as her work with John Willie (Jared Harris). Horan Betty's slavery photography sessions are rendered with scenes enchanting and witty. The beginner purveyors of the fetish subject were not quite condescendingly filmed and we thought these folks were part of a tight "community". Betty has never had a problem with her recognition, but her performance has the impression that she has acted directly on her acting to prevent her from getting legal in the world. Since the film's third act does not actually exist, we thought we were looking at a feature length documentary rather than a structured drama rather than on the Betty Page. Next to the flaws, producer Christine Vachon's hat is a picture of catching and well represented another good feathers.
