Martin Torggaf's book "I Can not Find My Way Home", I am delighted to read that Chak, who completed the information on America's medicinal culture in 1945-2000 years. This person knows his stuff !! I am an excellent spokesman for this documentary. I enjoyed watching film clips from the hippie age and 70 stoner culture. The soundtrack is amazing. The composers are certainly associated with the sounds of each era. Hopefully they will package them and sell them as a CD set. As long as we know, 1960s experiments with LSD will greatly recommend to anyone interested in how to change American culture from time to time. One missing one is that of George Jung (played by Johnny Depp in the film "Blow"), who had previously been responsible for marijuana and cocaine in the 60s and 80s.
