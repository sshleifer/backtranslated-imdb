This is a great encouragement to these films. You T.V. If you see, you can not see the movie. Almost all the funny scenes are hidden in the previews, except that Jennifer Annisten is just one of the funny ones. It's a simple gym curry humor and it's really funny. Just do not go to see this movie expecting astonishment. In all, if you like Jim Carrey or comedies, see this must, otherwise just watch the previews and you will just be satisfied.
