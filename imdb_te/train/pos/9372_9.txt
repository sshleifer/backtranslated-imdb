What's going on after Red Rock West is one of those rare movies that keeps you guessing the whole time. Nicolas Cage is wrong with a contract killer, who enters a small town trying to find a job. Dennis Hopper is a bad guy and nobody plays good things for them. Look for a brief show by Star Dwight Yogam singing the country. This time is a very serious play but some light movements. What do you think you will enjoy this low budget but enjoy the high quality work?
