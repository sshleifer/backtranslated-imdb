Nice film with a great soundtrack extending through the Rock Landscape of 70's and 80's. Radiofrecia describes a generation, which describes life in a small village near Corregigio (the singer who wrote the film inspired by the book), which describes their problems for young people and the world. It reminds us of bitterness of bit of Italian touch.
