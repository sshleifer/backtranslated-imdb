Romantic comedies feature old films that are free to film. Usually in a romantic comedy, there is a girl and a man, both fall in love, then have problems, and then marry or overcome problems. But the film is a different story, which is quite different from romantic comedies I've seen recently. <br /> <br /> There is a widower (dawn), there is a girl (Mary). Darrie meets Mary in a bookshop and just a little talked about, after leaving Mary some time. Dan developed something for her, and when this something starts to turn meaningful, we get a twist. Mary is his brother's friend. Not heard about the circumstances, Don moves with Marie and finds that he loves him and Mary loves him, but their love is simply not possible. This is how the rest of the story is possible. <br /> <br /> Steve Karel is doing well, Juliet is as good as Binoeh Mary. And every other object is done well. It's a good picture, see.
