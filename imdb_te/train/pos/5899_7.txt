The beautiful idea ... salesgirl Linda Smith (Yolande Donlan) is a small small county of Lampidora. The country that is not even in North America, the country has become the 49th state ... (in fact, there were only 48 states at that time, which took place in 1952 ...) Linda inherits her country, and she is in this strange country and its quirkier people We try to figure out what we follow along. At one point, she sang a song that her people had advocated from Navajo, and it would never be much stronger from there ... However, Yolanda Donalan's huge lipstick and Omni-present smile never existed or shine. Citizens singing to invite their new princess and other songs are scattered. The technologist Glorus is the equivalent of the British version of the British version, where Tony Craig is a British subject of big name, Dirk Bogarde as cheese seller. Boagard made a big splash in the UK film industry after the war, and was also knighted by QE II. Craig and "The New Princess" jumped with one another, and Lampdidora's financial problems became more intense as their stunts became more and more fun ... just a little fun ... with the Marx Brothers movie. Notice that Danlann was later married to our short project author and director Wall Gest and married for 50 years! It's good to write and direct his science fiction flicks both in the UK and the US.
