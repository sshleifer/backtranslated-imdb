Just like wine, "Johnny Dangerous" gets good and good every day. This brilliant, witty, well-played movie could very well stand on its own - but parody of gangster style, it's really unusual. In fact, it is the most outstanding, it's ridiculous acting and relative dating of mob movies - although this position is its main contenders, such as the oldest, obscene and frustrating pseudocomedies "Jean Aston's Mafia".
