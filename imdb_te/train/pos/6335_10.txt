Well, I come from Bulgaria where it is almost impossible to have a tornado but my imagination tells me "very, very afraid"! This guy (Devon Sawa) has done a great job with this film! He knows how old he is but he does not act as child (well done)! Now it's not realistic about the tornado but you're scary! If you like a good time before the telly - this movie!
