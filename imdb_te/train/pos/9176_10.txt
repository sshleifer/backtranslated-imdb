This review is about 30 years late. However, in early 2008 I saw a copy of the film and saw it slowly for 4 months! I had to write about it! I have seen this movie once and tasted it and nobody forgot. How contrary it is to see the stupid male role of literature painted by the fairytale man! And yet, what a welcome sarcastic! Timothy Dalton has done his best to his role, and that's fine for me. He delivered an incredible and successful performance! I never saw it! All other actors are very good. The whole picture was beautiful. I do not care if someone tells me about this film. I love and love! It was fun and satisfying to me. I'm a bit shy to say this but I love Jane Ir 1983 for A & E's P & J, which I believe is the ultimate short-range. <br /> <br /> The essence of Jane Eyre is quite a bit behind me in school. I have never come to understand the story well when reading the book well. Seeing this particular product, the story revives me and goes to the frantic franchise. The scenes and the voice of Mr. Dalton led me to endlessly and finally led me to read the book, a fantastic character. Bravo's whole team and especially Mr. To Dalton !! This film is a part of me now. <br /> I gave a 10/10 rating.
