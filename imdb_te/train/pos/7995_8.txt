Here is a rainbow, the get-the-bad guys are starring in a relentless and tough Denzel Washington story. He has three personalities: a down and out-of-key-key-now drunk-a former armor, a father-type guy who loves a child and then a ruthless maniac on answers and revenge for boredom. <br /> The story is about a Washington girl who lives in Mexico as a bodyguard for a small American girl, where child kidnappings are regular (at least in the film.) He is a boy and a girl who is our day actress, Dakota Fanning. When fanning him in front of him, Washington is responsible and no one breaks. Beware: This movie is not for short things. <br /> <br /> This is a good and bad picture of a stylish image. I liked it, but many people were very warm to their tastes, as the camera-work could give you a headache. <br /> <br /> Along with two stars, Christopher Walken is always interesting. Low character, and the number of other good actors. <br /> <br /> This film leads to basic emotions in all of us, but it works.
