I forced to write a review for Space Cobra because it had a good score of 7.3 stars but some reviews that were written at this time were only positive. A strange situation and hopefully my positive review will attract people towards this old and largely forgotten anime movie. Space Cobra is a smuggler and rogue turbulent, which is associated with a nasty power of love to control the powers of the three sisters and planets of an ancient and dead planet. It's an old movie and animation shows, but it does not do in modern glitter and makes it charm enormous. Space Cobra is very easy for Western viewers and to see. Some Japanese culture and references to animated innovations are minimal and enjoyable. Space Cobra itself is witty and favorite. I can not say how much this is due to the intentions of English Dub or Maker, but this is one of the few Japanese comedy characters I find really funny. This style is an amazing soundtrack by many sixty barleyles, Yelo. The style is colorful and imaginative and has consistent action to move along the story. The most important aspect of the film is that it starts comedy and ends with a lot of downbeat dramatic note. I can not think of another animated or simple film that makes it so simple and confident. You can not realize that this is going to happen, but it has taught a lot and looks absolutely natural. You really feel that the characters went on a journey and they were changed by the whole experience of lives. Check if you want.
