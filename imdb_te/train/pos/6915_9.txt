An underestimated image textbook example. <br /> <br /> Even though it's over and over again this movie and every time laugh and still look something new, it's still considered another funny picture. And while the film inspired a number and added to it's quotes and pictures to the pyche of the audience, the moon over Parador still does not receive it praise. Noting that the Academy Award winner Richard Dreyfus and Raoul Julia, also a clever cast, can not change this feeling. <br /> <br /> But Roberto Strausmann can come to an end only if Richard Dreyfus refuses himself in a meatlocker that he once reads a good review of a part of a starring role after watching Raul Julia himself: this stuff is timeless! Fifty years will prove.
