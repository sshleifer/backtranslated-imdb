When I first started to jump on the bond of looking "Lost", I unexpectedly caught an episode in the beginning of season 1 with a polar-bear, and since then has my godly vision. Performance, ie. The polar bear is not. <br /> <br /> "The Lost" Desert takes a simple idea of ​​full passenger flight of crashing people, the island, and gradually each character is unusual in its premise by exploring each character deeply and unflinchingly when thoroughly thrown admiration Adds depth? Where did they come from? They work as a general divisor for many things in their lives, something they (with Sawyer and Kate with others) or spirituality (Locke, Claire). But the "Lost" is also the mysterious horrors that Zooms and even the island on the island ... and they all seem fantastically connected. <br /> <br /> Television actors display their subtlety or dazzling acting abilities, the cast of "Lost", the truth, the magnificent actors in their respective parts, the heart and humor in their performances. There is also a group of eyesight, but not many TV shows like plastic Hollywood. All of the characters feel real and they are very compelling to see. Are their interactions rarely predictable sappiness, small arguments or cheesy play (though they are annoyingly secretive)? These individuals are trying to live for the first time, and whatever relationship they do in the second act. The realism of these characters is already very well designed for sculptural plotting. <br /> <br /> About the plot ... Do you imagine the tree as a template plot, now the branches (in this case, a branch of each character) ?? Well, the Lost adds branches to each branch and then adds the twigs to the other knives. If you're the brother / sister of one of the main characters in the past, you will get your own storyline. If you are a dog you will have your own storyline. The writers will eventually set themselves up, except for some of them weaving all of them together in a marvelous end. <br /> <br /> Some people are disappointed in the film. <br /> <br /> The best performance in television. <br /> <br />
