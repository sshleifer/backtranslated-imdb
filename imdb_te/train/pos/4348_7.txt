The role of a cheerful comic and gently tender story about Paul Reiser's family walks from the standup comedy spotlight - what we see and what we can not see, what we expect and what surprises us. What I say about my folks does not illustrate any new standards, but we have a good little story that reminds us about the important bonds that the family represents. <br /> <br /> Sam Kleinman (Peter Faulk) is a workshop on the background of his wife Muriel (Olympia Dukakis), his daughters (MacKenzie Connolly and Lydia Jordan), and his son Ben (Paul Reiser). One day Murri was married and she was gone! Her daughters, together with Ben's wife, Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins), start searching for her search and find things out in a hurry and go on a road trip with Hunt and unsatisfied Sam's son Ben. A road trip will be a time for both men and each of them to understand their status as father and son and family. Sam is the first to rest in his life and introduces the functionality of life and entertainment that now works. The trip draw the warm end of the story where Marie's and why she left and ended up calling a phone call about the intrusion of the wiser's family. <br /> <br /> Fall or racer They play each other as a disadvantage, but Olympia Dukakis is on the screen, reminding us that her image is one of our strong matriarchs. Well worth looking at. Grady Harp
