I do not like this movie. I have seen in the top 25 most controversial films list. It did not look great. <br /> This is a twenty year old woman wants to know everything. She stores every bit of information collected in her enormous archives. She experimented with the experience of sex, political activism, and human relationships. Meanwhile, the crew of the film is shown to be filmed and we see the story and their reactions to each other. Nudity, clear sexual and controversial politics While the film was not featured in the US, restrictions failed. Although the film is a story, it is a documentary, which shows the world behind the filmmakers in the storyline, the fourth wall breaks down. The movie is the most direct movie I have ever seen. The film is primarily a psychedelic of the 1960s psychedelic goings, free-fighting and sexual liberation. <br /> <br /> I do not think I want to waste my time with the blue version of this film, but I actually do it really. The film is a buried treasure. Give it a try.
