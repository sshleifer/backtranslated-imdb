Lost well-made TV series about some people who have lost an island. There are so many turns and turns that you can not decide who your favorite character is, one minute it does something to her, so he's a nice sheet about to do something so she enhances the suspense and you end up with episode and you like noooooooooooooooooooo !!!!!! So to see the next episode you need to wait for the whole week to burst but worth the wait. Suspense, Action, Romance, Humor, etc. Everything is different from the girls but it's good to have a good story and let the story focus on all these things. Although this is good if you like a good story and feel like a suspense 24 I think it's good. (There is also a review on what you can check it out.) I will lose 10 to 8 mainly because it's unpredictable and you do not know what's going on.
