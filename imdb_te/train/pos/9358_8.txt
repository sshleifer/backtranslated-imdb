Adam Sandler and Don Chead became the winner of the powerful works. While humorous actors look dramatic in terms of dramatic, Sandler is no stranger to play more serious roles. The vast majority of the characters he portrays are inconsistencies and the vulnerability that can blow at any time. He may also be a titikat for the letters with such hidden anger problems. <br /> <br /> In this film, Alan Johnson (Cheadle) is his old college roommate, Charlie Finter (Sandler), who he did not see in many years. Five years earlier, Charlie faced a huge loss of his wife and three daughters in a plane crash. Charlie's reputation from the accident threatened and did not even recognize the role of Cheadley due to the little boy's lifestyle. It's not as long as Alan gets involved in a conversation that Charlie recalls. After their renewed relationship, Finisher allows a friend who does not speak about his loss, and eventually enables him to deal with the oppressed thoughts and feelings on his own words. <br /> <br /> Mike Binder does not show much of a personal style, although a writer-director, and some of his shots and transitions are a little bit embarrassing, while he is a talented and funny writer and has a good necklace from his actors. The film was filmed with a digital camera, with most filmmakers doing today, allowing staff to shoot overnight with limited light. It focuses on colorful backgrounds in New York City, but as a result of often creating digital grain, it scatters the blue alphabets and moves on the screen. <br /> <br /> Almost every major character in my power is a great performance. Jada-Pinke Smith and especially Liv Tyler are reminiscent of Chidle's role in their roles and a bored wife of a psychiatrist. Nevertheless, Sandler and Cheadle will present their best work to date. They totally owned the film. Sandler actually does not reflect externally or plays a role as he does not, partially credited to his Bob Dylan-Esquire Wig. <br /> <br /> Although Chadel's role has more screen time than Sandler, they both want to play major roles, in which they support equally and everyone is helping. <br /> <br /> Music also plays a great role in the film, especially the title song "Rain Over Me," or "Love, Rain Or Me" The Who, and then the Pearl Jam cover. In one of the most powerful movements in the film, Bind Sandler uses music to close his feelings and memories, but this particular song stimulates his emotions rather than reducing his anger. All of them, my over-the-Rain is happy, sad, and many times the funny film is run by its amazing celebrity shows.
