I love this movie. Director Michael Powell once stated that this is his favorite movie, and it is also mine. Powell and Presbyger created a seemingly, beautifully crafted story - love power called "powers". Whatever the case, its impersonation is "true or imaginable" in its complexity. Initially, it was the only film to portray the effects of war on young, poetic Aimer during WWII. Or is it? Never answer the question one way or the other. Actually, it was not even asked. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> For example, Presburger always wanted a cinematic version of Richard Strauss' opera der Rosencalier's 18th-century Viennese lords. It is clear in the middle of a short, which involves conductor 71, dressed in all aspects (it is found in silver in heaven). <br /> <br /> David Niven is his lovely, and he has excellent support from Roger Lively and relative newcomer Kim Hunter. But, in my opinion, the charm of the film is coming from Marius Goring as a conductor 71. He has a very interesting role so far, filling it with his innocents with his scenes and this movie is bright. It's a pity that the conductor's 71 scenes remain on the cutting room floor. Despite the fantastic videos of the Scarlet Pimperan television series since the 1950s, Goring's comedic talent is rarely seen in the film too hard. This is a very memorable role in his career. He is the perfect foil for Nina's relaxed style, and his virtual ostatim is quite contrary to the sequence of characters remaining. Ironically, in the mid-1940s, Nine also played against another heavenly "Messenger", played by Cary Grant in The Bishop's Wife. Their acting styles were very quick, and I was boring, annuristic and frustrated. In Pavel's view, GÃ¶ring wanted the role of Peter Carter seriously, initially the conductor rejected 71. This is a good thing that he has given us a very happy part. <br /> <br /> "The film" will be gentle on the weakest link between Britain and the United States, and it will end its position in the end. But panic attacks have disarmed in its delicate reminders- many deaths, both military and civilian, need to "go" when they face death. The WWII "enemies" in heaven are not clear, but the citizens shown are unrecognized. Powell and Presbyger were more explicit in their depiction, but this was not necessary. As expected, the film may not work for its diplomatic interests, but its reality prompts Moemakers and audiences on both sides of the Atlantic.
