As a Chris Rock fan, I told him I was the lowest expectation going into the film and proved to be wrong. The first flaw was that it was coming to everyone. The chemistry between Regina King and Chris Rock seemed to be a fake number two. Finally, the acting sub-par in the film is worse than the best actor Regina King and Mark Audi. But I've seen that error past and saw a solid comedy. In the Heads-Up scenario, heaven can wait instead, this is good. So there you can see the film for all of Chris Rock fans, you'll enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Overall: 10 out of 10
