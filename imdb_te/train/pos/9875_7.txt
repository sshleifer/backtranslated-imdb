Presenting Lilly Mars (MGM, 1943) is a beautiful picture, but it's good in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Judi Garland is always great, but there are some scenes in the film and the romance between her and Van Hefelin is developing very quickly. <br /> I mean, but in the next minute he will fall in love with her. I believe this product, film album and script (although the photography is great, the scenery is good and the clothes are fine). It feels like the product has moved a lot. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is good, especially the youngest daughter Rossi, the youngest daughter of Rossi, Janet Chapman. She is really beautiful at age 11, and it's a shame she does not develop as a young comic actress. In the late 1930s, Warner Bros. (excluding the previous Broadway musketeers 1938, better than her) was better than her previous films, when she tried to make her the Shirley Temple / Cybill Jason Hybrid. Overall, the film was much better, but eventually, Judy gave her all.
