Lisa Boumer (Ida Galli) is the spouse of a big businessman who has a life insurance cover of $ 1 million when her husband was killed in a plane crash when she was a businessman. And her insurance investigator is Peter Linch (George Hilton) and an Interpol agent on her tail. Athens is going to Greece to earn money in his inheritance, but emphasizes that it is in cash ... a dangerous turn of events. Lynch is now trying to save her husband Laura Floriscus's lover, but she tries to kill herself with her accomplice Sheriff for the share of her own known money. And our masked killer starts his / her brutal murders. In accordance with our hero, Lynch was first suspected by the Greek police and warned that Police Inspector Strauss (Luigi Pistilli Zia and Spaghetti) should not leave Athens through. Lynch then helps the gorgeous Kleo Dupont (Anita Stindenburg) local journalist, helping him to investigate the killings. There is enough red herring to say that no one can see the film can destroy it, and there is a lot of joy in this story, glad to be happy with the mystery / thriller fans. Giovalli No No Sham DVD has excellent transition with English and Italian soundtrack. It's a very impressive score for a good measure by Bruno Nikolai, which will be over your head for a while .... All the first rate is Giovallo.
