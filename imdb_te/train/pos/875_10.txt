Well, when my nerves are still zengling, what can I say just seeing this amazing picture! Jacques Audyard's director must have a lot to name himself in France, and do exactly that. Vince Cassell Tom Cruise and Emmanuel Devos are not Penelope Cruz, but these are two magnificent actors, and this is a brilliant and compelling thriller, which starts slowly with some brilliant character building, and is ultimately the ultimate thrill of great tension. I write about the plots of others, so I realized that the camera is right down to the right, director, actors play their role, and everything is real, no stupid gun play, fighting, it's reliability, feelings, emotions, you are like a spectator. Make yourself a favor, DVD, get a bottle of wine, turn the lights off, take the hook-up phone and immerse yourself in this Hitchcockian thriller :)
