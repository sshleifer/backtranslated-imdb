I am surprised to make such films. I see all kinds of movies with my friends and I can say that I have one of the best ever. <br /> <br /> Washington, always attractive and seriously plays CRESCY, is a washed-up former counter-terrorist agent bottle. Once in Mexico City he was appointed to protect the young pita (Dakota Fanning), his emotional and ransom arc jump, which could only offer the adorable little girl. Inevitably, the pita kidnaps the thugs and decides that most of Mexico City's courage to remove his character's teddy-bear-clinging stimulant. Yes, he became ... Man on Fire. <br /> You should watch this movie.
