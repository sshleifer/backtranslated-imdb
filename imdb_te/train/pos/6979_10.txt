<br /> <br /> It is a real character and storytelling play at a level that is very obscure of most of us watching TV. Even if your psyche is not a fish nut (like me ...) on this planet, it's more interesting in another galaxy. I have not seen any empty ships or laser guns (though there is nothing else) so far I have seen up to s01 e04 and I am thinking and thinking about what happened next to having a lot of possibilities. Cast plays there with the cast pauses. Eric Stolts is particularly strong. <br /> <br /> This presentation really stands alone, if you see the BSG, it is quite different. <br /> <br /> I read some negative reviews from science fiction geeks that have lesser drama and more aliens and Ray guns, but I will ignore them. <br /> <br /> It is a good positive start in a program. They usually let the good performances do these days and hope they cann it after 1 or 2 seasons.
