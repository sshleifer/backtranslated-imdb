Oh dear. Another example is "Oreland" and religion. From the IRA we see some dull nonsense featuring some "hunky and macho free fighters". Credits started my initial reaction, but after one and a half a month I was in shock. <br /> <br /> The story begins on the wedding day between Sean Klan and Sheila Kelly in the 1950s. They had a little problem with marrying in the Catholic Church, and though that Sheila was Protestant, Shille attended the Catholic school, taking the pledge of bringing Catholic children, and old enough.
