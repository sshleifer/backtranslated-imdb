I'm a kick-ass picture of "Anything ..." Really. Tom Barman spent the year together, and it shows: Each scene is polished and has meaning ... I highly agree on it. One reason to criticize many people is the "lack of story". I fear that this "traditional" story influences us all the time. I mean: What you can achieve in a book is that you can not achieve a movie, you can not achieve what you can do with the movie, just telling it to one friend. The problem is that we use movies, series, ... just a pictured version of a story; A visual recording of events - like when you watch the news - we estimate that each image has these epic features: a lot of unusual events is a strong storyline. And I emphasize the idea of ​​"extraordinary moments": most news on TV, movies, series, ... exceptional situations, once in a lifetime. And here in "Anyway ...", there are exceptional events, but the "Hollywood Bigger Explosion" way: Guy fires, the pair reunites, the car is stolen ... and actually very simple things. And it is strong: the ability to just congratulate all, in the universe, art. I agree that what can only be achieved in movies, and the atmosphere and photography of the score are concentrated. But in traditional visual films (Visual Blackbusters like Matrix) do not like; It works for utensils and is deeply human. I mean, you'll enjoy the love of Tom Barman Antwerp and urban lifestyle in each shot. And as he has something to "learn", there is no point in this film; And he has a big story telling him with amazing scenario turns. He shows a city that shows a city in their good and bad side: "This is our city, it's life, so basically," Anyway ... "is not just Super Browwy, but a message This is a much stronger "message" than it is acceptable (not clear, but obvious). One drawback: We will wait five years to watch the next Baron movie, and everyone will expect it too ...
