The masked king (Bian Leon in China) is a shocking, beautiful and intense picture. The film was based on true story centers on Wong Bianlan, a winner of 16 Awards around the world, 1930 in China, a street performer who was unable to pass on his face's art of art despite growing old age. He has a special talent for quick changing masks in performance, and no one knows how to do it. Since his art is a family inherited only to a male heir, he has a great desire to have a grandson. We can go to the streets and their children can not care because their children are being sold: if some want to take their daughters independently, because the daughters in this community are not very valuable. <br /> <br /> The film is surprisingly cool, acting is awesome, and the issues are very heavy and well-delivered. Gender odds and the fact that no one in this time and place dreams of becoming a little girl. Interestingly, the famous opera actor plays the role of a woman and is known as living bodisatva, a man dressed as a woman, and he is famous and well-respected, woman. When we enter the film, human slave trade and the lack of solutions to its demands and problems, the brutality and corruption of the military and police, and helplessness and the lack of power for any person <br /> This is one of the best films I have seen in my life, and Wang Zhu Ju, who plays the Balean role, offers another beautiful performance. .
