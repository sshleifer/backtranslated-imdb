Scrolling through John Candy's film credits in iDDB, noticeing an entry entitled "Once Upon a Crime ..." I saw these years ago when I was young and could not recall the title. Something hovered over and I clicked on it, and after reading the summary of the plot it brought back memories of unforgettable memories. <br /> <br /> If I did not like it, it was a "great" comedy. <br /> <br /> The film has a large cast of characters, an American couple who finds a woman's dog, who is vacationing in Europe, decides to return to her for a gift - only when her dead body is dead. From there the plot gets crazier and sillier and the police go in the run after they feel assassins. <br /> <br /> "It's a Mad Mad Mad World" and a lightweight Hitchcock feature which is directed by Eugene Levi and some of his best friends like John Candy are his performances. The film is immersed largely by its cast and is not endless, it is not unexpected, but unexpected.
