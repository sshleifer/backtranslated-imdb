This film will take you to another time when there is a different pace in everyday life. Families have come up with how to combat the war and how quickly we have sent young people to fight. <br /> <br /> In the past a very touching look in mind and a reminder before the death of the war. <br /> Fortunately many of us have been involved in a war with our grandparents, grandparents or parents. This movie, I think, little thanks. Peter Outerbridge looks great like a young Peter O'Toole and Russell Crowe and he is absolutely lovely and Australian in Australia. It is definitely worth to read and hear him "High Flight" and makes him wonder what he might have achieved with Shakespeare.
