Farewell Friend aka Adieu L'Ami / Thieves is not perfect but it does not fit into a neat and entertaining thriller, stolen bonds that sees the same basement warehouse trapped by the French Algerian war veterans Alain Delan and Charles Branson. Two millions of wagers sitting there on Christmas weekend cleaning. Obviously they are not so easy after opening the treasury that leads to some expensive turns and turns. Branson is the most hideous stripstones scene in a car park, with Branson playing the most abusive moments, Brigitte FOSSE, probably the most hideously misconceived hairstyle for the 60's (which makes her the most irritating catchphrase like Fonzie, a wig that her wig is on her head The upper peak flips up the top), is any responsibility? She said, "I 'll cook spaghetti! I love Shakespeare! Is speech speechful in all the wrong ways ?? And it's a shame about the late line / shot, but it's a surprisingly entertaining and unusual number to check if you could find a good print. <br /> <br /> Cinema Club's UK DVD English Soundtrack, but the great problem that Delan voices himself dubbed well and the other cast is well dubbed, from wireless transition to pretty good quality.
