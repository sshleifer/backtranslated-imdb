'I only wanted to say if you laugh in the purple rain.' This is a fantastic movie. It should be re-rated to PG-13. But anyway, Prince's first movie and great. Followed by sucking. But I did not see for years here what I can remember about it. Kid (the prince) had to deal with his life, the Apollonia (her) affection, to keep her band (revolution of themselves) with tension in his family. But his opponent's band (time themselves) is destroying his life. Morris (himself) is trying to steal Apollonia from Kid. Saturday Night Fever, Flashdance and 8 Mile. Very good. Rent it, laugh and cry and buy it if you luv it.
