As well. I'm biased. I live in Shrewsbury, England, where I shot this wonderful film. It still looks like this. I shot them very clearly here, in the end days the fake snow on the streets. Often, when I was walking through Shrewsbury, I saw a street or house and reminded me of this film. <br /> <br /> George Scott's Scrooge is a more realistic role than many other screen versions. His physical appearance is not the typical difficulty. Scott's big and majestic is. <br /> <br /> We all know the story and the quotes. This book is one of the most famous works of the English language. I do not believe there are many sycophants who claim that people are not capable of change and liberation. This version of the film is very beautiful. <br /> <br /> Scott is an American but proficient in English feelings. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. I strongly say that if you do not see this version I will do it. Is it generally available for a very small amount ... or do you understand too?
