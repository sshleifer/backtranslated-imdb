I found 'Still Crazy' seriously fun, only to the end of the '60s, 70s' rocky era of rock. <br /> <br /> My 15-year-old daughter looks at me every time, just like the DVD (I do not worry, only three times), and she also loves it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <p> Bill Nighy is my first introduction and I'm glad to turn his somewhat similar to 'Love Actually' and brought him more attention. Bruce Robinson is a brilliant figure like Brian, who brought real life as a parody of a drug-damaged rocker stereotype. <br /> <br /> I am living in Sherman Oaks, California. For the first time, I saw Billy Connolly clapping this film. The local mall (he lived here at that time) and said it was one of my five favorite films. He invited me to sit at the dinner court and for some time we discussed the film. We also talked about the American-based remake idea before cleverly deleted. <br /> <br /> My problem with the original 'Still Crazy' is not only popular in theaters and many have lost a lot of exciting experience.
