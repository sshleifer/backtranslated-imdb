First of all, do not call 'the remake of '63 film. Although this version of the stage play is true, it is too long. Casting is good with few exceptions. China Phillips is not a good casting choice. She is almost 30 years old when doing this movie, and it is hard to believe that she is a teenager. Jason Alexander was a good choice, but after a while he gave me a headache. Tyne Dalie violated his piece as Ma Pietersen. George Wendh was funny as Harry McAfee and showed he had a tune. Like the '63 film, they starred in the Conrad Birdy who did not know. Mark Kudische enjoyed his role with Birdicky and showed it. I have a soundtrack and I listened to him singing. So what did this make a TV ratings flap? It's one of the longest. They are put on new songs and scenes. Although some of the new songs are good (like "let's settle down"), which really do I need? Now do not make me wrong, I like it, but I have seen 63 pictures (see my review). Some of the actors' characters, some changes, and once again, LENGTH is just one case. I forgot about Wassaas Williams. She is doing a good job with her role and music. Give her any literature and she can sing them. Here's my suggestion from couple productions by Bye Byrdie: If you take an entertainer in the play, see '63 film. If you want to see a version that's true for the play, see '95 version. Take it in moderation. Try not to be a hero and watch all in one sitting.
