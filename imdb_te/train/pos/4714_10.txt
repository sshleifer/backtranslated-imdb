<br /> <br /> The famous words of Roman Knorini's owner, "Lousy Cork Sucker", who only spent the whole movie as Johnny Dangerous's opponent, but binds the English language. The afternoon afternoon or "Late Late Show", Johnny Dangerously talks about a good hearted boy who secretly leads the life of the criminals to pay for his mother's medical care and put his brother in law school. br> <br /> The story is yes, but who cares ?? <br /> <br /> Joe Piscopa, Dom deuis, Marie Hannah, and Alan Hale Jr. have been waiting for you to see what happens. <br /> <br /> There are so many smiles to keep here. Like the plane, you care or you lose something. Good luck or good for anyone who can use two people!
