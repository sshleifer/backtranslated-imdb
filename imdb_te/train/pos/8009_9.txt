Ah, true memories. I lived in Holland at that time and eagerly anticipated every Sunday evening and later on Tuesdays. I looked at my 14-16s. As the Dutch language provides subtitles for other languages, it is better to be in English, nowadays kiddies are displayed. So you will hear the original voices and language. - This series was also distributed to Germany because the best series, Nazi Van Gelb, disappeared from the first three and later series (I do not think they ever really attracted him, he always escaped, let him look again in another narrative) And a Nazi enemy did not come very well! It is very bad, because Geoffrey Toon has done an amazing job of playing the role of a clever Nazi Countess who will take revenge on this wonderful Englishman. It is a real pleasure to see this kind of quality performance in the youth lineup, but Ronald Lee-Hunt is a very talented and young men are very simple. They were very convinced that I was able to imagine that I was part of this young man when I was a child, four years older than me. This is a very exciting series for me, standing up for a special show with my "Prisoner" at that time. I'll publish the best quality DVD of that series, which is awesome. There are also plenty of bad copies around. The next series was not good, watered down and was not quite as fun as the first three. Hopefully they also find other series of Van Gelb to keep on DVD. Greetings from Canada.
