Elganes and Claus are not always the first ones, but sit around the folks (such a thing) and talk about the movie Noir. <br /> <br /> "The past out," "the killers," "a lonely place," "night and the city," a moody catch phrase and foreboding shadows, Fedoras, and It increases beyond the meaning of Femme-Fatals. <br /> <br /> <br /> "This is where the trail ends," the film is very hard to find - the only copy in the best stock video store in Manhattan is a tough bootleg from the AMC cable channel - this class belongs to a class. <br /> <br /> The black cloud passing of the opening credits from the moment, a curtain rogue detective Mark Dickson's drawing around the world of the inferiority, and passing moments, close to it, threaten to breathe. Sure, he is a dark past cop, but Dana Andrews Dixon is uncomfortable and makes him uncomfortable to you. And yes, he has been hitting around suspects for a long time, and the newly encouraged chief (Carl Malden, in a generally strong and command outing) has been warning him of "last time." <br /> <br /> Dixon Now many people hate these thugs to stop this. And the boy did they have to come in? <br /> "Hoods, dusters, cups, gutter nickel-rats" He drops a boss's harsh nicose and rolls all the complaints received by the bureau about Dixon's right hook. Advice for cooling for his own good. Instead he takes him into his own hands. <br /> The world of difficulty when he relies on his instincts may not have come from generation to generation. <br /> <br /> As soon as he cops, Syndicate is in deep with his own partner. Dixon's questionable involvement in a murder "trial" threatens his work, wondering whether he is the only base he has taken as sworn to take on Bogart in "Lonely Place", "what can he do?" /> <br /> When he's out of nowhere, he finds it almost doomed to his unexpected relationship with a ceramic beauty (fantastic gene tirni) that almost feels worthy of his barren bachelor's presence in his home coming home. <br /> <br /> The speed of this magnificent image is taut and grasping. A group of writers who contributed to the product have improved this script to high glasses - the dialogue feeds rather than breaks into dialogue feeds, which are not dramatic or satisfying. <br /> <br /> In this top-line direction, performance is not too soft for everything or Buffett to unravel the emotional grip of the movie. Jean-Tarney's angelic, soft-sighted beauty is used for great effect. She shows herself as a significant performer, and her sensitive, kind of nature in her psychosis is "leave it to heaven." The scenes between Tearney and Andrews' Dickson are more intense and he is close to self-devastation. <br /> <br /> At the end of his cord, cut, wounded, and exhausted Dixon reveals his very essence: "Innocent people may also have terrible jams." "It's a bad act and you're on your head." <br /> <br /> The film is very intuitive because things seem to be worse for anyone - especially someone trying to do the right thing - a slight change in the air, a wrong decision or a punch, or, for the most frightening reasons is not. Noir always reflects the dark fears, bringing them to the surface. That's where the "Ends Where Are Where" is realistic. <br /> <br /> One nit-pick beside: Mystery Science Theater has been missing, which is very beautiful. /> <br /> But noir fans - heck, no movie fans - this is a wonderful treat for those who have never seen one.
