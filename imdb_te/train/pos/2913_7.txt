"This Man Navy", as suggested by other comments, is a rare and well-drawn view of the Navy than the air (LTA) actions. LTA missions are proud they are not proud to lose any ship to submarine attack. And a vast glimpse into a type of flight that has long been shot in various NAS locations. However, the first half of the film was about Bairi, his relationship with his service pals and settled on Drake's leg, meeting Tom and Drake's character and his mother. Only then the second film begins. The second film is largely under the influence of LTAs, taking the surface surface, killing boys and causing more damage. The look is very gritty and realistic, I imagine. Then we can switch to Southeast Asia. Are LTAs in the Navy? Never mind, this part is really in the forest, used to collect some fallen gas from a blimp forest. And jigsaws are shooting like madness. Vietnam's shades will be a breakout, except to get rid of. This is a blimp we're talking about. Finally, a feeling of the extraordinary part of the war-a good WWII play.
