This image is great! This picture is beautiful! Finally, there is a film that portrays Moslems as a People, no stereotypes here. The film is driven by storytelling, acting and most of its background, cultural acceptance and innovations. They seem like clocks but they are not at least in this film. The Vista of Mecca's Grand Mosque is absolutely gorgeous and a spectacular part of the Muslim world that is rarely shown in the West by audiences. Here people are concerned, support, devotion, tolerance and commitment to each other. Welcomed from the common negative pictures of the Arabs and the way the exit departure. Best Picture.
