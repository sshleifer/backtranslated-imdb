It may not be the best film of 2006 but an image for curiosity and thought. Sentinel is a good political thriller, which is related to some of the other political thriller films, or Fire and Manchurian candidate in line. The primary plot of the film is in such other movies: a plot to kill the President of the United States. Michael Douglas has acted as Secret Service Agent Pete Garrison, who works only to find out what he later made. Keefe Sutherland David Berkechridge and Eva Longoria, a co-star of the rival, Jill Marine as the agent under Rookie Agent Breckenzed and Academy Award winner Kim Basinger's First Lady Sarah Ballantine. An improvement may be more effective for some of the themes that are considered to be an action film like the thriller film, but the good thing about the film is that it is just a murder attempt to kill the President of the United States. The Secret Service, headed by the President in the wrong direction, belongs to the mole (traitor).
