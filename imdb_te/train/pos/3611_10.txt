I saw this movie after watching the Blue Crush and other films of Michelle movies, and I thought she had a Bilak future in this business. After seeing her performance in "Girlfight", I thought it was wrong, not a war, but also a warrior. The way she faced her father about the treatment of her and her brother in the film, is the way she expresses her anger to get the hit. Learning the Curve in her film is that her characters always hide from a wall and love, or because she has the power to succeed. I believe that this role is suitable to Michelle, even though the director did not see her talent, even though she had no prior experience.
