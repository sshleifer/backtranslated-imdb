I'm worried about ABC's disappointment in another show that I am likely to be a true winner. This performance is great, the writing and the storyline are great, the original idea for a show instead of another boring reality show. Casting is amazing! Not only characters and actors, but they are the most talented actors set. The concept and idea is really a new and cool idea for a TV program, most of us share this whole idea of ​​"connections". I really love Steven, Laura, Whitney and Damien. But honesty is not a person involved in this program, but some parts (like Shary Appleby). Acting and characters are so easy and talented !! I think ABC gave this presentation more opportunity and did not disturb the program midnight, and it was not advertised adequately. Really injustice! Everyone !!. This program has shown great promise. I can tell you how to feel ABC and send emails to keep this presentation alive. Please join me and I know we can. It worked for Jericho. (Where's the episode 13? I want the last show!). Please support this show and send emails to ABC, what we can do !!! This program is well worth it !!! Online song to protect SIX DEGREES: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html WE CAN DO !! ASAP this presentation !!!
