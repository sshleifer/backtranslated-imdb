Stoic and laconic soldier Sergeant Todd (always reliable Kurt Russell's fine and reliable performance) will be rejected on a desolate remote planet after he thinks he is brutal and proud Colonel Mekum (played slimy hit by deliciously Jason Isaacs) Todd and his fellow soldiers are genetically engineered Was replaced by a new modern race. Todd self-based outcasts meets a peaceful ragtag community and has to protect this community when new soldiers reach the field of exercise. Director Paul W.S. Anderson, working from the smart and provocative script by David Webb People, painted Chilling's attention on the future deterioration, cool and harsh, and organized a complex version and a tough, sandy tone. Furthermore, Anderson moves the moves of humanity (the fight of Todd's fight to be closely associated with his previously suppressed feelings) and action scenes that can be confusing with rip-roaring pleasure. Russell Todd's powerful and appealing almost pantomime filming; He makes much of his performance through his body movements and facial cues without much knowing the emotion. Mrs. Nathan Gary, Gary Bassy Krusty's veteran veteran Captain Church Michael Jalie Johnny Pig, as Jane Scott Lee, a gracious enemy like Cain 607, but Neilson, Kanye Nielsen, as Sean Pertwei, a gracious male like Jared and Taylor Thorne, And Brenda Weil, as mayor Hawkins. Better still, this film makes a deep and important statement about the spiritual cost of the intellectual strength and the importance of intellectual strength on the physical force. David Tatzer's polished cinematography, Joel McNeil's stirring full-bore orchestral score and first-rate rate special effects will further enhance the overall sterling quality of this high sci-fi / action hybrid outing.
