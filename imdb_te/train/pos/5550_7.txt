Highlights of this 1917 feature. The Klan's Pride tells the story of a young man who was the leader of the family after her father died. On an island off the coast of Scotland, villagers are spending the normal lives of "Fisher Folk". My copy is too dark and difficult to read, but this film has some amazing sea view and camera work is amazing in boats. Maurice Tourner directed this fun film, Pickford. Pixford is already a major actor in 1917, and this film seems to have been written for her: plucky young woman succeeded over misfortune. The picard whip thrown by the lazy villagers on the side of the church is very funny. The final scenes are well done on the sinking ship. Not a great picard image, but still worth looking at. Matt Moore (Peckford married his brother Owen Moore) has given an interest in love, and the hitting is as good as the island lad. Leitrice Joy is one of the villagers, but I can not recognize her. My copies add hours and a strange feel when many of the Gong's rung interspers and gram alert bells. Very efficient.
