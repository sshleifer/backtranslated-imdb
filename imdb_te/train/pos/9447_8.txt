Dragging the drama of four people in a canoeing weekend in a remote river. They are Shantikarini Ed (Jon Voiat), the adventurous, violent Lewis (Burt Reynolds), Bad Bobby (Ned Beatty) and Nice Guy Drew (Rony Cox). The first 40 minutes are great - the incredible couplet Banzos sequence, interesting interaction between the characters and the wonderful Widescreen Cinematography by Wilmus Giant. Then two hills attacked Ed and Bobby. One of them hurts Bobby ... and the tour becomes a nightmare. <br /> Reliable. The scenery is very beautiful and this terrible torture is going on. To be honest, Betty's rape never bothers me - I know it's fake despite good acting. The film shows how the characters change - Ed his pacifism is tested and Lewis is weakened, Bobby first violates one of the people he mocked and Drew tries to keep himself serving. Directed by John Bourmann is also very promising and the sounds of the forest and the river can help a tremendous mood. <br /> Acting is very good. Voight is just ok in the lead - he's fine. Beatty is okay - but his debut film and he is hard to take on a dangerous role. When the cox starts to fall apart, it is very good. And Reynolds is simply awesome - one of his best acting jobs ever! Although it was nominated for the Academy Award, how did it get me? <br /> <br /> Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward Hill are very believable. <br /> A powerful image - not for children. Try to see uncut version - TV version is destroyed. A letter box is also required to capture the breathtaking images.
