Director Anthony Mann and Star James Stewart (starring before working for the Night Passage, except for a few days), The Far Country Bails does not like his own redemption and struggles at every stage. During this time he was a veterinarian, which resulted in an inquiry of labor issues - issued a legal inquiry by John Maynter's Larque's Judge's Judge and Orders due to the hardest strikes - to cope with a gun at the end of the pavement. He steals them again and takes them across the Canadian border, killing what he wants or killing them, as soon as he stays up to the growing conflict between intellectuals and judges. <br /> <br /> Stewart turns out to be a surprisingly mild critter, not using his desire to leave alone alone as he is unlikely to warn the group of prospectors of an imminent accident when he is not likely to be his problem. Actually, the judge is immediately recognizable, and he rejoices in the company of the grateful spirit of the mischievous person to misuse himself. Even the urban people who shared their faith on him in many ways have been able to recognize it - the only one who could stand up to the judge despite his pleas for his dead and buried good nature is the worst use of the majority of the country, The level takes place on the field, and Walter Brennan, Harry Mo Gan and Ruth Roman (although korin Calvert is different from the embarrassment of a young romantic interest). Unfortunately, the great cinematography of Canadian Rockies has been specially assisted by DVD transfers, theater trailer only.
