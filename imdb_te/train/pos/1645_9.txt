This is done in a different way than most Westerners. The reality is the key here. Farrell comes to Wyoming to work for Rip Torn in his Ranch. How it's displayed makes America the most interesting piece. I preferred to look on the big screen rather than on the tape, but I need to look back at life in real life. Cinematography is amazing. Solid 9. Torn & Farrell Excel in this movie.
