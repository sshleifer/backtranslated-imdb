I showed it to my 6th grade class 17 years ago and students liked it. I also loved it. The story of the termites and their interaction in their environment is amazing. The cast of the creatures is deep and they all play their roles. <br /> <br /> Alan Route has done some amazing camera work and must win the best documentary Oscar. In the copy I own, Orson Wales (Derek Jacobi) does not comment, it is not called "mysterious castles of clay", just "clay castles." <br /> <br /> I have been very fortunate to find these VHSs before, and it is now my favorite movie. They brought them to the latest family collection instead of Disney. If you find this movie you are really lucky.
