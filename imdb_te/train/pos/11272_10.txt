108: Tarzan and his colleague (1934) - 4/20/1934 were released, looked at 8/6/08. <br /> <br /> John Dillinger escapes from prison and moves a bank in Iowa. Two road patrolmen killed in Bonnie & Clyde Texas. <br /> <br /> When we were disappointed with the original Tarzan The Ape Man, we were the second film between colleagues and historians, Tarzan and his companion, the best of the series. This is true. I got a huge kick for this movie. Johnny Weilller returned to nominal wine-swinging, animal dualizing wild superhero, and Maureen O'Sullivan loved her role as her absolutely fantastic lady Jane (here's the first and last time two pieces of clothing). In my review for 'Ape Man, I stomped in Jane's pretty good for her siege with clothes and her uninterrupted screams, but she's delivering me to myself here. No mistake should be made: osullivan is the actress, and Jane is the most influential character in the whole cast. She acts as an ambassador between Holt and Tarzan, working in her forest and working with animals, and when she comes out of the bullets she knows how to stay away from the pride of the lions. She now has her own wild scream now. Chemistry irresistible between Johnny and Maureen. She is fully trained. Cheetah is very lovely, pulling Martin's cigarette. This breed is largely unnecessary to fight with the most poisonous animals of Tarzan jungle, especially lions, crocodiles, and rhinos. Although the effects are always visible, more powerful and nice and full of action to complete. Oh, and you can not talk about the movie without talking about the naked swimming scene. All I can say: Yes, she is naked. <br /> <br /> Kevin: Wow. Just wow. This is not a candle to 'Tarzan and his companion' when it comes down to dirty and dirty pre-code action / adventure. The indisputable sequel to Tarzan the Ape Man is a kick-ass, violent and dangerous wild epic. I think another Tarzan film in the future will make prisoners this way. The full scene in this movie is the code-approved or animal rights-you endeavor to accept it for that matter. The gruesome violence does not even wait to show the happy jungle couple to slow down the limits of today's adventure films. After T & J entered the film, there was a morning rush and suddenly naked afternoon swim. If you do not believe me see it for yourself. Mourlenes Oswalvan I loved most of the film. In the first film, Jane appears to be a walk contradiction, and the authors do not know how to portray such a character. But here she is a great precursor to kick-butt girls. Although she still needs Tarzan's help in getting her from most jams, she does much more than waiting around her protective. Her personality is absolutely reliable for a woman living in a forest (relatively) lifestyle year. I saw this with my mother and "trained" Jane Tarzan, as Jeff Foxworthy pointed out to her. She is completely monkey man at every beck and call. Despite the dated optical effects throughout the film, Tarzan vs predator battles (mostly) are real. This time around the monkeys are very convincing as men and men dressed. Tarzan and Jane surprised the violence of the kingdom of animals left by two people breathed. While the couple reunite with the sunset and win, I can not imagine how this story will be heard by Tarzan and Jane and the next Safari to hear on the previous group of people who have never heard of it again. . ** END SPOILER ** One of the things that still bother me is Johnny Weissmuller's soft, hairless bod and over-style coif. <br /> <br /> <p> <p> Next Twentieth Century (1934).
