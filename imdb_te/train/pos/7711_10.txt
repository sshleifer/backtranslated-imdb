Okay, so Robbie's today makes little hockey-by-scales, and some of the acting are pretty stilted, and a lot of special effects can now be duplicated by a bright 12-year-old kid with a good computer editing program. <br /> After 40 years of release, it is still great. I grew up watching "science fiction" on the local TV station's "Science Fiction / Adventure Theater" on Sunday afternoons, so I saw quite a few SF movies from the 50s. While most films kill a rubber wear and demolish a small model of a city, the Forbidden Planet has always raised the bar and has actually shown a chance to make a science fiction film with a plot. <br /> <br /> Many SF films made in the 90s are considered to be viewable in the 2030s.
