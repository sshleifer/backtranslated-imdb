Everyday we can watch movies and soap on TV. Sometimes a miracle happens. A great movie with real feelings, great actors, great reality-director. There are two movies that everyone should watch: first you are "Sophie's Selection" with Meryl Streep. The second is "Journey of Hope". As human beings, we need to know about the love of others, humility about the approval of other civilization and other lifestyle. We must fight on racism and fascism. We should not avoid judgment and avoid criticism. We must love our earthly companion only. This amazing film, John (Lennon) helps us to reach his dream: think of all the people who live in peace. These two pictures are hard to see: note them, but you will be hurt, but it's fine. Great movie, great actors, terrible story, pain and cry is guaranteed, but good understanding of others. Enjoy.
