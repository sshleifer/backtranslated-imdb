I really liked this movie, it's good, and the actors are brilliant! Lion Robinson, who played Richard, and many classic singers, is very good at his music work, and when you see him in a musical film, you know it's good! If I want to know more about Richard, I suggest that people see this heart warming, sad and unique image! Fabulous! Latest!
