This is a great show, and makes you cry, this group people really love each other in real life and it shows time and time again. Email me and let me chat. <br /> I'm in Australia and they speak this way. <br /> <br /> I want you to enjoy five miles of creeks and about these great stories that are right and wrong, and friendly to your children. I have all 40 episodes in DVD-R that I have collected over the last 5 years. See my five Mile Creek Tribute Www.mikeandvicki.com and listen to the extended theme music. <br /> These people are great!
