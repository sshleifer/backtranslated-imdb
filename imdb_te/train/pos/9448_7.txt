This is undoubtedly the most disturbing picture I have ever seen. The first part of the film, if strange, it has a light and fun quality. Explaining and emphasizing the beauty of Apollachia's hills, the journey begins on such a peaceful symbol. But it is misguided beyond belief. The obvious social issues (breeding) and the disabilities of rural residents are the first disturbing factors in the film. I still hear groaning in Bobby's pain, and in the thought I'll be shaking. Lewis leg has become me. However, when the film was totally upset and displeased, it faced some interesting questions. When is it morally right to take another person's life? In some cases, what can morality do to us or not? And life is more important than that and moral integrity? Whether it's drawn from the film, it's a great achievement in its own right (even though chilling is real and fiery).
