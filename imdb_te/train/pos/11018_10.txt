Michael Rooker is a surprising performer and John Lithgow play an amazing villain! The music is fantastic The theme is amazing! Image action packed and always dull! If you are in this movie is really neurological racking Cliffhorne image! If a Stallone fan looks at Cliffhanger then it will not be disappointing!
