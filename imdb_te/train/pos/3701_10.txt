The Dinner Party is probably in my opinion the greatest adult film production of all time. It is a delicate way of producing and acting performances in the role of their characters. The kitchen scene featuring Yvonne and Julie Ashton is amazing. Use of butter and milk really makes the scene. In addition, the doctor's office scene is well done. The campfire scene is filled with activity that is enjoyable while the selection of actors in this scene is questionable. Asian karera's performance in the junkyard scene is amazing, but expect nothing less from her. The ending scene is somewhat used in adult movies, but nothing classic. I would highly recommend this movie to fans of older movies and those casual viewers. Run to your video store and take it today.
