Although it is politically incorrect to be entertaining with drinking, Dudley Moore's lovable lush role can not help Arthur Bach get this wonderful and fantastic character. How ridiculous you are that funny laugh and giggling laughter and totally fainting. Although I'm not really a Liza Minnie fan, she's really amazing like Linda Merola and I can not paint anyone in that role. Sir John Gielgood was the heart of the film and was eligible for his Oscar. The rest of the cast are also excellent and great tune "Arthur's theme", WOW. It was really one of the best comedy films of the 1980s. Great films get better with each view and also "Arthur".
