<br /> <br /> The film "Ransfeek" is a sarcastic accusation of the "Konkkin" film, Blakecapity Films and negative black stereotypes, modern day, 1975). <br /> <br /> It must be a picture of a bird, controversial, breathtaking, and alone. Another random "shock-joke" of an image that tries to shock for the shock is not. It is Ralph Bakshi. <br /> If it is the source of the knowledge of who knows, he is big. <br /> When it's too small, "Koninskin" is just another campy knock-mein stream white film or any kind of throwaway flick. "Concanskin" wants to be more. <br /> <br /> In this movie, it is a very big fish and tries to lay the big fish. But it prevents blacks, but it actually seems to show love, beauty and heart. <br /> <br /> "Conconskin" tells the story of some of the criminals awaiting a prison break. <br /> <br /> "Concanskin" is also possible to get out of prison alone in the world. This makes the old style. <br /> <br /> One of the prisoners is a brother in the Harlem brother Brother Bear, brother Rabbit, Preacher Fox needs to be respected and a part of the action and would like to take it anyway as needed. <br /> <br /> The Ethiopian mob is implementing all realistic activities. <br /> <br /> Big black black musicians actor: Barry White and Scoutman Crotter, as well as the first black playwright Charles Gordon, who takes home Pulitzer. <br /> <br /> This image is of this part of the race division, the descent into this world. <br /> <br /> Baker's movies do not understand the word "subtility". It looks like it never heard of the word. But one thing that needs terrorism. Real sledgehammer satire. <br /> <br /> Some things can not be resolved gently. <br /> <br /> The godless bird is relentless. Here, the Harlem scene is a member or minority. <br /> <br /> The characters here are "animated" to "real", depending on the mood and circumstances. Animated characters and humans all share the same reality and are intent on taking literally. <br /> <br /> But Baki just shows just ugly characters for shock value. He always has something to say. Black-face is not free. Here, unlike in Spike Lee's "Bamboozled", he is trying to do something and really try to tell. <br /> <br /> Like 99.9% of all the pictures of Bakshi, this includes animation and live-action. Usually at the same time. Bucks are not just Jimmy. <br /> <br /> In this way, most of these films (included of Bakshi) are very timely and are very momentous. They reflect somewhat of the day, but after a few years they have a clear sense of nostalgia (as well as timeless truth). <br /> <br /> Music, clothes, accent, and city Clearly, one of the photos in the capsule, attitude, soul and heart is the F - King ear. <br /> <br /> Some of the black characters are also a bunny (JungleBelly), a big ol 'bear and a fox. One of the most sour and relentless racist roles was the Dirty Harlem police, who was hot on the trail of this "dirty n ----- s" after the death of shepherds. But for him, it's not just business. It is not for other brothers wearing shawls. <br /> <br /> The scene with Godfather and his women is one of the most moving pieces in the whole movie, most of them. <br /> <br /> <br /> Promo line: Warning: "This film creates danger for everyone!" This is not just a hype. <br /> <br /> You are warned by Dan Yousuf
