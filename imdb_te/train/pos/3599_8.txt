This film is a real gem. The arc of the plot is defined in the first 3 minutes, the characters are sympathetic and clearly drawn, their motives are completely reliable. The conversation is fresh, and oh real. Conditions are unique to the characters and are not all cliche or hacked. Until the climax, ie. If the image goes off a bit of rails it's a bit hokey and unbelievable. But do not be discouraging people from seeing this picture. It's really great for the first 3/4. There are some amazing performances here that I've given an 8. Watch this movie.
