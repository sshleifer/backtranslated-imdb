A magical journey made by Alexander Corda and Michael Powell. These two TITANS movie masterpieces of the British film have included some amazing material to produce! An amazing and shimmering Micklos Razzle musical score along with youthful development and gentle beauty and voice of Sabu, Conrad Weidat Theatrical and antipathy villain as some junior Duprez princess in the highly ravishing early technician all work wonderfully well. Miles Malleson Duprez who is in the role of father, Basara Sultan, also wrote the perfect screenplay which is huge enough. Do not miss this one! Since the above comments posted, I honestly got the DVD released recently and I am sure this DVD version is so accurate and clear that the colors are stunning and the colors I'm never stunned-this is so amazingly never seen the picture until the spectacular classic time again and the charm fails and never pleases the viewer. Again, see!
