Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) accused of killing his unfaithful wife. At night she was murdered, and she escaped with a secret secret that she refused to give her name. After being murdered, the police visited all the places along with her, but only remembering people alone. He loves him because he loves to die and his secretary (Ella Reyes) murderer loves himself. <br /> <br /> It is made from B Universal B film (See cast cast - all character actors and a star - francote tone - degeneration). The budget is short and the cast is largely unknown, but it is one of the best film noir in the 1940s. It is beautifully directed by Kurt Siadak and is a fantastic script from a wonderful book by William Irish (a pen name for Cornell Woolrich). It moves quickly and looks awesome. <br /> There is a infamous jam session with Raina and Elisha Cook Jr. It comes up with amazing sexual power (the sensors are surprised to cut it out). <br /> <br /> Fixing bugs. The tone gives a terrible appearance. He looks terrible and he is terrible. Curtis is also strong and blonde as Henderson. You're really surprised that Reyns loves him - he is ill. But Reynes is very good in the lead role. She is beautiful and full of life. Moreover, she did not ring at the last scene when she was a murderer. He is not physically afraid and her reactions appear to be overly exaggerated. <br /> <br /> This is what I did when I was 9. A great picture - errors.
