This silly movie is really fun for younger audiences. Its leaders are the pair of dead detectives, some of which are sophomoric attitudes that lead to very crazy roads. These detectives look at each length to deal with the murder of the big murder case. Nudity is not, but very sexual feeling, slap stick silliness ... everything go for adolescence. Low budget, but very entertaining. Probable Cultural Classic Probability.
