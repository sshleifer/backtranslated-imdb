War is like hell. <br /> <br /> The series is not just a comprehensive perspective on World War II, but is a clear and remarkable expression by the Caribbean masterpiece Laurence Olivier. /> <br /> This documentary defines the genre of series. It is very long, no doubt, but you will enjoy them all and want to come back for more. (I have a series on DVD and I see a series three times a year). <br /> <br /> Really, it's a bit of a sinless film of film production. Apart from Olivier, the best part of the series is listening to the veterans telling their stories; <br /> When I come to me, I want to go to myself. <br /> <br />)
