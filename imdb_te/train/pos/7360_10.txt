Wow! This is a good picture! This acting is not as good, but if you look at a few moments in the film, rewind and see again, this is genius! The person at the beginning of the film walks three against his suitcase. Wow! I never expected. He then puts the coke in the suitcase and flees. One of those who sold drugs after a smoker who was a smoker for the three people. And intellectual quotes: '' Good shades, I need a pair '' '' You need them .. you can take them .. '' .. just brilliant! And fighting is the best I've seen at a time. Look at the second person he takes down after he hit the head of the first man against the table. A hit! And in the middle of the picture, when a man in a car is shot at one point, then 3 guys will come, he is good at aiming. It costs money to hire these guys like him. The finish is spectacular, it is very exciting to walk up the stairs and jazz petters up to 5 minutes after the jumps to his distraction with Jamie Cahill. Jason Peters comes down, and he rolls back in time to die! I can not tell how great the film is!
