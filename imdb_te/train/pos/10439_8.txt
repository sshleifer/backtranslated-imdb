When I came across free ad screening in 1995, when I saw this theater, I thoroughly laughed and happy to see it. When I spoke to a lot of people and I was totally disappointed with it and I forgot how it ended. I, on the other hand, felt totally opposed. I was completely satisfied with the result and the rest. People I spoke to most people! Plus they felt happy they left wondering about the fate of the two characters because they were happy. I find it difficult to see whether these observations are absurd and how the majority of American filmmakers have a tendency to get stories that are easily driven by complicated and intelligent conversations with movies. They also want spoon-fed tidy finishes - happy or sad. It's disgusting to me. No one wants to challenge anymore ??? And for the conclusion (and I do not want to be a spoiler), because I know in my heart that these two letters totally see each other again in two things. It's all about your personal faith in romance and destiny. This is a very personal picture that does not talk to all the people. But it definitely talked to me. Give it a chance! Be patient with it! Richard Linkelter has crafted a very fascinating film with a beautiful story set on the beautiful background of Vienna City. As you can see, you feel like strolling through the streets along these lines. If you're tripping on the Urolail Pass on the Urolail Pass. It's very close. Plus, Ethan Hawk and Julie Delpie make a life-saving work that takes a complex script. They should be improved in some areas and it works well. There is a great chemistry in their roles. In the beginning of the strangers, you are really convinced that their dreams are very believable and you really feel that the love and relationship between them in the movie is going to start. I respect him for doing this film, assuming that I am a very personal work for Mr Linklater. It definitely touched me and I touched others. Bravo for love !!!
