Joshua Seftel's first film - the sarcasm of memorable ratios - as the title suggests: corporate corporations influence the war. <br /> <p> The film is a country traveling to Turkmenistan (John Cusack) Country, fyi) The American government will help the leaders of "across their message". He meets a reporter (Marisa Tomei) and we all know what will happen with a single man + a hot reporter. Yonica throws in a baby star named Babyyeah. In Turaquistan's most important figures (son of the president), Yonika is married and a subaplate is created where the hire is orbiting this star. The film starts with a lonely Cusack in a bar; Fifteen seconds later, the film hooks you. With this amusing and exciting insight into terrorism and politics, you will be spending the running time of the film. There are a lot more actions than expected in the film, with the occasional scene, well dancing and murders. Although the story is not too deep, it is simplistic, perfect for both the common man and film critics. <br /> <br /> In the final action of this film, all the turns of its simplicity are quite contradictory and jumbled. I thought it was very well executed, but others do not agree, and I understand why. Everything around the twist after the twist is all over, and like most movies, it's a real hit / miss situation. <br /> <br /> The three authors of the film (Mark Lennar, Jeremy Pixar & John Cusack) have created controversial and entertaining satirical scenes in today's situation. <br /> <br /> Joshua Seftel is an integral part of the film's excellent work; Do not reduce the high repetitive materials of the movies (I'm afraid). The film was definitely edited by the film: he created a powerful atmosphere, which both examine the tough reality and cartoony mistakes; - Definitely make them different - as well as feel like if you're watching the movie all. Seftel really takes part in all the action and pays off completely. There are no mistakes here. Hopefully, he takes more direct jobs because he is a director to see.
