My director's intuition could bring on the right thing to do in the right things. Young Mr. Lincoln is filled with some 'old-style' values, which is more polite than in the current movie, despite its two-dimensional filming in the retrospect. What works well, its simplicity and greatness, the real court play in the cover of the history lesson. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows that after Abraham Lincoln was the 16th president who we redeemed and was murdered by civil war. But in his predecessor advocate he was the most attractive, the most unexpected places funny, and the real gentleman. He is not a superhero who can do the wrong thing (only Fonda's apprehension in front of the signature), but his inner goodness and the person with possible disadvantages to overcome the clear vision of the right and wrong. <br /> <br /> It is enough to say that John Furt is as exceptional as a storyteller without trying. Actually, it's a lie, he will try, but he makes it effortless sort of in the studio system; He worked in an independent manner and at the same time enjoyed Janak, so he remained alone for his own short-term practice in "Compilation in the Camera" and did not move away from the story and mobilized around it. This force of traditional knowledge, somehow hand-made with material, goes to Washington as seen in Mr. Smith as a kind of compound piece for the full-blooded Americana in 1939 (here it is not law and politics). <br /> <br /> Fonda Ford is the first one to be in the forefront- and never made in the shoes and loses us past Lincoln past the extra boost. Fonda's own personality, in a sense, comes in the role of Lincoln, in the grape of Drupton and in my darling Clementine. It may not have been, at that time no one has ever played: he is mature and wise, but there is confusion to prove himself in this regard. Case. <br /> <br /> In the two small cases in Lincoln's memorials on the road and finally in large parade scenes, only in the small bits and pieces of the final shot, as they were finally visible. To meet the goals with Young Mr Lincoln, Ford and his staff and all of the cast met; It's not hokey as it feels like it's gone, and it has a strong balance of humor and real sorrows.
