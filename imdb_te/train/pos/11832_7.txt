Time for an elegance, EH: I thought it was a great movie to see the spirit. <br /> <br /> Point # 1: While Matt Damon was intensifying me, I gave him a rating of 6 or 7. When I heard the first role, I realized that 'mac damman'. The man was very wrong with me - his performance in "The Departed" was terrible and destroyed the movie for me (the film also had a chance to destroy, but it was another story), which is almost "Spirit". <br /> <br /> Point # 2: Brian Adams Success ... The whole score is terrible ... the songs are uneven, normal, and poorly executed; I did not find music that once was enough; And the lyrics are terrible. Every time I was one of the lame songs I stopped. I have some patriotic campaigns in the super-American free-style literature (I can not recollect the horrible patriotic songs that I have ever played on the radio after 9/11). In the context of the native American perspective of the film, they should use a small musical radio-hit, teen-bop, 14-year-old garbage using proper tools. I thought I was back in junior high school. I can not believe what I did not do - I refused. Not for this, I do not bother talking about what a movie or two (Disney, I know you're probably thinking;) I am interested in art and animation except here and there ... sometimes aspects of the face Very sharp and very thick or dark lines of the body (primarily ending with dense / dark lines). <br /> <br /> Well, I slept here before I understood it less than I understood it. <br /> Try a nice epic movie Nice ... It turned out to be moderate though Man, you suck!
