A community theater actor, it's very hard work but deals very seriously, and I am delighted by those who deal with great art. The smile on the film is a relentless "actor craft" with a very laughing smile. <br /> <br /> One hammer for the film is a match to the dictator. When the dictator died of a lot of drink and food from a heart attack, the actor was kidnapped and had to play the role of "life time" by the neo-Nazi head of the secret service. He hit it, the dictator's friend fell in love with him and the tables on his relatives changed pretty. <br /> <br /> Lots of great shock through the leads are good work, some of our unknown unknown actors, especially home staff and two members of the palace guard and fun little characters. Sammy Davis Jr. will bring herself to light, Jonathan Winters plays the role of a semi-retired American businessman, and Raoul Julia, Sonia Braga and Richard Dreyfus are exceptional. <br /> <br /> The dumb image, but it's not about playing a beautiful narrative (in Brazil), a funny story and good actors doing their job and being really fun and playing a normal surviving player!
