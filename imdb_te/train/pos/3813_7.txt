Initially, I thought there was something complicated to say about the Secret Sunshine religion (and here Christianity), and it's more than pests of blind faith, or hellie you. Surprisingly, this is not what and not much judgment, but in reality the audience allowed the audience to retain their own judgment and decision. Helped, she lost the role of Song Kong-Ho, who is desirous of the wife of Shin-A (wife of Zen Do-yen), and she goes to church when she does. For reasons to go to the church, to find internal peace, for help, to fear for eternal loss in Hell's flames, to confirm the faith, or to want to get married in a church, or a skunk chase (I'm not a child). But for every own reasons involved in prayer and fellowship for every Sunday church, it is really dangerous that underlying lights are not satisfied, or while in despair. <br /> <br /> Shin-A and her son June her deceased husband's birthplace Mirang Goes into town. . She wanted to start a new life and opened a piano shop to give the lessons, but she found another new tragedy, finding a new finding and a moment of good judgment. And it takes an hour to get it. Secret Sunshine really took time to arrive at this time, where things dealing with shin-and-now are much more interesting, now accepting religion and accepting her present status, the convenience of religion and fellow believers. <br /> <br /> Solve all humanity's problems The silence on the acceptance and belief that religion is provided by the silver bullet What started now? The Almighty is doing what you do for him, you are starting to make some selfish opinions, everything is your good way, and in the Shin-Ais case, her extreme attitude that she wants to forgive others against her mistakes can also reduce the feeling in both ways. <br /> <br /> In the end, many have said that most of us are able to recognize that, why do I, unfortunately, do not start questioning us as we are angry against our faith, there is no hard and fast answers available. Then we will come by the wayside or wander with destructive actions. <br /> <br /> However, somehow the plug is carefully seized in the Secret Sunshine and not the offender, and the mug of an ugly character is muted. <br /> <br /> If you hit the film, it is highly valuable to mention the fantastic character of Jiang Do-yuan, because you have only a little unlikely to face many crashes in the earth, the widely depicted Shin-A character, Most of them are she doing. While watching her transformation, worth the ticket price, and my personal favorite Korean actor Song Kong-ho movie, this is something he breezed right through.
