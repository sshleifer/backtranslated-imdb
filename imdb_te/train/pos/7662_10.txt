B movies go, it's better than average (although I'm trying to minimize such a trend, I warn the reader that the plot or other parts of the film will reveal some key elements). While the sequels typically go, it's pretty awesome, even though the "cookie cutter" approach to trying to copy some items from the original film verbatim. Despite this sometimes tedious perspective, it is the viewer in this particular movie. <br /> <br /> The film is a source of "Superman" The main character's description of his childhood and his parents (Found in similar lines as Kints in "Superman") and morally pure protagonist background, which has exceptional abilities from a young age. A background that reminds me of the exceptional or other non-real "genius", and (more superficial degree) "Doctor Mordid", corresponds to children, adolescents and / or adults and damaged a particular strong string. The film has a positive melodic e, and is fun to watch. I have attracted some insights and accuracy (in the description of some aspects of paranormal experiences), and also at times touching badly. These moments are occasionally in the great formula-based school and homosexual (with tastes of sexual content) and B movies (or Shakespeare dramas) <br /> It's for comic book, sci-fi, "remote view" enthusiasts and horror fans With the right exposure in the right circles, the film continues to follow along with "scanners".
