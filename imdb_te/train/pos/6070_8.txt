Yes, Shakespeare actually boasted. Lawrence Fishburn is not his best, certainly not bad. On the other hand Kenneth Brungh is good. His plan is amazing as he struggles with the audience. Very good work. <br /> <br /> A very low level of play has a lot to expect. <br /> <br /> For example, it was a bit too dark for Cassio's murder, and the spectator would turn his head off. <br /> <br /> Do you know about Michael Maloney? His madman Strucken Roderigo is exceptional; <br /> If you do not see Othello in front of you, see it. If you read the Othello, see this. If you do not hear from Othello, see this. On the other hand, when you read it, help you, it's played on stage and played.
