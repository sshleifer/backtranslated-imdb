The film is quite simple and clever. Cinematography is good, acting is amazing and the story is absolutely breathtaking. It was the story of white South African Donald Woods, who felt himself independent until he discovered the reality of apartheid. Kevin Klein is entirely convincing - when Donald Woods himself appears on TV a few years later, I recognize him from Klein's character. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington also turns out to be a wonderful act from time to time. It's too long, but it's worth your patience because it tells a wonderful story. Remember, folks, this really happened.
