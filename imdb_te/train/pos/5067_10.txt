Here, at IMDb.com, I always read the impression, Gray Awl is always the best part of Pierce Brosnan. <br /> <br /> Other things - the film director is in the hands of the impressive. I will give my honor. The beauty of the serenity, beauty and the spirit is really amazingly portrayed, and I had never met any film before. <br /> <br /> Another thing in my mind after the movie - it's cinema, original books, and atmosphere. <br /> <br /> And a little more. I will pay my honor to the original Gray Owl.
