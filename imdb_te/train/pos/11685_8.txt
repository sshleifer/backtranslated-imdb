Since you have found the film really funny, you're going to die in the youthful black comedian (Chris Rock), and in 50 years White House will be sent back to Earth in the body. He does not realize that he will change his behavior and continue to deal with having in front of him. He listens to rap music, singing, playing the stereotypical part of the town's black man. The true humor in this movie is watching the problem with blacks who are attracted to him.
