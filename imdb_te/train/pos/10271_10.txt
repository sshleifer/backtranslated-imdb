The film should not be compatible with "The Sting" or other Capper / Hest / Can game. What makes such a great movie experience, telling about relationships, deceit and trust. It is also a pruning critic of psychiatry, and the female protagonist finally gets deceived and works in the primitive manner in the final phase. Is there a unfortunate experience in Mr Mamet's treatment? Highly, highly recommended!
