The first animated feature film from Ireland was one of the best animated films I've ever seen. It's all true to its true pimples and all other Oscar nominees and any other movie from this year or any other year. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film Ireland built a wall around its wall to prevent the abolition of the Kells from destroying the town of Ireland. His nephew Brendan, a young saint, can do his best, but his uncle hurried to do his own time with a quick time. When a legendary bright Aidan comes from a destroyed monastery, Brendan leaned towards him and his warm personality. Eiden taught her Brendan to the light of his uncle's fury. In order to help Aidan work in his great book, saving from his destroyed monastery, Brendan goes into the forest to get the material to make ink. Outside the walls he meets Ashley, he develops a friendship. Suddenly Abbott finds he is hell to go outside the wall and pay. <br /> Forget what you know about this movie that you think is wrong. I explained that the film did not do justice. This is a simple story that's going to be more. It's a fabulous movie trying to find your way around the world to find the walls on the upcoming demons and the beauty of the world. <br /> <br /> The film will be a huge audience, including the life of all the rest of the movie. There are death and destruction and happiness and joy. It's not sugar coating. People will die. Hide monsters. (It is freaked out by some of the kids), but in the end there is hope. Obviously in this movie the darkness is completely unlike anything in the recent American film. Forget "sadness" in the picture of the pixel, this is the real thing, and it refreshes and shows how the pixor also shows the homogeneity. <br /> <br /> Its a Jenny Tartakovski-Esquire (Samurai Jack) animated film look originally based on Celtic art of the time. An image that looks like no other. The film will feature another movie feature film and it is possible in every way. Images are designed to fill as much space as possible. Often manipulated things to make it look like a page in the movie Kellers epic book. <br /> <br /> Director Tom Moor is a movie that has been produced by a masterpiece. I can not say more than that. This is a masterpiece. I've never implemented one of the best animated films ever.
