This is a tat pathetic masterpiece from the brilliant displays of Brian de Palmwyat all around! It's very curious, and often scary, and the score is excellent, plus all the characters are awesome. Psycho yes rips off too much, but it's a brilliant start-up and horror / thriller that's still a brilliant, with a shocking and unpredictable finish! This is undoubtedly one of the best horror / thrillers I have ever seen, and one of the most memorable sequences of the elevator scene, plus Michael Coin This is simply amazing! The ending is fantastic, and at the end of the hospital scene is absolutely terrifying, plus the end twist shocked hell out of me! It has never failed me to creep up, and the stalks are totally brilliant, plus Nancy Alan and Keith Gordon have excellent chemistry together! This is a tough suspense master from Brian D. Palma, with excellent performances all around! Directing is incredible! Brian de Palma makes an excellent job here, with Amazing Camera work, amazing angles, awesome use of colors, awesome zoom and zooming great POV shots here and keeping the image at very very fast! Blood is quite a bit. We get bloody stabbings, of knifing, bloody gun wounds, and 2 bloody wedge throats. The acting is amazing! Michael Caine is Amazing, he is amazing in the acting department, creepy, very fond of, mysterious, and really just did an amazing job with the amount I loved him! (Cain rules!). Angie Dickinson gives a memorable performance here, and is very beautiful, and has good chemistry with Cain. Nancy Allen Stankley Gorgeous !, And here is amazing, she is very much like hooker, featuring amazing chemistry with Keith Gordon, and put a stunning performance! Keith Gordon is very good like Kid, he has excellent chemistry with Nancy Allen, and very fond of! Dennis Franz is good as a detective. Overall, this is one of the best horror films ever made, and I told you what to do and what to do right away! ***** from 5
