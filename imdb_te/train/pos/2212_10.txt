E! The TV is so funny, a great channel and talk soup is in a flash you can see the transition of episodes. Stan Evans is the best author of the best writer by our writer ... The patron saint of anonymous people ... He is really talented, gifted writer, actor, comic, producer, director and creative adviser. Anna Nicole loves him, but he has a $$$ He was not a billionaire, so he left him for a billionaire. Several superstars wanted to make films with Stan Evans, who had "Humphrey Bogart" [Clarke Gabby} acting style. He should make many movies. Perhaps Stephen Spielberg, or possibly many other talented producers. We wish him a moment to fame a great moment. Which mock-u-dramas was he made? Or perhaps any documentrom ??? A project about Bernie Madoffah is a great TV movie written by STAN EVANS. How many screenshots did you write? He's under $$$$$$$$$$$$ the billion deal with Disney ?? He has to earn more than 50 million ... he can write a TV movie about the king at the end of pop .. Michael Jackson. We want to see a lot of people through Stan Evans in movies and TV. Thank you very much. Elvis left the building !!!!!
