<br /> <br /> <br /> My friend is Best Chatch & Chong, and I went out and went to take the Blave Brothers. NEXT MOVIE has no plot, no pacing, nothing to really define a picture ... but it is funny. <br /> <br /> Well, in this short paragraph I have been in the plot, but at the age of four in the film, a story that does not normally begin. <br /> <br /> Changing chew twice while drinking the people is no other silence? What about rooster? Is Pee Wee Herman's first film performance? You have to watch the movie to enjoy. I will not have enough balls to make the next film look great, but the movie is heart and hay, so I'll borrow it to my friend that it reaches 7.
