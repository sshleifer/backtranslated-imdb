I never read Shakespeare's Hamlet before I see, but I have a Shakespeare book with me and I can follow the conversation. My opinion on this image is partially biased because I have read before the play, but I was dragged into the comprehension of this film. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare is one of the best authors ever to live and Hamlet's story is certainly one of his best achievements. I recognize that all the actors in the film have a solid understanding of what they say, and that is why they are well understood. In Romeo and Juliet, there is nothing compared to Leonardo Kenneth Branagh and King. The thing I like about this is that it worked well as "MOVIE" and is not a game you're reading. You do not have to be rich with Shakespeare in order to be involved with all the wicked friends. <br /> My two cents.
