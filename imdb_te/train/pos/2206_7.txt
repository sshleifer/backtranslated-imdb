Do not trust negative reviews received by this movie. Yes, it is cheaply made. Yes, Gore is ridiculous. And, yes, acting sub-par. However, this is the textbook of the early Slaser Flick, and you enjoy it as your "thing" (its mine!). There are good things to do with the film than the reduction of defects. For one, then the unknown Christopher Young score is very creepy and the voices are definitely torture. The conclusion is that most films are welcomed from predictable upbeat endings. Finally, not the last, this film made me cinematic. The filmmakers were able to "dressing" collectively a better job to make them more reliable as a college dorm. However, if you do not mind this error, the setting is great. The four colleagues in a huge, abandoned, condemned building just waited to crumble ... This is possible. When looking, allow your imagination to do some work and enjoy the movie as you do.
