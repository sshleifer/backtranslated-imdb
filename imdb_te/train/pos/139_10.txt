First of all, Rigat is wonderful. Good comedy and mystery thriller at the same time. The good combination of good music and great actors is a good combination of the frenzied 'Dhoma' style. But unfortunately there is nothing there. It's acceptable for me. I'm thinking ... How can it be possible to continue the story without Helmer and Druise? ... and I have some idea. I think Lars Riget III should be slightly different. I'm sure the 3rd part without Helmer is not the same. Here's my suggestion. Maybe a little stupid, maybe not. I know Lars likes to experiment. So why not make a small experiment with Riget3? Here I am the only solution puppet-driven animation (such as "Team America" ​​by Tray Parker) or Computer 3D Animation. I know the true actors are not the same, but in principle it can be believed to work ... only in this way is likely to make the actors alive again. Igig fans should not be this big different difference - if the best way of animation is made in the average 'watermark' is just the general after the first few shots of the movie will look normal. The most important thing now is the story. Nowadays the actors can fully understand that the register 3 can not be created. Why not play with animation? And ... look for opportunities to give it to you! Also marketing one! The great director overtook his trio using puppet animation after 10 years. <br /> <br /> I would like to see RiggaT 3 on some day ... or even the script. <br /> <br /> I: "Do not speak about the kingdom. <br /> <br /> ps: I'm not talking about the kingdom" hospital "Stephen King ;-)
