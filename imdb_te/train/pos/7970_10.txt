This image is definitely my first 10 favorites list. Voices for animals are amazing. Sally Field and Michael J. Fox are fond of sassy feline and youngest experienced puja, but the old standout Dan Am√©e is an old, loyal Golden Retriever. The film is a great family film, because it is well appreciated and liked by children and adults. Humorous and curious, and every animal lover is guaranteed to be crying! (Happy tears!)
