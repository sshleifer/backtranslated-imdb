I'm looking for a cold case because I have real life experiences. This one is very close to me and touched me deeply, so beautifully handled, thanks, Merideth. All characters are well developed 3D, especially in the coop. This material is still difficult to reach, and America is far behind in developed countries. This kind of honest reality and treatment only affects people. Of course, everyone sees things the same way but I am glad that 3/4 men in the 30-odd under-under me have the same same vote 10. You'll keep them for this episode "Best Episode Reserve" forever - reaching them hard. Please take the opportunity and accept my heartfelt gratitude.
