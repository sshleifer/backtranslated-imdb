In theory, it should be boring but it's an incredible picture that I have ever delivered with subtlety and incredible acting that is frustrating. Instead of clich√©s dependence and excessive dramatic moments the project is exposed by a series of very realistic moments. The main characters are not perfect and are easily associated with the people you know. The film tries to laugh or does not make an impression on the audience, and shows us true love in any case. <br /> I'm waiting for the weekend so I can see the sequel. One moving, thought provoking, I think the funny look at love should be a perfect romantic classic there with Tiffany's Casablanca and breakfast there. It also makes the hardest heart soft.
