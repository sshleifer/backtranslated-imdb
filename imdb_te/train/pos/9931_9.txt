I did not even know that I was inspired by a realistic story, and I rented Domino in a whim, even if it was probably possible and true biopic. <br /> <br /> With Richard Kelly, he put together a large amount of plot and commentary in 2 hours of pure entertainment. Once you get it once and appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Domino is a bounty hunter who left perfect Hollywood life to pursue a model of amateur or perfect career. It has an experimental acid trip style provided by director Tony Scott. And with fast paced music and composition, it gives you a visual flame with slowness performances and unexpected comedy, the film is well made and enjoyable and a wider audience. <br /> <br /> I would like to think for about 2 hours at the same time and suggest to anyone who wants to be entertained.
