Footwear Parade is the best of the 1930s music comedy Extravaganza. Jimmy Cogn√©, the lovely Jon Blondel, Dick Powell, and Ruby Keeler, is a wonderful script and all the actors who cut over the rest of the songs. The creative intellectual directed by Busby Berkeley and the choreographer directed the film will be from the earliest to the ear from the ear. <br /> <br /> Busby, Hollywood music scholar "Gold Diggers of 1933" and "42rd Street" for his credit (as choreographer). The footwear parade is chorus girls wearing hundreds of lessons, decorated with a Berkeley trademark. Extensive dance numbers were filmed with a single camera and was the first director to film the scenes of Busby dancers. His obsession with his sudden legs and "back-view" shots was performed here. <br /> <br /> Our son Jimmy Cognney plays the role of Chester Kent, producer of "theaters" or small musical performances to entertain audiences before the audience. Shown. He has curly partners, corporate spy, and gold-diving girlfriend. Though Kagani had a great background in the Vaidyellay, he was the first to show his dance talent. Joan Blondel was remembered as Cognini's brilliant-ruptured, well-known secretary. <br /> <br /> The film's three best production numbers, "The Honeymoon Hotel", "The Waterfall" and "Shanghai Lill", each are a masterpiece and replaced by a creative photograph called "Special Effects" in today's Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Claudia Bottom Line: Clever and romantic, some of the best musical production numbers kept on celluloid. Completely enjoyable Depression era is easy.
