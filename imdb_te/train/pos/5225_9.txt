I think this movie is a very funny movie and one of the best 'National Lampoon's movies', which has a very impressive spoof title, which basically reveals what the whole movie is about ... Men White! The story is related to the sarcasm of many films, including a Will Smith film, as you might expect, 'Black in Men'. I do not give up the end but it ends in the most funny (Leslie Nielsen style comedy) from the end, especially if your bit Deepbins (Garbage Cons) is on the street at the beginning. Also, they have a beautiful cool dustbin lorry (Garbage Purchase Truck) in the scene. Acting is not spectacular, in fact, it's not very good, but that's what makes the movie funny, it's a funny, unfold up !! I like the story, it's somewhat overwhelming and partially because it's interesting (or it's un-subtle), because they break all other images. I'm really a big fan of serious confusing films, but I'm a fan of the real thing, and with these pictures, it's hard to decide which film is the Ripps off (before I mentioned this review) or it's the original movie, but when you're really surreal to comedy movies Make it really difficult, but this movie will be successfully turned off . Two rubbish men are so funny, it reminds me of a TV sketch show in the UK called 'Little Britain'. This film is mandatory for your collection and is the best, most entertaining, ridiculous, outstanding storyline of the National Lampoon!
