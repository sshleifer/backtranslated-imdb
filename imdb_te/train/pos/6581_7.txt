I'm looking for QoWadis in my local video store, and I have seen this 1985 version interesting. Wow! It's awesome! Most Ken Russell is a kind of film -wiriki, stylized, very artistic, and of course "different." Nero is presented as an absurd, unfulfilled emperor with a circus career, unlike a bad embodiment. Why was he surprised to see why the empire would be prominent in the earth? Claus Maria Bandoure has had a tremendous time with this role and it has acted out to be valuable. Yes, Nero hurts Christians with vengeance; One of the many who did that. One of his servants at one time is murmuring: "No one can understand that we can not save ourselves." He got that right.
