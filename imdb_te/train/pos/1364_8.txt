I remember Parker Posey in "World the Turns" before I became the Queen of Independent Movies. In this movie, Posey shows her ability as a top-level actress. The supporting cast of the film is Omar Townsend, a Lebanese immigrant named Moustafa, who works as a Falafel Salesman on the street. The supporting cast plays her godmother and has an amazing actress starring Judi, old-fashioned, dedicated and only family cousin as the menubar of Libertarian. Mary Pryce learns to grow up and mature. Her loss of a librarian clerk will tell her how much she will lose in her life. Friends surrounded the Lower East Side Village in New York City. The film is very good for an independent and I enjoyed Parker Posey and other characters in other films.
