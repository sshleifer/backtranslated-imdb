I thoroughly thrashed John Cassove's opening night. It is the first film I've ever seen, so it feels more mainstream, but he does not feel any more dependent on himself than in his previous films. This makes it very serious. <br /> <br /> In fact, Casabettes has played a major role in his career, and has expressed his career as a director in his career behind career. Here it is expressed before. Rowland's character, middle-aged theater actress Myrtle Gordon has not been able to play her role in the upcoming production, following her inspiration after inspiration, resulting in chaos on the stage, until she appears to the right. <br /> <br /> It is a film that fails to capture internal steering that travels during an emotional cleansing. Noble can not understand why Myrtle does so many things, and it is visible and destructive, yet it may be best for her. It may be a cleansing rather than a break. A withdrawal, a satin, a rebellion, which ends all meltdown. Cavessivet gives her the most realistic touch of her role, which, in the beginning, she argued that she had nothing to do with her role, although she was silent but emotionally fearful that the opposition was true. <br /> <br /> The last scene, the Myrtle shares with a character, is an image of one of the most interesting, hilarious, hard hitting, enlightening, and enjoyable moments I've ever seen.
