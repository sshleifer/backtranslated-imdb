The first time I saw this episode was like shock, it was the first time I really saw "24". Speed ​​is going on things things are wonderful, and it's incredibly surprising, thrilling, and even interesting, if you're reading a book it's almost like; It's hard to stop after you start. From the minute Richard Walsh said jack privately about the possibility of having a mole within the CTU, I mean sitting at 6:40 hours, that means 10 episodes! (Sounds funny and silly, but he's just kind of interested not to stop when he's interested) This series is kind of one of the best. And it has to build some of the different stories that are connected together. Recommend in every way!
