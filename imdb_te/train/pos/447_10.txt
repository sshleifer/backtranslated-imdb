This is one of the best films. This is one of my favorites. An image with good acting. The story is very sensitive and touching. <br /> The names of actresses and actors are not on the American star list. <br /> <br /> It is a pleasure to see a film about true love, love and friendship while they look at those in the kick box. <br /> If you do not like this film, you have no heart or feelings. Then look at a sporting image. There is no killing or horror here. See the movie. This is mandatory. TH
