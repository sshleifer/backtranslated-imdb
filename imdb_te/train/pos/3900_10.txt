This is right up the top of my list of the most crazy funny shows I've ever seen. I'm laughing very hard, I'm sure half my jokes will be lost. Izzard performs as an amazing bright comedian. He likes to keep far away from his fans. His timing is impeccable and routine merely functions as a piece of performance rather than impulsive rows. Thumbs up the way.
