When I learned that the film was originally titled Brian Cross, I wanted to see it. It took me weeks to realize that I had seen the original and loved it. So I have more reason to see. Well, I see. It's actually better than most sequels for TV movies. I'm going to do Brian's role (you can find out for yourself) and I do not like Brian's a lot of characters. But the film has cheesy and unpleasant and jerk to make Stanley Caldwell (Judd Nelson) shine again. In the end, I'm excited for Stanley and his happy ending. If you liked the original cabin by the lake or you like horror images without blood, I'd suggest you watch this.
