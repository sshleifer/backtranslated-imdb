I love this movie. It's one of those movies that you can see again and time and still engaging. Congrats !! I believe everyone involved in making the film and the script should be proud of themselves. It's very strange, you think you're looking at a real life band. I want to see more movies like this. I'm glad I did not choose the famous Hollywood stars in this movie, because it probably does not work. And while Billy Connolly knows very well, he really got into the role and no one else can imagine playing it. Again congratulations, I really deserve the Peter Sellers Comedy Award for this film Bill Nighy. And when you come to the final scene ... what can i say !!!!
