It's hard to finger on you. In fact it is a funny (comparable) poor girl who wants to marry a risk that has been denied by his family. Suppose a funny about a idle racket drunk that fell in love <br /> <br /> It's funny moments, romantic movements, and touches. Dudley Moore is funny and somehow makes her self-centered character so pleasant, Liza Min√©lie has an acceptable foil as he is a hilarious opposite opposite, but John Geelgood steals this performance as Arthur's awesome satire Butler. But with a soundtrack that was a lot of fun, and for about 3 months walked in our local navy.
