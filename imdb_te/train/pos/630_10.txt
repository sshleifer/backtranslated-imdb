I do not expect much from this film. A ticket was given for advanced screening. I lost the job. It's hot and I'm tired. I had to wait for a 40-minute film line that flows in the hall of the theater complex. <br /> <br /> Once in the theater, tired and depressed movie began. , I did not recognize any of the actors in the beginning, but the film flow is perfect. Initially I had a movie with the film, with every minute getting more excited. I should note that this film is a fantasy / fantastic classic. The cast is fantastic, the pace is perfect, and the conclusion is magic.
