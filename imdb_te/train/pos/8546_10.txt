This is one of the most ridiculous and best films ever made! I see only forty minutes and say that this is a good movie. And if the plot is funny and because of the pretty much every corner of this movie is having sex around. It's really funny and I do not see how someone does not like this movie. I really want to really see the rest of the movie. It's a minor illness scene (believe me, it's not very fun) but this is a great movie. I rate this movie for comedy 7/8, 10/10 for sexual content and 10/10 plots. If you're a fan of American Pie and you would like to see a very sexy movie to buy this movie, listen to it. <br /> <br
