<br /> <br /> Tom and Jerry is a classic cartoon with a flawless idea, and almost every little one is a gem. If you compare it to other classic Tom and Jerry shorts, it's definitely a little nuwe, you can not hate this cart. Certainly, this is the worst of the Tom and Jerry episodes, and I understand I can agree, but the fact is that all Tom and Jerry episodes are great, but some are better than others. Well, it's enough for "others". <br /> <br /> Here is the story of a cat cat. Tom listens to the old scary radio stream, and becomes easily frightened. Jerry examines how he feared and he is already trying to intimidate him. He creates a scary dilemma for Tom and Tom scares his comedy, and his life. Jerry then puts a sheet on a vacuum cleaner and controls it, so that vacuum is a ghost. Tom learns that Jerry did all of this and chased him. Tom then accidentally bruises the maid of the house. However, finally Jerry fears his reflection in a flour cup. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is a pleasant and entertaining time away from the best Tom and Jerry. I want this to have such cartoons. Tom and Jerry's famous slapstick and cheeks are as good as these little ones, but something seems to be missing in this case. It is considered much slower than Tom and Jerry shorts. Anyway, it's better not to live up to smaller Tom and Jerry cartoons, but it's still good. <br /> <br />
