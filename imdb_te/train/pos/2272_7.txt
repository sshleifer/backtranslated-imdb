Nick Nolte in the dark story of Kurt Vonnegate gave a magnificent performance. Howard W. Campbell, a double agent in the campaign during World War II, played the role of Nadel. After the war, he lives anonymously until he wants to digg his opponents. Like most of Vonneget's work, it is meditating on the absurdity of the war and the propaganda for their own goals. Nolte is wonderful - self-assured and confident as young Campbell, and broken and haunted as an old man to make an end to his old sins. (10 to 7)
