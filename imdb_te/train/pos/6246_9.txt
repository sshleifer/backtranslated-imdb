If this is not 100% accurate of your mental stability, it is not a wonderful idea to see the handstage, because it is seriously tested on how well you are against the film. I think Huntstage is an art film rather than an art film, so the majority of viewers can not reach the happiest side of having a "maturity" level. Tarkovsky is kind of like movies, but in a different way. I can not tell myself, I'm very fun watching. But it's an unusual and very interesting experience for those who are victims of Hollywood's offer. Hundestage draws a finger in your mind and scratches all the grooves on your mind. You can not sit back and watch, you are looking at the spectacular eyes or the wide eyes throughout the movie. Nachtstasselten, a style similar to the style, but this is very good, and the path is less violent. For example, not for children or mentally tender or evil-minded people. Many viewers have given this film as 10 or 1. In another film I'm giving it a 9, because I see a multiple-story-in-one-phenomenon phenomenon. But this is an extraordinary part of its own. Get the look worth it, but get ready to see something disturbing.
