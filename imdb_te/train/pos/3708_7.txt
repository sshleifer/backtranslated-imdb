In an appendix of a Grisham novel, he attends a femme fatale when a lawyer is taken into a deadly game of cat and mouse. Altman creates a breathtaking, gothic atmosphere, but the script is weak. A southern draw, Braag convinced the lawyer, and David is impressed by his wish. Downey likes a private detective. Duvall has a small role, which does not allow much to do with his unnatural role. Hanna and Berenger made impressive performances. After an interesting setup, the film will be smoothed and will not really deliver on its initial promise, but Altman is always valuable.
