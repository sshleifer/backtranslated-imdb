Storytelling items for "eighth day" appear as the image of the spark, mystery, and symbolism that still has jazz von Dormal's first ever film. Although it's not as good as the "full hero" ever in my favorite list, the film still loses lots of emotion. Daniel Auil, fearing fearing to reduce his role since 2001, "The Closet" is fearful (if the actor is overly dramatic if the character can easily be destroyed). <br /> <br /> In this film, I felt that a character needed more realism. You came from "Hero Toto" because you are disappointed. However, this film is not yet wrong, it's good in the movie
