The 1971 film was never seen and was well received by Walt Disney Studios and the great production of the great animation creations. Angela Lansbury, (Eglantine Price), a woman who took a course on the witch craft, and played an apprentice role that began to travel on a wand and took up a lot of trouble. Eglantine has discovered many drops and can be broken down to different parts of the world. However, Eglantine had failed to become a master witch for his final tests. Mr. Emerilyus Brown, (David Tomlinson) is a soldier who sells this course in magic and attempts to help her find her solution. Eglantine has a purpose for her madness and to stop Nazi from avoiding England. Great family entertainment and most of us today need movies.
