Frankie Dio (Lee Wancliffe) is a high-level train that has turned herself into a police or illegal jubilee (due to her obscure looks). Tony (Bianco in Toni) is a low-level thug, who spends his pool time on the pool hall and frequently on Frankie. By being in the right place at the right time, Tony was arrested with Frankie and was sent to jail ... they would form a bond that would not be too friendly, but it will do for now. <br /> <p> I got this film called "Frank and Tony", which was a disappointing one because I thought an alternative name was "Frank and Crazy Tony", which helped to sell the film more efficiently. I think it was a tribute to "Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry" but what do I know? I've seen it for another time after another Italian crime scene, "Violent Professionals", and I compare both with each other correctly. <br /> The Italians are always behind their budgets and productive values. The real shame with this movie. It is considered a "grindhouse" film, which inappropriately displays a B-movie (or worse). With cleaner sound and pictures, it might be a Hollywood hit, I suspect. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] <br /> <br /> If you like mafia movies or crime, you should try these pictures. In fact, you can ask about the mob from Italy (how much more standard you should)? Certainly, this is not "The Godfather", but it should not be. It's not a play, it's a light comedy, a huge action buddy like "Die Hard With A Vengeance" from the focus of bad comedy. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, the film made me check the other images of the director and the conductor's cast. "Escape from New York" (featuring Vancoulef "Hook") and images of common culture films. What's more fun than learning the lost classic?
