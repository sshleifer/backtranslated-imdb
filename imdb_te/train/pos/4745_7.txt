I can not understand why they decided to release this movie with the introduction of Dynamo American audience called Jet Lee. Legend's fist was a better option. Nevertheless, the black mask is not terrible, but it's definitely not great. The final fighting line led to the coordination of The Matrix by Unin Woo Ping. But the English release is suffering from tough editing and dubbing. (I would like to release these films without cutting the Hollywood studios with subtitles.) Jet Lee shows the character in the lead role in his role and Francois Yip 701 has a small but small role. <br /> The mask has a strange style, it has some interest, but it is overloaded by gun battles and explosions. Li's amazing physical skills are in a more focused order. Black Mask is a good movie but do yourself a favor and pick up the legend's fist if you really want to see the tremendous picture of Li's skills.
