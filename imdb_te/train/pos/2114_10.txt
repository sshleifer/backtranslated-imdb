In a leather goods store, two struggling shopkeepers become a secretive sweetheart according to box-number nickname. With this simple idea and everyday setting, Lubitz has created a great deal of fun, intellect, drama, satire and satire. Stewart and the Sullivans are realized in the real emotions and tensions, and the other well-developed characters have their own sub-plot and jokes. 39/40 (Distri, Philadelphia Story, Mr. Smith) This is quite simple, even though Stewart's abstracts are hidden by the big images and we enjoyed a full range of satellites not seen in other movies.
