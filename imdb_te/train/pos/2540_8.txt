Some of their other collaborations (such as Black Cat and Body Snatch) are very popular, although casting decisions are a bit odd, this is a small little horror movie. Boris Carlof Dr. Janus Ruck plays the role of the weird scientist who lives in the Carpathian Mountains - where Dracula's own town. BÃ©la Lugosi plays the role of Dr. Benet - although the name is always French, whose nationality is not discussed. I really think it would have been a sense of having two switch roles, seems to have cast for the Carpathian character Lugosi - especially with his accent. However, despite this extraordinary twist, both of them still have excellent jobs. Carlofz is definitely the main character, but Lugosi himself is the most common man - he did not play too often in the movies! Other scientists (particularly Bennett) have considered his theories to be bizarre and inept. However, during the film, Rukh comes to the right and Benet is particularly generous in his new praise for the blood. But, unfortunately, the rugged new element discovered by Rukh is a crazy killing machine (do not you hate it? Though it's just a good nice scientist mad story, the plot is well laid out, the characters are well developed and Madhur Ruck is not a dimensional killer, but complex and interesting <br /> <br /> Hate old horror images With the exception of the people who made the film. If you have removed all the stops and lagosi and Karloff Universal Pictures shortcuts instead of the cheapest in both big-budget movie that you really are, unfortunately, instead of gravitationally. Good stuff.
