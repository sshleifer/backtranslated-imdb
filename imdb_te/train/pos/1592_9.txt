'I like about you' is definitely a show I could not wait to see every day. Amanda Bains is such a wonderful actress and I grew up watching her performance: 'The Amanda Show.' She's very funny guy and down to earth. "Holi" is capable of such a like person and has an "out-of-existence" personality. I always enjoyed how things around and seemed to turn upside down, so she messed her up at times. <br /> <br /> When the character 'Vince' came, I especially liked this show. Nick Jano is very hot and funny, as well as 'Gary', Wesley Jonathan. The whole cast was great, each character had their own personality and charm. Jenny Garth, Allison Mun, and Leslie Grossman are very interesting. I especially liked 'Lauren'; She is the best! She helped to make her appearance more funny and did not know what she would do or say later! The whole show was really good but I did not give any new episodes because the episodes were longer and more deep.
