Astaire / Rogers is definitely one of the lowest of the musicals. It is very poorly plot and speed. For example, it only runs for a few minutes than swing time, but it's a longer hex. This is due to secondary Romance between Randolph Scott and Harriet Hilard. Scott is rarely interesting. I like the hill. She is sweet, and I love at least one of her songs, "But you're u?" ("Behind Your Behind My Satan", her other number, remains weak from Top Hat, thankfully cut that masterpiece). Although Fleet is not actually a bad movie, it is not for at least three amazing dance scenes between Asterhare and Rogers. Vies to the top of their numbers in the dance competition. Dance is just wonderful. "I am putting all my eggs in a basket" and they provide both a dance two instruments that are not quite finished yet. Its flaws make it more precise. And "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is one of Irving Berlin's best songs. So this film is good for its great moments.
