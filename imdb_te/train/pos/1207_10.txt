This was the first time I saw it after 17 years or so, and in fact I realized that I would lose my copy and felt very disappointed. Although this is actually an association (I do not recognize as a child and do not care), this is how cartoons are. Interesting and light enough to enjoy everybody. I'm glad that my parents raised me on this kind of thing, and I saw cartoons that our kids did not teach anything. The music is great, and it never stays on your head ... I've downloaded the entire soundtrack at one point or another.
