When I first saw this series, I reached thirteen and I would see it again on the DVD, thirty years later. Images on early credits have never left me. It has influenced the world and public opinion. My parents were with me until I saw this series with me and we always discussed the program. <br /> <br /> Sir Lawrence Oliver's voice and delivery is timeless and accurate. In World War II, it is the concept of people who believe that it is their version. I can not imagine watching. <br /> <br /> A similar cold war series can now be considered, although Sir Lawrence can replace the position. <br /> Buy it!
