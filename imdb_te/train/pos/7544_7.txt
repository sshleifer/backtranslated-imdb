Japanese animators have an exclusive freedom with animation, which ultimately ends on the animated-fans' hard-drives and college student floors, but is completely overlooked by the source outside of its country. The pot soup is one of the films that are supposed to be experiencing or analyzing drugs from Western eyes. <br /> <br /> It makes it easier for parties who are not interested in things like sub titles. The cat and his half-dead (brain-dead?) Sister travel through many landscapes and associations. A simple plot or lack of water (perhaps because the cat is initially sinking probably because of the title?). There is an interesting sort of Genesis. There is a pig to eat himself. The elephant of the water. And it's gorgeous, compelling, exciting, and fun - you can not look around the druggies that do not experience a distinct feel without comparing to the acid tour. Eventually, the film turned itself up, adding another full-scale self-image level to the inquiries. <br /> - PolarisDiB
