I loved Peter Sellers too. I played the role of high-profile britain until this film. He pulls off pretty well, although he does look bits of inspector clouseau in the mix. <br /> <br /> It's not interesting for Goldie Han. Her time is great and her expressions are valuable. She substituted her Sellers Lecheras role, and it is pretty appealing to him. <br /> <br /> The last thirty minutes of the movie will come flat. It is worth to let down just sixty and just let down. Haane is initially nude to some amazing seconds. Enjoy it ...
