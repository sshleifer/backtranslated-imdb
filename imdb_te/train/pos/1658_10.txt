If you see this movie, you've come to Puerto Rico. I lived throughout my life in Puerto Rico, and we have to admit that we (PR) is currently living in real confusion, almost every day for shooting and killing drugs. These individuals, anyone and anywhere, will be burned and lost many innocent lives. We do not feel safe anymore, additionally, our so-called "justice" is not by money and influence, not by truth and grace. "Ladrans y Mentrosos" is based on genuine and unpleasant facts and really portrays the three major problems of Puerto Rico: drug trafficking, money and energy, deception of our courts, and innocent people and children are also damaging and dying for this. Ricardo and his wife Polly, with their real life life and their award winning direction (**), it's all daring to show it as bad: Puerto Rico is a beautiful and friendly country, not the end! * Recently they won the "Copper Wing Award" for Best Director at the World Cinema Competition at the Phoenix Film Festival.
