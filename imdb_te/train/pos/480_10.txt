The primary feature of this film is that many people missed Luzin's life as a chess player. Many people have seen this movie and can not get it, and I do not understand why. I took this picture to make it private. <br /> <br /> I will talk about things happening in this film. **** Spoilers **** Forever! <br /> <br /> His life to "big tactics" and "small tactics". He chooses Natalia as his queen, and he and her aunt first mention King and Queen and their behavior when she introduced him to chess as a boy. <br /> <br /> When someone asked me a question, he had gone past the past to review the previous moves. (Flashbases are beautifully lit). Flashbacks are very interesting because they are a child as well as a view of the other character, not just his opinion. <br /> <br /> Various characters have become his assistants or his enemies, pawns, bishops and knights, and their actions shine towards you on the side. Their position is also crucial in a scene to understand what's going on. <br /> <br /> I do not comment on what happened to Luhin 's role, but I hope it will eventually come to light what actually happens. <br /> <br /> Why do I agree with this? <br /> If you want this film, I would recommend a film called Fresh. <br /> <br /> The same way as these films, chess and characters are considered to be pieces. <br /> <br />
