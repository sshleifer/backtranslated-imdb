Well "Wayne's World" has gone and since then snl have been hard for movies to shoot off. For a recent 80 minutes, "Ratsbury's A Night", many from the film such as "It's Pot", no doubt, lost belief that any other snick skirt could ever win the silver screen. Do not panic because Tim Meadows comes through spades. The well-written storyline conducts audience interest to the end, and although it is true of the Leon Phelps character introduced in a five-minute sketch, the storyline allows the character to develop. Humor (having sex jokes too) is fresh and interesting and I've made it harder than ever in any picture in memory. You do not seem to take yourself too seriously. Tilbani-Amber Theisen's "Preserved Bible" reputation, looks and looks fantastic in the film. Finally Billy Dee Williams and his Colt will give a touch of class, embracing 45 days. And for those out there who have been vacuum film cutters like me, you will find this film wonderfully quotable, "Oh, it's a woman!"
