Several references to the film have been subtly made to blade runner, but the Cain 607 and his unit are all genetic structures, the maximum warriors, which is most obvious. But mine's favorite quote from the movie, "You must have made them smart and fast". Kurt Russell has done an excellent job, lacking in his facial expressions or movies, mixed the rest of the story with the story. He does not know how to deal with these emotions, even though he has fallen in love with Sandra, and after his boycott from his tears, or when he hugs himself or his attachment to many ways, he can remember himself Todd, even though he was not a soldier to his choice.
