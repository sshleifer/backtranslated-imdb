The main reason for watching this film is the Clara bow beauty and the superb attraction. "Hula" is not equal to Clara's finest images, but it is still enjoyable. She drives her horse, her horse and chases the girl she loves. The film is just over an hour and is directed by the winner of the Oscar winning winner .Flash quickly moves and Clara Bow has a screen time. If you want Clara, I'll get back "Hula".
