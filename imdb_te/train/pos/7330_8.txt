The film is based on the art of the mythical fantasy artist Frank Franketta. Some characters have come out of his paintings (Death Dealer is the best example). Surprisingly, the animation maintains the concept of the original art. The heavy use of bakery rotoscope (the technique of searching the live action scene) and the film is no exception. <br /> <br /> The subject of this film is very realistic (all characters are human beings), which makes it work pretty well. <br /> But I really liked the plot here: and nice action scenes, really bizarre villain and a beautiful babe. This film is the concept of the best Cannon comics, Roy Thomas is not surprising from the writer of our favorite Simmons Marvel series! <br /> <br /> All of this genre is not talking about B-movies, it is far from the crappy live action canon. <br /> Absolutely recommended!
