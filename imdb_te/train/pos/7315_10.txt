The classic, highly influential low-budget thriller and two directors gave birth to the horror icon and started Carpenter and Star Curtis. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Halloween is a movie that has never failed to live up to his reputation as a horror masterpiece. The carpenter's frightening story and intellectual direction give the film a very good life, which should really be considered! The direction often includes such simple items, shadows, dark streets, doors that connect the day-to-day arrangement of a small urban neighbor. Carpenter will always manage a horror filmmakers in itself, in order to make his suspense well and his jolting shocks surprised them most effectively! Plus, he is clever enough to give us some very scary villain to keep all of us stronger young characters and tension all the more strong. There are also the most spectacular scoring for the carpenter's general, yet scary music. In a sense, Halloween is a perfect example of a perfect horror movie! <br /> The cast is awesome. Young Jamie Lee Curtis is a very good turn as Lovely Daddy Larry Stroed, so good that she should have a number of other horror movies before retiring to big movies. The great Donald Pleasures played the perfectly depressed Myers doctor to capture the unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Like its own villain, Halloween is an unstoppable force that does not fail thrill and coolness. This is mandatory for all art fans! <br /> <br />
