I'm some of the purists there, and they are not the original, but spin-offs can sometimes stand in their own merits. I would like to be a new iron chef because it fits the Japanese version, but at the same time provides an American inspiration. I love Alter Brown as a narrator because he explains with Flair. Iron chefs are very interesting. I know that I am probably the best chef on the planet, but Bobby Faul is the only American iron chef who defeated them. Mario Batali is very fun while cooking, and elegant when creating and creating comments. I saw that series and I would work well with all the players. But judges are not always the best. There are some exceptions, though the lawyer has become a foodgrain, and most judges are questionable in organizing the services they have served. I enjoy watching Chef Hustle and the Challengers are shocking. At the end the diet is always amazing and sometimes it inspires me in the kitchen. Maybe everyone can ask, what really want to eat what to eat. The only thing I really want to change about the series is to ask them on a slightly lightweight presentation. Sometimes the mood becomes quite a bit, and you're never going to be entertaining as you're looking forward to being more fun. I liked the version with William Shutner (Iron Chef USA) because it was actually there, but I could say a pretty expensive proposal. He is with this version and is host - Bill Shuttner and Alton Brown, laughing for an hour. You can find it as an enjoyable day as long as you do not expect the original Japanese version and accept the sequence with its own merits.
