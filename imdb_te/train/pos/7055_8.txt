Although I did not have a clear selection for the sequel, I loved Jack and Gus, so I did not hesitate. Writing a book for Cinderella is one of the motive in the format of inspiration. I'm happy to write stories and I hope the children will encourage it. These three stories are beautiful and fun, though the songs are unforgettable. Jaq and Gus I enjoyed seeing my favorite characters but Lucifer, Bruno, Mice Chorus and all the rest. The Pom Pome proved to be the perfect companion for Lucifer and I liked Goverson. The sequel to the right for a change. My rating is 8/10.
