Akshay Khanna has proven himself as an actor. He was very natural in expressing emotions.

I saw this movie just 3 hours ago (the second in Dubai on the day) and the movie "pin drop silence" was over and the other guy came out of the theater (you can not imagine that Indians do not push?) There is a sacred silence ...
