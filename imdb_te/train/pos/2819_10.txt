This movie is a burroon! And I loved it! "Dragon Lord" (Jackie Chan) and his friend, "Cowboy", meaning the film is fun, meaning, and was just plain craze. The film is a good vs. A bad mixture of bad fighting and (something) wonders and fun growing up. Long Shao any young man, "the Dragon Lord" of the daily activities, he takes the viewer (the name of his wealthy family's son) and "cowboy", in the study, to escape from the brilliant, a wide range of ways for the student, "soccer" in the participation (what I am saying, you will see ) And since the list continues, the little kid (and Idiot looked interesting) way to compete. /> <br /> And many of the people who transport valuable antiques <br order to save lives, they will find themselves in a fight. But they are not discouraged, but they inspire. The boy's game has not lost in the exchange, but actually works against the evil. I loved so much about this film and it ends. Typical confrontation (it's awesome), but well, you'll see. <br /> <br /> The soul of this film has really captured me. <br /> <br /> Foolish, witty, meaningful, and nostalgic. Great image.
