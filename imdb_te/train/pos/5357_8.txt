This comic book style movie is funny, it's a very visible action and a great future style for it. Commando's writer Steven de Souza signed a contract and sends plenty of lines of Arnie to "send me a copy" after the lawyers cut a knife; "What the pain in the neck," subzero after hedgehog; He split after "distorting his body between his legs" and eventually, when Kilny was slamming through a billboard with his own face, Arnie concluded, "Now that place is damaged." Funnily enough, the whole recall of some similarities, featuring another sci-fi movie featuring Schwarzenegger.
