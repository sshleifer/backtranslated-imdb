Let's short story short. I loved every minute. A luxurious fantasy in the real Arabian-Nights style. An evil wizard, a beautiful princess, a zend and everybody happy and happy afterwards. Modern Holroy definitely has one or two things to learn from this modern. The only quibble: Special effects are pretty dating (though, beloved with the foot of Jin!)
