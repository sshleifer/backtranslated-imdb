It is good to be a better fight victim than taekwondo, because a taekwondo guy can not be defeated in the sport, as for life and school, the film is the film. Martial arts in the film are not good, but it is majestic and enjoyable. Friends who are going to achieve what they are confused by the mind and heart. <br /> <br /> The slapstick in this movie is not very tight, but it has a message. <br /> <br /> Do you have a good movie from Korea?
