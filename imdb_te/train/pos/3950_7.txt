Finally an unofficial disc from an old VHS was to watch this classic TV movie, a classic piece of horror. DVD and VHS ... The horror of TV horror film official releases is more of a pity in this neglect corner. Recommended for all fans of the 70s movie Terror, as shown in Terror. Interested in this book is David Deal - TelevisionFright Films of the 70's. Email me for an opportunity to see it ... its amazing to see again. <br /> <br /> It seems like many TV movies have problems like 70 minutes, maybe we'll probably be all modern editing but still great stuff and may be used better than many theater poses released today.
