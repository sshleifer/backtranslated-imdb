A few years ago I bought the MGM Double Feature DVD (and enjoyed) of two Kolchak TV films, The Night Staller (1971) and The Night Storm (1972). When the next TV series of the Universal set came, I wanted to buy it immediately - but the rackets of playback issues with DVD-18s kept me from adding to my collection; Recently, I have an on-line order in Universal Box Sets, and I decided to pick up KOLCHAK 3-Discer. Now I can not say it is safe: I am sorry to earn a bit of this beloved (small) crime / horror sequence: it can follow the standard formula - Carl Collk, who is a great performer by Dog McGavin, gets his hair with everyone's attitude Oakland, long-time colleagues, classed individuals, monsters and villains <br /> <br /> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> "Budgets have special effects on al and make-up effects (sometimes, ultimately entries and in the final installment of the goffy alligator) - these are 50-minute programming And is intended for the purpose of family use excludes both the simplest and the perfect two of its often witty mental and metaphysical themes (in the case of wolves, he never saw anyone biting someone, but some lunatic just turned people around)! <br /> <br /> The cynical narrative of the hero makes a great deal of pulling into a fabulous fables, a healthy dose of comedy relief in every episode (often, but not exclusively, revolving around McGavin's relationship with Oakland or replayer Jack Grignage). For reasonable weather (for the most part, Chicago, and suspense) nothing to say. To make the ride more enjoyable, Gil Melley and Jerry Fielding have a flying run. <br /> For the record, in this series encountered monsters by Kolchak (but not always defeat): Jack the Ripper, various types of cultures (Voodoo, Native American, Aztec), aliens, vampire, wolf (this special episode Fully gained by putting in the cruise-liner!), Dopplingger, satanist, swamp (motion police captain, Hans Carride and Robert Dehner as Robert Perhaps the best supporting cast episode), armor of a shield, Emhardt), Helen of Troy (!) And Crocodile. Some of the actors (unlike Kolhak's colleagues) are the heroes of Kenyan Vine and Ramon Beary (both bosses as officers), John Fightler (an active Morgan assistant) and Richard Keill, both of whom are different characters. While I'm compelled to choose the best (or most entertaining) episodes, I'm heading towards Horor (Phil Silvers and Abraham Sophore) and the previously mentioned The Canitie Murders - I, the weaker <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are no additional tunes in this set : It's WeWolf (due to the reasons I have already explained) and CHOPPER (Robert Gemekis and Baba Gale! It would be nice to see a feature discussing many concepts in KOLCHAK: Night Staller, as well as the TV series during the original broadcast of the series, or even the permanent impact it holds in the sci-fi series. In pursuit - back in 2005 restoration Magnanimous; this version is available at my local DVD rental outlet ... but, for various reasons, I'm not sure I want to check it out after the 1974-5 classic!
