I watched the low expectations last night. Causes, I usually do not like movies "made for TV" and rarely I liked the "cast reunion" movies. But in the Los Angeles Times, it seems like a critic. I'm happy. It's great. Add them back to Adam West and Burt Ward. But, in a way, they played their "Batman and Robin" men. They are camping and can not take themselves, or the film is very intense. The film is looking for "George Barrise" design Batmobile, which stole someone before auction of the orphanage. However, they are looking for a car and they remember the series they did together. It's said in flashback. This is well done. For the young burt ward and Adam West they were killed by actors. And, for a TV movie, it came down on the screen and nitty-gritty about their true behavior. I give this a 9/10, I liked it so much.
