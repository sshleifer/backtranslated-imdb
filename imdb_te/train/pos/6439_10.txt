I went to see this movie twice a week and in one word (I normally can not use it) can be edited together: amazing! In my view, the best film ever made. If the Oscars and other awards are deserved, the Swedish team, who created the perfection of the film in the final story, was drawn together (and abandoned) throughout the narrative? As the character of the Daniel Diaries increases feelings of moods and people around him, the film does the same for its audiences: You go out with your heart and your heart will feel completely. Great thing! The next time, you asked, "What is the meaning of life?" Think of how you would feel after a typical experience in heaven: happy, content, fulfilled. With Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway say: "Such moments are enough".
