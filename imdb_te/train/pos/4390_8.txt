Filmmakers blamed North and JihƒÅcker for trying to set up audiences with the audience 'Jake Rodell (Tobey Maguire). The Union did not elect the Union from Missouri and the Army Army was not the force of the invasion. Fought for the southern state rights: the right to own slaves, the curious legislatures and the judiciary and the political risk system. There is nothing in that noble. The Missouriites easily traveled to the east and joined the Confederate Army. <br /> I feel that there is nothing wrong with the story. When Jake bushwalkers are abandoned, he is not for the wrongdoing in his way, he does not necessarily have a cause for eradication.
