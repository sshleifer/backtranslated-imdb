Actually, Goldie Han from Washington (Tacoma Park, Maryland), but I'm DISE. This kind of Mr. Smith goes to a Washington type movie, with some variations but on the same premise. I have a huge love for Goldie Han because I have cable cable tape earlier this year. The story is interesting, but because some cocktail waitress saved some big shots, it would have an important job in government. It laughs at me and at the same time made me mad. It laughs at me because she's so ridiculous in her findings, I got laugh. (Possibly with a possible spoiler). I have the feeling that our government will set up an average citizen in her manner. And the speech she made at the end ... beautiful. Many bad people are not hard in real life.
