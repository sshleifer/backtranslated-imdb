I saw the presentation 10 years ago and I loved it !!! Now I'm in the possession of the DVD and I'm looking at that series, and I'm waiting at the show (when Lucas faced Gail at his home) and it did not appear - suddenly I saw it without a transit. Then I went across all the BIOS check line of the Stars and came across comments about the shows out of order. Thank you !!!!! But there is some conflict. Some commentaries "are like the Strongler number 19 after the triangle 20, while the other has somebody else and the Potato Boy 5 and Dead to the World 6 are also overturned.
