I have seen this movie on many occasions. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are not in a hurry, Many Japanese men and women go to the film because it is a very honest-good-looking samurai film with a cut and medieval Japanese dialogue. <br /> <br /> When two heroes talk about horror movies, randomly insertions throughout their sentences, old people go out, usually bored. <br /> Type 2: Film Esobes. Because the film contains the label of "Independent", it is thought to automatically load hard-to-follow, omission, worse, or not in English. But if they see what they have to praise about it, people think of intellectuals and cultures. They were really surprised when they saw this film. Anime-inspired knife begins with exaggeration from the wars, or over-the-top villain hits a dog with his crossbow during a phone conversation, these people will be very worried and come out. <br /> <br /> Let us see how terrible the film is for their friends. <br /> <br /> Type 3: People who live-in OR MATRIX-special effects. Sorry, the martial arts are beautiful in this movie, but director Yamasato does not really have that kind of budget. <br /> Type 4: Without hopes of people. This movie is really enjoyable people. Samaroy only heard about blood, when it randomly selected, or Deccan into a false theater in alcoholic lambs, all of these jokes smiled and finally congratulated the film: Entrementum. The film did not inspire enlightenment or deep spiritual thinking (which really "should have left some donkeys" if "take the line of dialogue from the movie"). <br /> You can enjoy or dislike this movie depending on what kind of person you are. However, if anyone can congratulate the film and enjoy blood and acting, watch the movie and make sure you bring your friends.
