This is amazing. Touching, action-packed, and perfect for Kurt Russell. I liked this movie, it deserves more than 5.3 or stars. This film finds life more than soldiering is the story of an obsolete soldier, and the need to protect people to learn, there is time for fighting. I cried, laughed and mostly sat in the awe of this story. Good writing job for an action movie, and the plot is appropriate and very solid. The end is not a twist, but it is still amazing. If you like to escape from New York or root out for the underdog, this image is for you. Gore or violence is not an unnecessary amount, it is not difficult to look at that. Something for everyone.
