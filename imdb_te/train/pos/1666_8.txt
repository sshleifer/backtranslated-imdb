It was a 17th-century Italian artist and an artist in particular an artist, a woman Artemia, who at that time did not listen to her career and killed her to portray her nude images that describe her particular muscles. Camera work is mainly at home, and artists work mainly. There are some great shots. Close-ups by candle light indicate the beautiful work of traditional artists and it is lovely to see illustrators and their students supporting the details of religious murals through extensive scaffolding. It is not surprising that the artistic aspects (clothing, faces, makeup) of the film are pretty awesome, because Italian churches have kept these details for centuries. The great Florentine artist, Tassi, who specializes in visual imagery and landscape painting (most new), was introduced to new technologies in her artistic inspiration, Artemia painting. After acting for her, Tassi raped her violently. Her father was angry. <br /> <br /> This romantic drama has a very simple story with unsatisfactory ending. The outstanding feature of the film is its artistic display and attention to detail. <br /> <br /> The scenes such as women throwing the ball in the air added amazing effects to wear their huge dresses. <br /> <br /> Artemisia tells herself to be happy; Her father makes others happy. For this film, it will please me a lot, I think.
