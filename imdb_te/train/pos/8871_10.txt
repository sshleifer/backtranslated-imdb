This is a great movie with lying problems. It deals with racism and class issues. But there is also a message that you know and your responsibility. The movie is very deep, it's your message and you can only control your task. It also showed that knowing you and being comfortable with someone is the only way to fit into society. It's not important what others think about you. I believe I did an excellent job of showing this film. Actors who make each character look great. I'm surprised how deep I am in this film. You can not see how deep the movie is, but you can see the underlying meaning in the movie.
