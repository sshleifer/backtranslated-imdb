Okay, so it's a bit from "It's aonderful life", but 44 years before the film, why not a new effort. Belushi has a rotten 35th birthday. He did not get his wheat and coffee and lost his job. The capper is when he describes his self "sh ** big blue piece" car break at the end of the day. He heads into an empty bar to call for a wholesaler. While waiting, he was recognized by Bertender (Cain), a boy who lost the Town Championship baseball game 20 years ago. If he wins the game, he gets him thinking about what life is like. Unbeknownst to him, Cain gives a motion of a motion in a glass, which he acts as his wife as a building, regional queen (Russia) and president of the sporting goods company. Cain later revealed himself to be the man responsible for this change, but Balusi was not on the board altogether. He has never completely adjusted and the movie is not yet correct, and his wife (Hamilton) attempts to marry someone from his real life. The good move they do not spend much time, basically they rip "ghost", with Belushi continually telling her only Hamilton things. It also brings a hockey dramatic element, like kevetch in two shadows to his lovers, new wife Russia, and his imbalance lover Cox. But the film's keys are somewhat long in the beginning, and the cheery finish. Better work from big and recognizable actors, Balusi is very fond of, choosing the most attractive ladies, and the coin title guy is absolutely simple. It received a substitute lifestyle of Riches in the 1990 film "Talking Care of Business". Similarly, the two films made in the same level of laugh. So check this for a fun search "what to do?"
