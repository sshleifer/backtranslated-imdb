This film is one of my favorite foreign films, others are some Amale and My Life as a Dog. Comparisons with images of very large foreign films, which take on a worldly piece of life and it becomes a heartfelt hearty text. <br /> <br /> In Japan, he finds a beautiful Japanese woman looking for a dance studio window, a bored man in his worldly life and the long life of his married life. As soon as he crossed his train, he was trapped by her. But how does it appear to be that, by his beauty, through her vision, or both of them? <br /> <br /> Shell Dance Dance has excellent markings dealing with the world's painful realities. Breaking the traditional molds and stereo bushes of Japanese society, they find it hard to risk for all the happiness and that a lot of pleasure. It is very magical and meaningful and one of those movies, in it, beyond the worldly by showing the miracle that is true magic and life.
