During a vacation as part of his family, an other boy makes his first experiences in his homosexual love specially a very close and sharp discription of a 18year older man's bubbling and dynamic emotional world. Complete with this "sound intimate-ups" and quiet moments wich because I liked this movie, full of intensive moods of his extremly clear and surrogated storytelling.
