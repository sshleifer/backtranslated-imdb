<br /> <br /> I will give four reasons to see this film. Four of the best filmmakers in contemporary Mexican films. <br /> <br /> There are four good stories related to a good plan. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly good cast. <br /> <br /> Alejandro Gumbobah opens the film with a good mood in a funny mood. The practice of exploitation against ordinary people is the power and is still expected to be appreciated by its efforts. <br /> Antonio Serrano is the storytelling successor of the Italian Neoralylia with "New Zealand", more dramatic in the second story. <br /> <br /> In the third story, even in this case seems more independent from this case, Carlos Carrera tells us the story of man being in the wrong place in the wrong moment. <br /> <br /> After the recent slaughter in Tlahuac and tradition in this awful incident at the state of Mexico, the story has not been updated yet. <br /> In the end, Fernando Saarinana has played a number of characters from previous sequences, one of the best comedy pieces ever recorded in "Grand Finale". His previous films include "Todo El Poder", rewriting the center scene, giving it the final lesson of the theme. <br /> <br /> When you finish the film you have a good image (and perhaps maybe) with a very painful subject). They say that people in Mexico laugh at their own disgrace and this is the best example. How the film learned and learned how to live in the middle of the crime between two crimes (and agree): Officials known as criminals and corrupt officials. This film has a strange idea because almost all the good people are crime victims and they can not get this harrowing. If you attack without a scratch then you're lucky. Meanwhile, this film will lose the opportunity to see, highly recommended. <br /> It's a beautiful life in Mexico ...
