The very high-level columbo story is actually the first featured episode of the long-running series, but actually the second (after "Murder by the Book"). <br /> <br /> Robert Cole appeared as a guest assassin in his first three series and as the owner of a private detective agency blackmailing Patrias Crowley (Patricia Crowley) (the most sympathetic by Ray Miland) Misunderstood, she is associated with her after she finds out. The wife later revolves against the blackmail scheme, but becomes angry. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the most satisfying episode, especially the plot is strongly established and then developed and even a unpremeditated killing because of the rare Colombo substance. The whole thing improved when a typical husband used the murderer to assist Colombo in his studies: the three most prominent characters in particular of many good quality scenes, and Colombo's cruel fraudulent features were excellent in the first line. <br /> <br /> <br /> Bernard L. Flair directed by Kowalski and acted on a fairly high level, which was really for the whole series ("Murder Murder By The Book"). The creators of Colombo, Richard Levinson and William Link, are the perfect, well-structured and well thought-out and consistent, productive speed and meaningful scenes really show the story's unpredictability. Finally, Colombo has always been said to be a step ahead of the murderer. <br /> <br /> Overall the detective work for Colombo is very good, and strongly suggests that the product team works positively and is structurally providing a polished Columbo story.
