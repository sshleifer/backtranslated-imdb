This film is very funny, I could not stop laughing when it looked and saw it twice in 2 days! The film is unique in humor and visuals, both splendid and other (more serious) image gems of the actress are similar to Cube and Cipher. <br /> <br /> Dave and Andrew Andrew Miller (co-writer of the story), Dave Hillytt and Dave Hewlett, who play the most favorite music and "loser" characters of the film, are the actors and I like it. <br /> <br /> Very nice X-Box Dead or Alive fights (see Dave play you hello at a time) and Andrew's amazing guitar solo. About friendship. You should see it!
