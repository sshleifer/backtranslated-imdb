I enjoyed this movie. It's honest, happy, very colorful. You can see that MGM has shown technicolor. There are no visible colors in this image. Each scene is full. Choreography is great. Jean Kelly is a miracle. He is very talented. The dance numbers in this movie are all implemented perfectly, and perfectly designed. He understood that dances can tell anything in the story. The final part of the film, Grand Dancing Sequence is great. The film is specifically made by Gershwin. Some American composers have a good gift for melody. I enjoyed Gershwin music. It's mesmerizing. Ira Gershwin is definitely one of the greatest lyric writers. He is very witty and beautiful. This is a very entertaining film.
