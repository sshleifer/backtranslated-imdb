Lost is one of a kind ... complete with its enchanting and suspense, thrill and emotions at the same time. I've never seen any TV series like this. It's full of wild thrills and a good screen play. Actors opened life on an island on an island, and I think I would miss out on seeing the island. This is a striking work in a very clever form. The image of this series of life lost a lost life on a desert island. I looked at an episode and looked at something else and I would recommend this series to all TV show lovers. I'm looking for magic to lose it somewhere.
