I caught this film at a test screening. Very surprised to find a truly sweet and fun story. Well played. Natalia Henstridge next Julia Roberts. Male is a major surprise. Very funny picture. In the best places in New York. I wanted to go there. <br /> <br /> I thought "I've got mail", "this was what you wanted." This is a very good story. <br /> It's fine and great for the entire family. I liked it with the audience. A perfect recommendation!
