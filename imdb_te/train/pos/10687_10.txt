I have to admit that I am absolutely amazed by this film. For one, when I went to see it as a whim expecting something mediocre, but given this, it was a very shocking thing in a popular American cinema at all. It is the best-known British comedy in dark, quirky and funny films. However, I sincerely recommend this to anyone to stop short; I saw many people, some English, some European and some Americans and some (mainly the first two groups), hated some and looked at it as worthless. If you want to go into this kind of thing then go. Otherwise, no. 10/10.
