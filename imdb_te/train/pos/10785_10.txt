When I was young, I saw it was wonderful. Kelsey White Lisa and Mises Mice name are beautiful. Sudan Bonde Dudley and Sandra de Hedeke in the Snodello Hilaryis. Karen Botcher-Tate is a professor. Burl Ross is funny as Little Bunny as Fu Fu. Gregory Donovan as Kaiso is good. What is Hillary's about Snoodle and Doodle eating too much candy Little Bunny Fu Fu is hanging over the head with Macy Messes, and then Little Bunny Pooh Foo gives some greetings, then he turns into Gon. This story is about when Lisa, Snoedd, Dudle went to Big Rock Candy Mountains. This show is as wonderful as watching this presentation of kids, new words, songs, and playing them.
