The man who lives alone after 45 years of marriage. He will have to solve the problem of family Milk Cow and Tulip, which does not allow the participation of milk. <br /> <br /> Tulip has wiped out his wife, and he visualizes his wife. <br /> <br /> Tulip relies on the real story of his grandfather's genus Griffith's family. The film is responsible for the life of an invisible life, one that is set in a rural Victorian (Australian state, no age) in rural areas. The author and director Griffiths have more goals in both, and the multi-award-winning 15-minute short is starting to reel herself.
