Melvin Douglas once again has a polished performance, during this time he is in the role of a detective who does not love the fate and adventure, and Water Hill Zone Blondel (they are many illiterates, a critic has written, wrote a novel about his early life) and always loved his beloved It's as pleasurable. It's almost a screwball comedy, almost a thin man-type film, almost a series, I guess, the sequel. It did not reach much classic status, but it had a pleasurable 85 minutes in the direction of the episodic non-pacifist script, fine character actors and all of them, so it was almost not Williams (Douglas) which would not be exactly visible in Colombo. I would like to have such movies.
