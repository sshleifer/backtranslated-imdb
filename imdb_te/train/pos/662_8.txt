The first is a wonderful second installment that deals with the good. <br /> Once again, casting is amazing. <br /> <br /> The second episode is just so funny, very crazy and very enjoyable. This is the first Christmas episode about a woman who suffered a serial killer after she killed her husband as Santa. Like the first part; <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous scenario is a length between her husband's murder and her phone call, which is true and will remove her fears.
