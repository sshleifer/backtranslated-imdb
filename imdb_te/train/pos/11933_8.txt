I think this is a lovely family movie. There are plenty of happy scenes and heartfelt moments throughout the film. The actors are great and the effects are well implemented. Danny Glover is working on George Knox's terrible baseball team 'The Angels' and is great throughout the film. Also young actors are Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Milton Davis Jr. Christopher Lloyd as 'The Angel' and the effects of these top-lyric Disney films are great. Everyone should enjoy the touching and heart warming film.
