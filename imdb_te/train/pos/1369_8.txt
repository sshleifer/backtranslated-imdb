I love this movie, and I feel like it, or it feels like that. No, the film is not deep - who cares? These films are always there. But amazingly, it's a message. <br /> We have enough probability for everything. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey is the greatest of the movie. I never thought I would have had some similarity with Catherine Hepburn. Hepburn and Posey are great looking to have movies about two librarians (Hepburn's The Desk Set). All librarians, especially those of the sense of humor, should see party girl. <br /> <br /> I gave the film 8. It's not a great movie by movie standards, though there are some nice shots. But it is very fascinating and entertaining.
