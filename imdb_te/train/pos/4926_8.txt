Elia Kazan, one of the best theater directors in the country, is at home with movies. With "Patux in the Streets", Mr. Kajan shares the earlier version, perhaps with his masterpal "On the Waterfront", only two films share the water. <br /> <br /> Mr. Kazan shot himself in the city of New Orleans. The adaptation of the Dawn Fukes of Edna and Edward Analt's stories, based on the film, takes us to places where visitors can not see when visiting "The Big Easy". One of the bigger assets of the film is Joseph MacDonald's wonderful black and white cinematography that best shows New Orleans. <br /> <br /> Alfred Newman's music and Billy Holiday song songs give a good touch. <br /> <br /> The film is clearly visible in the movie Jack Palons, who kills the screen every time he makes his screen debut. One sees him. He is so intense! At the same time, this tough guy shows his soft side when he goes to see his sick partner, who is not suffering from a malignant disease. Blackie, this guy waits with his sweaty face and runs his hands through the dirty hair of the dying person. <br /> <br /> Both of the actors are convinced that Mr. Balance and Mr. Mastel appear to be doing their own stunts, which is very refreshing. <br /> <br /> This film also introduces Reid's family at the beginning of the film as a normal side. We see a family man painting furniture with his little son. Then discuss how he and wife will not be able to meet his salary, many families have to deal with something everyday. Richard Widmark, playing a normal man, is not effective when playing the role of a more fraudulent and serious people. Barbara Bell Geddes, wife, sounds like she is a suburban woman from Connecticut. <br /> <br /> The film is a delight for the cast and crew of Mr. Kazan and the actors who work in the film.
