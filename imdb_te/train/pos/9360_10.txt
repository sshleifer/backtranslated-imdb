At the age of 34 I suddenly said that I was a widow. I was devastated because he was not sick --- he died unexpectedly heartlessly --- bleeding his carotids - he died behind our house. There were a lot of speculation from the police, he barged over something and it was captured by his head. I was a suspect for murder until the autopsy came back. <br /> <br /> My children are like me and I am in love with a good father. I have three young children, no education, financial support. I took it very hard. In two years my in-laws allowed me to physically, physically, emotionally, and spiritually mourning my children, and my pain during the holidays ... no one saw me and my heart and soul follow me Grief physician sat for a holiday, except of course, standing for my choice. My in-laws did not get it! This has changed my relationship with me forever, and I have never returned to the holidays. This is just an example of how my grief cheated! When I shared from my soul my own (new) husband declined to talk about injury. I can collapse, do not breathe, hybridotilate, and usually do not work for a few days if I try to convey the hidden pain. <br /> <br /> Now this movie is about my mind. My fears and back pain from the real monsters that offer this picture of pain; A mourner compared to many of us and how we expect demons. Adam Sandler is exactly how you faced the horror of the horror, overcame, and everything at your own time! The film has removed all the pain I've tried in years to come. When you feel deeply in your soul, when you think in the dark, all the words that come out of your mouth do not want you to live in a dead and dead state. <br /> The Bible contains a book, Romans 8:26 When my mouth and spirit pray, what does God's holy spirit cause to the feet of God? - I do not speak. Sandler has done it perfect! <br /> For the purposes of mental health commitment he has a scene to take part in court proceedings, and goes back to face his in-laws (I know it very well) --- and he tells them the wonderful truths he has, each one over Can not get it. This is a very strong, and powerful display. I started bawling and it was hard time to get up to the wards running out of the theater feeling my legs feeling so weak. My son is with me and it's the first time I'm trying to catch all of my perfect moments; He is a lesson, my youngest, who can not remember his childhood. It's been 13 years old, but when I demanded my masks for my feelings and my submission to my own, instead of losing my in-laws, this film brought me back. <br /> <br /> If I am this episode, you make it for this film, but the sandler gave a 1000 star performance. <br /> If you are not yet gray, learn lessons from his image and listen to people's choices in their grief and find peace on their own! Sometimes, the soul can not say words to express our pain. <br /> <br /> Make a film with tissue and do not get ready for your soul!
