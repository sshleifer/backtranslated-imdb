Osciesy is in a very bad state but is now fully restored in Digital Film Lab in Copenhagen. The fact that the material used is "master positive" from the 2nd generation actually managed to hide from Visconti fascists. It was scanned on the 4K (2K RGB data) and was then processed using the Daewin Revival Recovery software. After that the rest are manual labor and we can not finish before spring. After a while it will be available on DVD and will hopefully be released on HD DVD. We hope that the film is very beautiful and will enjoy the restoration effort through many generations to come.
