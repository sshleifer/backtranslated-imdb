OK, so musical pieces are poorly written and generally sung poorly (Walker and Mariner, especially Wachen, are pretty good). They eventually lost the fourth wall and eventually sang the fourth wall with "Ogre" with Ogre, and they do not even know about it, but praise Puss's efforts in Boots. /> <br /> Who cares? This is Christopher Freakin 'Walken, a film based on a fairy tale, and he sings and dances. His acting style plays the role of a nasty and unfortunate Puss that appears to have brought his character into deeper and deeper hardship, but in fact he intends to think of seven or eight moves beforehand. <br /> <br /> Whenever you ever wake up in the villain's roles, you will be able to beat him, and he will come into his trap. Anyone who enjoys the unique style of Christopher Walken must see.
