I'm zero interest in rap and ghetto culture, I like white and classic rock, however, do not stop me from appreciating this wonderful comedy. Its very sequel is the spine pump, the same image, just about rap or rock. And it's so happy. There are very funny jokes but there are some jokes that just come flat. All of the characters are very funny and believable. It laughs at me at 3 o'clock and at least one test screening I have seen in any film that can make those warrants. One of the reasons why these movies are so funny is that it makes fun of a different rap. Rap today is related to the wrong things and get through the studio noise and minimal talent. The film comes from the time the rappers paid more credit. Overall, jokes related to racism, sex, and music culture are very funny. This is the spine pump which is recommended for any fan. They are essentially the same movie, just about different worlds, and yes, the same jokes work in both films.
