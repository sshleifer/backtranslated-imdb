A great picture. Acting - the pavement artist head doctor from the doctor is incredible, with very few exceptions; I felt like Sony Razdan (mrs.noble) and Viraj Hariji (Sarab) are among the lesser-known actors. <br /> <br /> Another great thing is camera work - and the way it captured the power of bomb streets, Kurush Debo (TEHULULE) <br /> <br /> I am a fan of the wall of a shrine, And artists should be taken philosophically. <br /> <br /> It is good to see good films in Indian themes.
