Jerry has an ordinary cat and mouse prank until it flies in an invisible ink bottle. He gets the bright idea of ​​torturing Tom without knowing it. The cat gets the knowledge and if it is not a fool proof, he is prepared to 'see' him. Jerry Gets Butch of course is aka killer aka Spike dog (although it is late in late, and his contribution is actually low) which reminds me of the brilliant animated little kind Tom so terrible Tom angry white mouse. Deception is a lot of work and no good Tom and Jerry should really be all violent as little. This hilarious cartoon "Tom & Jerry" can be seen on one of the DVD's disc of spotlight collection <br /> <br /> My Grade: B +
