I think you have to get a lot of jokes from the USA. But if you liked Princess Bride and Forest Gump, you would like this movie. You can not match the quality to the course of the course, but the cameraman's trip was clearly intended. Killer Tomatoes is a hundred times better than Napoleon Dynamite. My opinion. I'm sure people from France will not appreciate French sights So this film is not for a global audience. When I was not a trained film critic, I knew what I liked. I can not stop laughing through the whole movie. My sides and my jaws were hurting at the end of the film.
