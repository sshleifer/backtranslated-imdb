Another major film made by John Walters is a serial Mom. There is a hobby to pick up images that see the title role of Pierre. It does not matter if he is dirty or surprised when he is taking pictures. He uses images that are immediately taken and performed in his work. Peker belonged to a semi-typical middle class family. His father works in a drunken band with a paw machine, but does not get enough money with a Lesbian stripper bar on the street. His mother drives a savings shop and prefers to wear poor people. His older sister, Tina, works in her exclusive trade gear bar. His youngest, Little Chrissy, has a habit of eating only sugar, sugar, and sugar. His grandmother, Memo, has a small statue of the Virgin Mary, and with which the Warliluxist plays. He is also 2 friends. His friends, Matt, a long-term shop lifter and his girlfriend, Shelley, runs a laundry mat as she is a dictator. Soon, tourism from New York purchases its pictures and displays them in an art gallery. The film comes to fame, but the pictures reveal the unusual life style of the normal life of his friends and family. For the R-rated film, Waters is the perfect taker of previous R-rated films and peaker than Pink Flamingos. 10 out of 10!
