An entertaining Kung Fu movie, with acting, plot and fighting scenes cut above average ax sack. Roles and skill martial artists like all cast. Alexander Foo-Sheng's proto-Jackie Chan comedy is very fun to watch, and his tough companion is particularly impressive. At times, the changes between movies and many subplots get a little confusing, and some characters can not get out completely fleshed like a request - for me, the size of the only clear lightning cast of the movie <br /> <br /> But the Kung Fu movie is the first and The higher the performance must be decided, and the Shaolin Temple certainly provides that count. The film is climaxed with a high-body count battle that allows each character to showcase his skills against a worthy opponent. <br /> <br /> Overall, the low-budget Kung Fu movie enjoying the Shaolin Temple. Good jet l is not the image quality, but it is definitely worth the genre fans. My rating: 8/10. <br/> Various Notes: 1987 Warner Home Video Release I have seen (assuming) poorly dubbed, and does not have full cast & crew credits.
