During insomnia (fueled by my curiosity ...), I was amazed by the title, I stood up and saw it. I checked my TV lists and looked again! It's clear to me when I see that there are actually young people in politics, traditions, culture, and everywhere. Children from Belgrade say that it is impossible to say that, apart from the local teens in the era, the American midwest somewhere, and in the language differences next to it, say. Music, sex, movie idols, music, drinking, sports, music ... In fact, at the same time in the 1970s in Southern California, it was a sweet story story, but youthful joy made it a very enjoyable experience. The characters, especially the young actors, are also completely reliable. I can not say that this Yugoslav is "American graffiti", but I say that this is good enough with other 50's-themed movies.
