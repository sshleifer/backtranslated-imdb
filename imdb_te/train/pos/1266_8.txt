I will also read some previous comments that the film is going to lose steam at the end of the film and compare it to Cape Fear. I totally disagree. There's going to give a simple review for the usual illustrators. I thought the casting was perfect. I thought this was one of the best performances of Ed Harris. What a bad mood he has for his performance about his performance in this film. I was riveted across this movie. If you are mysterious thrillers, this is exactly what the film wants to see. I also saw a young Scarlett Johansson in the film. This film is filled with top stars and I highly recommend it!
