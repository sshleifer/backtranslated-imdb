Full House is a great show. I am still growing up today. When I was 8 years old I started looking at it and now I am 12 years old. I was especially in love with Stephanie's characters. She's my favorite. She has the sense of humor. In this eye, people rarely see the show, and you'll get on it because you must. After the first show I saw as the first episode in 2002, I hugged it up. It's really good performance. I really think families of this show should go down for many generations. And it's great for all ages because it's great. And for all parents, children teach lessons on how to go about their life. There is nothing terrible like torture or swearing. This is a great sit-com. I give it 5 out of 5 stars. What do you think Oh and the best time you watch is when the home is sick from school or from the old office. It makes you feel very good. I'm ill with illness at home but you believe me well. And even if you're happy in your life you will not get much life because everyone is thinking that the show is stupid, you are very bad. You really need to see and you are hooked on it. I told him what happened to me and others, starting to see this spectacular show. Well I should go have some meals. Remember that you are looking at the full house and start soon!
