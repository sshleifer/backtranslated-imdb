The history of the FBI is linked to his personal life story, as stated by the perspective of Agent Stewart. Stewart and Miles (his wife) are pretty good, Hamilton is a serious agent. The problem is that the episode of the story's ecosystem makes it harder to work. It's like looking at the bits and pieces of a dozen different films which get the momentum of who's casting gangsters. Some episodes are too long, some are too small, and some are just Stewart's daughter look in school order. Overall, it goes too long. However, it is good to check its beautiful product values.
