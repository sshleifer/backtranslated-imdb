A valuable resonance from Lars von Trier's Europa the Third Man, an American World War II coming to Europe and embroiled in a dangerous mystery. <br /> <br /> Jean-Marc Bar Leopold ends up working with his uncle as a sleeping carrier conductor on the German train station in Frankfurt, Germany, who refuses to join the US Army in the Battle of Keyer. What he does not know is that the battle is still going on underground terrorist group called Werewolves aimed at secretly American allies. Leopold is hard not taking any sides, but Catherine Hartman (Barbara Sukova) is attracted by the daughter of the owner of the railway company's owner, Fatalel. Her father was a Nazi sympathy, but American Colonel Harris (Eddie Considine) was forgiven, because he helps Germany to regain transportation and re-run. Leopold is a spy (a choice or opportunity to think of him) to see if Leopold will make attacks on trains, and everyone is involved in both sides and everything in a mysterious and film noir-ish route, where it is not visible In the adventure is difficult. Finally, he can see the innocent Leopold's deal with everyone (his girlfriend, militants, colonel, annoying passengers, his unsatisfactory uncle, railway company officials, also to observe his working rules) before being crushed and ridiculous and violent. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully portrayed and snowy in winter. Its shot that appears randomly in black and white with shots of color. In addition, it displays images showing images with background images. Add the hypnotic narrative of Max van Sido, and Europe will become a dreamlike place in the world. <br /> This is my personal favorite movie now.
