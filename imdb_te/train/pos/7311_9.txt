Halloween is the image I want to see every day out this day and every time. It's not the holiday I sometimes even see! This film is great for SO. Jamie Lee loves Curtis One movie I never ever stop this movie might be older, but the story line still comes to me every time, and acting is absolutely amazing! Even if I do not see the remake, I already feel that it is completely unnecessary. There is no need to recreate such a classic. To know why you will kill me, there are some who have seen the remake without even listening to it. I'm so angry about it !!!!!! Great, and it will always be remembered in history as a classic.
