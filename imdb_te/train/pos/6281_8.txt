I have the opportunity to watch many movies on BluRay and HD DVD. This film will be up to it's exciting action and great story. But this is not one if you're looking for an image with an amazing picture. Help make it easier to buy without a movie on DVD. I enjoyed the extreme action and best performance that I did not always work together. Overall this makes an amazing fun movie to watch. Now on the Blu Ray level. In many Blu Ray films you get two things. A distorted or grenade hd image is almost clear with a picture with a picture. I was disappointed after my first Blu Ray film. I think this Blue Blake is standard. I know very well after seeing other movies. I do not believe they have spent the film as long as they have to transfer the film to hd. This is usually a problem with some movies. And for the price of Blu Ray players and Blu Ray discs you have to be the best film. I have never seen this movie or consider a worthwhile investment for people who do not buy the DVD version.
