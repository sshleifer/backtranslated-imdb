This is a great movie. Every time I watch, I love it more. Most comedies can get pretty slugged because you know all the gags, but mystery men look again and again have a great deal of writing and classification - like Ben Stiller's tears at the hood of the lemon, or Ham Azure says Louis Laser or Geoffrey Rush is his fiery choreography, or Tom Whites Looking at the news report, or Janeena Garofol Paul Kissing from Rubens - a pleasure. This pitch is perfect ensemble acting. The story is straight and steady, action sequences are not creative and very prominent, ultimately all set-up payments. Seriously, if you see it and for a while, look again, and if you do not turn it off. You can not see it again until you see it for the first time. (Wes Studi, William H.
