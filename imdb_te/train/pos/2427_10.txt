It's really great unknown image. Perfect dialogues without simple clicks. The movie depended on the talent of the actor and it was removed. It also has a little comedy, but it is not an overdone. Once in life <br /> <br /> I love all the different things previously. <br /> Now on the actors. Lawrence Fishburn is a career young man playing a small criminal. He only allows him to show his talent in his own film. Titus Weaver is fond of Fitburne's junkie half-brother. Eimon Walker has already added a flavor to a full flavor. Paul Calderon is a greasy monkey / drug lord. I liked his performance from "King of New York". But the best act in the film comes from Gregory Hines and Michael Paul Chan, who are pairing with Calderon's servicemen. <br /> Once in the Life for sure keeper. **** from 1/2 * *.
