This is a run-of-the-mill natural romance film. By romance, I'm not sexy. I have thousands of birds combinations, or hundreds of woods, or inaccurate images of a huge waterfall or iceberg. Many of the shots in the movie appear only to enter the trailer, only to enter the theaters for up to ten seconds to see the rest of the films again and again. <Br /> <br /> There are almost no plot in this movie. The film is expected to be the story of three animal families "better than March of the penguins". The allegation consists of three important locations: (1) The writers who describe James Earl Jones as mentors of film history (2) describe music, the editors who have a storytelling progression from the film, without any flow, no flow, Life in the whole movie - the film about life. When the film was halfway through the film, I was worried in my seat and in my seat, I hoped the film was more than half, and I was able to cope with a long endurance test with animals. <br /> <br /> There is almost no science in the film. They have attributed the heat and cold (not all, just seasons) to the tilt of the earth, ignoring the fact that if there is no tilt because they will not be warm in the dust, ignoring the fact that there is even greater extremes. If half the planet is burned and the other half is frozen, it would be worse if there was any rotation (such as the Revolution) associated with Mercury. At the end they use the term "humans and animals", if humans are not animals, something is excluded from the laws of nature. <br /> <br /> I need to credit the camera work, but why would I call this nature profane. Everything in the super-slow move appears to be mechanical-controlled time-lapse photography, and some (and some of the alerts, some "only") are fantastic movements of other nature films, and I'm not convinced that it's all on the screen.The few shots that featured the great water hole in Africa, From season to season I looked like CGI. <br /> <br /> For a director <br /> <br /> For the film about the Earth, what we have seen is what we saw earlier, some species may be at risk because of climate change, They did not give us evidence, they are from Alberta V. They did not show us the great Pacific pistols and they did not show us a nighttime picture of the human light pollution around the planet, why are they so many countries that you should cover for a good whitewash? My last criticism is hunting. At any time when the predator was hunting on the screen, the music of the Mt Doom scene from the Lord of the Rings almost changed, while some kind of siren was filmed as the ultimate-evil character. But the hunter is not bad. They perform the necessary services, and the best members of the diet are surviving. We hunted us. Pretender hunting is at any time that we immediately cut away from the other and say that death and eating are not really happening. The final insult "father" died to kill the polar bear, he tried to eat. <br /> <br /> "Bad bare! Bad!", you can listen to what you say. <br /> In the show. My theater is the reason for this, but probably not. I want to see something more clear than what I see in my own HDTV LCD at home. But the film is unclear and at the same time I presented the same 16: 9 proportions to the extensive ratio of many movies. In an action-packed scene at the end, the film (can not imagine how it looks, can not imagine how it looks), was damaged, and we lost many colors and finally blackened. <br /> If they sow a tree on my behalf, it will be valuable. But how do I know?
