Last November, I had the opportunity to watch this film at the Rena Film Festival. I have to say it's fun. There are some technical disadvantages, which is a great experience. I liked writing and acting from the person who played the lead role. The film has many hearts, most of which are. I had a chance to talk to some filmmakers who made it, and they seemed real nice. All in all the whole movie is just a positive experience, and I'd definitely recommend it. The story is entertaining and nice, I have come from a lot of issues like the main guy, and because I really understand its problems. This film works great for giving people sympathetic to us. The friends in the picture are well written, they are realistic. I know people like this, I only wish Imy Friends and I could sound cool like these people when I spoke. <br /> <br /> This is a very good story
