In 1928, the Russian immigrant director in Hollywood (William Powell) wrote his legend about the Russian Revolution, and hired an old former-general from the Gizmist regime (Emil Jennings) to act as a general director and both of them drama. <br /> <br /> Previously, 11 years ago they all shared the female memory (Evelyn Brent). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " 'The Docs of New York' is a great movie, and 'Underworld' is a movie that I always wanted to see, but it is going to be heavily than 'The Last Command'. The premise is fascinating, but the treatment really takes the Script scripts into life, except the scenes set in Hollywood, which portrays the brand line of professional additional products and a larger film production with state-of-the-art technology. <br /> <br /> Emil Jannings is an excellent Russian general, old former general of suffering and weakness, transmitted in his misery, and is a wonderfully separated among the strong, heartfelt officer of Ghana. The end is great and worth the wait, but to get there you have to be a little bored ready.
