It was filmed at the Florida National Guard site, "Tigerland" is fully reminiscent of Fort Polk, LA, firing, maneuvering areas, waist-deep water and all. The film is very authentic and the same characters in my AIT in 1974 are similar. The difference between Tigerland year, 1971 and mine of 1974 All drill serologists and preachers have learned that they did not go back to Vietnam Over pretty much all over, so the training was relaxed - not a challenge at all. I lived up to 2004, and in fact, I am a precursor to all our problems in the 70s and 80s for the fact that I know. I did not hear about "Tigerland" but the army has real Vietnam training villages in various fields in America. Vietnam Vets for me is said to be pretty hard and hard for 1972 Basic & Eights because the trainers were there and those skills were essential to training Vietnam-committed men, but this is not always the case. A drill surgeon at Polk and later one of my Vietnam vet NCOs, when we became a preacher at a basic training brigade at Fort Bliss, they did nothing to prepare for anyone, and find people and get out of it. This movie is overwhelming.
