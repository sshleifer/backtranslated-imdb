I want to see what the film's name alone is about me, so I recorded this film at the opening hours of AM. If you ever want to go to the first days of exclusions, the men will see a dramatic scene when the seams are cracked. The film is obviously working with Germany and France and wanted to show how the Germans who came to help German prisoners with the distrust of WWI and French towns. The actors have unusual scenes in the quarry with a horse and a little boy working in the quarry. There is an old old retired minor who is dark enough to go down the mine through the ladder when the elevator is broken. If you have a real picture buff, you do not want to miss the picture.
