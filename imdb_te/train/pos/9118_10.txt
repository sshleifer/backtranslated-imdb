I saw Owen Ali Shahadah's work with a special appearance. It's very interesting where this guy comes from. Now he is the world's leading independent African filmmaker. I am talking about black filmmakers who are rooted in culture. Moreover, the idea of ​​a testimony to the diversity and range of African themes is an African edition of his film 500 years later. But Idea is not suitable for this vowel. Showing artistic variability. The film is all African cast but there are many people in us. I love lightweight comedy in it. And Tuende Jugged is just wonderful, it's really an art gem.
