John Cassavates' "Opening Night" is spectacular and lovely; It's lovely because it plays with deep fears that our surprise has inside, lovely because it never leaves us surprising. For two hours and twenty minutes in its long term, no one can take their eyes off the screen for anyone to appreciate the characters. <br /> <br /> An unstable actress, Myrtle Gordon, (Gena Rowlands) tries to stay with her for a play, fights her demons; "Opening Night" is not only about the woman on the marginal edge, but also the complexity of the lives of theater actors and theater. Here are all the Casavutas characters who are familiar with the theater's world; Half of the performers in the film will perform their work or producers and directors and directors at their backstage. <br /> <br /> Cassavetus is very strict with his uncanny characters. Attracts audiences in the film, to the audience. Because another audience is in the movie's theater, they do not really know what has happened and they think everything is functional. And what is it most important; We can not see audiences 'backstage' in the theater. Before she could go to that stage, they could not experience Gene Rowlands for a long time; <br /> <br /> I always thought she was hard to be an actor. Myrtle (Rowland) only said that she was an actress and knew how to do it; If I had a friend who was a professional actress, I thought it would be really difficult to say when he told the truth that he could be an actor and could duplicate anytime. Will Marrel put many things in the horror experiences she puts on through the film? <br /> <br /> Mirror is the author, Sarah (Jon Blondel) who does not understand why she does not understand the role she wrote for her. Director, Manny (Ben Gazzara) does not agree to lose his best actress; <br /> <br /> The producer David (Paul Stewart) is a young man's death witness, a fan that Merrill co-star Maurice (Casavades himself), they can not act in love with each other; This is all together and affects Myrtle, but no one knows if her illusions are for the real. They do not want to interrupt her because they do not say anything, but the film enters only a subset of mystery approval. At times, we can say that everyone has it. In these periods, the cassette's amazing script characters describe a horrific brutality and honesty; <br /> Everyone is saying only to Myrtle, but she does not even tell them. <br /> <br /> There is no fear of talking to their minds like Cassave's way of making the film here. . In this case, more plays than "shadows" are very important because the characters are bigger; <br /> <br /> But, in another sense, the real way of making the film is that the film is not different from "Shadows". There is a beautiful thing in the alphabet's camera roles. When someone speaks, the camera does not focus on him, it shoots the person who hears; So we can see how he or she responds to what others have said. Sometimes they do not care, sometimes they are happy, sometimes destroyed. <br /> You may still have some of these amazing performances. At the end, there is an unexpected scenario where the Conserves and Rowlands do not start talking, but stop. It's not sophisticated or we should not be surprised. We just got to see; And both of them see each other's experiences and looking at the life experiences really alive in the conversation, much more than what it has shown.
