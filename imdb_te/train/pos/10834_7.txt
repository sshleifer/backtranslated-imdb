I have no real imagination and did not reach "Still Crazy". Another rock and roll film, I shot ... good nostalgia for baby boomers. This film is partially but not so much. Brian Gibson, director, has previously succeeded Tina Turner's biography and was very successful in his style. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this film, <br /> <br /> The cast is well-chosen. Bill Nighy's main character is sure to be in his role. Actor-director Bruce Robinson appears to be the band's washed guitarist. Although he did not appear in the film in the late 70s, he did a fantastic job. You're looking for a touching and funny movie (with some great songs), you've found it. <br /> <br />
