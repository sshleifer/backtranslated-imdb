It is one of the best-built films since 2002. It's not a good movie, but it's a great deal, it has great performances and is directed entirely by Sam Mendes, who started with 'American Beauty'. <br /> <br /> It tells the story of one of his jobs, Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks), a gangster story telling his son (Tyler Hoitlin). Michael's owner, John Rooney (Paul Newman), thinks things will be ok but his jealous son Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig) sets up both his father and Michael, leading to Michael's wife (Jennifer Jason League) and the second son's death. Michael Rooney feels obliged, and Rooney wants herself to choose and sends Hitman Magrey (Jude Law) to complete the job. Michael is a respected man in the company and he tries to help some friends, including Mob's owner, Frank Nittie (Stanley Tuske). <br /> <br /> 'Roadmap' is a classic gangster movie but it is well that you've almost never seen it. The film is good in its design, art direction, sound, music and its entire cinematography. Although the result is very beautiful, all of these things can create a surprise and suspense. <br /> Haillin is not an annoying baby and hanks, La and Newman finds out how to work. <br /> <br /> This comedy film is much better than you expected, which belongs to good films in the genre. Sometimes there are events that you have seen many times, but for some reason it is fresh at the same time. The scenes between adult hanks and baby heights help in that area. At times, this movie is familiar but it is very new in many areas.
