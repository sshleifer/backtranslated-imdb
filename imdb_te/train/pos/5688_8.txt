Early credits: great. Music: This image is correct. Cinematography: Burying a great effect. <br /> <br /> In the rail-wreckage, the excitement rises. This is how you can control some lives. "Wonderland" drug-inspired cruelty (and its consequences) is not a violation, but it shows how really that happens in our society. <br /> <br /> These days, Manmohan films and books are often focused on Mansoon's mad brain, because it now has a full picture of inexpensive fame and coincidence. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the best "method-acting" in the film, see Kilmer in the film. <br /> <br /> Here the filmmakers have succeeded in raising "outside control" to the level of art. Giving us cheap thrills.
