Well, casting in the movie is really amazing - this part is due to the plot, but I have a bit of confidence that Pierce Brosnan played this lead role (he really did a good job). <br /> <br /> It is based on the true story of the Englishman who lives with Canadian Indians in the early 20th century. He mentions mixed blood Indian. In fact, he was successful and well-thought-out people to listen to his lectures and take on the mountains that go to his wilderness - even though he was not a mixed bloody Indian and even all his knowledge books or fake! This film is centered and what happened when the fake came to light. <br /> <br /> Acting and settings are good and I like this movie very much (Brosnan has stopped believing). It did not receive extensive distribution-perhaps because it was very dirty - not a Bond film or a romance - just a really odd movie about a great man.
