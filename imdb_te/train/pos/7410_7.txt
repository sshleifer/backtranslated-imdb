I participated in the foreign shoe section of my local video store "Shower" and spends a lot of time from its cover, which is a farce or comedy. Then I locked a copy to buy at a financial price and was happy for my luck. "Shower" is a change in modern China, with three (3) men, one father and two (2) adult sons coming to terms with the changes in the world around them. <br /> <br /> As with most "foreign" films, Chinese culture is also very interesting, depending on the attractive features of the local and Chinese color that sets the story. <br /> <br /> The story of the family moves from perception and makes me excited to discover the difficult and still touching relationships between the men and one single woman involved in the story. These people. The main story is attached to many small characters, bathhouse customers and their personal differences and friendships. "Shower" is a movie that comes out of the laughing and touching place with its warmth and humility.
