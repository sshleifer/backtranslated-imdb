Opening the film with Bach Takkata is an aural hint of what to unravel in this serious drama. All compositing tools Bach is perfect to keep his listeners (and actresses) and is fit and entertaining in the film. There was not a mutual sensitivity between the two main characters and the main woman, which she was subjected to the final scene, claiming she was the victim's victim of a cad but claimed she was raped. Mamet is looking for differences between compellingly emotional abyss and sexes but I feel how clueless they are another compliment that really gave them a healthy sense of humor. If Mamet is always healthy humorous, intercourse between sexes I wonder how this work is out? It's so discouraging and enthusiastic as it exists.
