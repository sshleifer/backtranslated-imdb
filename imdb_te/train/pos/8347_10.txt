Perhaps I was very generous with rating ... but I love this movie! I have seen it many times, but every time I watch it will fall in love again. It's just a simple romantic comic, with no big or memorial nothing. But I'm a big romantic and this movie is * romantic. I love Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins, and Walter Motta is very funny. Scientists make me smile ... I recommend this film to anybody who has not seen me. It's a pure, good picture - and now rarely! My 20-year-old brother likes this movie, so it's not just a chic-flick. ;-) I recommend if you need to laugh, or if you are just alone and * do not participate in yourself one * If you need to see a romance. This is good!
