Really amazing picture, the feeling of a prophetic prophet of the future is frightening. Due to the damaged ozone layer widespread population worldwide, unsustainable heat, and all our natural resources. In this drowsiness society, we killed Charlton Heston's great film Nokery Style Detective, aside from the final appearance of the film Noir Legend Edward G. Robinson. One of the films that has always been with me from this movie is a group of people who run the stairs and Thorn (Heston) each time they use them. <br /> <br /> The use of music is very valuable, although it does not have any score in the general sense, the opening theme is good, and the atmosphere in Simonson's apartment, especially the Beethoven pieces in the euthanasia clinic.
