I am looking forward to a movie shooting horror movie. I was terrified. It's a horror film at the core. It's not a blaze like a horror house just like ghosts and other horror movies that have gore. This film also shows the fear of the characters Most deaths have not shown you. I think the best thing about that feeling is that I am worried about who I go home. Where are they where they are? Office buildings, police stations, hotel rooms ... etc. I was surprised that critics did not like this movie after reading about external reviews. <br /> <br /> I gave this film 10 stars because this is what a horror movie is to be done. It scared me out ** t.
