That's a fun fact, I was one in the baby, the crib in the movie. :) I'm now 19 years old. My parents took me to try for that part, we lived in Texas at that time. I feel like I have made 80 bucks for it, but I'm not in a long time. I told my parents that I was happy and happy when I wanted to cry. I'm mixed. Suppose strange and funny truth .. And I'm not a child actress. I work in San Antonio, 'I am working at Walirens. I graduated here in Texas but lived in my life in Maryland. This movie is a great movie, though, a good feeling. In my youngest years, I have seen many times.
