Why do not the pants do dynamo? Where did they go? It does not explain. That's why the film is so amazing. Plus a starcie gave her children AIDS !!!! A lot of great acting. Richard Dawson deserves to win as Best Supporting Actor! My favorite line from the AIDS movie "I'm" spot hit "This movie" birds "I tried to give this film to" stinkie "but it was playing." I thought it was Ponnani lol;) I like for a show why Dynamo is not wearing pants, I slip his hand but ... what's that silly futuristic nets? Ray Combs family fight uku person does not get to the net, he could have used ??. AIDSSSSS
