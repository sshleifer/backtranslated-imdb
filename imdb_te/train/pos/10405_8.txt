This film is one of my childhood favorites, and I must say, that during the period I have raised some other pictures I have placed on the quality of Baghdad's Thief when I grew up. This is not just a children's enjoyment, it can be enjoyed by adults. The disadvantage is that 'bad effects' (compared to the effects these days) can not be seen when one is younger. I do not recollect these pictures, and it's been ten years since I was at the age of eleven. Who is seeing the effects then? He only wants good stories and entertainment and this film is exactly the same. In my mind the film is one of the first great adventure films of the 20th century. I feel like Indiana Jones films. Humor, romance and adventure, it's an excellent mix that creates an amazing mix that ends until the end and the movie is outdated and the music and style of the images is not clearly modern, it's not dirty and old. Most importantly the great story, good direction and good acting performances of the actors. Standing in the section Sabu (Abu) and Conrad Weidt (such as Zafar), providing comic and movies for the most part. Great movie and an 'oldie', obviously a goldie '. <br /> <br /> </
