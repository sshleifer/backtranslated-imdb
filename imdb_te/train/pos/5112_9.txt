This film is all it's, action, fighting, dancing, bull, riding, music, cute girls. The film is an auto-look in Middle America. I believe, I was in 1980. Lots of oil money, lots of women, and lots of handy tonks. Very bad people are now gone. The film necessarily involves another boy girl, the boy loses the girl, the boy gets the girl back, but it is redeemed by actors and music. There is no cinematic film that has this film and American graffiti. This is a movie I watch again and does not get tired of it. Every time I watch, I'm young again, and it's time to go out of tank tanks. Since you can not rate a picture zero, I only gave it to 9 because I think you should rate a 10.
