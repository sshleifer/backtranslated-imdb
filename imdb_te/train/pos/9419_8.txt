<br /> <br /> This is a very good fun political satirical art of the corporate industry, featuring Alex Guinness, and a light-eccentric nature study. <br /> <br /> This pacing comedy is slow, but probably the faint on the floor except for the sound effects for experiments. But it has its amusing moments, and it is very intelligent in its implementation. <br /> <br /> Union processes are very drastic, I think all of Jack is very reminiscent; Especially the socialist of women with light romantic love on Guinness's role. Political machinations actually take the story. Ernest Thesigner is so important as a huge. <br /> <br /> I do not think this works a lot of LADYKILLERS, or KIND hearts and CORNETS as well; But even the light eeling comedy is better than nothing.
