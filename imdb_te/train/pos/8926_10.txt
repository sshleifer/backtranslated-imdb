I think someone other than Terrence Malick will do a cleaner film than Claire Denis. It is one of her newest films, the best work of her 2001 "Trouble Ever Day" (although it is very close), I do not like this role in its newest film. It's probably too long because of the story's own good. Do not make me wrong, there's a plot of everything in this movie, but it's one of the best ones, but I thought Denis would be concerned about a degree, so that the movie was a little flawed and some of the key points were somehow explained (where the main character was, instead of getting his heart's crossing Or the description of where he is located Suddenly, instead of showing him where nda). And some of the other characters are unnecessary and she is just as excited to be just as excited to use castes for Denis (Beatrice Dalle's character, especially if she's looking forward to some significance). Furthermore, the film is far from absorbing and cinematography. It definitely has a masterpiece in its own way. Whether Denis's most well-praised "Beau Drunk" is not as good or good. Claire Denis should be my favorite French director at this time, and Leoos is better than Carracks. Also I have to admit that the South Korean sequence is really "translation in the past", better than the film (and I'm a huge fan of that film, rather than some).
