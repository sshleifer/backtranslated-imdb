Stroke of the genius genius of Michel Rodriguez, who does not know Diana. She's perfect. Her acting experience works in her favor. It's never seen before, so it's really her story. She also brings her true strength. It works against her because we can never doubt her. She has never been to excuse her to win because she does not go against any war because I do not think she can be defeated. <br /> Again, this is not really a boxing movie. How does a movie about a girl who wants to become a boxer movie boxer? You will not do it. But Karyn Kusama is anyway. Like many indie movies, "Girlfight" describes the classification or style, and the real life span is a folk tale. <br /> <br /> Diana is doing poorly in school. She avoids unwilling people (for example, other girls in her school). She is not enough. Her father is forced to learn his brother's brother Tini from the box. He has given little money for his boxing sessions and can not give Diana anymore, it is not necessary for her to save herself or to improve her life. Tini wants to go to the Art School (Clich, Yck), thus giving her boxing allowance to Diana at the box office. When Diana falls for another boxer, Adrian (Santiago Douglas), it's complicated, who will see who's going to be promising. From there the story goes on ... two amateur title fight meets. <br /> <br /> The coolest thing for me is that it is not something interesting. This is quite a bit believable. Children with harsh lives growing in tough urban areas will fall on sports. Most professional boxers have risen from these conditions. The mental and physical fitness required for the upbringing is also a game of boxing, where anger is your friend. So this time it is a girl. <br /> <br /> Finally, a boxing movie about a girl. Women's boxing is a long time. Commonly looking brutality in bacterial films is replaced by discussing people's lives and their feelings. The whole fighting thing is used as a platform to portray a big picture. Respect. Overcome difficulties. <br /> <br /> I would recommend "Girlfire" because it has a good spirit and an example of a great work by the director for the first time. The dialogue is not so much about the soap opera quality, but the story actually changes my opinion on some things. Yes, the world is now a good place. <br /> <br /> Grade:
