The night of the living night is a funny act of 1978 film (and 2004 remake) of "Dawn of the Dead" .Just at this point ... with homeless. Why do not all South Park and people recognize people who do not live in episode? They treat the homeless as zombies that want change and the supermarket ends up on the roof of some of the parents in the movie. So now they come from and get rid of the guys to find out there. It's a fairly funny part with some good moments like the boys who follow the own version of the 2pac / Dr.Dre song "California Love". <br /> 8/10
