What a episode! Last week Melissa was constantly making fun of Annie and Brandy's friendship, and I was almost kidding. But as long as it's deleted, there is nothing to see Mellissa's folly. She looked at her shirt on her strap and felt her purse was very joyful in reality TV. She continued to look at people who were ready to take her clothes "to everyone" to wear something in her bizarre outfit. Mellis are at the age of 40 and are you still refusing subtle swimmers? Then, in the book of Jon calls all the brandies and brandies, and gets up and leave the show! The two rivers are the only brats that have survived in this show only to reverse up. Mellisa refuses to make a crying and departure interview, just everyone can imagine what America is thinking, you are a spoiled baby. WAH WAH I can not get my way! I love everything that I have told her, Melissa to think about her way, and then do the right thing. Melissa is a very attractive competitor and is clearly worthy of winning the whole game.
