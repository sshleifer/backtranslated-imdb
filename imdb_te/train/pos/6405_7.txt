The racism and prejudice against Karl Braischer was largely ignored by the Hollywood influence. I believe the U. S. Navy is always openly racist. I can not imagine a full captain and commanding officer, who is not always a man who is deliberately mocking his leader. Not the risk of his life. And the Chief Petty Officer is always confusing against WASP for everyone as Diniro's character. As he did, he and the non-alcoholic leader rose to the master's chief for the first time. Cuba has a good bad picture shot.
