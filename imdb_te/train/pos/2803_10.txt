As a former 2-time Okinawan Karate World Champion, I like movies about sacrifice for sport. But this film is very high. This image is very good and very deep. I am suffering a very serious injury recently and it is very unfortunate to everyone. I have almost lit lights. And this silly little picture drowned me deeply and reminded me of what I think about my father's life. Picture about this country. Respect your life and others for you. Empowerment. God, Bless "Bend like Beckham" I believe it is a true gem.
