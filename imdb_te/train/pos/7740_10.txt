It is immense throughout a rare film. This is really one of the best acting I have ever played, one of the most tightly produced films. Each line of the dialog can be applied in several ways, with three main characters different. The film's inspired motivational web and dual crosses make you pushing and refusing to let you. The slow-burning romance between Kevin and Faye seems to adhere to celluloid and tell you that you have the necessary materials for a perfect image. It is exposed as romantic artifacts of movies like "Titanic". If you see a movie to watch the laundry as you do it, it's not. You must adhere to this film. You should not have a conversation while walking in and out of the room. This film demands your attention. You will be treated with deserved respect and you will get a lot out of it. Unless you think "Titanic" is the best film ever.
