Buzz beastmaker? Frankly. After spiking with Spike, Tom and Jerry rushed to each other, Butch called a silent and wanted to know why. This is a good question. <br /> <br /> "Cats can get together with dogs, do not they?" He asks Tom, who accepts his head in the deal. "Rats can get together with cats?" <br /> They go inside and Butch takes on a "peace treaty" (finished professional masterpiece!). The rest of the rest, and the bulk of the cartoon, three of them are great, whatever a refreshing change-pace. I was glad to see it. I will reach these millions of cartoons, each of which hit each other on the head. <br /> <br /> Anyway, you know that it is not a permanent ending. A big part of the steak feels the death of a "peace treaty" but it is a good change and still has a simple Tom & Jerry intelligent humor.
