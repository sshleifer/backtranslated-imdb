Cinderella's story is one of my favorite films from Charles Perrault with Sleeping Beauty, which was designed in 1959 as a Disney movie; The film is a sweet, enchanting masterpiece from Disney. <br /> <br /> The film features a great soundtrack; I feel a very good soundtrack in a movie, and I love most songs; My favorite song is romantic "So Love Is." I love a lot of rats from the cinema, they are beautiful. After my favorite scenery scenery, small birds tried to wake Cinderella in the morning; Cinderella's animals (rats and birds) I also loved Cinderella's birthday-mother's clothes, so she could go to the ball ... Derigella & Anastasia bits and b ****!
