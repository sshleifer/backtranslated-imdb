At first I had a lot of responses left after seeing this: fat people sunbathing, etc. The shots are in a way less shots. OK so he meets Diane Arbus. . . Whatever. . . But it was not long before I realized that I did not complete this problem in full insult, because I thought the problem was a complete audience: Hollywood and movies are actually everywhere. It's ineffective to look at a certain age group in a sexual way, which is not shown. If this picture is all it is great. However, the story of a woman with an abusive girlfriend and her drunken friends is really a ton of bricks: very eloquent storytelling, incredible performances, and the scene improved. The blonde person is a genius actor. In the end, I want to contrast this movie with the movie about how pathetic this film is. Eventually, the old man with a dancing woman is completely lost in the character of the vowel, thus blocking him and does not exaggerate the film. Yes, his dog is killed. It's not the rosy movie of the world, but it's not. . . Absolutely helpless. I was really grateful to the filmmaker for doing all of such beauty, however. I'm as strong as I am, but I can not say that I will do this film primarily kicking and highly recommend. . .
