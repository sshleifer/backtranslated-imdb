This is incredibly exciting, a terrific intelligent and entertaining movie I will never tire looking at so many times. The cast is great for comparing young people with older characters. Here are really some of us to appreciate the good actors and intelligent story texture. For Judi Dench, she is beautiful and the gift of what kind of stars she is. I always made a point to see Judi Dench in her performances. She is an amazing actress and a pleasure to see if her character comes to each transitional life. I am only grateful to see this extraordinary picture of most of the movies, because I have so many good characters, good scripts and good performances. Movie people do not need accurate leaders, they do not have psychiatric and proficient. How wonderful to see old favorites like Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukas and Cleo Lynne. I want to win awards for this film. Thank you again for the amusing night. I congratulate the writer, director, producer, and such a good job.
