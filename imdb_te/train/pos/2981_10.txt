The worst is why this movie is low? I saw this film 25 times, and I know every line of this movie. I loved this movie. Troy Parker and Matt Stone (creators of South Park and Team USA) are the main characters Joe Cooper, or Cope "Aurman" Kopper, and Doug Reimer or "Sir Swash". Mainly they are referred to as the Coop and Remmer just across the film. The movie starts with the right money reminds us of the hungry insulting world of money paid, they go up to what is also known as "Townsell." I have to quote this part of this game because it started with some games: "And I'm happy to play here for a year for New England, San Diego, Houston, St. Louis, Toronto Arnanauts and even in the city of the desert in Miami." Depends on his agent: "Minnesota." Let's forget this important part of the movie. So it begins with the Koper and Reimers in the first high school reunion party and they do not have anything to talk with their old classmates. They challenged what the top school basketball leaders challenged outside the sport, creating the sport BASEketball. The sport will last about a year after insulting them. At this time they try to recruit their third team mate, Svek, one day after the game was invented. The film is based on kupay, reamer, and skeke that are only good players. The story is a foolish blackmail, Milwaukee Bears cheerleaders, and you are so furious that you cry more. Look at the dude, it's so happy.
