This product of Oliver has the expertise of showing the layers of evil in the human soul. The story mesmerizes a brightly illuminated unseen character, killing the darkness when he leads to an innocent boy through safe confusion in his possession. Yes, Oliver walks in the shadow of death, fears he is bad. There was a rod and a staff to comfort him. In the end, he was saved from the worst of mankind. Fagin at the bottom, the most scary. Fazin once did not repent in his ways, twice as much, as he did not want to pay for the price. Fagin is worse than Bill Syks, as he grows small bonds of murderers. Oliver is in the middle. His innocence is inadequate, but it does not even know. Nancy is the best. While not in judgment, she puts Bill Sykes's love down and loses violent temperament. However, like Fagin, she will be remorseful of her sins by protecting Oliver from her bill, with the cost of her life. They can not be seen. In my opinion, this quality art makes it worthwhile - can not imagine. I gave the movie "10", but its 70s have a TV soundtrack and the atmosphere is disorganized. Overall, fine, good story for all audiences.
