The fact that the couple of comments before me is very bad. Based on the actual events, Wilmington is based on the most publicly invisible disappearance and murder case that took place in the DE / Philadelphia PA area 96 to 1996. How long have I dreamed about Hollywood's original history and events dramatically and how long they end up constantly reporting on local newsprint and Philadelphia Inquiry news stories. Actress who acted in the fairy tale (Anne Mary was really pretty) actress (I really liked the Cold Case) immediately mentioned. Mark Harman of the exposed personality, such as the Copano's colony and the behavior of Copano during this time, really agreed. The case details are right ... no differences in the dramatic effect ... even down to the carpet, gun, furniture, and cool. In the end, I also wished that Tom Carpper was in many ways (despite being a good man, a politician) and I enjoyed the strings of the federal kingdom that I needed to solve this terrible crime. Guys like Capano is real and it is great to finally see him put behind bars.
