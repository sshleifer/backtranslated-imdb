This is a great movie! I played all the Nancy Drew games and read the books, and I never expected the film to be so exciting and funny! If you have never heard of Nancy Drew, I've read the first book (Secret of the Old Clock), so you can use Nancy, then the movie can be seen, because they do not really introduce roles and accelerate names. ;) My whole family enjoyed it and the plot was very interesting. This is the final film of the previous Nancy Drew films that could not be a match for Nancy Drew. The film is like Alex Rider: Stormbreaker. It's great! Nancy Drew lovers, you should see it!
