The first and second seasons began with Shakespeare, amongst the average episodes of good, and in some cases clich√©s were invented. But it began to establish the existence of the universe and began to develop its characters, which became more fun and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Richard Dean Andersen, Peter Deloise, Joseph Malozzi and Paul Mully: This program has been successful due to four men. Richard's pessimistic sense of humor will show very well, Peter's direction is very good and the episode is much more fun and Joe & Paul have come together with a funny, interesting episode. <br /> <br /> If you understand what the show is about and you know the characters, then you doubt that you do not like the show. For those who enter the show, I suggest 'The Other Side', Episode Episode, and 'Window of Opportunity', Classic Comic Relief Episodes.
