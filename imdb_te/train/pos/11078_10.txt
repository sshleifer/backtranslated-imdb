I have seen the film today and it has given up my mind. I can not understand why it's a real masterpiece of art and it's all bad for people. The main idea of ​​the cinema - take your ego away and then you will have real power! It was at the end of the main battle and Guy Ritchie was shown in a fantastic way. "The great enemy will hide in the last place you will ever see" - you remember this from the movie? Because our true enemy is in us - it always tells us that our ego is something that is important to us, that we can not give us, but we can not give us, but creating our invasion creates all negative feelings and ideas, wants to be in control. GR has expressed this idea in astonishing way and has shown you the only way to get real control when losing control and losing your personal importance. A fantastic picture!
