It's simple and still pretty cool. The whole sense of sex segregation in society, it's bitter, and I felt very sensitive. There is a bitter hammer in it. The fact that the actors are not many professors makes the film more clear and more realistic. The film is also on the documentary. Best scenes All girls are prohibited from watching, listening to the soldier's passion and watching an eye on them. If you're an Iranian, if you're promoting and dance on the streets after winning a game, you'll be filled with national pride !! If you are not a Iranian, you will love the same!
