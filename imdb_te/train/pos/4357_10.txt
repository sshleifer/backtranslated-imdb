I saw the film in Nashville Film Festival. It was pretty good until acting from cinematography. It's a father and son's story, and how they appreciate each other during a family crisis. Written with the dialogue that the pretty rings are not lying, the film displays the performance of Paul Ryser and Peter Faulk, among others there are some of these amazing actors. The elderly father (Peter Faulk) is trying to figure out why his wife (Olympia Dukakis) is leaving him. The father went to his son and daughter's house and alerted him. Father and Son take a look at some property and take a classic road trip and end up taking the next day. They play fish, pool, watch a baseball game, drunk, take part in a barroom clash, and dance with strange women. But the more important, the unpleasant tensions that everyone can not affect any family. It touches the heart and makes a compliment to those close to them.
