Life Stinks (1991) Mel Brooks is one step under other productions. He has acted as a great man with a mad man with his "friends". Brooks argues that he will live as a homeless man for a month. His stunned and cheerful friends accept this unusual race. During his "stay" in Boary, he meets the odd homeless group, one of whom holds his fancy (Leslie-van Warren). They strike friendships because she teaches many ideas she has learned while living on the street. Can Mr Brooks live dirty without being luxurious? Would you win this traditional race bet? Who are his true friends? <br /> <br /> This film is unfairly slagged. Definitely not as classic as his previous films but still enjoyable. I liked the mel Brooks Charles Chaplin in the film. If you see Chaplin's pre-silent images, you'll get humor. <br /> <br /> It is recommended for fans of Mel Brooks.
