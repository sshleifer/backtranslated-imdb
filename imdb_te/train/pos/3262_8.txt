Though some things are disturbing, I do not think I can enjoy more. I said, if you do not see ... you have to know for yourself. However, there is no image of Robert Downey Jr.'s puppy-dog eyes? All in all, the plot has been developed adequately. Nothing seemed to be moved much, as there are movies like this. The characters are like-ability, and it has plenty of delightful scenes. Moreover, this story is very well connected, although some things are unsatisfactory, even in the opinion of the opinion. As I said earlier, it is difficult to love any movie with Robert Downey Jr.
