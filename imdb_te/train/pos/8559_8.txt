There is a particular genius behind this film. I smile all over. The scene in the phone sex office, discussing how Dopeldagger's love is a good effort at this genius / joke. Execution is poor, but you can see the author's message and they have some talent. Finally, it seems like the DopingGangger split ... "Well, it's not a lot of expectation, but let's see what the movie says". Definitely ridiculous, but it is a sweet idea and very coherent in a strange way. <br /> <br /> Do you have a logical picture or communicate at an entertaining or emotional level? <br /> <br /> I think some of these stories have some autobiographical roots, but it's just an estimate. Terrible evil, but good. I'm looking for other people who made this person (with more experience).
