This movie is good for TV. I like this because I'm a huge fan of disaster films, though this family movie. From the book the accuracy of the film was half and half they got the names of the characters but there was no storm hunter in the book, participated by the hatch family from the tornado car scene book not participated by Don Hatch and his friend with a police officer going to the police station for safety. And Dan and his friend are at the age of 12. Thats all I feel like. Overall this is a good movie. This is a bit more accurate in the book. Do you know the book based on the true story of tornado rows that devastated a small Nebraska town in 1980?
