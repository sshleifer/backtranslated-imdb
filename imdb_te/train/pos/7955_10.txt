This is one of the greatest pets ever created. I cried every time I was sleeping "Wait, Peter Wait for Me!" Family car pulled away. If you love animals, you must see! Best Movie Ever! The lines in this picture are sometimes stupid. Like Sassy Chance says; "Cat's Rule and Dogs Drull!" I was able to do such lines, but I love that line at the age of six. Hookie can feel some of the storyline, but I like it. The old dog-like shadow who really is willing to take for her when he's thinking about it is really moving. It reminded me of my childhood dog. I think everyone can find a piece of themselves "homeward bound."
