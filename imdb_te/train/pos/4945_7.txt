It is a complex image to classify "10 items or less". Generally, I do not care about defining genres, but you want to keep it in a particular category, with a single word, and your feelings about it. I would recommend this film to anyone and you really enjoy the movies and enjoy life if you want to do it immediately after you finish watching it. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie, but I should not make a noise on the contrary, but Writer / director Brad Silberling knows exactly what he's doing when he writes this inspiring script, I'm sure he will achieve a product that is not perfect: a product that is simple, enthusiastic and unlikely as its title. <br /> <br /> Silberling, the director of the long, complicated and dramatic films like "City of Angels" and "Moonlight Mile", proves to be "70 items or less", ending in just 70 minutes, A worker in a nurse's shop (Morgan Freeman) and a place where a normal life takes place Be sure to take them to the right. <br /> <br /> I do not tell you anymore because there is a thought provoking apparently lacking in simplicity. , Directly focuses.
