After High School graduation, Best Friends Alice and Daleen decide to travel to Thailand. When they're there, they meet Nick, a lovely Australian guy. After spending some time with Nik, he wants to take a weekend trip with Hong Kong. They agree. While at the airport, they get busted for 33 years in Thai prison for something that was busted for drugs smuggling and something they did not have. They do not really know what they end up contacting an American attorney who lives in Thailand with Yankee Hank, his wife. The word has a word that he can help you if you have money. <br /> <br /> This film is great, but they can not come out yet. <br /> <br /> This image is great. I can not believe if the end. You do not know 100% of the truth, but you still know what happened with Nick and drug trafficking because 'owning' etc. <br /> <br /> Claire Dance and Kate Beckinsale give great performances here. Beckinsal performance is very weak. The friendship of Danes and Beckinsal's characters was good but it seemed good. Paul Walker also has a little useless role here. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Brookdown Palace is a good movie and I've given it 7/10.
