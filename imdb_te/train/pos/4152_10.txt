In the years that began with the Season 1 Episodes, which began in the 2003-2004 season, I have seen quite a few case episodes. While many are good, this particular episode is not the best, but has some opponents in the Emmy's circles. While some do not agree with the content of the story (i.e. male males from the male), it is doubtful that nobody can see anyone moving deep into their soul. <br /> <br /> This story is basically a re-opened case based on evidence from a dying drug dealer. These two central actors have been the police officers by the 1960s Sean Cop (the name of Copenhagen) and his partner Jimmy Bruno. <br /> <br /> In the story, the Cope single, Vietnam War vet, is deeply troubled past. Nevertheless, Jimmy was married, and the children were small. Both form the secret secret relationship that escapes from a deeper and legitimate homosexual culture, rather than a partner and friend on police forces. <br /> <br /> The flashbacks of their lives are mostly black and white, now sprinkled with bits of color and throughout. In examples, their red team, yellow curtains blowing gently in Jimmy's bedroom, Jimmy's wife fought with Kopp and Jimmy's drink, and then kisses one by one with a sparkling state. With only the black and white everything I chose, the flashback scenes were in color. <br /> <br /> Apparently, the relationship between fellow petrol officers and the two central actors increases the severity of the episode. Jimmy's baby's baptism was a key emotional scene when his father faced anger. In this scene, the coworker's father, Sargez, faces a cooperative role in the rumors surrounding Kopis's relationship with Jimmy, a respected co-official. Sorry for the anger, "You are not going to insult our family ... you're not my son," because the shame and disgrace of the brothers' father accumulated on Copen. <br /> <br /> There is also additional tension in the police locker room after being called a colleague and Jimmy "Karp" and "Jimmy". Batman and Robin Homos ". <br /> <br /> The relationship between Cope and Jimmy shows that he wants more of Jimmy in his life. <br /> <br /> Jimmy is to his devotion to his wife and children, his church, Tension in Jimmy's face can be seen once in the choice between the commitment between the two. <br /> <br /> Finally, Jimmy, he had both the Cop and his family at the same time Kopel was murdered because of his relationship with Zimmel, but Cop was also killed for his understanding of drugs money and police corruption. <br /> <br /> The most moving scene was when he died from gunshot wounds in his team car, Silently spoke on his last words in the police radio: "Jimmy ... we are lucky. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack is the best choice for episode. <br /> <br /> I have enjoyed the last scene with Chad Everett, who has been so much older with Jimmy, and his former partner, Copen, is not yet clear. Good. It's very well written, well-played, and without doubt the absolute doubt of all the cold-case episodes I have ever seen.
