I really liked this movie. I've read some other comments, and I'm reluctant to those who do not understand, and I agree with some criticism. This is, in a strange way, this film makes me more. I agree that I have done pretty well to remake an intellectual film to the general public, and it is still quite a lot and is still good to see. Many movies, theories, possible conclusions and secret subtitles can be provoked, and I love these movies too. Mr. Crow, congratulations on my top ten. <br /> <br /> When I first appeared in the Backpack in Mexico, it was late at night, and I went back to my hotel and had a big mental tour! Where is the end of the dream and the real start?
