The Last Hard Men's James Coburn expelled the long-term penalty for free retirement from the chain gang. He and his friends make head for the Mexican border from jail and security. The work of Coburn's vengeance is because they are not. <br /> <br /> That peace officer Charlton Heston retires now and finds out what is after Coburn. When he describes his daughter Barbara Hershey, Coburn fell into a sack and participated in a stamp like Waco. His Indian woman fired bullets killed in hail. <br /> <br /> He cares for us for Cobber, and we know him very much as a bad man. Heston is his typical fortune hero, but his performance in The Last Hard Men goes to James Coburn. He wounded everyone on the screen when he was. <br /> <br /> Heston sees Cobern Hershey kidnapped by her and carrying her to Indian reservation unable to touch him with white bosses. <br /> <br /> The cobbler's gang, Morgan Paul, includes Thalmus Rossula, John Quaye, Larry Wilcox and George Rivero. <br /> <br /> Last Hard Men is an evil and ruthless Western. I've been thinking that it might be a project for Sam Peckinpow, directed by Andrew McLoughlin. The liberal use of slow motion to increase violence is quite accurate in its effectiveness. It's too much. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
