I want to see for a long time this time, James Meredino is a great director. SLC Punk was one of my favorite films, and I thought it was great after the first ten minutes of the film, and it started pulling. Acting and directing are excellent. In fact, everything in this film was a flaw in the script. At times, I have to keep my focus, the cast is the most beautiful woman in the world, Claire Fours. The film was good, but I hoped more. <br /> <br /> See great characters by Chris McBride, and Chris McDonald.
