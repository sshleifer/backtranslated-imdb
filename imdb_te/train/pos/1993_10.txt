This is music adaptation of Donner's "Oliver Twist". Most of the story, carried out the original story, though the film has been abandoned by some subblaters (summer he recovered and half brother spent). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> It's a type of music - its style and range is not really before or even completed. The songs are often very singing and memorable, but a scene to observe the choreography of the film. Although many people in many music or choreographer dance are dancing, the numbers are often hundreds or even higher. It's really a vision to watch and it's lucky enough to be seen in the theater at the beginning of the play and one of my early childhood memories. After looking back a few moments ago, the movie is only good over time. Great sets, excellent acting and singing - it's a special treat, it's not loving. <br /> When I see this movie again today, how much more and feminine is the image of Marc Lester's singing. Well, according to IMDb, his singing is a girl dubbing and this is definitely the account for his voice.
