It's okay, but not as good as TV version. Actors are usually alright but I compared the Mark Strong in the TV version, notably Mr. Knightley, rather than Jeremy North. Gwyneth Paltrow OK and her English accent is pretty good but again, I prefer Kate Beckinsale's Emma. <br /> <br /> This script is a comedy, but there are so many set-pakser dresses, and the Frank Churchill subplot is almost absolutely not. <br /> <br /> My big criticism is the scene. It's very lush. England has never been like this. It looks like a chocolate box. <br /> Despite these criticisms, I enjoyed this movie but would recommend it to be more favorable to the TV.
