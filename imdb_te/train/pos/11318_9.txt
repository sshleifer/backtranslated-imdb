It is a great haunting and powerful Italian adaptation of James M. Coin's novel The Postman Always Rings Twice, which is directed by the great lyricist Visconti. What's more interesting about the film is that it crosses on every subject's subject and becomes more original (interestingly, Camus is the key inspiration for his milestone The Stranger's Kais's novel). The film has more power and intensity than the novel, because the Visconti Cain narrative can create an artwork's paradigm, but the gender conversation is more complex. Cain's most American novel was critically acclaimed (the main character Kora is a Mexican and is married to her Greek immigrant), which serves Visconti in the Italian rural context. This allows the middle class and dance to be on the edges of the emotional and doomed love affair of the two main characters. This film is a complicated, sublime, gift feel.
