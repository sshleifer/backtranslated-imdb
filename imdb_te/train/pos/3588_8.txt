I saw this film, I was surprised that it was just a TV movie. I think the film should be in theaters. I have seen several films that have been raped, but this is the same. The film has a real reality that is rarely seen today, which only separates TV movies. I am saying that many of the rape victims in smaller towns today are very real, and I realized that it is very believable (it is difficult to find other rape centers). I also thought that Tiffany Thyssen and Brian Austin Green were excellent in the episodes they played. For anyone who absolutely enjoys movies that have a bit of a tough reality for those who recommend this film. I enjoyed it very much.
