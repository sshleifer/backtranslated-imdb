I'm totally surprised to have canceled this show. It lasted only a year. I started looking at it recently and I liked it.It was a program that went to friends until it was gone.It is humorous and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Two brothers and 2 sisters live in a single home without their parents. Kurt (Joey Lawrence) is part of the older sister and plays the father role. <br /> <br> It lasted longer than a year ago. Excellent performance with all the best actors. <br /> <br />
