Yamamoto's 1999 film was rebuilt with the same title as Udi Yamaguchi (Battlefield Baseball) and Junichi Yamamoto "Meetball Machine". I suspect I get the chance to see the original, so I am commenting on this. What is "Metball Machine"? Now it's a good effect on the laughing low budget industry pitcher flick and the gore. If you do not end up writing books, it's fun if you make this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> "Meetball Machine" follows a well-known plot. The boy loves the girl but is not afraid to ask her at the date. The boy finally meets the girl. Girl gets infected with a parasitic alien creature that turns her into an offensive cyborg. The boy is transformed as he says subject matter, and goes on a quest to save his love. Can he succeed? <br /> <br /> The plot is simple and quite extensive, but it sets the course of the film that leads to a bloody confrontation. Among the two popular characters. The infected parasite focused on how they got their lives. And it's very fortunate to show more violence. I'm happy. Acting will expect you to publish any budget publish image. This is not exactly bad for the ears, but it is not good. <br /> <br /> Apart from violence and gore, the film's main attraction is cyborg models. Who is well known by Keeta Amemiya who is working on creating foreigners' creatures and outfits for both movies and video games. Necroborgs look stunningly detailed as they are known in the "metabol machine". The breathtaking combination of meat and metals without the design of CGI Am√©mia is a painful miracle in their appearance. Different parts of the body transforms into cool weapons such as saws, rocket launchers, blood-shot shotguns and so on and so on. <br /> <br /> "Mets Ball Machine" is "Tetsuo the Iron Man", which is a "alien", a low-budget and extra ketchup mode. It's a weird entertaining film that denies modern special effects and proves that the publishing genre is still alive and kicking.
