There are many things for this movie. It's a "feel good" story. Characters and actors preferred, realistic and present fine performances. It is very important, I believe, Dennis knows how to capture Quaid and throw a baseball. Robert Redford "threw the bat, swinging on the trail" and Kevin Costner made "Best Durham" in "Game's" and "Bull Durham". "Major League," Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen <br /> Although baseball films and stories may be of interest, such defects are provided. Jimmy Stewart is credited as a professional baseball player in "Stratone Story" and "Strategic Air Command", as well as a high-weight, non-athletic, (eg, Garre Cooper, in Gaehrug, Grover Cleveland Alexander and Don Deally as Dan Daily) Demonstrated the ability, in the final rounds "pick-up" a game on Sunday's vacation (Though Coode, and your uncle). <br /> <br /> The scenes of Quid's high school team, his efforts with the Devil race, and the two smaller leagues with him and those who are playing in the American League, all the rings are real. Participants are reliable and capable. In addition, he is an attractive actor who always plays a talented and appropriate role. (Except for Dream, his "over the top" scenes and his forced slap, in the role of Jerry Lee Lewis). But he is exactly where it is, and the film is good or "good", rather than any other style of the genre, as "9 is natural".
