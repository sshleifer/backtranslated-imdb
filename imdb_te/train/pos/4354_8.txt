I watched this Palm at 2005 Palm Springs International Festival and I reached # 4 of the 14 films I saw there. The 900+ theater was completed and in the end it was appreciated. If you're a Falk fan, this is a classic Peter Faulk if Peter Falk and Paul Riser perform a lot of chemistry between the characters. The title of the film has made me a long and very strange sound. I'm surprised that it did not do this in normal release. The main studios are much better than the wastes you throw. Probably the most grown it is the baby boomer and the senior audience. Many people have a relationship with the scenes in this film. This is probably a revival of some years from now when people look back at this picture and consider the type of a gem. I will rate this 8.0 to 8.5 in 10 scale and will definitely recommend it.
