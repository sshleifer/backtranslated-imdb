Richard Dix decided to retire and, as a result of Ted Nicholas, Michael Dewune met his character Alice Duopers Barclay, (Lonor Abert), a young girl. The couple knew only two days and they decided to get married by a peace judge (judge) and they pulled the judge's house and he was not home and the next day. As you are inside the house, you lift up their car hood and take the automobile from the engine. If you see this event, the couple will realize that the story is a big surprise and the story reveals a very mysterious event surrounding humans Alice Barkley and poor Ted Nicholas is getting plenty of trouble and marriage. Good mystery, but I miss Richard Dix. Enjoy.
