Version: Universal / Hong Kong Legends R4 DVD release. <br /> Once five years ago, I was engaged with 'The Matrix' in the world and at some age of fifteen I was still better than Terminator '' Matrix ''. I was a good teens boy but for a good action movie, and then I did not see much on TV station, a small station called SBS. One night I saw Jacky Chan - movie 'Police Story' in the next TV Guide. Fifteen, as I only saw 'Rambole in the Brooks' and 'Rush Hour', I said ... "Wow is awesome" and sitting on it to see it, and continually shouting "Wow Awesome". Two weeks later, after showing the SBS 'Police Story' trilogy, I learned that I found my new favorite actor. <br /> <br /> Jackie plays the role of Cham Kai Kui in the role of a Hong Kong police. , Chu (Yuen Chor). Chu secretary, Celina Fong (Brigitte Lynne), was arrested as a witness against Chowk and Chan appointed to save her. <br /> <br /> 'Police Story' is one of the best action films, and definitely one of my favorite jockeys. Chan images. It starts strong and ends one of the most exciting action scenes ever shot. Everything is great in the middle. However, some funny episodes appear to be a little flawless than some. <br /> <br /> Strangely, this is still one of the best efforts of Jackie. This story is great for the action movie, and Jackie is a better actor than he is acting & plot intensive 'New Police Story'. It's not 'wonders', but it's a good thing. <br /> <br /> 'Police Story' is one of Jackie's finest works. This made me hook up on Jackie Chan films, and would have a good start for any jockey fans. 10/10 - The bad news for anyone who saw this did not make Jacky Chan movies in good shape
