In 1979, I was a 12-year-old boy, and my parents had a pretty new home box office for our neighbors. As a 12-year-old boy, I have seen breasts on television for the first time. I will never forget those times. Racing vans, garbage van, water cot, herbal smoking, hot 70 chicks, and my chewy van song makin love with the whole donkey and it's very new to me. A complete picture of all the memories you expect. I own and enjoy about it for about a year. When I watch this movie, I get 4 wheels to get my skittles, not on the straight line, but to go to the park and help me hunt some kids with regulatory hair. Great memories of young adolescence!
