If you see the definitive life of boxer James Corbett, it's not a movie for you. The famous boxer received "Hollywood-Size" in the 1940s of his life - it's a lot more entertaining and surreal fantasy than real life. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn's Guy Ninties-Your Boxer James "Gentleman Jim" Corbett - became the world boxing champ in 1892. The film went from his humble beginnings and won the title match against John L. Sullivan and followed him in his career. Nevertheless, despite its focus on matches, the film is relatively small (except for the final title match) and his relationship with Alexei Smith, who co-starred with Corbett's brush persona. Throughout the film, casting of superb supporting actors (such as permanent assistant actor Alan Hale in Flynn's films) and writing helped make these people alive. <br /> <br /> This is particularly good about the film, watching Athleticism as Flan's bunker. There were a few doubles of shots, almost all of the boxing scenes were Flynn and he did an acceptable job as a pugilist. It is a good departure for Flynn, usually portrayed as "pretty boy" characters or Swissbuckler, and shows how tough the character is. To learn more about this, try to read his biography - a very harsh and confusing character before he came to Hollywood. <br /> Now for Real James Corbett, you will not be afraid to learn how 'the film is not accurate. First, Corbett is not a poor man from a poor man, but college education and bright. Second, when he got Alexis Smith at the end of the film, they divorced a few years later. Third, the fairy-hearted scene in the film between Sullivan and Corbett is perhaps the best part of the film, Sullivan is a jerk and it never happened - in fact, Sullivan is more liberal and carbot fat - they have starred in the film - even though it's a lovely movie.
