I became a fan of the TV series `Homeside: Life on the Street ', which was completed in the show, but was quickly became a fan. It is a police display rather than any other type: contrary to the use of hand-held cameras, the viewer is everywhere, multinational and triangular cast and their diverse and attractive people, and its good and bad police department, including the corruption and personality conflicts that bubble up to the surface. <br /> <br /> Homicide: The Movie, the sequel to the series, is good for television movie. Lefty. After Giardé (YafeTto Côte), the Baltimore mayor is now filmed, and the cast members help find a killer. In addition, actors who have left strength and death will get their place in the film. Series Return marks intensity and fire, and the script series bristles with the same fire mark. For all, an amazing TV movie. <br /> <br /> Vote: 9
