I chose this picture in my local library. After watching the director at the Film Festival at the end of last year, I was interested in "checking" her work. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The film looks fresh and up-to-date with love, dislikes, friendships, jealousy. It is a bit tady at times, but always sinks the film. <br /> <br /> The love story in this film is low, and I enjoyed the love story with the characters that meet the ones who are perfectly "falling" in one of the "love" <br /> <br /> The film and the average low-budget shoot-m 'black up image is very different. Check it out. If you're lucky, your copy will come with a copy of a soundtrack like mining. Good cargo!
