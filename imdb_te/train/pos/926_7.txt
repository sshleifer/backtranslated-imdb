<br /> <br /> This is a major, funny show - the mainstream time is probably not the right thing, but still ... <br /> The family dynamics are funny, and everything you see in a very funny show. Supporting characters are absolutely fun. Individual parts plot and often Siegfried & Roy Jackets are just above average, but you often have sub-plot or a liner, you will be laughing on the floor. <br /> <br /> I paid for the performance of 8 pounds. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8/10
