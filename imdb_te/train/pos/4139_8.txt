I'm U.K. And I'm really surprised to see how this show plays in the rest of Europe. This is SELF-LOATHING about an American (especially white Americans). This may be a big reason for some of the poems and cartilage expressed on this board. I love the performance but with some reservations and I feel the easiest way through the spoiler spoiler: <br /> <br /> At the end of the second season crash and burning everything. In the middle of a few farmers, the door closed with hopes to restore Julie's appearance, except for her role on a haystack. Who knows? It's a funny, rare and occasional, terrible appearance.
