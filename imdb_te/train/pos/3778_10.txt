The first film is somewhat rare on the screen. The bad version of 'Back to the Future' with zero appeal. <br /> <br /> When Bill and Ted were accepted as nitwits, it was only a joke to the audience long before the break. <br /> It's a surprise. This is your unique spoiler warning ... <br /> According to today's standards, it is fun. This is much sharper after release, and has more intelligence than the first time. <br /> <br /> We are getting a photographer of 'Face / Off', the designer of the designer 'Fugitive' and 'Matrix' from Burton's original work. <br /> <br /> The authors for their depth are outing with something first deep. As the fanbase and the fall backward by the public, the director probably decided that the style was too intense. This is not the case, it's enough. Like 'Death Becomes His' and 'Catch-22', this courage is smart, but we do not buy our movies because it's "normal". Perhaps it would cause 12 producers to remove it if it was dumped. <br /> Nice self-reference towards Keane; From the storm to the messenger. <br /> See also Arnold Schwarzenegger. <br /> <br /> Jazz hates his creator, hates his opponents, and makes his own hatred. Evil B & T and "good robot usses" have the same vocabulary as their original: low copies and depreciation of language. <br /> <br /> "Duality" is the motif. It does not know much about photography styles, higher and lower angles. <br /> <br /> They can also use Roy Bros Smith from "Total Recall". <br /> - "options" motif. I do not know where this style (probably 'Ghostbusters') was started, but it's very well used here. <br /> <br /> There is also self-reference in the game against Death (Clue). It is smarter than Tarantino or Brooks. At the end of the premiere magazine cover note: "Bill and Ted: The Movie." <br /> <br /> Death and Nomolls are the villains in the "Die Hard" and "Lethal Weapon" sequels. Music and film are different media, and so many lipsticks revolve around - especially there is no meaning in the teen market. Carlin is a great comedian, but he is ruined in these films. <br /> <br /> Although it is like a nickelodeon product, it is very interesting. We've got Beavis and Butt-Head in this movie. "We're in Heaven and we have tricked us into three people." <br /> Final Analysis == Mirrormann Material
