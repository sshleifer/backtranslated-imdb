Do you really like the comedy that you've invented, or if you love "wedding crushers", if the second one reads it in response. I can not believe that this movie is not high rated. Meadows usually plays a role rather than Austin Powers. There are very sophisticated moments in this Gogaramama. From the brutality - Leone was deceived into feeding the former boyfriend, playing himself on the porch. . Oh! Good. Inspired stupid-clown, broadway simple, voice over. Meadows is great as childish, but very sweet-looking Lyon. Some great lines are "Wong Does Not Blame" "Freak Dickie Sex World" too. . . Why this movie is not a huge one is a mystery. Great comedy.
