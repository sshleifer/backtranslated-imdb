The Dirty Harry series began with a very complicated police action, and soon came to light for "Magnum Force". By the time surrounding "The Informer", Dirty Harry is a bit more than a television cap show (only saved by Tyne Dalley). After a seven-year break, Dirty Harry finally went back to his roots. <br /> <br /> At this time, Don Seegel's first clinic is Eastwood's first well-directed Harry film, which helps significantly. Harry is once again a dark character, and he's not a nice cop guarded by him. He once again "tell me, make my day" and really mean things like that. "Sudden Impact" is a real dirty Harry sequel. <br /> <br /> "Doctor" should never. <br /> 10 to 7.2
