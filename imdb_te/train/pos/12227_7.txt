I searched for the best work of Ariasia Silverstone in the film "Careless" (1995), which made me happier and linguistically challenged when she started her film career. "True Crime" has Kevin Dillon, which should help improve movie projects too. Actually the cast is a good job for everyone. The only disappointment I have for the movie is that it starts with a school adventure in the tunnel and comes from the need to run a very uncompromising, grown up theme with some awkward "feel". /> <br /> Alicia Silverstone This is a beautiful. Mary Giordano influences her innocent excitement and growing discontent against the truth behind her serial killings. I consider MG to own its role as well as its mileage. In accordance with the story, she goes to work in law enforcement. It is of interest to the old Silverstone to visit Giordano during the crisis after the officer's life. <br /> <br /> "True Crime" shows its director in good light. Pat Wark also has a credit credit. I do not know any other movie film. <br /> <br /> Bill Nun (Detective Jerry Ginn) is rare, and it is a very unknown support like most productions. It seems that he has been able to enjoy the impressive number of screen shows in the last decade. I recently saw him in "Carriere" (1998), designed for a TV show with a military background. Bill Nun played "Captain Arenades". Fans of the classic US TV comedy show "Who Is the Boss" may also be interested in "carriers", as recollected by many as a result of her long engagement with the leading player Judith Lite. "True Crime" could not work easily, but it does OK. I think it is a worthy entertainment story I watch.
