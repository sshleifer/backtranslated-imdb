This is probably the best of Star Wars films. <br /> <br /> The opening point of the film is the episode IV - the ideas of the location of the cabaret music and the cabaret space, where the intensity of the mob jabba hut is even more intense. He ordered Luca to die in a basement pit of Bantha's bone-suppressing teeth, who looked like a cross between a bear and a shark. Luke's Jedi powers finally ended the monster. <br /> <br /> When Jabba was so angry about it, Luca was sentenced to die at the Sarkock Pitt outside, with the addition of the honey solo's mysterious rescue at the end of Episode V. <br /> <br /> Star Wars "Bad Guys", especially R2-D2, have other ideas ... and those other ideas intercepted Luca's death penalty; In the end, many of the soldiers of the jabber died and the Prince of Lia forces used the power to kill Jabba. <br /> As in episode IV, Death Star makes its appearance in episode VI. When I analyzed the rebel planes that attacked the Imperial Warriors around Death Star, the Star Destroyer crew, I raised the main laser's weapons, used the imperial warriors as a routine. 20-25 star destroyers were ready to attack, but surprised the laser weapon on the Death Star. Once fired, the only hope of rebellion was that the Death Star's delicate shield was demolished, and that he wanted to destroy Death Star, but Shield could not be removed. <br /> <br /> Like in episode V, Imperial Walkers have demonstrated their horrible performances with their two cannons, at least one of them has been killed in Evoaks ... but Ewox is still the most unusual way to deal with ancient ones. For example, Chebbae, as well as another Evok, used logs (and used to remove one of the walkers), and the other Ewox used logs to knock down two walks. </ P> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> <p> It's awesome that Luke can do what he can do with his Jedi forces in his Light Saber, for example, in the view of Endour, a storm with a storm trooper from the laser shots from a fast bike. Or, in a climax, Saber uses Saber to break his own father's arm in the final Saber fight with Saber Wader. After death star storm, Evox was known for celebration, (eg, storm trooper masks) drumming, and Luke finally met Leah after Lion's own foe --- Darth Vader, after a dead, burned on a pyre . I think it's not that Euclass was singing at this ceremony but Lucas did not buy it - I feel like John Williams's strong respect for the film composer. <br /> <br /> In home film version, Lucas thinks he needs another end. In addition to the celebration on Endor, he also painted scenes of celebrations on many of the surviving planets, including a celebratory laser shot that destroyed the Sitting Statue. The Ewoks song was replaced by an alternative instrument piece. With the devastation of Death Star, he wanted to do extra things to prove that the balance was restored to rebellious galaxies.
