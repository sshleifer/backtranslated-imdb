Ghost Story (The TV Movie - 1972) pilot for the NBC series. The film was well-written and well-established, and the 1972-73 TV season began with NBC being the winner of the TV series if it was half good. (I wish this movie is available for the video !!) The series is a great disappointment - even with William Castle. Producer. However, check if you have the opportunity to watch the original TV movie, Ghost Story. Do not be disappointed.
