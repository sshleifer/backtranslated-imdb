In fact, Dudley Moore was seen as a solo vehicle, not only 'but only ...' but his former 'Beyond the Fringe' collaborator guest Peter Cook first saw the show, and the audience was well-controlled BBC2-the controller since then. They are a classic comedy band - Cook is long, beautiful and witty, dudley is small, attractive, musically awesome. The sketch that brought home brought them to the pub, wearing flat caps and muffles, hypocritical about movies like Jane Russell and Grata Garbo. <br /> <br /> It is one of the hymns of all ages, and cooks are still living together. Idiot Pete and even-Big Idiot Dudder - The appearance of each episode in the episode is appropriate, in a different setting, such as a zoo or an art gallery. In the next period, they are sandwiches when discussing artworks. "That Leonardo da Vinci cartoon ... I did not see joke!" Dud said. Pete pointed out that when it was first it probably had laughter people. Dude strikes on his repet. "You really enjoy those sandwiches!", Ad libs cook. The couple broke their humor to each other so happy. <br /> <br /> Before the arrival of 'Monte Python', comedy and standards have produced the new standards. <br /> <br /> The quality of the guest actors increased well because of the popularity of the show. For example, Peter Sellers, and John Lennon, is the subject of his poem 'Def Ted, Danuto, & Me'. 'One Leg To Fue' - The Dude came as 'George Spigott' (the name used by the film 'Bedazzleld'), a film man who hops into filmmaker Cook's office, 'Tarzan' for audition for the role. Cook tries to make him as good as possible. "I have nothing against your right leg!" "He said. "The problem is - what you have!" <br /> <br /> <br /> In an interview with Dundee, the extraordinary Sir Arthur would have been thinking about the start of Streeb-Greebling (Cook), who does not teach him the underwater fly ravens. 'The Frog & the Peach' is a restaurant. Another classic 'The Leaping Nunes' (also reused in 'Bedzed'). But my all-time favorites are the unfortunate funny (and precise) simulator of 'Thunder Bird's' by 'Superstarstars', Gerry and Sylvia Anderson. Pete and Dude played all the roles, and the next 'Lady Penelope'. Ludwig van Beethoven's 'The Is Is Jones' style has appeared in a variety of shows. 'The Immortal Bargo' is a robbery documentary in the life of 'Reckless Movie Star' Emma Borgo. In one unforgettable moment, she's bellowing through a loudhailer, by London, "I want to be alone!": Ronnie Barker, Spike Milligan likes 'Poets Corner'. , Barry Humphries, Willie Rushton and others were suspended on a gun tank. They each got the poorest of the line of a verse, and to make it wound up in the poem nasty stuff. In all three of the failures, the product (at different times) was made by Joe McGrath Dick Clement and Jimmy Gilbert. Very few editions of sin exist. To make matters worse, scripts are also destroyed. <br /> <br /> The show ended in 1970. Comics later broadcasted Broadway's hit 'Derek & Clive' tapes, but Cook's frequent alcohol consumption broke them. . Eight years later, Cook announced that it was in a new series offing, but it turned out to be a wishful idea on his part. His former partner has made films in America, and does not intend to work again with Cook (at any time). <br /> <br /> The BBC's early 90's are adequately footage. As expected, some items are not kept as well as others. Cook died in 1995, and a tribute to B.B.C's various 'Parkinson' interviews and 'Not Only ... but also' accompanied by a program editing from the shows. It ended with Pete and Dude finding themselves in Heaven. "Bloody Hell!", The other was surprised. Moore passed in 2002.
