"Doy Do Ka Den" is the first color of Master Akira Kurosawa, and surprisingly not about sourisires, ranins, warlords or warlords. It is located in a slum in Tokyo with very poor people, where residents include drinkers, beggars, trumpets, misused women and losers. I do not know why Kurosawa chooses this tragic background and environment to paint, but they are very tragic stories, some of which are heartbreaking. I personally dream of a child's story and his dad's house and his father built by them; The retarded boy story he believes is the pilot of trains; The story of a man who makes five children as their own sons and daughters; And the story of a young woman who misused her stepfather. <br /> The title (Brazil): "Doddekenden ?? a camino da vida" ("Dysked Dengue" The Way of the Life ")
