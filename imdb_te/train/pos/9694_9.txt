I was not surprised by this touching and hilarious portrait. I was also surprised to hear Pali's voice by Jey Mohar. This performance was well cured, pushing into schmaltz or becoming too tight under New Jersey's swagger, I thought this should be some smoked old pro, not Mr. Mohr faced by the baby. Very impressive performance, indeed, and his talent is delightful to see the aggressiveness taken seriously in the string of indie films.
