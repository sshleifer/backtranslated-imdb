First explaining what makes me a great image. I do not know what comes next but I'm thrilled with the first time I see the movie (case: point). Good humor (John Candy at Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors), better resolution (Madeline and Matilda), speculative storytelling (all Star Wars episodes-George Lucas MAN), and good music (again all Star Wars episodes, Wizard of Oz, Sound of music). What about watching a movie at least six times in my theater and buying DVD or VHS tapes? Characters. I said, I'm cindy la hue and the grin. Excellent performance Taylor Momsen and Jim Carrey. The rest of the cast is very good, especially Jeffrey Tomber, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Christine Barnsky, and Josh Ryan Evans. But every scenario with Cindy and Grinch is amazing and very funny and / or heart. In this movie, Cindy Lou is my favorite character and why the movie is better than a cartoon. Grinch is a strong plot, good contradiction and a very good theme (I can not do it because I can not start). Jin is very funny as Keri the Grich - especially when he communicates with the syndicate. And music! Wow! Excellent music by James Horner I liked the selection and compositions of his instruments. Very good job Jim Carrie - I do not know you sing. Taylor Momsen! Oops! There is enough reason to see your voice picture at least once. Your Solo - Where Where You Are Christmas - Is It Really Sound Your Voice? Sounds like an F #? It is a pornography that is 7 years old (one of the best ways of pornography). Great work. This is the best work by a child I've ever heard in the movie. (Taylor von TrappÃ © kids - no small feat!). Now for actors. Jim Carrey was great, funny and surprisingly very sensitive (it really showed through his sights with Taylor Momsen). Taylor Momsen's unspoken expressions (one of the secrets to a good acting performance) is very strong- she really becomes Cindy Lou Who. <br /> <br /> ******************** ******************************************** ************************************** spoiler alert ************ ********* ***************************** ************** <br /> <br /> Examples: An expression when she first saw the Grinch. This was a classic quote ("You Are the The Man" and later Grinch Line "Da Da Da the Grinch", then covered up into the Sorter, protected by The Grinch). "The next response by Quote and the Grinch is great. <br /> <br /> When my favorite part of the film, called The Grinch Holiday Chemist, this scene was spoken by two good actors and one in their excellent dialogue ... Little Taylor Momsen Jim Carrey has his own piece of space, I hope to see Taylor Momsen in many movies. About £ (except for the feet and noses).
