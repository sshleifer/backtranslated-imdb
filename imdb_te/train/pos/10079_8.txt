In this beautiful movie I enjoyed the cinematography of China in the 1930s. The story is very simple. A bigger male actor wants to go to a young man in his art, where he has no surviving children. The faces of the actors are wonderful to see. The story tells the devotion and gratitude of those who treat them well and their desire is well cured. In this film, Opperas me Meruquin, Complain, and more sophisticated and complicated. The stories here are reminiscent of the kids remembering the story of Dickens. The plot is a bit predictable and a bit too sentiment for me but well worth the time to paint heroism, humanity, and history.
