I participated in this small product and bought me for my mum video when I was a match 8 at school. I loved it since then !! When I was younger, I appreciated the amazing performance and character patronage that I enjoyed when I saw it as I grew up with songs and wonderful dance sequences that I enjoyed. Oliver Reed and Ron Moody are good. I can not imagine anyone playing Bill Six or Fagin. Shani Wallis is the best character for me if Nancy. She gave a lot to those boys, I think she is such a strong character and her last scene ... Well, you know ... always shouting at me! Best of all time in my opinion of music. It lasted all the time, it will have to live for many years to come! 11/10 !!
