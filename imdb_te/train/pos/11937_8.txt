It was definitely done with the Angels in the Outfield. It was last night on TV and I believe I did not see the film from my second year in high school and I'm now in college my 4th year. While the film has many errors, you can not help but sitting, watching, and enjoying yourself. It is also hilarious. Danny Glover's ranking is just above you can not help but laugh at him loudly at the very moment. It adds to the image and the director desires exactly what he wants. Feel for the characters in the movie even though you're not really improving. Must see. <br /> <br />
