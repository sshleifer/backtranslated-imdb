Dark Comedy? Humorous calls? How does murder make a comedy? This is a risky business when audiences need their moral values ​​and laugh at the pranks of the person who killed the people. So, the story is solid rock with good dash of reality suspended in order to work. Therefore, the answer to Irish 007 for Pierce Brosnan is now a chain-smoker, sexually addictive addict, who kills people for lifestyle and has a life crisis. He meets struggling businessman Greg Kinnear, and at the beginning of a stone he finds his friend intentionally. But Greg Davis and Brosnan are happily married to him, he sees the basic things, love, house and life. Join the character actor, Philip Baker Hall as the Hitman Manager and we are away from the races. Brosnan is a brilliant cross and crude anti-hero and Kinnear's delightful counterpart, a very human businessman. Hope Davis Kinnearer adds lightning as their traditional wife, who attracts this deterioration in their lives. The ending is cheerful and with some surprise of it. Theater feel should at least be partially left out - if you are able to suspend the aghast when you kill people.
