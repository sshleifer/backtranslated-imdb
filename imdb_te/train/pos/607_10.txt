Perhaps I loved this movie a lot because I was feeling down in dubings and it's a lovely little fairy. Whatever the reason, I thought the pitch was perfect. Great, clever story, beautiful effects, amazing acting (especially De Niro, is awesome). <br /> <br /> This is a very fun, intelligent movie. The joke of the history and consequences of the history of prince cruelty, the magic and the dozens of magic touches me all the smart things that are smart. This is a lot of what makes it very good; <br /> <br /> There is an extensive, exclusive-influential laden film with more story than most fairy tale movies, and is of great interest in little things. <br /> I'm going forward and will see again.
