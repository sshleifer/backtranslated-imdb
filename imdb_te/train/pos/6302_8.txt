I and my lady have gone a little bit more to do an evening afternoon gone to see this, I like movies dealing with sleazy, losing roles and this em's done. After a slow start, there were some good moments from the cast, but the original 'Bellini' made both the film and the movie to be downloaded. 'Bellini' is one of the funniest scenes I have seen in the film for a long time, but it is very small and it's all 10 to 71/2 complete.
