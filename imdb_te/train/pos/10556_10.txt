I'm not sure what to expect but I'm glad I went to see this. A smart, slightly distorted comedy that you can think of. I'm not sure how a director can create "nothing", but I sent it to the amazing people at Mr. Natalie and C.O.R.E. To create another low budget set that looks real (there will be nothing like real). Well worth your time and money, if you have the opportunity to see this, please. You will be happy.
