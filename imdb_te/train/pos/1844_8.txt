It's just confusing going to be another night of soap operas, it's unclear, but it turns out, it's a pretty good show (not a little thanks to talented casting). Four friends with different backgrounds share weekly watches on their love-lives. An hour-long program separates each of them separately, often spewing their love to spray and is not boring or uncommon. Sharon Small's "Trudy" is a little preachy and annoying (her husband is a husband after September 11) with her friends (a little bit loosely and more creative in their trials). T.v. Small is looking back in because she is great in "Inspector Linley Mysteries". Chick can work. Orla Brady's role (Cioban, a lawyer) is probably very damaging, but women still have a lot of sympathy, with her kind struggles, self-absorbed husband Hari (Jaffer, formerly "Spooks") without her needs, regardless of her. A wild child who sleeps with anyone, not with each other, no gender, and Katie (Sarah Parrish) is a dead child who lives in a life planner and the life planner who sent her son to the life planner and effective jes (Shelley Con). That being said, I'm now hooked and hope that the BBC will continue to crank this series, because it's good, it's different and it got a great cast.
