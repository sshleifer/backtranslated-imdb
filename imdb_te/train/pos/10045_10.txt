We are talking about this movie for all of these films. Apparently this movie is not that bad or even people can not even talk to it about BOTHER. I personally enjoyed this film personally, and still do it! I'm not this movie for everyone, but it's a lot of touches on the hearts. <br /> <br /> For those who think this film is "overrated" or "over hyped" ... well, only to the people who are grateful to us! lol * You see, this is not the authors / essay authors of the movie's movie "heavy" or "hit". This film is very successful. With Titanic, everyone was afraid. Let's face this, never before. At least not really the kind of special effects needed to capture the fact that the ship sinks. The film is very clear, James Cameron is virtually drowning in the film, sinking in the real day of April 1912 and sinking. Silver is also good for goodness! <br /> <br /> Give this picture a break! Critics think this movie will sink BIG time! When the film is actually out and the people see it is a good / good / movie worthy film, everyone has moved to the theaters in droves to see the movie. ... not once, not twice, but 3 times more! So, I can not really say that this movie is "overhyped" ... at least for the MATRIX reload or the HULK is not as an increase for "overhyped". Ha! Critics did not even think Titanic could make enough money to take Cameron's biggest movie budget. However, movies have taken care of that 200 million budget and more! <br /> <br /> Personally, I love this movie. However, this film is not for everyone. Do not say that this movie is just sexy! The most sexist thing I have ever heard! It's a movie that is so sexy because it has a sex! The story is sweet. The dialogue may be good, but it'll be ... The real star of the film is Leo or Kate ... It's Gigantic Ship! I did all the good work for the actors, including DiCaprio and Winslet. It's not their best work (I've seen very good work from both of them) but I'm not seeing it on the front screen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
