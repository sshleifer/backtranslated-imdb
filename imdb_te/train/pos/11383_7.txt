One of these is one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and the lovely 'Parisian' atmosphere with a timeless score that is the best music, which gives the film a lot of charm, but in terms of a story it's not really that much. Or at least, not work well. Acting by Karen is not too soft. But I liked some of the dialogues, and I liked the scene in Sein, Levent and liked the role played by the colors; <br /> <br /> A 7.5 - 8 appears to me on the dot.
