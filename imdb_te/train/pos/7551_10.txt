The best animated film ever made. The film only affects the vast world of modern animation, but the branches of the human mind, soul and philosophy. In this story, when a sister dies, her younger brother dies and protects her body, but she is left without her soul when she is lit. So two sibling cats started a journey to find it. I'm talking about this journey for many things. The history of the world, the Bible, the cycle of life, and every time I find more hidden things and metaphors. If you do not come into its physical body, you worship it. The animation is amazing, and creative scenes will be added to the screen. For example, during the freezing of the sea, eating a soup from the ground, a strange and slightly SNM resume of Hansel and Gretel. Ultimately, the cat soup is a perfect dish for anyone. <br /> <br /> There is also no unwanted violence for children.
