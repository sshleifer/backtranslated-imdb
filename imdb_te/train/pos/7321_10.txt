Halloween is one of the best examples of independent film. It's well made and it has more emotional stuff than you realize at first glance. This is a simple picture that is quite simple. The music is perfect and this is one of the most haunting scores ... If you do not see this movie yet, you should check it out. The cast is all spectacular. After the sequel they never made a sequel. The first was the best and ended without the sequel. It was fun to see Jamie Lee Curtis in the film. She did not seem to be aged in age (she was just gorgeous today, without clothes and seventy clothes). The masked scenes are always one of the most terrible things!
