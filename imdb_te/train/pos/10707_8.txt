There was little publicity, and for a movie about some people, it's great. It is one of the modern British crime films quirky ("Snatch," "Sexy Beast"). It's not like "Snatch", but it's interesting and has some tough characters. <br /> <br /> It has a trumpet and a somewhat predictable finish but at the beginning of the show - not the last - the first time the viewer is very interesting. Generally, it's a low key British French male who sends away for a Russian "mail order bride", with the help of two Russian female friends, providing a big surprising couple. <br /> <br /> Ben Chopin and Nicole Kidman co-star, and Kidman's Russian teams, such as Vincent Cassell and Matthew Cassowitz, are very good. It's a different kind of film and good acting. Kidman once again proves she is far more than a pretty face.
