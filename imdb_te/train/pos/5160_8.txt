While Dr. McCoy and Mr. Spock were trapped in the last era of the planet, Captain Kirk was in the colonies of the same planet. Anyway, it's a long duet of the former duet. Apart from the freezing temperatures and sanctuary caves, one third resident is a beautiful and very sexy jarabat (Marithe Hart). While Spock spends most of his time in this era, he slowly revives his predecessor's behavioral patterns, feeling the natural attraction of Zarabat, leaving the place and throwing "warning to the wind". <br /> The character is one of the few occasions when it comes to showing some "emotions" and nimai (spock). Deepfiel Kelly (McCoy) is coming closer to dealing with Bezesses. <br /> <br /> Continuous "Old Man" Ian Wolf "plays the role of Mr. Atos," the librarian responsible for sending the trio in the past.
