Panic is a false little gem of a movie - think you have discovered through the first half hour only to realize, with great pleasure that the better author / director than Henry Bromell. <br /> <br /> The film is silent with a tremendous devastating scene. William H. Mackie, Donald Sutherland, Neve Campbell, Tracey Ulman, John Ritter, David Duffman as Macy's son, offers his lines if his lines are not completely untold. Rich and rewarding, this film will be with you for a while after the credits rolled.
