In 60 seconds, it was a very good action comedy film, which earned over $ 100 million but was destroyed by many critics. I personally think this is a great movie. The story is incredible and has the greatest cast ever to date, including 3 Academy Award winners such as Nicolas Cajamar, Robert Duvall and a very hot Azolina Jolie. At the end, it is a perfect blend of action comedy and drama, rather than a lure stunt. My score **** (from ****)
