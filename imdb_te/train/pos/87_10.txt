This academy can be ranked great in the award-winning short film genre. Without a dialogue, it is a visual medicine about a young man who bought a golden fish, putting him in a cup of love, leaves school, golden fish is unprotected and a window openly. Shortly afterwards, a neighboring orange tubec comes around, slowly heads for the window and bowl. Fish knows something that knows clearly and will be very excited. As the cat is very close to the bowl, the fish are jumps. The cat catches the fish and drops him back into the bowl and comes back to the boy if he does not know what happened. It is portrayed with marvelous creatures; Why did Costta explain these animals to behave in this way? I want to watch this movie for the people now; When I first appeared in 1959, I saw only one time, but it was unforgettable.
