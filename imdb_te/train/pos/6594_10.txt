Tweedy professor-sorts thought they all discovered it. Today's people living in Polynesia are migrating from the Asians, the Far East, the island from the island, the Tahiti in the east and the tropical islands of the southern Pacific, in thousands of years. But the realistic mindset is not well with young Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdal. If that explanation is true, how are those born in the islands and some people compared to tradition, arts and physical attributes rather than from Asia and South America? How can Ecuador, Peru and Chile have you found a thousand miles away? Is this just a coincidence, telling the Islanders to move into the sea in the direction of South America and tell them where their ancestors came from? Meanwhile, Norway is talking about the Snandavian ancestors, who have colonized from the South American continent, and some of the local peers put together on the western shore? Incidentally, heyardahl is a lot more. A wonderful mix of conventional rifle building, with a team of staff and local knowledge, begins the tour. This is a fictional science exhibition which is a long way in man's fiction, with the basic elements of such travel tools and semanics. The Oscar-winning documentary is dating with its voice and the Anglo-Ethonocentric mechanism, but it will fly with the best adventurous in the space program that began a decade later, because men test a theory that is considered by all. Wonderful. Help yourself and read the book first. It's a perfect set-up in the excellent Page-Turner and News-Reel-style film.
