Before I saw this film I heard a lot about it and some scenes in the film, but I do not listen to watching it and waving on Wow! Ned, Rony Cox, John Vaught and Burt Reynolds make up for an interesting group of people who are hell bent on canahing down the unfortunate series of events in the Cahulawassee River and all of them. The character developer takes some time in enveloping the viewer with good understanding of each person, but in the end you know these guys as they are your friend. Acting, the dialogue is very truthful, close to reality as you can get for Hollywood acting. Reynolds character "Louise" is very strong, but very soft and broken person (I am impressed with his performance!), A very cool and broken person who is very interesting in the role of Jon Voitt, in every unfortunate situation every corner and finally to him Sweeping (his character's transformation is fantastic River). Ned Betty and Ronnie Cox are really just joking around and look like silly lank heads who think they are most unlikely to be so bad ... They are really amazed at Billy's view of Dickey's novel, very impressed. You can not go all your life without seeing this movie. I gave it eight stars, and I was very impressed.
