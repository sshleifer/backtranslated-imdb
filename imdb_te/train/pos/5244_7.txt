"The Lady's Man" faces a common problem in movies based on "Saturday Night Live" skits. And if that is usually done within five minutes, a sketch can not do well in ninety minutes. Leon Pulpes, like Tim Meadows, sex abuse in the 70s, and wrestler-engaging husband by Ferrell Will Ferrell Lawn. So this movie is funny enough, but it's not "The World of Wayne"!
