Any movie that is emphasized by any kind of truth (one documentary) in mind, creates a negative and uneven amount of hatred, searching for any hints and truths that are not already understood, psychology of the soul, film and captains masters will find this movie to be repeated, know. <br /> <br /> For me, in the minority like me, I found "The Perth's Guide to Sinme" .... Movies, Psychology and Modern Philosophy <br /> <br /> Scott McQuds 'Understanding Comics' Such as director Sophie Finiels will speak about Slovene philosopher, psychologist, and many images and special scenes related to social critic Slavoj Zeiss Do not. The cover is from "The Birds" (a boat that takes a boat to rebuild Zizek Shot). <br /> <br /> Laconian psycho-analysis, a fun evening is not necessarily loud ... but it is! If you like movies .... Laconian mental-analyzing aid (symbolic, real, and imagery) will be thrown out for the first time, but Zizek's selected and analyzing scenes are exceptionally clear. In fact, it is better to have familiarity with the images he discusses than the vocabulary he used, which becomes evident in the film. <br /> <br /> I loved it, because this movie was a great way to explore or reveal great truths about Luckan, but in a very practical and clever approach to meeting the film and psychology (and the default philosophy) shows. <br /> <br /> To find out the mind from the "red resurrection", the planet of "solaris" is to do what "Psyche" and "The Max Brothers" do one another, Lynch torn to crash ... well Zizek has some ideas. The voice character in both "The Exorcist" and "Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith", I'm surprised when he enters pornographic sexuality ... Zizek says at one time that his idea is to decorate flowers, they are bored and Hiding from a child (ironically, it looks but ...). <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a lovely documentary that attempts to see someone at any time looking at a movie and thinks it's something more than literally suggested. <br /> <br /> Slavoj Zizek, this is much less dry than "Reality of the Virtual", and "Zizek!" Should be more direct than "other contemporary cultural criticisms of Elvis" about his other two fake docs, not the sex role in the film "The Perver's Guide to Cinema". Zizek argues that "it desires and does not want" because it is the only contemporary art form that allows these desires to be expressed. This is not a movie about finding reality in the movie, it's actually finding a movie and how important and exciting it is. It's hard to find, and a bit long, but worth the trouble, too I'm one of the most "stimulus" film watching the experiences I've had.
