It's not like the other movies about dancing. Some common people have found themselves from dance. Unlike dance movies in Hollywood, the characters in the film are neither pretty nor hot young. You can watch every day in your office. Some people are frustrated about their lives and will eventually find themselves and their dreams from dancing. It affects me deeply.
