I love Paul McCartney. He is, in my opinion, the greatest of all time. However, I did not get a ticket to the concert at Tacoma Dome during the back of the US tour. I was upset to say the least. Then I found this DVD. It's almost fine there. Paul is still man and I will enjoy this in years to come. <br /> I have a complaint. <br /> <br /> </
