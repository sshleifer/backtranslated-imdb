<br /> <br /> If you want to enjoy a pleasant feel with delicate humorous loads, you'll enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know why anyone will enjoy it. Take this: Dennis Hopper is a vehicle for confusion with your vehicle and you can laugh. It's not Shakespeare, but it's well done. Ericka Eleniak is totally beautiful and this one has her in - Baywatch better than any episode - and shows a knack for subtle humor. <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger is certainly worth the role of "Real Navy" and William McNamara is a great work as a great work. <br /> <br /> In this Sunday, Chase for Cherry throw a walk through Hopper in the middle of the chase and you got a movie that kept my eye and kept me laughing. <br /> I bought it right away when it's available. <br /> <br /> Brain candy.
