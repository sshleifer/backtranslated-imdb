Recently, I saw this film in Winnipeg - the right one, the place I used. I have read Laurence's book for the first time in 70 years, which is the most powerful film of aging tests in society. It resonates when I was younger, and it is now more resonant. When this film arrives, I have taken great care to see if this story is survived. And Ellen Bertstein's performance was totally impressed. Although the character is cranky and discriminatory - she is able to give us the perfect man even if you do not like to live. It's great to be able to see the favorite characters look so resolutely life.
