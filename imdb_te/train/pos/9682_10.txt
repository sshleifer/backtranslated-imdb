I definitely liked this movie! This is good! This movie tells the parrot, Paulie's opinion. Pauli gives a little girl to Mary. Mary learned to speak and they became good friends. But when Pali says to fly to Mary, she drops and the bird is sent away. Once that adventure begins. Paul goes too far to go back to Mary. This movie is very sweet, funny, touching, sad and more. I saw this movie for the first time, and it made me laugh. The birds were brave and wanted to go find his Mary for all the time, so was touching. I have to say that it's too sweet and sad, but you have to see how to do it. Finally, after listening to his story, the watchman tries to help him. Did not find his long lost Mary? Find out when you see this sweet, heartfelt image. It touches your heart. Rating: 10
