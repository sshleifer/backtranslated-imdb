Feroze Khan and Anil Kapoor's 'Gandhi, My Father' Mohandas Karunchand Gandhi is a good film that explores the chaos-side-family, his eldest son Harilal Gandhi's struggle with society, father than big life, and demons in his head especially. Equal to Gandhi's father, which son can fight with their father <br /> <br /> Acting is good. Shepheli Shetty, Darshan Jarivala and Akshay Khanna - definitely in this order - adds color and pathos to the heartfelt story of Heartlain's heart, hanging and hanging on. <br /> <br /> <p> Firuz Khan is directing and producing canvas luxurious and attractive, however, screenwriting can be tough. A few years ago I saw a play on the drama video type DVD (it was called Mahatma Gandhi, I think) and it is definitely more gripping. <br /> <br /> The background score of the film and the father-son and mother-son movements are good. <br /> <br /> The film was great. It has a border. This is too big because it is a storytelling between a father and a son or just a Gandhi or both. Somewhere, the plot is gone and when you expect the perfect summary of emotions, you will not get anything. <br /> <br /> It is enough to meet other Gandhis. Kingisley Gandhi, or Kamal Hassan's Hey Ram is not a detailed film. The film just manages to find its consistency; However, the value of a watch is "wondering what ..." is left wondering. 7.5 / 10
