Once again, Jet Li brings his attractive presence on the film screen in Black Mosque. In the film, Li Tui escapes from a Super Soldier program, trying to regain humanity from him. To do this, Suzai decides to become a librarian to spend a simple and peaceful life, but before he seeks peace he will be forced to refine his past problems. Other members of the Super Soldier program escaped at the same time, but they wanted to find internal peace rather than get to the world. Sus is the only thing that can prevent his ex-team mates from releasing information that could lead to the lives of innocent people. The film screams on the screen with a frantic speed and does not allow its audience. Marshall Arts is fantastic, but it uses wires because it does not quite appreciate the American audience deserves. If you like an interesting story and action films with good acting performances, they deal with mental and physical contradictions, then Black Mask is for you. Some of the jet lie cinemas are finally getting mainstream coverage in the United States and look forward to seeing how the film's changes (such as dubbing and soundtrack) influence the film. It is one of Li's finest films, which can go out and be viewed on May 14, released in the US.
