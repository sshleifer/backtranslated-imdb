Enormous pleasure for adults and children, this film works at several levels: there are some very good (yet subtle) jokes for car crashes and cake from the face in the face. <br /> <br /> Glen Close is at the Doctor Pavlov Behavior Modification Clinic after three years of recovering her fur. Even the puppy skin skirt she wanted very strong. <br /> <br /> She is a daughter of her daughter, something that changes her behavior. <br /> Now she needs an additional puppy (hence 102 dalmatians) to complete her fertility scheme this time. <br /> <br /> Ian Graffood, the second Chance dog, is instantly appealing as the hero of the dog's shelter. Although he was in "Titanic" and last year's television version of "Great Expectations" (PIPA), I did not recognize him; <br /> <br /> The fifth officer Loov in "Titanic" is not surprising because I do not see "Great Expectations". <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardieu Furrier-Punt Cruella. He looked at you prances and poses in the most extravagant and outrageous fur clothing ?? And it does well. <br /> <br /> Is not that terrific bad companion of Tim McInterney Cruella? He is also known as Alonso, 'Krules Butler,' in 101 Dalmatians' and you can also find him from the "BlackBread" Brit-coms. <br /> <br /> Oscar is usually given to the costume for a picture in the film. . Is it unfortunate that the clothes wearing Glen Close look great? It's very detailed (she's hand cuffs when she's released from the Behavior Modification Clinic) and is worth the over-the-top role. At least one Oscar nomination for her outfit is alone. <br /> <br /> Does the animation have a special place in my heart? But comparing this picture with the original animated film is like comparing to apples with orangutans: this is not possible. It is enough to say '102 Dalmatian' is also better than the 101 Dalmatian film version of 1996. There are a lot of things to see here: scenes, conversations and castings costumes - this is a good image for the whole family.
