Conrad Hall survived with a bang. The great image photographer before his dirty career is complete. <br /> <br /> Acting is not painful when you head Tom Hanks and Paul Newman! The whole action here is quite right, not too much; <br /> <br /> Since Hanks is a professional hitman for urban owner Newman, the characters here are clearly "good people". Hanks is the only ransom quality that does not want his younger son to close a killer, yet he teaches how a man who escapes in a robbery! <br /> <br /> Acting is as good as the acting and storytelling, the real actor cinematographer's Hall of the film, after a beautiful scene with his lens. His work is just amazing.
