<br /> <br /> This review may contain spoilers, but I like watching movies because of the idea that I do not know what is going on, so I have a lot of spoilers for other reviews from this movie! <br /> <br /> I have seen this movie again and reiterate that it has the best ending for any movie. Ever. Ever. Ever. The real translation, 'the beating of the butterflies wings', can not be used as a correctly translated title. They think that many Americans do not know what the Chaos Theory is ("Jurassic Park" or except). The film depends on the confusing theory and a small incident can influence the outcome of any related events, which can lead to an event. The film is a spectacular wonder and impact of the vortex as it follows a chain of chains in the middle of a number of reasons (about 20). In a way, this is inevitable despite the end, but if you think about it, it's a perfect end. Think yourself, "what to say?" At the same time there is a brave end. Too bad, we need to go abroad for this kind of gem, but such ending does not come out of Hollywood. <br /> <br />
