I saw some expectations and it totally liked it! Beckham is a very definitive upcoming film about a typical girl. It is the breakout character of Parminder Nagra ("ER"), a conservative Indian family and football's love (which we call Southern American for Soccer), played by Jess in England. <br /> <br /> Jess's friendship with Keira Knightley (Keira Knightley) is a movie about friendship as she goes with her mate. She wears a purple nail and small arrows on her shoes, and fears that Jules be more feminine, wear lacquer lingerie, and laughing with boys and playing sports, her daughter is homosexual. Jules and Jess try to convince their families to play and persuade their families after their dreams. They also, unfortunately, love the same person - Joe, their coach (starring Jonathan Rice-Mayors). <br /> <br /> In some places, Bend It Like Beckham falls into the clich√©. <br /> <br /> But, as this has been taking too long scenes, the film probably received from the whole edition. <br /> <br /> It is a fun movie that is refreshing about growing, culture confrontation, and football's love. It is about women empowerment, chasing your dreams, and supporting your friends. <br /> <br /> Funny, fascinating and pleasant, Bend It Like Beckham Small Picture ... and was able to. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
