Two years later ... Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) have been picking up near the rock stars in the near future but still need more work on their way. In the future, Bill & Ted is in public history, but then the scoundrel (Jaws Auckland) is ready to kill Bill and Ted, by sending cyborg look-likes to destroy them. Cyborgs are being sent today and they are actually killing true Bill & Ted. Now, both souls and they must travel through heaven and hell to protect themselves and their future. <br /> <br /> Tom and Hawk, the Beyoors), directed by Peter Hewitt, has excellent visual effects. More fun and entertaining than the original. <br /> <br /> The DVD has a good uniform wide screen (1.85: 1) transition and fine-dolby digital 5.1 surround sound. The DVD theater trailer and sequences is a fun behind the scene. This sequel is actually a box office hit, but it's also (or not it is believed), one of the best sequels ever made (based on your feedback). George Carlin originally repeats his role. Palm Grire also appears in a bit of role. This is an enjoyable fantasy comedy. (**** / *****).
