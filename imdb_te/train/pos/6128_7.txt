Yes this B-grade horror. But at least the producers, the directors, the cast did not appear in the film, it was immortal from heaven. This plot is splashed into the mental serial killer genetic acid that turns the wheat and death into a snowman. Snowman a.k.a. Jack Frost will eventually go to the murderer to find the small town sheriff, who was arrested. With a limited budget, the crew has to do with limited exclusive effects, most of which will be spent in the costume of snowman. Special skill shots can be handled by cartoons or shots (the camera moves to hide details). <br /> <br /> It is not a kid's image, it should not be confused with the Disney movie of the same title. If your children are not able to watch pg-13 movies than parents do not allow their children to watch this film. The film has two claims of fame. 1. Beatful Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie) played her first lead role. The sight of Jack Frost Shannon Elizabeth is worth watching a few times. 2. This film is always the worst snowman joke. The joke is very bad, the directors provide joke teller on the credit list.
