The title has many meanings - the bridal ring, a jacket that the mob is caught up with the boxing ring, where the mob is involved in differences and grievances, Jack jeopardizes its problems and causes a bolster love token as a ringing ring for Mabel. <br /> <br /> Former professional boxer Danish Carl Brisson made his debut in Alfred Hitchcock's films in The Ring. Many young Ian Hunter, who have a long career in motion pictures, play the role of a cute girl Mabel (Lillian Hall Davis), a fun-looking Bob Karby. As she was engaged to "One Round" Jack Sander (Carl Brishen), she did not flirt with Bob. Convinced Bob to go "a round" with Jack. He goes to many rounds and victories - he's a professional boxer and he and his manager come to the fair to find out if the good fighter as Jack they heard. He has to take Jack, and Jack improves his fortune with the intention of marrying him along with his scary coach (great Gordon Harker). Jack succeeds in his fight and marries Mabel the next day, but she and Bob still have the deepest attraction of each other's feelings. Jack is suspicious and does everything in his training to fight his wife Bob. <br /> <br /> Hero did not go beyond a town - Bob behaves himself, as a winner - Mabel plays the same way !!! She left him for Bob - a powerful man in the end. It's so realistic - it's a 20-minute film. Having been raw and enthusiastic, Jack almost knocked down - then he would have the courage to win in the middle of the rounds again with Mabel. <br /> There was a question that he had previously had - she did not think she should start a relationship with Bob initially - why should she not do it again? <br /> <br /> This image will be loaded with symbolism. Jack, waving his hands with the promoter, changes Mabel's hands to accept a bracelet from Bob. When Jack Ring is placed in the Mabel's finger, Bobs embraces her hand. At the end, Jack sees Mabel's reflection in a ringside water bucket and gives him the courage to go. This is a fantastic picture that is undoubtedly so. <br /> Most recommended.
