Jen Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Catherine Grayson, and Jose Iubi Starr in "Anchors Avig" directed by George Sydney. <br /> <br /> Kelly and Sinatras Joe and Clarence have two naval guys on holiday in Hollywood. They encounter a young boy (Dean Stockwell), who will meet with his aunt (Grayson), taking him home. Clarence comes to her. She wants an audition for Jose Irubi. <br /> <br /> They are very powerful music with great dancing and singing by Kelly and Sinatra. Kelly dances with Jerry The Mouse in a delightful scene. Graceson Jalousie and My Heart sings sings. Not one of my favorite voices, but she does well. <br /> <br /> How does Sinatra show her diversity and why are the girls with the big blue eyes and the boy's face drowning him? <br /> <br /> For Kelly, it is a big break for him at the MGM. <br /> <br /> The amazing picture, very light.
