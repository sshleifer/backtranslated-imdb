Sure, it's cheesy and inefficient and cool at times, but at least the filmmakers did not try. While most TV films are on the border of the mediated edge, the film actually has some zealous features. Cinematography is pretty good for a TV movie, and Viggo Mortensen has demonstrated the shades of Arugan in a film about the person who has his own rules. Dark scenes are very cheesy, but the scene with a mountain lion is intense. I'm angry with Jason Priestley's role in a rebel shock-joke film, but again it's a TV movie! Despite all the good stuff, the soundtrack is outrageous. However, the tokens are good to see, Arizona is popularly seen in the film.
