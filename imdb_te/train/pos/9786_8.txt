I really enjoyed the lead performances. Emma Lung is courageous and interesting. The characters have developed directors where one is not dimensional. A complicated story changing between ages. And the story of the incident that loses the impact of a large employer shut down in a small town. I agree with the comment that the old man should be attractive. There are so many relationships with big men and young women - male without looking good. The depth of the character is not too shallow. The film has a good look and cinematography is good.
