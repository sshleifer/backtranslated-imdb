I have seen a lot of PPV in the past but it is very entertaining, extreme PPV and the most complete DVD I have ever seen. DVD extras are valuable because some of the gladiators' performance (such as Chris Benoit Interview / Edge Interview), some glimpse of Monday Night War Wars, the first match of the Hogan tag title is Gold and some promotional discussion. In addition there is a good music video. <br /> Tag Team Table Match: Bubby Ray and Spike Dudley vs. Eddie Guerro and Chris Benoit 7/10 This is a very good match to take part in this event. Not too high and just pure raw material. Spike Tables have its own in matches and have good wrestling skills in Guerrero and Beno√Æt Mat. <br /> <br /> WWE Cruiser Weight Championship: Jamie Noble w / Nida Billy Kidman 3/10 This group really did not care about wrestlers and was not kidding until Kidman shooting star did. Usually people have a cruise weight flying high in the championship, but it is very low. In fact, it was very bad, at which time Nobel smashed his finisher, no one even ignored or realized (you could tell without a camera flashing). The end is quick though. <br /> <br /> WWE European Championship: Jeff Hardy Will William Regal 5/10 I'm not really wrestling reggae, he has no intensity and style. Hardy was very impressed, but he was not able to perform his high flying action, although he still did some good counters and added speed to the match. This match is perfectly suited to this match. Cena's first PPV is how funny he looks, how he used to dress up, and how he used it (looking at his face, pretty funny). It has good feelings with Cena, which has a good variation, suplexes, counters and some aerial. Jericho was sub-equal, but helped Cena start her career. <br /> <br /> 5. WWE Intercontinental Championship: RVD v. Brock Lesnar 8/10 This is a very serious and good match. The two wrestlers styles really fit well on the screen, with Brooks pure power and raw power versus RVDs full skill and quick skill. RVD was seen in the match (good for his next matches with the edge and Cena) and the overall match was fast. <br /> <br /> Finally Brook's undefeated streak is yet to give RVD his desserts in his home state, no disqualification match: Booker TV Big Show 7/10 Although there is no particular intensity of RVD match in another great match yet good follow up . Although it started out very slowly (it was always a big show) Booker T was impressive and moved with the illness in the advertiser's chart. <br /> <br /> 7. WWE Tag Team Championship: Hogan and Edge V Christian and Lawns Storm 5/10 This is a normal match. Hogan comes out of the way to a huge pop but his type of motion does not have intensity and strength. Then again the Christian does not have the best athletic abilities. This was the best match, but still correct to the PPV. <br /> <br /> Triple Threat match for the Undiscovered Championship: 10/10. Rock v. Undertaker v. Kurt Angle. <br /> <br /> Easily match the year's play. It has so far been the best triple threat match ever seen. It has a close waterfall, plenty of finalists, stolen finishers, raw energy, intensity and fast pace. No one could predict who would come out of this. If you buy this DVD, I will definitely buy for this match. <br /> <br /> You have a solid PPV that has plenty of extra goodies for you to look over again. It's definitely worth your money even though it's hard to find (I had to pay a little more than usual for this DVD).
