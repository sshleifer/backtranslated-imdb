This French horror movie was last night and liked pretty much. The whole movie will be held in a prison cell in a prison room. Twenty prisoners found a handwritten magazine on a wall from a serial killer. When they look through the diary, they enter the black arts and orders that come out of the toes and freedoms. What they find is totally different, at least terrifying to say. I love the low-budget horror movies, which delivers the quality of the goods and the good story. This film is going to take some time. Outcome and fear they are very interesting, and I enjoyed the ride. Gore is not a lot, but it's not enough for that story, it's pretty good.
