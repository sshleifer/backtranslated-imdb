Words do not adequately inform the emotional power of the film; One of the most memorable things you can ever see, the ending is the most loving, the softest, and emotionally you can expect. Every actor in each character is exhausted from the heart of Tom Huyes, especially intelligent and poor Jamie Lee Curtis, strongly wounded and hearty Ray Leota, and wants to have him for every award in the book. (He's the # 1 pick in 1988's Best Actor in Danny Pierre's "Alternative Oscar"), which earned each of its tears in the movie - and without plenty of them, unless you make the stone.
