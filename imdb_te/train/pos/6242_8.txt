I agree with the previous comment to describe the image's content as "every day madness" but I like to mention it: "Dog Days" is about how women (male) deal with society. The parts we see here show some variations in women's daily discrimination, which are categorized as the most aggressive group. She has a senior man working on having his new partner look and his last wife, dressed in ex-wear and treat her as a doll to act as "worthy to wear". There is a middle-aged couple, whose relationship she is almost addicted and he (violent) master. The more we communicate with his companion (s) to communicate with his friend / wife and instead of being really jealous of his affairs. The young man clearly clarifies to his friend - a girl who is struggling by her pretty enough - she follows her narrow rules of jewelery and respect. Finally, the man in his last half of the calculation of his own advantage gives a simple, thoughtless woman to an angry client - she is guilty of guilty of taking her car and steals her - naturally. She was "intimidated" and "humiliated" by the former "in her word", after her misuse - to complete the examples of her "master-slave" All this time will be under the summer-sun when the late-built neighbors will take action - completely motion (sic!). Unfortunately, I did not see the last moments of this shocking, authentic film of the ancient structures that ruled the relationship between these women and men, but I analyzed the discrimination of discrimination. Perhaps a useful tool in teaching a less sensitive viewer has been wrong - with good visualization.
