What did I expect when I saw a low budget movie? I do not think acting is good (budget reasons), I'm not shining (budget reasons) The sound is not good (budget again). Stop judging these low budget movies like a big budget movie! Since I'm a producer, I understand the budget limitations in a low-budget movie. Positions, shots etc. are stealing ... list and continue. I'm not saying all acting is bad. Jos√© Rosetta, Kris Angelo, Victor Zaragoza are good. Raul Martinez is a natural one. Karl was not even sold in Washington. He understands that each line is not important, some lines are removed. If you want to see what happens next, it's a good movie. I liked this movie. I gave it to 8. Let's see what happens next. Great job quiroz brothers!
