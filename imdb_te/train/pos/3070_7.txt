The "panic" branding and controversial middle-aged murderer is a fascinating, vague-style film with a young unborn pediatrician, his wife and son, with his own identity, with the responsibility of his employer / father. Although the image is ambiguous and the obscure ending, it is an excellent product in almost all aspects. The clarity and openness of the characters in such an improbable story can attract and disgust the audience.
