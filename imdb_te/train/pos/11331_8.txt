<br /> <br /> I have not generally pressed to write a review for a movie, but so far the only comment for this film is unfair, so I feel it is necessary to share my opinion. <br /> <br /> "Crisannana" (or "The Fallen", nicknamed Theater) follows a monotonous Latvian aristician Matis, who attempts to learn about a woman who does not try to stop her from jumping off a bridge. It is briefly a storyline, but it does not relate to the story depicting the guilty person's failure to act. A detective who investigates the incident tells him that every day until we die, we do not have to worry about anonymous faces. <br /> <br /> Comparison to Michego Antonioni and his "Blowp" is high in the review you read about "Krisana". Antonioni's philosophical and rigorous style and the influence of the "blowout" story is clear and, in fact, the author / director Fred Kaleeman gave a clear reference to the film, in which Mattis Bridge, or who he was at least considered. <br /> <br /> The only person who shares his or her views in the film condemns "college film class" look and sound. He or her existential neglected Latvian film neglected the considerable budgetary limitations, but the atmosphere was an artistic level to paint the atmosphere of black and white cinematography and ambient sound Matis. The sound of the wind and street noises provides an ominous glow and Feleni remembers it in the film, whether or not Kellumen's intention. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers undoubtedly have little money, but this barrier was used for the purpose of the film. <br /> <br /> "Crisannana" is a humorous enough to keep it too self-intensive, as a character is successful as a study. It easily drops into the traps of a mysterious story, but it escapes and becomes a brilliant film about solitary and guilty. If you pay more attention to the plot, this picture and its end may disappoint you. Otherwise, it takes time to get involved. It's worth asking.
