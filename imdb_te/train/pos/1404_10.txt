Hole Hove is one of the best horror films of the past decade. The sub-plot is original and the main plot is also good. Special effects are excellent and maybe the best I've seen in a horror film. <br /> <br /> Kevin Bacon again proves that he can handle what role he's got on his way. <br /> <br /> In 1933, Claude rates moved the world with a shocked man. One of the most breathtaking horror films ever. The action is intense and cold is the fact. If you see the night in the dark, you are jumping yourself. Supporting actors include Elizabeth Shoe, Josh Brolin, Kim Dickens, Joe Slatnick, Greg Grunberg and Mary Bundle. Everyone is doing an extraordinary job. <br /> <br /> Sebastian Cain (Kevin Bacon) and his team have been found to be secretive to appear secretly. After animal tests, they will go to human exams. But someone should have something. Volenteering, Caine turned invisible. But when his team could not return to visibility, Cain walked to his madness with his vengeance ... * The end spoiler * The film created memorable shock scenes and a classic of the next century. SCARY MOVIE 2 is based on a spoof joke, which attracts you through the throat and always goes away. The first 45 minutes or so slow, the characters show how to develop and work their experiments. The second half is exciting and appealing for many action and horror fans. Think of the Deep Blue Sea. Then sharks into a silly unseen man. Then turn the water into a fire and explosion. A killer shark is a rehashing of the film. Interestingly ... HOLLOW MAN GET 5/5.
