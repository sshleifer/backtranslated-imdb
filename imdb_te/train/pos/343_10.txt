Katherine Heigl, Marley Shelton, Denis Richards, David Bournez. <br /> <br /> How do I get started? <br /> <br /> "Well, where do I start?" We already know about the film. Five cute girls are targeting a 'romantic' serial slasher, a man who they all refused at school dancing 13 years ago. His trademarks include voluntary cards, maggot-infested chocolates, and subtle mortalities disguised as bleeding nose. His weapon of choice: well, pick a pick - ax, knife, electric powerland, bow and arrow, hot iron. Well, basically it's a horror film with a good twisted sense of sexuality. <Br /> Horror movies should not be considered Shakespeare, but I'm not gonna go there. I love horror movies, but not all of them. This one, I adore. It's been some of my other favorites. It's funny, sexy and scary. The killer's masked child is creepy missed, and seeing a cup of fire and a fire at a victim is truly strange. Acting Tonnott: Denis Richards, Marley Shelton and David Borenaz are very fun. I would like to see Katherine Heigl much more. I'm one of her biggest fans and she'd love to see some of the prominent things soon. Jessica Capcha is a very talented actress, and Jessica Kaffle plays the role of Ditzy blonde who filled her in Urban Legend 2. Smaller components are also good; The young version of Heidi Bruce ('bleedmedry.com') and Denis Richards has threatened her. <br /> <br /> Highlights: It has a distinct difference to each death scene. The corpse is an early scene. The hottest scene, though ridiculous, is well done. And the audiovisual maze is bad. <br /> <br /> Less point: I thought the killer was not enough, we saw the mask and it was not visible at all during the climax. <br /> <br /> Finally, the twist is not a surprise to me, but I'm really glad that the filmmakers should leave that amount. <br /> I do not want to tell about the movies they want to see, but when someone asks me to pick a horror movie I've seen, <br /> My rating: 10/10 (Bullseye!)
