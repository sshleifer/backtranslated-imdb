The above average film and acting are partially spoiled by its entirely predictable storyline. Music is selected according to the action every time. The scent of "Plejentville" camp hangs around the film. The time has passed, it's more accurate than that. A description of the tragedy of the company towns and the lack of upward revision is the sketch, but moving. Chris Cooper will change Howard's coal mines, like a first-class show.
