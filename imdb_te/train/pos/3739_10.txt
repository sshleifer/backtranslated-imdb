I really like this movie. Bozz is an ultra cool, not intimidating soldier who does not like to go to war. Joseph Haller's classic novel men and wars are the same as his personality to the Yosorean in Catch-22. However, the film was not set in a war zone, but trained in pre-war warfare. This spectacular film was about the perfection of the Vietnam War and the pain that would hurt the people who wanted to sacrifice for a losing cause. <br /> <br /> Colin Farrell Bose, a very real love and compassion for his fellow soldier with hated and incompetent establishment trying to kill himself. Bozz is totally cool and non-plussed, testing and tweaking his military officers, getting their goat every opportunity. He is a Jesus Christ with a Psychology Degree, "protecting" his fellow soldiers and showing them the real need from this man's army. <br /> <br /> The acting and action is crisp and reliable and <br /> <br /> "Sleeper" is one of my first three Vietnam films in the Tigerland Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket. <br /> 5 Stars, a top choice.
