Lately, the great Robert Bloch (Psycho writer, for those who do not care) is the story of this story of terror and it is one of the terrible movies I've ever seen as a kid. (I've just walked the MILES to watch a movie and it's usually dark when I emerged from the theater, it's always unfortunate when I look at a horror movie, but it's done very well.) It's been a long time ago video tape (which is always the last resort) I was surprised to see how well it could be done. Take Terror Terror: Night alone, watch it, and tell me it's not scary ...
