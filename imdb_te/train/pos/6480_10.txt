The best fighter documentary ever made. From the beginning of the first episode when Sir Laurence Oliver described the horrific events in the 'day of soldiers' in Oradaur-sur-Glan. In the last days when mushroom clouds appeared in Japan, I did not lose the second in this classic series and I recall it even though I was back in 1974. Every aspect of this tragedy. The whole range should have as much view as possible for most children in the world, so that the tragedy of World War II does not repeat and the difference, hatred, greed and embarrassment are not confused with patriotism or religious enthusiasm.
