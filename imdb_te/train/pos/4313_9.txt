The Grand Canyon comes in a rarely classed category: a very intelligent movie with intelligent dialogues and food for thought everywhere from the beginning to the end. I thought it was never going to be because it was simpler, it had a lot of rankings. This kind of flick sensitive viewers needs. IMDb makes me write ten lines, because this is not necessary in this particular case. I always say that if this is a request, it is the weakest point of the film if it is in acting: it is not bad, it can not do well. Exempt for precise Kevin Klein. Go ahead and see it.
