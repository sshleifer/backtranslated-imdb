"A Guy Thing" is not a classic, but definitely a good, funny comedy. The plot focuses on Paul (Jason Lee), who wakes up in the morning with his bachelor party memorabilia and becky (Julia Styles) naked on his bed. Before he finds out what happened, he comes out of his apartment because his fianc√©e Karen (Selma Blair) is coming. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ When he predicted what would happen to Karen, there were a lot of humorous movements. Selma Blair is truly a talented comedian, and the worst thing about this film is that she uses her. Still, Stills is more fun than the character, in fact she is not interesting. <br /> As I mentioned, "No Guy Thing" is not classic, but it's not bad either 7/10.
