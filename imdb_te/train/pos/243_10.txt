Definitely one of my favorite movies. The story is good, acting is very good, all technologies (especially cinematography) are sharp and the script is clever. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger Edward 'Ned' Kelly is wonderful as well. He holds the legendary publicity and supports Geoffrey Rush, Naomi Watts and Orlando Bloom. All Action Sequences are on the Point <br /> <br /> The end of this movie is at the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite films from Heath Ledger, the theme of every movie that I had previously played. There is no mistake here.
