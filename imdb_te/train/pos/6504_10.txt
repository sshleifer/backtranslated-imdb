My wife and I have seen the entire series at least three times. I can not imagine how good it is. This is not a "perfect" history of WWII, which library does not have such a history? But that's the best summary of history. <br /> <br /> Oliver's explanation is remarkable and is of course awesome. Apart from the interviews Russians, from all sides, because the producers are not allowed to talk to many Russians. It is very valuable to own this full program on DVD. <br /> <br /> The amazing work of producing the images and actions of the producer is that there is nothing in the archive: there are no ships and submarine battles, but still, episode is good on this topic.
