Yes, My Love is the popularity of the skyscraper of Lanza and is still popular. His throat was strong and stable, and MGM decided to use him in a great carass. Lanza himself thought he was a reborn of Karuso. After reading the Kostelinitz book written by Lanza's biography, he recounts that continuous learning and vocal lessons have become a perfect curse of Lanzhou. There is no doubt that Lanza has done a great job in the story, but the story is not entirely true; Blame on Hollywood! I learned to sing his songs ten years ago, and ten years ago it was pretty good for me to lose my voice due to emphysema / asthma. 'My My Love' is not easy to notice. But beautiful!
