The picture may be great. I have seen last night, but I feel unable to give it an honest impression because I have read the first book. This film is much better than I was disappointed with this movie. If you want to see "man's slavery", do not read this book first. On the other hand, the book is great, and the love affair with Mildred is very much for Philip, and you can enjoy it after watching the movie. I do not make this claim lightly. I read the book for an average of 4 days and read unparalleled writers such as Daniel Steel, Ovid, Faulkner, Plato and Shakespeare. My vote of "Human Bondage" is one of the ten novels ever written.
