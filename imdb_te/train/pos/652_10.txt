This image is very complicated, given any explanation and go along with it. You have an unprotected, troubled and charming main character (played by Jean-Pierre Leyad), who are trapped between two (three, three) women. We listen to his social, philosophical, and moralists in infinite monologues, and we will see that he works around his three magicians who love him. This is a fossil for a foul movie filled with rigid, cool, and uninteresting commentaries. And director Jean Eusta, manages to keep it fresh, contradictory and witty. Being such a long film, when a note line is recalled from a movie, 2 hours after the oral talk, Jean Pierre Liar does not laugh at all when it suddenly speaks on the phone. These conditions are completely cinematic and can not be completely restored in a commentary. At the end of this film anyone can not restore Fran√ßois Lebrune's tragic and painful beautiful monologue. 3 and 1/2 hours and worth every minute.
