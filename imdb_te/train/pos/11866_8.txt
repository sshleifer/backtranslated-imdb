Many people who have seen this movie think that it is the best film ever made. I disagree but this movie is very good. Tony is a bad donkey and knows that he is using it to intimidate and forward. It goes from washing dishes to him and how to have large offices and all the offices with cocaine. If you want a family image, it's not the way to go, but if you want mobsters and vengeance and such stuff then you will love it.
