Now, for all cinematic fans, this movie is not a high rank in your list. But if you know that you understand my pawan with the intent of plot development, deep truth, and the intention of having this film (series) <br /> <br /> The specialties of the film are not the authors' translation and will not know what will happen in the end. But the film is accurate and just as problematic. I am not a Christian, but my personal decision to accept Jesus as my Savior is a Christian. The likelihood that some of these scenarios and scenarios are portrayed can be intimidated by thinking about their actions and decisions. <br /> <br /> As a Christian, I know that I can not come back, and thanks to films like this, I appreciate the depth of the rewards that can be seen beyond the superficialities of entertainment, acting, and movie budget. You can not see this movie, but you can not feel your heart and soul.
