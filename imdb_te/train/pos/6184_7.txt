I got this movie from the library on VHS because this Black History Month and I reviewed many African-Americans successes in chronology, as Duke is in Ellington and his orchestra. Their jazz version of Franz Liszt's "Rhapsody" is the theme of this largely overlord murder mystery-musical comic strip. Many other numbers I liked were Kitty Carlisle, especially "Sweet Marijuana", Carl Brisson's "Cocktail for Two" and her duet with Carlisle, Gertrude Michelle, who love to hate you. Jack O'Kee and Victor McLaglann are probably a little too long with their love / ridiculous fun of the producer and detective but they will grow on you. And the Toby Wing is a sexy mute tease like Nakin, who tries to tell Okeeki something, but every time he's "no longer". Despite the intentions of the killing of many characters, it was not surprising to reveal who made it. And here's how naked women are (namely their hands closed, with their hands or slightly uphill). It's pretty clear before code. Worth a look for any image buff of this kind of thing. As a longtime Louisiana resident of PS, I'd like to say when I was born here because Carlisle was a New Orleans home.
