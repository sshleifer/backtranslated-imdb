Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experiment is Doubtful ***** In the first perspective stars have a raw realistic creepy and disturbing look for the dark side of human nature. This movie gets correctly, what might you be thinking? The point is just the intense violence and the satisfaction of Gore's fan. This film has some gore, more or less tortured women just violently. Only 3 scenes are really considered as gore. The guinea pig does the devil's experimentation, however, as hostile to Sesame Street. <br /> <br /> Film review 0-5, Gore 0-5, When you see the Gore Pig, <br /> Guinea Pig: Devil's Experiment (Uncut) ***** (7 )
