That's definitely one of the best movies I have seen for a very short time. Sensitive direction and flawless performance makes this a very entertaining and often moving film. Denzel Washington has so far played a role in its most charismatic and emotional roles, and the other cast is beautifully displayed. Christopher Walken was very impressive in his role, although he did not seem to like it often. The hero of the ultimate greed will overcome childhood innocence and love. It is a movie for action movie lovers, which has a fair share of bullets, rockets and revenge. The city of Mexico City marks an eye opening and corruption. Overall, a really gripping film from beginning to end. Highly recommended!
