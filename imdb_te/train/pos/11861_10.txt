This film is very entertaining and never boring at nearly 3 o'clock. Al Pacino, Michael Pfeiffer and the rest of the cast are great and very believable in the film. The violence was very low, but at that time the film showed how painful the drug trade was. The ending is one of the finest and best of the scenes. Great image and you probably will really enjoy it.
