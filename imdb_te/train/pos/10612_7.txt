It's cheesy, it's majestic, it gross, but it makes it a lot of fun. It just came over the top dramatic moments that are just plain ridiculous. The film is very cool to make fun. <br /> <br /> The film takes place around three women's newspapers at one time in front of cell phones. They go to a small town to cover a festival, but they can not get a room to come to the night. When they met Ernest Keller. He is crazy in a psycho kind way. And he will let him stay at his home. <br /> <br /> Stephen Furst's performance is "The Unseen", and he really has this movie. While it is interesting to find the truth of the Ernest family, the film is pretty dull. <br /> <br /> When you see this cast in this scene it will be worth it. Barbara Bach and Dow bars make good eye candy. <br /> <br /> I take into consideration the old old gem of the image and feel it worth it.
