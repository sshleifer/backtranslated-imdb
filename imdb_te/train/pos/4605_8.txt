<br /> <br /> It's not great among Jackie Chan films, but one of the greatest Kung Fu films of all time. <br /> <br /> We set the benchmark for crazy stunts, and chan movies, and this one follow others. It's two hours pure entertainment, it's impressive all the way. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> Any Kung Fu fan must be a fan of, while at the same time the movie can reach a wide range of community.
