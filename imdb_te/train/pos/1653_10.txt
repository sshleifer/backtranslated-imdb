I agree with all of you that this series is the best in the 'gnostic' style. My husband and I were attracted by it when it first appeared in the US and every episode. I tried to buy that series at that time (I tape it) but WGBH said it was not available. I feel I have written to Ian Holm. Like other people, I purchased and read the Daintain Series (part of the complicated plot to understand). If the original version is always available on DVD, I'll be the first to pick up a copy. The weak but courageous Bernard Samson Ian Holm's character is amazing. (He is always amazing.)
