Glamorous and burt and last TV serials are a breathtaking effort to incorporate the distorted plots of the original TV series. Directly from the Bunch Ward book "Boy Wonder: My Life in Tights", the flashback scenes were lifted and I imagined the inspiration of his book for the film's production. <br /> If you lose this broadcast, it is worth the effort to take a tape from a record friend. I am copying my children now.
