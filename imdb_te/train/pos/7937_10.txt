I thought the film "I Do It It Do not" was fantastic. In the past I saw Rob Estes on Josie Bisset in "Suddenly Susan" & "Melrose Place" and "Melrose Place" and enjoyed them again in "I Do not Do". They have great chemistry together (I can help marriage guess in real life!) - In the film they both both children and careers are a widow and they try to combine their already busy chaotic families together in love and falling into the ball. In fact they make mistakes, but they work together, what works and how to build a family. Many people talk about this movie - all good! - And the picture left us wanting more. This makes great series - appealing to many ages! - Today is a great way to visualize the reality of our life, such as a family show, on earth and real life - instead of all the stations called "reality TV" are our days. People can start a new series now in the ABC Family!
