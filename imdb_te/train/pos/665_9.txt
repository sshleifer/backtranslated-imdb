"And All Through The House" is a special spy piece, it's not only from the first season, but this episode is the first I saw! As a teenager with my parents in the summer, I saw this episode in our hotel room in South Carolina, South Hollen, HBO in 1989 and I've ever been cryptic and never slept! I have always been a fan of horror-suspense series and have loved monster movies and I'm afraid again with this series that started with HBO. This episode is the first one I have seen for myself and my favorite one, it's just so enjoyable with a good twist. "And all through the house" is a nice cozy setting on a snowy Christmas Eve, a perfect way to get you relaxed for the holiday chopping! Anyway you will be taking care of her hubby while waiting for some money and a new love Mary Ellen Trainor as a greedy philandering wife (works by many alert brothers by the way, usually works with small parts). The most horror series is not only the worst and bad people take a turn for what they deserve. The odds are greatly stacked when maniac is preparing for a late holiday chopping on Christmas Eve, as a maniac like a maniac escapes from a local nut house! Old E.C. Like comic lessons, what are you asking bad people to do? Well this story ends with a perfect holiday scream! This story is also in the 1972 film and starred as Jon Collins, one of my favorite and perhaps one of the classic Gopi episodes of all time!
