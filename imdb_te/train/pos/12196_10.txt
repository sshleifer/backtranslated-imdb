Orson Wells kicked my ass with his every image I see. The lady of Shanghai is at the same level as her other masterpieces, The Magnificent Ampersons, Eat Touch, The Trial, and Missinesite. This plot may sometimes be confusing, and sometimes it may be too short (modified to the maximum hour when testing shows are not correct). But it does not matter. You can not see the pictures of Wales and show much more attention on the platform. He's directed in what direction. Almost any scenes in the film can be captured with other scenes he has directed. See the courtroom scene. Normally they are such stock scenes, I can not stand them. Point Case, try to sit through Wells' own speech at the end of compulsion. From Shanghai to Lady, pay attention to details of the courtroom's scene. Always see the lawyer who will interrupt the sneezing and inquiry. Or check the lighting in the scene. I know, it's just a simple Venetian Blind, and the film's Noirs and Crime movies have been used continuously, but Wells gives it a beauty for everyone. The conversation is also great. Wells has no expertise to make a crime film with examples of skill and great skill. He was talking to Shakespeare or sprinkled the hard boiled lines, having the power to move the soul. 10/10.
