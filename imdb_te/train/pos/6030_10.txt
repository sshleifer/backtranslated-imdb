I know this is not an infamous thing about the Jabrisky Point, but I liked this movie. I know, I know - I legally call an Antonio fraud. I love La 'Aventura, I love La Note, I love El' Eclassse, I love Red Desert, I love Blow, and I love the profession: Reporter (aka the Passenger). I only gave a lesson 8/10 (less than 10/10, less note than La Note and L 'Ellisse), the other two, I totally agree that I'll have to see both of them again), Beyond the Clouds, it's called an awful movie . If you hold my drift, you do not have a good picture. If you are not an Antonion fan, you must logically log me out. But if you're a casual fan, you do not know whether this particular film, whose name, is spoken, is often followed. <br /> <br /> The people hate it because 99% of film makers only care for the story of the film. Well, that's not sure. If an image is stunning in a specific subject, say acting or cinematography or directing, and just as good in its narrative, the movie viewers may love well. But the film has a very spectacular visual masterpiece and contains a sluggish or weird story - another thing that has ruined the film over the years: logic - then they certainly hates this picture. I really agree that in some ways. As long as I do not like it and change my opinion, it is difficult to love the story I said to the poor. However, other people are getting irritating in a loose story. This must definitely drive viewers from the Zabriskie point. I can tell you the story, but you probably think it's nonsense. It really, but, for me, the whole effort made it more spectacular and beautiful. I comparing it to 2001, this is my favorite movie. <br /> <br /> The 2001 version of the film is entirely compatible with the article. <br /> <br /> Jabrisky Point is suddenly. Music helps a lot; The score has several days of action along with Pink Floyd. This type of mood is the mood of the other artifacts of lonely and desolate Antonioni. The freedom that came from it too. The best sequence in the film is the main man and woman (her name is Duria, I know, but I do not remember his name), drag the desert road to their vehicle next to the historic marker. Above the stone wall, the cars are built to stay the oldest lake without traveling. It is primarily a rocky desert, and both go to play it. The setting is beautiful. The woman says: "This is such a beautiful place, what do you think?" Man: "I think I'm dead." This is not a good thing or bad thing. This is similar to the other Antonioni expressions in the films - the characters are constantly missing or disappearing. Instead of bored David Locke with journalism, he was bored with journalism, who was unwellly hippie young in his friends' politics - they are talking more and more correct, he said. <br /> <br /> This film seems to be just like the situation. Antonioni's films are marked by just a few frames, but his visual style is always under construction. I prefer the passenger more than the jubrisky point, but the jubrisky point may be his ultimate accomplishment in that subject. Well, that might sound odd - the images of the L 'Aventura and the Red Desert are amazing. I feel particularly amazing camera movements here. He apparently made a ton of money in the Blowjob, which was the biggest hit of its day, the biggest one at that time. He spends a lot of time with his air shots. <br /> <br /> In one of the greatest scenes of the film, a man's private aircraft has a dive bomb in his car. <br /> <br /> The subject of most criticism is the politics of the film. They are absolutely easy. Those hippies are not easy, but Antonioni's focus on hippies - nothing in Italy - are dirty, well, filtered by foreigners' eyes. There is a child's criticism rather than advertising, but it's still there. I mean, do not you care for people? What's wrong with it Are you running on buying billboards due to your billboards? Or criticisms against the capitalist system. The Secretary of Duria, who works for a company that steals the land in the desert - the land he and the man enjoyed - cheap, suburban homes families. Rod Taylor, a very poor actor, whose time machine and most famous roles in The Birds have played the role of her bass. In the end, I can not be destroyed - you got to see - is almost offensively cheap. However, I can understand the treatment of police officers. I usually do not disdain them, but they're awful at the moment. They are still awful. <br /> <br /> These common arguments against the American lifestyle still do not affect my opinion in the film. This filter view of America is very interesting. I do not think I really disagree with a hippie Antonioni. 10/10.
