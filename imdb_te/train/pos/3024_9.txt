A Spanish diplomat who sent him a dramatic portrayal of a meaningless dislike to face the inevitable coming of the Second World War, a Spanish Republican who sent him to look into his skin in support of his attempt to support England and influence the wealthy mine owners not to sell coal to fascists in Spain. He loses the locals, losing a film that faced the angry crowd of minors who convinced one of the scenes, and subsequently seen another threat to their careless livelihood. Although the social-economic hierarchy, xenophobia, and world politics, the film enters into a dark and curious intrigue with Katyana Pacquino and treacherous compatriots who do not play Peter Lorry and James Wang Howe, and operates more than once to get under your skin.
