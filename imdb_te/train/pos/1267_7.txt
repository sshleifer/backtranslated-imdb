Just the custom is a flawless but good picture that is made by strong bugs and some creative (most speculative) works. Sean Connery is an anti-death crusader taken to protect a innocent young black man (Blair Underwood) from the ultimate penalty. To correct matters, the Conory Venture to the offender, he should fight only with the time spent, but the sheriff (Lawrence Fishborne) as an intermediary. There are twists and turns and character reversals - some surprising, not some - like the aging crusader secret unravel attempts. The end of the ending is a bit ridiculous, but just slowly worth a look at night.
