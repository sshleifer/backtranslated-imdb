Personally, I hate the Jerry Springer show, but I find the "Ringmaster" as the funniest movie I've seen this year. In the opening scene, Jerry Springer "Guests" will be laughing throughout the movie in a continuous satirical film. Although there is a small scene made by Jerry Springer a weak effort to support his presence, I definitely recommend this movie for entertainment value.
