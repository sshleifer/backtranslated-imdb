Get it. The DVD is cheap and easy to come up, the length is now standardized and you have long gone without it. (When the home video starts, there are three parts that are not exactly ..) Everything you read is true. It is not defending, and the country without it. The color is lush and spectacular to look at, and the production values ​​are pretty good for the Kiddi epic Saturday afternoon. But the question is not .. the whole Santa Vs. The satan angle is so stranger that the jaw drops and the film and a cult Fave film hit once it is really done in the home video. How good / evil / strange / it? I saw only a child as a child and remembered IT for nearly 30 years. Murray I'm tied on the voice above .. I said to my sister, she lied to me and it's Santa vs.Satan .. Santa put it on Christmas Eve before Christmas set off on Christmas Eve To make him their SLAVE .. and an international kiddie sweat shop .. And it's probably 60th of many children overnight Came.

But whatever the old way you choose, the film is a very crafty art and the whole (along with Brian, along the way ..) will never fail to laugh at me.

"If you're bored, go downstairs and play the piano." Dam.) Freaky, boring, disturbing, funny, childish, strange.Hey, what do you want?
