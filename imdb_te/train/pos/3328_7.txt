It's not very unpleasant in small doses throughout the entire film (eg Big Fat Greek Wedding; Me, Myself & Irene) is rare to spot a romantic comedy. The film is unnecessarily depressing jokes in the movie, not unhygienic, unethical. All around, it's a beautiful picture with characters who love it. I thought the end was a little bit abrupt. It feels like they should end up at the World Series for a real bang-up finish. The acting wants to be too small, but designed with the speed of the story. If I was known as a Fellyell Brothers movie, it was considered a stomach's rubbish piece and did not see it, but it seems to be exactly an odd picture. They are good, I hope they are pulling their heads to the other ways and doing good films continuously.
