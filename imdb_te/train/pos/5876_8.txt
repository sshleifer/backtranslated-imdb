<br /> <br /> After watching the film, they will have to make more movies in the future, like Akshay Kumar and John Abraham. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar faces difficulty by dating himself with 3 people at the same time, but when he comes out of the door he deals with it and then is very fun to watch, In this way more great comedy, John Abraham plays his best friend, he is ba Â£ plays his role and he noticed that I was happy to have some of his amazing work, but he's a really good actor. I loved John, Neha Dhupia had a small role in the film and it did well. <br /> <br /> This film is really recommended by the movie.
