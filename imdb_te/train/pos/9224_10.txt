The film is visually amazing. She did not take action or not. Each scene was composed and composed by John Derek. Locations, set design and textiles work perfectly to show things that appear in the story of beauty, youth and wealth. In some ways I would like to see this film as a tribute to John and Bo Derek. And ... This commentary is not full that men are men who have lost an ancient period when the father, the teacher, the lover, and the role of man, Anthony Quinn, did not complete. There are some of us who find value in the surrounding strength and direction with confidence that contribute to the feelings of faith, control and security. Yes, they will no longer do such men! However, how often do you find the women who do like Bo Derek.
