Now, I have seen a lot of movies in my days, but in everything I have a lot of good. And I'm a 19-year-old man impressed with this movie directed towards a young audience. This is a very poor gem for foreigners watching. Almost all acting is believable, the graphics are good (you may not even care when you watch the movie, trust me, bitching about the graphics is a rare thing), the story is well written and this is an image that not everyone can enjoy. <br /> <br /> How did this movie make me this film? It's one, made me laugh ... too, two, made sense for the characters as you think, and three, this is a very exciting story. By the end of the film you will feel good. Certainly, there is no anime to show some great kid to be a great warrior and to show off whatever great evil he has done. This is a formula that is used too. But, in this case it is forgivable because they are not used by some characters and puppets for some average graphics that you want to look 5 years ago, but it's not decided. It's very touching, ending, and puts you into the image as it suppose. You're never saying "Never-Ending Story" or your opinion is different. <br /> It is very happy. When I came out of TMNT, I saw a single movie that got this feeling. I really loved it about this movie that I thought about the TMNT. So do not analyze or take this movie too much and enjoy it.
