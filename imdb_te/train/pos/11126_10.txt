A man living in two families is centered on Tony Soprano's life. A traditional wife and two children are the other huge New Jersey mafia group of the nuclear family, which he is the boss of two. Tony is a fascinating, horrific, loving guy who plays James Gondolphini, True Romance and The Mexican fame. Gondols should be given full praise to make it a feminine and scary aggressive cruelty as a virtually recognizable and full-fledged figure. <br /> <br /> Hundreds of castes do not always have flat performance, such as Pauline Walnuts and Ralph Siffaretto in such styles always lose your memory. <br /> <br /> The true genius of the story is revolutionary in the brave and traditional play series of the creator and writer. Twenty-minute long sequences, symbolic and realistic use and transformation images and really surprising scenes of violence. However, this genre has true touching themes for love, respect and family members. <br /> <br /> There is currently competition with TV and often poor. Sopranos is the longest of the remaining parts of America, the most original and compelling play. Forgot the family. This television is Redifined.
