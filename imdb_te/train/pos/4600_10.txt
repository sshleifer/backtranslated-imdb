This film has to be at least the top 250 movies of this film. Best Action Film So far. Today's action films are badly done by actors and action directors not to do the fight and adventures properly. How to do more from Hong Kong, like Jackie Chan Battles are very intelligent and wild, we always see favorites. Chan and his team begin to hunt a hill car through the hill town. The ultimate fighting fights have always portrayed me as the best fighting fights. Slashing down the crash flag down through glass jacket, the stunt was severely hurt.
