1.) This image is amazing! I saw it when he was in a nearby town! I saw the buildings that went to the story. Overall, I loved this film, and Jake Gyllenhall's is the best! Even - my favorite parts science fair, and his father all the times. They are very sad, it seems. Homer wanted to follow his dream and his father did not find a way or attention. The tag line is true. "Sometimes one dream is bright enough to light up in the sky." 2. The way the film portrayed was sinless, and it was as reliable as the record in the 1950s. The dress is perfect and they also got down their accent. Please definitely recommend this movie!
