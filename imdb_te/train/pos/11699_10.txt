I have seen this movie a dozen times and it's awesome. But it's only the beginning of the matter, who's who's who's going to get out of discussion. I think it's interesting to make its remake. But on the official site, they said they could not remade it because many people were saved when they saw it. What now happened to Patty Dyning? She is a pretty good actress. She did many other movies in the 70s and 80s, but we did not hear from her. I'm sure about Jerry Tham Rachford, working for accounting in RD Films. But overall, I have to say that I went back to the old school in that series.
