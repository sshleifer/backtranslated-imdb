Well, honestly, I saw previews for this movie and what do I think of, what are the producers thinking? Hutton, Jolie, and Dequoi? How can a Monorand actor probably compete on the screen with Jolie's natural force? But surprisingly, it has chemistry that has been shown to be serious attention without both kissing. David's humor also matched Jolie's spark and fire. In the case of Hutton, he has acted mentally well and differs from David's life-threatening situations. Overall, I have attracted a lot of writing and character development. I gave up 8 stars.
