The characters and their related histories are one of the most interesting things about this film, developed on the fly. Suppose I wanted to get interested in the characters by not letting the characters consume their characters. The premise of using the art and craft of furniture design and architecture is a unique theme and similarity for what has happened to families / siblings in life. The complication of the twins and the husband as a couple surrogate father adds great tension to the film being mentally curious. Moreover, although the story is directly related to the massage (ie Jewish / twins / family businesses) the themes are universal because each family has a black sheep. It made it very attractive.
