I started to say that I am very happy with this climax of the Bourne trilogy. Please do not delete it from a sequel years or now by a prequel. Leave alone. <br /> Matt Damon is a talented and versatile figure ... he just seems to be playing Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of the first two Bourne movies, you will not be disappointed by the third installment. It sticks to what works and adds a bit. Finally, I saw how well all of the mesh 'identity' and 'supremacy' were in the 'ultimatum' to illustrate the final picture of Jason Bourne's troubled past. Action sequences are fast paced and put on the edge of your seat. Bourne and assassins are always fun to watch. <br /> <br /> The CIA agent is a fan of movies around and how the CIA collects their intellect and this image is exactly on the street, which is very exciting to me. <br /> <br /> If you do not see Bourne in the previous 2 installments you will still enjoy it but still recommend that you still see them first. This allows you to understand the role of Jason Bourne and to be a part of his world. This film enables you to appreciate and enjoy. I'm not sure which is the good of the first 2 but I personally think 'ultimatum', the triangle might have just the edge.
