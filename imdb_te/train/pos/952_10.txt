So this is just 7.6 in the site for the TV movie scores! Humbug! The 1984 version of Dickens's classic story without question is the best done so far. And yes, Hound also saw the 1951 version which is good, but not good enough. Acting is stunning but lack of color is perhaps the biggest drawback of that version. <br /> <br /> Scott Ebenezer is just as exciting as scout. Three other souls later that evening, we know the story of this nasty businessman, haunting his dead partner's ghost. Scott struggles as a screw. Confidence is indeed hard for some critics who claim he can wake up to Christmas morning and teach him a new find that after a valuable lesson teaches him a valuable lesson. But hey, this is George C. Scott. He is going to dance on a street that is not happy. He is very respected and his scrooge keeps his emotions in a realistic manner. <br /> <br /> Supporting performances Clothing, music and scenery are uncommon amazing. Clive Donner's fantastic style comes to the 19th century London life. The film will make many scenes to the souls frightening. <br /> You can not broadcast this version on television often, it is a disappointment. A Christmas Carol's version of 1984 should be part of every housing ceremony of holiday holidays. When the decorations come from the basement, the film should go to the DVD player at least once. <br /> 10 stars 10 <br /> <br /> Hound.
