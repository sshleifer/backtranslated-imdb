<br /> <br /> It is a great human drama that inspired my emotions and my imagination. <br /> It is a parable of the life and death of Christ. Daniel is a superior musician who is physically and mentally exhausted by his career. As Jesus did to the society in the first century Palestine, when he joined a church singer as his conqueror, he would bring a change in the lives of the Chargers. They laugh, they begin to talk openly and honestly each other, their flaws are exposed, they accept each other, love one another, become an important community. They are emotionally disabled young men (? Tore) Pastor, Stig has been authorized to suppress oppression morality on the community, and it has been gradually rejected by choristers. When the Stig Daniel is removed, there is a rebellion, and the ski is crushed. Stig suggested the Jewish authorities in Jesus 'day, and the Jews' obedience to the Law contrasted with the new life of Jesus through "the riches of the law." <br /> <br /> In a dramatic scene, someone declares that the Church has "discovered sin". <br /> <br /> The truth of the story of Christ is killed by Daniel Connie, beats him, sinking him into the river. <br /> <br /> Three women (three women) (in the cross of the cross), in his room (the tomb) in his room, wearing a white linen sheet (mausoleum) <br /> <br /> She takes Daniea to Lena, one who loves her The guy is a warm, beautiful young woman who has cheated, and is now ready (Jesus Mary Magdalene-not-perhaps high-class prostitute / prostitute). <br /> <br /> Gabriela composed by Daniel <br /> <br /> The final sequence is like a magic, sampling / hamming, drawing large audiences, our true human destiny, and so on. Such as connectivity and inter-connectivity.
