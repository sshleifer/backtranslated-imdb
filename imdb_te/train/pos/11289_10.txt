The film made in 1934 is above the head and shoulders above each Tarzan film, which is bragging and boring 1980s, including Gretkek. The director agrees with the first three sequences, as Tarzan and his colleague are like a shot, with the action, humor, and romance. Maureen O'Sullivan Jane looks beautiful and beautiful and cinematic. Wesmuller is also great. Highly recommended.
