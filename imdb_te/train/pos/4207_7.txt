Macyoy (Richard Widmark) has an important thumbnail for the wallet communist cause of Pick-Pockets Candy (Jean Peters). She later looks forward to catching a microfiche hand at her contact with her federal agents. However, each one steals purse on the subway under the noses and hunts him for both the policeman and the joe (Richard Kiley) and Candy, who want the microfilm back. You can only skip through the Mo (Telma Ritter) that sells information on criminals. He's important to steal and make it clear that he must cross the two sides of the film, but he wants to catch for a higher price. This leads to Joey's hunt after him and there is a dispute between Joey and Jean, who fell in love with Skip. Joey has a deadline to give his owner a microphone. <br /> <br /> Its a well-shot movie and it is a good start for you to be taking part straight away. It is unlikely how Jean Peters will immediately fall in love with the vidMark, but in this case she needs to be away from Joey. Its good picture.
