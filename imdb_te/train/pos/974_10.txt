The director is Mike Takashi's best. It's so nice to put words on it. At the age of fifteen, I first started to get me to the target audience. <br /> <br /> 1980 ల నుండి ఇదే తరహా పిల్లల చిత్రాలను గుర్తుకు తెచ్చుకుంది (ఈరోజు కాకుండా) ఆ సినిమాలు భయపెట్టడానికి భయపడలేదు - నేను ప్రారంభంలో jarring దొరకలేదు ఇక్కడ దుష్ట వివరాలు చాలా ఉంది కానీ వెంటనే నేను పెరిగిన ఏమి భిన్నంగా ఏది గ్రహించారు. The film is a compilation of '80Kit Kits Films Conventions. You name it, is mythical and ghostly goblins and another young man who lives in his own happy / dysfunctional world of a young boy from the fire; An exploration to save the two worlds from an evil power; A beautiful heroine has a passion for him; A brutal trainer (Go-Go Yubury 1 from Kill Bill Volume; A major villain who has drawn his evil power from everybody in the world. <br /> <br /> One of the INDB's criticisms began, saying, "Where is this picture when I am a child?" And I have a sentiment that I sincerely agree. When I saw it, I cried that I did not grow on it. It's Labyrinth, like masters of the universe is not part of my cinnanatilo, and a very low level, the neverding Story. Recall that in the movies, but not copy others, such as the goniyis - Mike usual things to offer us new things. /> <br /> Sometimes the budgetary constraints of poor CGI <br reason, has played an important role in many films, often an artistic choice - the desire to present things in a drastic way. Here the CGI is mostly due to average, budget restrictions, although he does a great job putting on a scene. CG effects, traditional puppets, yanimetraniks and truly extraordinary appearance (and the character) with the world, combining to create a unique look. It often has boundaries in the fringe edges. <br /> <br /> It's the pictures of a great child ever. But not for a young or sensitive child. <br /> <br /> Just jaw-dropping fantastic. See it for yourself and show it to them if you want your kids to handle / appreciate it. In the great Yokoi war you can not do it as some of the smallest.
