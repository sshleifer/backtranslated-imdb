Cunningley is an interesting Western from a director who has some accomplices in the genre. Like the other Anthony Man films, The Far Country scenery affects a sturdy pot with a scene. Both of them play in some of the peacocks of Man, such as honor, loyalty, betrayal and of course, death! This story lucky hunting partners Jeff Webster {James Stewart} and Ben Tatum {Walter Brennan} go to the Oregon Territory with herds of cattle. To know about the blooming gold boom, they make a good profit to sell cattle in a Klondike town. Joining Skagway, self-appointed judge, Gennon [John McIntyre], is ready to deliver to the Webster for breaking justice to the webster, all of which can be honest. In Gunnan, Gennon takes the flock of their partners, but they returned to Davon in the border with Canada and stole the heads-and kept Gannon and his men warm. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "We are in a hurry. Cinematography from William H. Daniels has been praised, has not contributed to the current DVD prints, and the film is surprising and a "he practices?" The core viewers had something of an important view for the first timers that went into the Western world of Anthony Man and James Stewart, still amazing, yet dark, in dividend payments for backpackers for hardened fans. 8/10
