When I was 8 years old, I did not always want to see movies and television, and this is one of them. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite films, and it is a fiery movie I have ever seen in my life, acting is amazing, do not make comedy these days (really funny and seductive actors like Seth Rogen and Barf that retarded Jud Apatow <br /> <br /> In this film you can make a smile without some kind of vomiting-inspiring body fluid. The glorification of a classic action stars, and deserve all the accolades.
