Adam Jones film "Cross Eyed" takes on the control of the main character cycle and the redemption ride viewer is gaining momentum as the order sets his life. Adam Jones invented an imaginative and refreshing way to make his character stronger and more important. These facts are both obvious to both characters and viewers as you laugh and make them funny for their credits. Simple yet attractive settings \ clothing keep guessing about what you will see next. You can not help with the prank of the movie but can not smile and laugh. I can not wait for her second attempt. It was only time before Jones hit again. Bravo!
