I do not think I'll ever understand hatred for Renny Harlin. 'Die Hard 2' is good, and he has given the world 'cliffhanger' one of the most exciting action films. <br /> <br /> Gal Walker, former rescue climber, who visits his old town by visiting his former town, is a former friend, Hall Tucker (Michael Rooker), who helps protect the mountain peaks. Walker certainly returned at a favorable time, because the lonely people were actually the sophisticated band of thieves led by Eric Quane (John Lithgow). Queen & co. <br /> They have lost a lot of money that they have stolen from the US government in the Rocky Mountains and they really love it. <br /> In particular, 'cliffhanger' is another 'die hard' clone. If you trade in the Nakotomi plaza ranges up to the open mountain ranges of the Rocky Mountains, fully trade with the scenes designed to indicate the weaknesses of our hero and to keep him alive. Naturally, that set-up completely ripped off to the shreds, Stallone's character easily avoids a very large number of bullets, and face-to-first clear side effects slams into many rock faces. After all, what action films are not all about? <br /> <br /> 'Cliffhanger' is one of the most exciting action films. Performance of great scenes and adventures. One of the earliest stunts is one of the best struggles I've ever seen in a film, and the rest of the film does not get better than the start, which performs its surprise. The main villain of John Lithgow is entertaining, and a bad dude. <br /> <br /> 'Cliffhanger' is easily one of Stallone's best efforts, certainly the best effort of Renny Harlin, and the most exciting action film - 9/10
