I have seen this film many years ago and have seen a lot of my opinion because it has enjoyed the movies in the future and I hate the rate at this rate today, but this film has always been judged by everyone and in my opinion it is great with this clinging and test tube chilly Able to decide. You go there to be. Today I'm also laughing at all the horror but this one thinks to me and if I'm disappointed after watching this movie, kill me when I kill me, do not make a movie-just tell the story and ask yourself how far this kid is going for?
