The film I was about to review was a 1996 small television film and starred Melissa Jon Hart and Daniel Baldwin. <br /> <br /> The main character / adversary Jennifer Stanton (Hart) is an exclusive American teenager who is under pressure from such controlled father (Baldwin). Nevertheless, when she meets Nick Ryan (Jeremy Jordan, a former con called "no kiss") they are instantly 'fall' to each other, but Jennifer has a different idea of ​​where to take their relationship. She anchored her to kill her parents, killing her parents, but she used her to get rid of her parents, so she would be with Brad (with David Lauscher's future subsequent 'Sabrina' starring Hart). Melissa Joan Hart actually surprised me with her role as a nasty manipulator and she kills her using her friends and Nik, so she literally gets away with murder. The rest of the cast will work well and they have their own time every time. Hart, Sabrina, began playing the role of Teenage Witch in the same year that I was doing this film and showed that it can be featured in my genre and television genres. Her work with drama or thriller has been somewhat stills and I look forward to the "Nine Dead" that came out in November because she can see other people not called "Clarissa Darling" <br /> Melissa Jon Hart or Sabrina Fan I would recommend this picture to anyone.
