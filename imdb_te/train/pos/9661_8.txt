Betty Betty won a year Emmy for Bethel Mitchell after losing Emmy for her performance as a maiden version of GYPSY: Divas Las Vegas, a live concert special for HBO from Las Vegas. Midler, who performed live on the stage since the 1970s, has proven that she is still one of the most electric live performers in the business. From her starting number, she commands the stage with style and attraction from a wrap style number called her "Classic" Friends, Bottle "I Look Good" from the wings on a beautiful prop cloud, Because of the connecting, some of the business in this business has a way to joke like other actors. Her respective punctuation is part of a slightly overdue program but she jokes her old sophie tucker jokes for a good purpose (though she forgets a joke between what she says, it's silly until she remembers). Betty has been a shameless plug for her title tune and her hit film The First Weiss Club from GYSSY and "The Rose" from "Rose's Turn". From ROSE "Stay With Me, Baby" and her # 1 hit record, brings her home to the end with "Wind Benid My My Wings" from BEACHES. It's a dazzling evening for musical comedy entertainment and for midlife fans.
