It's a great, humorous horror film that captures the essence of the siege in the late 80s when it is necessary to control bad metal music. When I was a kid I was freaked out by metal teens. At the age of ten, I found an unclean grave in my hometown of the graveyard. This unnatural metal boy is dug some old bodies and their bones are used in some strange sacrifices to Satan. <br /> <br /> I purchased this DVD for 6 bucks and I thought it would be good because of the slack. , But to my surprise, it ruled. It's about the force of the ghost of metal. And you shoot a guitar laser and headbangers evaporate in the crowd. The film is awesome, if you like 80 metal and bad movies, it's for you. 9/10!
