** Possible spoiler *** Adam Sandler typically typographically in comedy, but in "Rein", gives a deep motion performance. The people who showed the boldness on September 11, 2001, wanted to meet Sandler Finlayman, the lone and the "Old Times." We are also emotional and withdrawing under pressure from Rhineman (Dustin Hoffman), Fineman. His music is a soothing and "psychological" coach appears. <br /> <br /> Johnson is looking for Fineman, his family. He was happy and satisfied with his job. In the same case, he also wants to make sure that his friend does not come through social "fractures" .I have a different outlook and more sympathy for the families that mourn away from this film.
