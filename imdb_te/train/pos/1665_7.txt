The film looked like a walk-in for "Immoral Study". I never participated in the burning of a female artist to keep the naked nude alive, so "now this penis has attracted me?" Sound a bit abusive. Dialogues in this movie are terrible, although the film has its movements. When Tassi came into painting a mental picture I almost did not dig but then the film weered back into the penises. Highly recommended for those who have never seen one at a time.
