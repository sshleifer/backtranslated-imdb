It's a very good movie and it's totally unfair to judge it without taking into account when it's released. There are some films that are not old, but this is clearly outdated. However, the film is a boy and I have not forgotten stories for more than twenty years and I can not forget many of my friends, and I have seen them again to congratulate on DVD. Actually, I remember talking to the older boys in the chapters such as many chats and conferences that we recall from this movie. Even when disappointed in the DD, there is suffering too. First, there is the doctrine of how innocent our generation is. Secondly, I think that's something more. I feel that this film is interesting to all modern filmmakers, especially those who focus on decaying horror style. This is the idea of ​​annihilation and cinema; Taking man's pieces more than death and violence produces a deep horror. When Kirst's arm breaks the monster, I remember any sickness. And at the end; The doctor knees to remove a fragment of the veins. Another great thing is that in a secret laboratory, if a person in a car is in a lonely street looking for a woman's body, for a striker dressing room, and so on. This may be the reasons that good film is not just technical work. For example, the scene of the accident and the person who saved his fiancée's head is more precise, making it for another and modern second unit director of the unit. The same thing with all action scenes, including Kurt's hand. Moreover, the monster can do something that is made. Some reconstructions are good. I think it's worth a try in this case. However, black and white tones should be preserved.
