This is WWE's second best PPV after WrestleMania, which is a good success! John Cena has an amazing match that Chris has disturbed Jericho. Jeff Hardy retained his IC title in a small baggy match with Villa Regal. Bubba & Spike Dudley won overly violent tables on Benoit & Guerrero. Jamie had a good match with Noble Kidman, which bumped me up. Booker Ti Big Show defeated No dq match, at one time the Booker Tick Big Show gave a scissor kick and sent him right in the chart. In extreme decisions by WWE Christian and Lance Storm, anti-jealous Americans defeated Hogan and Edgz with a lot of help from Test and Jericho. RVD and Brooks have a high-profile night match, and RVD has signed his D. Triple H with Eric Bischoff and Raw, which is not small. Kurt Angle & Undertaker, who rocked the first 7-time WWE World Champion in the main event, beat the triple threat match. Overall this was probably WWE's second best PPV of 2002! 7/10
