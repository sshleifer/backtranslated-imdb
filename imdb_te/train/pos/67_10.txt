The industry has reduced this ball. The trailer does not do the film justice and when it is open it is full of screens. Seeing people, the oral work was very successful. Each of the two main actresses really give you great emotional appearances in the story and especially the characters you draw. I recommend Raw Richard Roper or (Ebert and Roper) based on his book. An example of a great film that is completely released except on some screens. It's not possible to see it. Some movies quickly go to the video because they are not good. This is an Oscar worth and it is also tragedy at many levels. Perhaps the word of mouth receives the following on a DVD or cable. If you do not see this movie. The great performances of 2 main actresses make this film. This is another principle teen film after schooling, but instead it stands out to other notable films. Girl interrupts. If you like it you will like it. <br /> <br /> Two of the girls are in dramatic emotional scene after another, not dramatic. Though Alicia is angry, even though Deanah screamed through the film, they are such a real way, which are not stereotypical characters or dramatic. The film moves you in many scenes and if you're an exciting actor use these real appearances in your school. Erica is better in this case than in traffic. Both of these actors get the characters that use their talents and shine on them. Watch this movie and recommend friends if you like, so it will not be lost in all the blockbuster trash that comes out every year. The film surpassed Spiderman 2 records. What kind of words do we live in? AGHhh. So to see the world again and to recommend it.
