This is a very stupid image. Realistic performances, particularly mental and art-household meanings in real locations such as Daddy and Cody and Bad Boy, are all good, failing because the director does not take any position, he makes a critical comment on the subject of his appointment. One of France's respectable and regular work partner in films with Depardieu - I believe they've done together 7 - failed to engage Pialat. It is a Scripture why they come for the bad boy who hurt when they are a ready caring boyfriend and a good-hearted husband around. Isabelle Hubert plays the distinctive character of the philosopher's role, providing misunderstandings like "I do not know"; "I liked his hands"; The husband asked her to leave her home, "I love to love" but the Paliates and the reviewers ... because I think she loves her. So he agrees with it, and what does he expect? She wakes up one day and comes to her feelings. Polyatt's frustration with lengthy lectures and long sequences without answers like these. I know that answers can not be added but please stand. Jules and Jim, it's not. The last shot we saw was a heartache and headache that was too forgiving last shot.
