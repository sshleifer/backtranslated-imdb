When it comes to the romantic genre, I am fortunate to get from the first 20 minutes or not looking for or watching. This image is different. Julie Davis (I Love You Do not Touch Me) has directed these two outstanding lead actors Kira Reed and Doug Jeffery in this thrilling thriller. Doug Geoffrey's "The Man" was a sweet stranger's seduction of the web as a sweet and romantic novelist for Kira "Kim". Kira controls the restrictions in this role and gives what she has to do with another T and depth and loyalty. I believe it is still her best performance. And the romance directed by Julie Davis is a great gift.
