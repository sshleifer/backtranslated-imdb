First let me know, I have a cerebral palsy and I want to do the permissions for the main character. Even though I knew that it was not the case, I was able to cast a half-the-the-the-star to act as an actor with a cerebral palsy in the role. The performances are generally great for Brenda Fricker and Hugh O'Connor (I believe in his name), especially as young Christie Brown. Christie is talented, brush, proud, indulgent at times and in domestic animals - in other words, man. This film, along with the Gaby: A True Story and documentary King Gimp, is a wonderful picture of your life with CP. That is not a complete picture, but good examples for the disabled as a human being. Highly recommended.
