While Rome celebrates Hitler's visit - uniforms, bands, parades - two outsiders stay at home, large building, and meeting. She is Sophia Loren, a six-pricked brutal civil servant and mother's wife. He was a fan of Maestroani, a radio speaker because of his homosexuality. Both require company and understanding, both of them will find each other. <br /> <br /> This film is for a few hours from time to time. The color deteriorates and everything happens with military marchs and crazy radio announcers sound track. Surprisingly, the Nazi song - Horst-Vesel-Lied - turns into a romantic music theme. <br /> <br /> Beautiful history, a unique era in Italian history is a fabulous entertainment and touching, sad story. Maestroani looks good as we look forward and Sofia Loren is doing an awesome job, far from the typical truck driver's pin-up, Napoleon Fish Wife Persons. Do not miss it.
