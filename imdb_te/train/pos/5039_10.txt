Excellent. Absolutely amazing. This is a sudden sight of the father of two children. He tells an angel that he is visiting him, and they say that they need to kill "demons". He gets the instructions later, and they begin to round up the naked eye, the common people, the monsters, They killed the so-called demons in the rose garden, killing them with axes, chopping them with axes. Their father tells them that he can see their sins when he touches them. <br /> <br /> What I love about this film is that it captures the weakness of human perception. Is their father completely mad? Or, is he telling the truth? The audience is determined. Take your judgment and look at the movie. Now.
