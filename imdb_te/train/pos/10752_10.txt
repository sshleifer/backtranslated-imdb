This is the most visually amazing, moving, exciting and exciting story I have ever experienced. Most obviously, those features can not be explained. I can not just choose a scene that stood out for me. I think a list of firefighters can be listed as crashing sounds of jumping victims. The response of the people trapped in the elevator, they do not know what is going on, and finally they come to the horrific scene; Shock and disbelief of onlookers; And finally silence. <br /> <br /> That day, and now also, I remember Star Wars (1977). Opi-von said, "suddenly millions of sounds suddenly cried for fear and suddenly silenced. It is amazing how precisely this is in its description. <br /> <br /> This documentary clearly expresses the disturbance. The feelings are very visible. Anger, depression, shock, fear, fatigue, and its size. It's right there. <br /> <br /> It is a powerful and very moving documentary and well-deserved to Emmy. It's 9/11 papers but because it just has to be everything. <br /> If you want to see, be sure to catch the tissue box. You need it. I know I did.
