Yes, it was unbelievable that won the Academy Award for a Musical Best Picture in 1968 - it was the award-winning third genre of five years, the first being My Fair Lady in 1964 and The Sound Music in 1965. My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music and Oliver! Oliver! Very nice! Not comparable. The first two films were lightweight noodles. Performance was great; The songs are great; The story is great and the dance is great. The film is dynamic, timely, related to human experience and unlike New York's biggest gangs, Oliver! In the 19th century, London provides a depiction of poverty in England, which increases sympathy without despair. Oliver Reed is a great actor and he has proven in Oliver! Other actors and actresses, most notably Ron Moody and Shani Vallis, are equally superb and sarcastically offer powerful imagery with characters that evoke sympathetic and warmth.
