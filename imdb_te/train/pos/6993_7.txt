It's not Bella Lagosi's best film, but it has a good old style approach for the 40-year-old horror entertainer. <br /> <br /> The bride who dies at the altar like a bride will die. I think I'll postpone the marriage after getting rotten, but it's a horror movie, so people do not care for some reason. However, Lagosi is a mad doctor, young man needs blood to stay old, healthy and healthy. <br /> <br /> "We're going to have a loyal lane type woman who wants to catch her own criminal." It's good to solve the crimes, Imagine the person who had chosen Lagosi for his next intended victim, badly for her to shut her mouth at all wrong times when I was as a guest in the Lane Lagoi's dangerous building like "Hunt House "bit like a hidden passageway, a vampire-like wife, a bad dwarf Igor assistant and others. <br /> <br /> The most well-made passing makes the movie shaken and the story resolves in a distinct or satisfactory way. If you want horror movies, it's a watch value.
