Four great stories from Master Robert Bloch, founded in the field of the best actors screen in the early seventies, are the foundation of this magnificent amicus production. Sixties in the mid-sixties is a very popular movie and it is one of my favorite types of horror movies. Sweet to the Sweet, especially for the episode, Christopher Lee is a poor little boy and heir to his mother's tradition. Very fun and very good from start to finish with the other three parts (with a bit of late on the comic side, but the great addition to Ingrid Pitt, the most famous vampire of the English cinema.
