I'm not alive in 60 years, so I can not guarantee that this film is a perfect representation of time, but it's definitely a moving and saturated experience. Josh Hamilton (with honors), Jerry O'Connell (Sliders) have some spectacular performances, the brothers divided the war. Bill Smithrich, a largely neglected character, gives the actor a heartfelt performance as their perfect father, who forces him to question his own beliefs and values, one of his sons goes to Vietnam and proud of him, another is exactly the opposite. All in all, this is a powerful and heartfelt picture I hope everyone will get the chance to experience.
