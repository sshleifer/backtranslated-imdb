I am in France on March 5th, and I would like to go to the festival. I knew about this syminmas de Americ Latin di Toulouse, but I never went. I decided to go and then I Cero y Van 4. <br /> <br /> The image is excellent. This does not have the same effect as Mexican users, because it is French-subtitled but it is still surprising. <br /> <br /> This film is a caricature of urban violence about kidnapping and crime on the streets. In Mexico. This is a raw image of the city. A metropolis. Securus Express with a magnificent Mia Maestro, is almost a satire of kidnapping, but has a very serious tone, and I think so, some very much connection with Sero y Van 4. A, sort, redemption story and how much that? Fire on Man, it's pretty awesome, it's not even a satire, but a raw picture on the streets of Mexico. Or it sounds like a brave one. Shocks and a very strongly beaten image. This is a common suspicion, which has some plot twists and turns, but it makes it more reliable. Verdict: A picture that makes shocks and believes that you no longer have any security on the streets. Excellent conversation, impressive direction and amazing performances. Sero wi von 4 You can not forget the sooner. You shake and stagger leaves.
