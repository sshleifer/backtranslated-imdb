Director Douglas Cirk once said, "There is very little distance between high art and rubbish, and this is the quality that is close to the worst art of garbage. <br /> <br /> The term defines its film in its classic stages of introduction, And war films, Western and his famous melodramas. <br /> <br /> The melodies of Cirk, the melodies of music The music set the tone for his master style, and his brush each stroke (cirk also a painter) leaves a powerful image on the screen-canvas, but it's not life, its representation, the simulation of life.Cirk did not try to show reality in contrast to the directors of his generation Nobody has used all the technical instruments Hollywood provided (especially Tek Niccolar) to be artificial from the realistic object. Let us remember his golden time equally when he turned his attention into the Hollywood films of social drama (Black Bird Jungle, an unreasonable rebellion). <br /> Another statement by Sirk is summed up in this way : "You can not reach or touch the truth. You see reflections. If you try to extract happiness, only your fingers meet the glass. I'll explain that I've seen anyone writing on the air to count the mirrors and images that reflect the visible images on the screen. <br /> <br /> So we're in a room full of mirrors because there is no difference between real and its wrong copy. No one can say that Hadley is real people. The town is not the real one, the dark oil pumps more than anything. So acting in this kingdom is affected, Dekor fake, trick appears. Everything is slightly backwards from the limit (for example sexually intertwined with Dorothy Malone's oil tower), for example. Cirk criticized and theoretically at the same time. <br /> Thoughts of angles directors; His philosophy of lighting '. When we write in the air, we make a conservative way of life in the geometric way and fall in terms of light and shadows. The Harley's House is perfectly metaphorical with different levels connected by its rotation steps. A house similar to a mosque, no party will be happy. As the tragedy sticks from obscure daylight to shadow night, photography of the cork is extended to the interior of his characters and the colors they wear. <br /> <br /> Sirk was thinking of himself as 'Story Bender', because he was bound by his style and intention. Written on the air is a good example. It does not work in any other hands. <br /> <br /> Another director of the same strategy, Frank Tashlin, is for 50 comedy for the Cirque drama. Their lives are American life-newspapers, TV sets, boxes, washing machines, sports cars, vacuum cleaner machines - portraying its vacuity and decay. I thought their films were treated differently by their contemporary audience. The game has played on both sides, so it's camp. Now we think of them as 'cult' or 'bizarre' because we are not that audience. Thus, the remakes of Todd Haynes's 'away from heaven' because the cirk work is reproduced because nothing has happened. Circl Julianne Moore and gardeners then change into the art gallery that discusses the above picture. <br /> <br /> Circus understands the elements of the play correctly. He has consistent characters (Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall), where he can assemble a series of splits. By controversy his balance is remarkable and surprisingly we will root for split characters because Cirk is very interested. Robert Stack and the 'temporarily' Lauren Buckal we are very fond of him when he flies with Lauren Buckal (apparently Foston echoes) all the worldly problems in the world. <br /> <br /> The studio often puts 'happy ends' in Cirk's universe, not. In fact they did great work. The likeness of the Sirk Greek tragedy and the deukes of his day were considered to be happy endings for the former engineer. We know that the ultimate court scene is well enough and remember that the whole picture is past, so we know that tragic events on Hadley's feed are coming. <br /> <br /> There are many similarities between the one on the wind that is written with the Godfather Saga. I absolutely agree and I'm sure parallel is not random. The oldest father's father is trying to maintain his empire when saving his family. Robert Stack has a staggering bodily resemblance with Jimmy Ken's sonny Corleone, the son of the restrained son. Action against her sister's friend is symmetrical. Two families are carrying their urban names, and in the two films the old man is the son of his trust. The gate and details of access to property also indicate that the surroundings of the covered house are written in Coppola's mind when setting up his skill. Both films deal with the power of power: power, its manipulation and legacy (Kyle Hadley's infertility, confusion speed program, in this case, is easily linked to the central point of weakness, sexual power). Citizen Kane is another great film that uses the power and uses American life as its representation. The first of the similarities between Wallace and Cirk images is not thought of, but the petrol business began with the family's fortunes, and Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson), Charles Foster Kane, received a trainer, his own father alive. Amazingly, the same actor (Harry Shannon) made both Wayne and Kane's fathers. These details are not coincidental. <br /> <br /> In this exciting director's career the style and technique, style and strategy, in every aspect, is written in a parasite in each subject. Some say that this is his best film. In my opinion, `amazing pitches ',` that heaven all lets', 'tomorrow is always' and 'simulation of life' is just good. And for those who have put Cirk at Dallas or Dynasty levels, I wish them a happy ending.
