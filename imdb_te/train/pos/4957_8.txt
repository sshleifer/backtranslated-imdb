In less than two weeks by 10 stories or writers / authors / writer / director Brad Silberling, a little film shot in Carson, CA seems to be like the whole story ... has been improved in the best sense of the word. Among his big projects with Spanish actress Paz Vega, he has good wealth to add to the legendary actor Morgan Freeman, resulting in a conversation between two individuals from different maneuvers performed to improve other lives. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman plays his role - although in comedy he is portrayed as an actor for four years, scouting a place for a small 'filer film. His 'role' is a market manager and he is eliminated in the CD market in Carson, where he, along with others, a Scarlett, faces 10 arguments or a little checkout line. Scarlett is tired of her consistent work, she is usually sleeping with Scarlet's lazy colleague (Anne Dudeck), and she is generally angry with her parents' husband (Bobby Cannawale) because she has the ability to get a better job in other places. <br /> <br /> Two couples after some participating issues, they went to the 'road trip', which refers to the presence of the other and the rising characters from the life story. <br /> <br /> This is a simple story, just said, but it's very good because the tender relationship between the freeman and the pause. This is one of those small films about human conversion. It's well worth it, and it's a pleasure to watch a DVD that has touching, informative, and comic features. Grady Harp
