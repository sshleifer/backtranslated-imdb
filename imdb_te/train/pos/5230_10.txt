Actually I liked this movie. Because it's plot, acting, jokes, not. This is one of the worst films I've created because I liked it. It is very dirty, so terrible, it becomes terrible funny. Some jokes are actually cool, but the rest of you pray for unemployment for a script writer. "White men" so dumb and stupid, you can do just two things. Turn on the TV or laugh on the ground (beer is very helpful :). I chose the second option.
