At the start of the journey Rose Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) meets the lower class artist when he goes to the United States after winning his ticket on the Titanic game in the pakar game. If he wanted anything, he would go and not as the upper class that was concerned with their social concerns. <br /> <br /> Titanic sinks in love and the fall of two in the audience primarily through their eyes. <br /> <br /> The film begins in modern times. Titanic, which has recently occurred. Titanic, who has learned about the ruins of television, finds a man named Rose Davit Bucketter who flies to the boat from searching for an intriguing search to help explore. She remembered the only one of the Titanic's sailing journeys. The scene turns to Southhampton in Ireland, where Titanic traveled with passengers on April 10, 1912. After another stop on the Irish coast, Titanic walked out to see the first voyage of the Atlantic for New York. Historically, for the first time the journey did not go for a few days, but at this time the fictional story of the story grew, and Rose was in her wealthy call hackle and the third class passenger, Jack Dawson. Captain Smith has been asked by the White Star Line Director as shown in the film, which will receive additional newspaper and newspapers in the newspaper headlines and in New York on Friday morning. Smith was lucky to expand the titanic legs at full speed for his thirty-two years experience. Titanic reported that submarines in Atlantic were filled with ice, but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the figure. On April 15, 1912, 11:39, an iceberg was sighted. They tried to close the engines and repel the ship to the iceberg, but there was not enough time and the iceboard was shot on the starboardboard. Many small pores of the side and the bigger sides of the side are precise. The Titanic team called the grieving calls and suffered to show up to 2:18 when the nights finally failed. California's lights appeared six miles away, but they failed to realize what was going on and did not react to Titanic's many requests for help. Titanic warns of heavy snow on the thirty days of California, which led to stopping their yatra, but Titanic California dissolved its radio and dissolved them for leaving Titanic. The twenty-class boats on the ship have first class women and children. Third class passengers of high class enjoyed many deaths of any class, and the crew was severely damaged by this tragedy. While the term is believed to be the second and third class passengers for white star line employees and first-class passengers, authorities are trying to get drowning information. Also, the metal used to build Titanic has been found in recent years under severe cold conditions, which is very fragile to nighttime titanic. Overall, these events are more accurate in its match in events and timings on Titanic. <br /> <br /> Many characters in this story are not real, the purpose of the film or the combined characters represent the people's possible properties and ideas in the ship. Fictional characters are included in the story when reflecting different groups from Rose, Jack, Call, and Rose's major group of stories. And many characters such as the all-skinny Molly Brown; Captain Edward Smith; Ship designer, Thomas Andrew; White Star Line Representative, Bruce Isme; And all the Titanic officers are real. Kajal's voyage to Captain Edward Smith's final voyage, however, is when he is going to retire later. He was a part of the White Star line since 1880, where millions were reaching his rank as captain when he sank in Titanic. Officers threatened to kill the passengers of the ships, except the only four who survived the tragedy. He is in the record for the role of the protagonist, and James Cameron apologized and created a memorial in his honor at the former Canadian resident. As shown in the picture, there is a language problem between staff and low-level passengers from non-English speaking countries. In addition, Officer Lou is the only officer to return to lifeboat. Straws were older people who showed water in their bed in their bedroom. Mrs. not to leave her husband's side. Strauss died with her husband on Titanic after refusing her lifeboat. Furthermore, Mr. Goggenheim showed that he cut his brandy and smoked Cigar, thus saying his best dress was wearing. John Jacob Astor, a wealthy man in the ship, was found dead in a large part of Manhattan but died in his little wife's lifeboat. Moreover, Molly Brown was saved, and later the medals produced by Cortétia staff emerged from Titanic's survival. Her ticket on Titanic ended with a cost of $ 4,000, and she broke her life for the rest of her life. The interior of the ship was formally converted to the final parts of China and silver. The rarely found gymnasium was rebuilt correctly with all machines reproduced to matches appearing in old photographs. Wonderful costume and costume is a wonderful re-creation of Victorian post-post of 1912. All the rich were practically ruled at this time because the women's vote movement was not moving further. Women at this time were often married for financial security, thinking to do ros and retain their status as a supervisor for their husbands, who wanted to call for Rose. The wealthy 'new money' is not as rich as described by Molly Brown. Everything of the time is very costume. Women are supposed to go to dinner by a male figure that appears in dining scenes. Smokers between women during smoking were not very common, with cigarettes coming in at the time, appearing in Rose. Men of time do not usually wear cigars as cigarettes. Women were physically present through their societies and socially communal. Although James Cameron did not have any background in historical films, he brought Titanic experts, spending two years of taking Titanic history and some liberties. <br /> <br /> In the movie, there is a significant message in the Titanic cinema that people in the ship have about three hours to think of their death. Director James Cameron shows many reactions during the crisis in people's lives. Everybody reacts to you and you think you can think of how you react in that titanic on that fateful night. Moreover, the film was a reflection in 1990 when giving a scrutiny on Titanic's wreck. Only true Titanic site has been found and explored for the past fifteen years. The film is much deeper in a disaster that most people do not see. However, there is a moral question that people take on wealth from the wreck of the underwater cemetery. Attempts have been made to retain a profitable wishes shot in Titanic, but they have failed. Anyone can ride to the Titanic while still standing today and take valuable items they have painted in the picture showing the usual values ​​of our time. <br /> Technically, the film is very well made. Receiving all the footage needed to visualize twelve dice to get rid of the ruins of the sea below the sea. In addition, a special camera was created to withstand severe stress on the lower part of the ocean. Cameron was not planning to use the probe to go far beyond the Titan, as it was in the 88 years since the harbor was drowning, but it provided a distinctive perspective on the ship. Moreover, filming and outbursts were filmed from Titanic's devastation during Titanic's virtual journey. This transition between the modern scene of the last scene in the voyage serves as a neat transition, making it easier to follow the story. At the beginning of the film is used to recreate a sequel entertaining scene, and real people from Titanic's remaining events have left the coast of Europe on Titanic. <br /> <br /> The Titanic is almost like a historic biography and the work of art is like a real epic. Like most history novels, we know the ending, but do not get away from the wonderful treats found in the film. Some of the elements of the film include attire, sound, syntomatography and compilation, including the Academy Award material. If you want to give an insight into the lives of characters in the early 1900s and if they like the interesting characters they are experiencing, then the film is perfect for you.
