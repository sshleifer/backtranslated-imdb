My girlfriend and I have one thing for robots. I will try to find movies that have robots. And the film is robots. Exaggerated. They beat short and bang from each other, the fate of the nations hanging in balance. It's great. You have to forgive many of these errors and appreciate what the directors and staff of staff are able to put on screen when working with a tight budget. This film is very difficult to like. That's because of the big robots. They looked like transformers and they battled like pro-rollers! This made my girlfriend smile. And that's good for me. And special mention should be made of celebrity character actor Paul Coslow: maniacal Russian villain, he recklessly tasted whether he is already surrendered or stomping on his helpless opponents after complaining after their proximity close to him in a bar causing his vodka "is like blood" A line with an immense campy sub-bela lugosy accent) Sp Tanga on the screen whenever he had the ball, and the film has to be profitable. This is a nifty small image that deserves its culture reputation.
