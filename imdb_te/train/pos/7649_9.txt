Jim Ballusi Vehicle, a modern cocked version of it's a wonderful life. Michael Cain plays a form of angelic character, and if he is "big," I see how life is. Jim is fine with a good story and a supporting cast; It looks like a real chemistry between him and Hamilton. Not an Oscar contestant but good warmth.
