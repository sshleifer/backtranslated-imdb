This film made me wonder. It has never had a touching, off-center approach without losing your attention. This is a movie I've never heard of, but if you want a "sleeper", this is it. Great writing, production and acting. I recommend this to a very thoughtable audience. Nick Nolte, Sheryl Lee and Alan Arkin are superb. Why not make this movie more?
