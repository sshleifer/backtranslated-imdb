"My Lips Read" tells a strange coexistence which is developed between a plain, socially maladroit female office worker (Devos) and her workplace trainee, a raw excon (Casel). This rare duo enters their IDs when they open up the film, sparking their minds sprinkling, everyone using their own selfish reasons with an outstanding outcome. Character-based films with powerful psychodromatic under-careers are good for anyone. Easy to read subtitles and good translation French. (B +)
