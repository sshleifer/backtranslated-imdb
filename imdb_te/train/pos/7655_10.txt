I have not seen this movie in nearly 20 years, and I'm still upset with starry and starry. In fact, Mr. Mickey Rooney is truly the best in a Ring-Leading "Killer" role. (Referring to another review - Mickey Rooney's name is also a great actor, except for Orson Welles). I also remember the jazz-brass score and bear black and white photography. I love Mick's final line before he goes for his dose of lead poisoning (I think the stranger lifted it up a line of their songs - Get a Grip on Yourself.) This is a great film and unfairly buried movie. Let's get it! Side Note - Recent film review Magazine gave Daggers a sequel to Segal's "Babyface Nelson", two years before "Last Mile" and Mickey Rooney. Another rack of Mick's serious and sympathetic appearance. Perhaps this is really a good way to get some great superficial performances.
