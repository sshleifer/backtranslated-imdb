I love the bed knobs and broomsticks will cry a thousand thousand tears of joy every time I have the amazing pleasure of seeing it. I would like to reiterate the simple fact that I have a lot of trouble. I have 27 copies in the video and I love them equally. I also love someone who loves. I love you. My favorite scene is the dance scene in Portobello Road. I learned dance moves and practiced everyday. There are some audio recording songs I sing. I hope anyone can call drums or guitar if someone hopes to call the band knobs and broomsticks band.i 'knobs'. Love me (liz)
