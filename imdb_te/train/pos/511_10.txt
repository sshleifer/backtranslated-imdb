It was 21 years ago when I first saw this image as an ITV (before the days of cable and satellite). I was schooled with mums and I was completely wrapped in the film. I have on video purchased for about 10 years and I want to obtain a copy of its DVD. David Niven is my time favorite actor and I feel like a travesty that he has seen many times when I come to the Oscars. I think the Queen recognizes him because he can not do much for the film industry than Sean Connery or Anthony Hopkins. The film is black and white and will be repeated again, and the film has stellar stars such as Roger Lytty, Marius Goring and an opening performance from Richard Attenborough.
