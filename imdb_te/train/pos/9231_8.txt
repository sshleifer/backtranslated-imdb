<br /> <br /> When we follow Flavia in a strange tour, Flevia has a strange entry into the HERETIC nonsploit style - sleaze of equal parts, feminine travel, and "history". She does not believe in the male-dominated "rules" of her world around him and her escape from the concoction with Macho-Is and her Jewish friend, Abraham. They eventually get trapped and brought back to Floria Conway, where she joined another "treacherous" monk by speeding up the Muslim invasion. Fleaia gets out of the canvas and flees with females who are "busy" with nuns in monks' scene. Eventually, the Muslime's Roll Out and Flavia were convicted of being cruel to the other cruel scene of Christianity. <br /> <br /> In this case, I'm in the 70-year era - some good lamb, nipple-removal, and a good leg-combination scene, some good nudity - needed full-frontal and good story Including the narrative. I can say that I am thrown in a few points, but it is not enough to really get bored. I would definitely recommend this to Nunsploit / 70's exploit fans ... 8/10
