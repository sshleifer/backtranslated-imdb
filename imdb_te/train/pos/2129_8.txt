Sweet romantic drama / comedy love letters about Stewart and Sullivan provide love to each other without knowing someone else. Naturally, they work together and can not stand each other. You can guess the rest. It has a pretty witty, clever script, and is absolutely fantastic, with pretty much the whole cast (particularly Salavan, Stewart and Frank Morgan). It happens in Budapest and filmed in Hollywood, but I believe I saw Budapest! Everything looks so perfect and dream. One is a kind of picture. Do not miss!
