It was one of the genuine love stories I've ever seen for the ages, especially the film-based (brief) film. In fact it is a story based on two worlds, which is a real one, another fiction, but the filmmakers speak in the beginning, it is only a coincidence. However, Peter Carter (The Great David Niven) was going to crash on an airplane, who spoke to him for June (Apple's Kim Hunter Planet) and said he loved her. He meant to die from jumping without a parachute, but something he survived, and now he is loving and loving loving June in the flesh. This other place like heaven is happy because he has survived and sent the French conductor 71 (Marius GÃ¶ring) to persuade him, but he is in love with the intention of coming to their world. Peter suggests that he will appeal his life to the other world court, which he grants it. When two lovers announce that they die each other, there is natural love, and June also comes to its place! Robert Coet Bob Tribbshaw, Kathleen Byron as An Eugle, briefly (now unknown) Lord Sir Richard Attenborough as an English pilot and The Judges / the Surgeon as Abraham Soufer. David Niven won 36th of the 36 Greatest Giant British Actors, number 47 in the 100 Greatest British Films, No. 47 in The 100 Greatest British Films, and No. 100 in the 100 Greatest Films for the Most End of the 100 Greatest Tearjakers Is in place. Fabulous!
