This plot: combines 3 different muffings in a criminal charge to buy a criminal, then acts as a cash-transfer facility for organized crime. To prevent it, the FBI seeks to bust one of the Mafia Lords. By mistake, and some unlikely plot twists and turns, we have another "one another unpleasant coffee buddies" film ... a female FBI agent, and the other a female ex-DEA agent <br /> <br /> Stupid, so far. But the strength of this film is not in its story - a poor joke, better. It's funny. (At least the German synchronized version). With a memorable scene involving a shotgun and a rocket launcher, it's very good. But the vision is ridiculous. Not the clever satire, not too applause, but somewhere in between, you get a lot of funny jokes. <br /> <br /> The film is against political correctness. Legal drug abuse can be prominent, without criticism, and it's cooler. The film bit annoyed me, and in my opinion it was not suitable for kids. <br /> <br /> <br /> All in all, the action is acceptable with some funny jokes for watching a nice evening, this film is perfect. Just remember: In this genre, it is common to leave your brain at the door when you enter the movie / TV room. Then you have a good time. 8/10
