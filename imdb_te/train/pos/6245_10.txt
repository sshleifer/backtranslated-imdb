"Huntstage" is the first fictional movie of Cedel (previously known as "animal love" or "designs"). Seedl worked more than 3 years in this project, but it cost only $ 2 million. Actors are very good, especially non-professional actors. Cinematography is great. The whole movie is awesome and some scenes may be very high for the "normal" audience. The film shows a lot of sex and violence but people are not alone and can not communicate with each other. In the end I have said that this is one of the best and most prized Austrian films of these past years. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for my bad English <br /> <br />
