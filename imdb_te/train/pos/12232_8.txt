As a film collector, I had to buy a movie poster for this film, now I finally saw it and it's great. There is nothing more attractive to hang on your wall than the 27x41 inch image of the melting man. However, there is nothing more terrible to place on your VCR than a man's one-and-a-half-long image. At first I felt this film was pure rubbish but realized I had some features that made me laugh. Dr. Ted Nelson's character is always the most desirable person who has brought to the big screen. His conversation is wonderful, this is unbelievable! <br /> How would Heck tell him how much time Steve had left before he completely melted, and would the plan "help" him? If the film intended to intimidate its audience, I think I would lose its call.
