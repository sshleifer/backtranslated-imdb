I've enjoyed a lot more crazy than the film I've seen over the years. The successful band of 70s decides to give another effort. They start by playing some gigs with some seedy European venues, hilarious results. The music is wonderful, the script and the acting are excellent. Characters, especially Heavy Heavy Metal Voice, makeup and personality issues lead singer. At the end of the concert is unreal. Go ahead and watch in a good sound system.
