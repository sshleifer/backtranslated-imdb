The film has a great writing style. It has all the normal Colombo substances; Lefty. Colombo arrives to his suspect and is secretly a mysterious way for him, fortunately like him, Colombo's dog, cat and mouse play, and fortunate as well as a good humorous comedy. In fact it was written but not realistic. Colombo is a detective / murder novel author who hunted once more than once in the Colombo film. <br /> <br /> It is a well-directed film from James Froely, directed by 5 more Colombo films. '70 and 80's. He has provided the film with style and some great and memorable scenes. <br /> <br /> It is one of the slow-moving Colombo movies, although it has been running for a long time. <br /> <br /> This style and approach will never work well for a Colombo film, but it is not the least thanks to the performance of the film. <br /> <br /> Most of the filmmakers have starred in a leading actor or star from the early days of filmmaking, the film of its murderer. Ruth Gordon, who is 81 years old, is unlike the film. She did not star in all the horror films throughout her career but she is still well known for her role in "Rosemary Baby", which won her an Oscar. She has a real and some exceptional style of acting, some people may not like it. Before her success for "Rosemary's Baby" in 1969, she earned 4 Oscar nominations throughout her career. Peter Fall has some great interactions with her in their scenes. <br /> <br /> Still young GD pretends to be Spradlin. I am telling the young man that when he was already 57 years old at the time of this Colombo product I knew only about his latest work in his career. <br /> He is still alive but retired from acting since 1999. <br /> <br / > <br /> <br />
