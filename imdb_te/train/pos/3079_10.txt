Listening to an audio book, Campbell Scott Reader. I'm glad to hear his voice and brought back my disappointment that "Six Degrees" was canceled. They are never seen to keep good shows in the air to catch audiences who can connect with the story of the shows. This show is a disgrace and humiliating network without letting the full seasons out. It's a wonderful performance to watch this great performer. The second chance of the network "Men in Trees" was also a great witch, but they became "invasion" and, rather than the same old-fashioned old themes, were completely different to watch. Why networks do not get it right.
