A story of Martin's attempt to colonize the globe. (Things should be very bad on Mars.) Two state forces investigate the UFO crash scene. Despite the snow buried under Tracy's pond, there are footsteps in the snow leading to a nearby diner. <br /> There are no customers at 11 o'clock in the morning. There are quite a few bus passengers waiting for permission to cross the structurally weak bridge now. The bus driver claimed that there were six passengers in the bus, yet they were not able to see anyone. Seven people are now waiting to resume this problem. One of them is an alien, but what's this? All of them suspect. A silly old man (Jack Elm), of course, is who seems to exercise a sub-rosa wit. Boston (John Hoyt) is a businessman who is surely missing. Young couple in their honeymoon. (Exhibition performed by husband Ron Kipling), no one has ever been seen. And even couples are suspicious of each other. The bride's new husband's husband: "I swear that there was a mole on your beard." The story continues to be a sobering but slightly more horrific way - without any reason the phone rings, the lights go back and off, the jukebox revolves around it - nothing is taken seriously. <br /> <br /> It is worth a stew of a fully enjoyable ensemble play and climactic revelation. There is no clear "depth". This is not a moral message about the people who play as normal people. This is not a warning, it can only lead to a fairy tale and be closer. <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever it is always there, I will enjoy it. It is interesting to see John Hoyt as an angry and intolerant businessman, as the Roman Senator who killed Julius Caesar in the MGM version of Shakespeare's play in 1954. And here he is - with three hands. <br /> Alas.
