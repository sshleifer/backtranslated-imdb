I love the film, I'm deeply embarrassed. Without watching the film, I gave a thumbs to "Che, Part 1 and 2". I know terrible. But I thought in a trap I was doing ... who? I do not really know but there is a negative word of mouth spreading like wild fire and, I'm just how smart I'm, I fell. But fortunately, I'm an Argentine film director, Martin Donovan, I love and worship. When I told him I was going to see that the movie failed me, he was ready to send me on the face and Donovan was a peacekeeper! He left me and told me how he loved the movie and why. I looked at two parts directly, "Che, Part 1 and 2" is the best film I have ever seen in 2008. It's such a purity, it's some past of great masters. Its audience opinion is no longer used. I do not know if we can ever. Discounted, moving, without subsidies and Benisio del Toro is just extraordinary. We can see his soul, and we can actually understand it. Humanity of man is great. So, thank you Martin Martin Donovan. Bravo del Toro, Bravo Soderbergh and everyone who participated in this milestone. Do not make the mistake I'm committed to. See now on the big screen
