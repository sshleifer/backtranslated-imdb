An image that is discouraging is not a bad thing. If there is a point to be prepared, I'm very pleased to see the disappointing film and this is definitely one. This is a heartfelt story of the Chinese man and his family, with many difficulties and plenty of two years of experience. However, I have to warn that the 1930s might be a very depressing movie to get out of Hollywood - because the life of farmers in China is tough to say the least. Be prepared to see sections about drought, death and disease. <br /> <br /> Those who are more than a tone of persistent tone are played by Paul Muni. While he was exceptionally talented, Hollywood had always refused to play the Asian superiority in the epoch of European descent. If you are concerned, it is clear that the part of the Muni is wrong.
