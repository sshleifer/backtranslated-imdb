This amazing movie is one of the greatest films I have ever seen. It shows China that I have never seen or imagined, and I believe it shows in 1930 the most true light in a movie in China. It's a lot of situations in the heart, breaking out of the hard life for the characters, and the story and the end are very pleasant. In this picture you will see the depths and traces of human existence really. The actors are all perfect, and you feel like you have really entered a different world. <br /> <br /> "You can change yourself forever after seeing it.
