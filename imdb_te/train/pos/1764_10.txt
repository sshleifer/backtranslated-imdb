Steve Carel has starred in his own role in his first role as a 40-year-old Old Virgin with only supporting roles in Bevic, Bruce Almighty, Anchorman, and his work on the Daily Show, which Karel really makes his own piece of comedy. You say Ferrell will influence his "joke" but Karl says he will take another level, everything he does is innocent, friendly and happy. <br /> <br /> The 40-year-Old Old Virgin was a two-hour-long laughing (or if I see you for 4 hours), a full-fledged cast and great leads through the entire movie. The script is perfect with great lines, and you want to watch the film again to remember them again. Music makes the film's tone great, the director knows what he's doing. <br /> <br /> This movie filled with sexy jokes, some nudity and a lot of languages, but if you liked the wedding crushers, in Anchorman, or any image like that, you definitely love the 40 Year Old Virgin.
