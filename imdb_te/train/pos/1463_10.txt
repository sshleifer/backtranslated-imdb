Mardi Gras: Made in China offers an excellent, made up of nudity, nudity, and globality between popular culture and tossing beads. I saw this film at the Boston International Film Festival, and I thought it was a dry introduction to globalization, but I was surprised by both the scenes from both China and the United States. The eye-opening film is jolly, deep, intense, and unpleasant, and it deserves the role of credits. It's worth comparing Murderball - it just works well. Young women workers in China have different opinions, and the owner is wonderfully open about discipline. Reversals are highlighted during Carnival, but this provides a deep context in the factory industry in China without this amazing film storyline. Bravo to filmmaker in and out of the movie! I never thought of the relationship between beams, China and New Orleans; Now I am concerned about the human relationship between almost every thing, but also about globalization, inequality and fun characters. More importantly, unlike other images on globalization that I have seen, these connections can be made without the guilty feeling after seeing this film.
