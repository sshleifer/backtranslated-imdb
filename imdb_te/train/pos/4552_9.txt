Daniele de Lewis is one of the best performances by an actor in my left foot. He is a man with Christie Brown, a cerebral palsy, who learned to write and paint with his left foot. A well-deserved Oscar and Brenda Fricker plays the role of his loving mother. Hugh O'Connor is great as the younger Christie Brown and Ray McAnaly's father. Worth watching for excellent performances.
