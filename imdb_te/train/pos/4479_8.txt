I first saw Anchors Aweigh in 1945, and I had a lot of memories to see it on video tape. At the age of 15, it is easy for me to take the first of the great MGM technolar music. Now I'm very interested in thinking of future players of future players. Sorotta Sorroe made short films after her diaries in the days after her Dorsey singer, which was his first big film as a solo performer. As another viewer says, it is almost visible for town on the town. Sinatra has to work hard, but his dance with Kelly is reliable, and he does well in their next pairs. However, looking at his body, it is easy to see why he was portrayed as string bean. Who can imagine that in a decade he would win an Academy Award and acted as a strict detective or leader in the fight. Although Jean Kelly's dominance and dance have dominated the film, his spectacular performance did not indicate that he became a major creative force for MGM music, becoming an iconic figure where he developed Fred Astier's full dance style. Finally, it is strange to see the latest Dean Stockwell and remember that he played the role of a "thrill" killer in a compaction based on Leopold-Lobb murder since 1920. Additional note: A reviewer described Betty Garrett's performance as the love of Sinatra. She then starred in On the Town, but Pamela Britton starred in the film.
