This film is such an amazing piece of work, moving. When I came out I saw it in the theater, but I was not only 13 years old, it really was not "I was not ... I saw again when I was 20 years old (I'm now in the video of course)." From Steven Spielberg to the end I created a wonderful picture that keeps you wrapped up.I read the book as well It's something about the film that really brings you to life, acting, acting, music, dressing, scene, everything, it's amazing.You laugh, you cry, you cheer up ... it brings out every emotion imaginable. One of the work and not to miss!
