In the summer I saw the shooting of this movie for a long time, the final result is only two scenes in the film. This place is the Silvan lake in Black Hills. Take the cart and wag the tar. So this Dakota youth looked forward to seeing the movie and was not disappointed. The shooting scenes are real, as the local buffalo is removed. (Yes Doris, animals were hurt during the shooting) I think I copied through Jack Nicholson in the shining end? Great western / social comment from the 50s. It should be in the same class in the high none of the original western drama or used as a social statement, such as Blackboard Jungle or Rebel Without a Cause for 50 young people.
