It is one of Shem's first stories with Stuges. (Which is excluded from its previous earliest instrument with the team). But the timing of threesome is the best of its honed timing. Unlike serious movie scenes, others are more subtle, but are just funny. Look at Larry when she asks him to see the camera for a snapshot. <br /> <br /> Emol Sitka is at his disarray gopiest. And Goon can be seen scary, but he is something funny. <br /> <br /> For fans of Sheep, it must have an episode. It's not disappointing.
