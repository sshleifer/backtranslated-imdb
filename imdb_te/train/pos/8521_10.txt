I definitely liked this show. I saw it from the time when the first episode was broadcast at the end of the 90s. In my honesty opinion these days is a fantastic family play that is very rare. Exactly a performance can be seen with a friend or your children. Yes things have changed a bit in Zola since I have seen her in her books, but it still has great stories and good lessons. Children and students will learn daily stories and lessons between actress Joe and Nick, as well as actress Joe Bahr (Spencer Roachfort), who plays the role of Joe Bahr (Michael Burk). I recommend this presentation to anyone.
