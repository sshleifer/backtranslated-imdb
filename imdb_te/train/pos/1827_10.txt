All dogs go to heaven and are one of the best films I've ever seen. I saw the first time I was 3 years old. Now I'm 12 years old and I've rented it, I can think of things and it brings back many memories that "days". I love music, when I came in Charlie Heaven and I loved it, I love the song "Surprise Me". I see Charlie and how he loves his voice, Bert Reynolds can only make this Charlie's voice great. I love this movie, because it is original and great one of the 1st one is the best one. It really does not make me realize that no one can reproduce memories. If I could go back to that day. I love the characters. If I remember, when I recall when memories come back I imagine how I feel when I was 19, I hope I can see this when I am older. When I first look at it I know that I really look back and think this way, and I hope it will be available to watch. I'm very happy to make this film and the amazing idea came to mind and heart. From 1-10 I'd give a perfect 10. This is a fantastic picture. It is very difficult to describe the feeling, and if I have kids, I hope I can feel this feeling.
