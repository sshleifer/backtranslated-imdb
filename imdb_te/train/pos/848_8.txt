The unstable man from Danny sat on the balcony of his Mexico City hotel, turning it into "The Matter", while enjoying a quiet moment. Someone knocks on his door, and it's Julian, knowing the payment murderer, he refused to answer. But what did he really do? <br /> <br /> Richard Shepherd, Director of The Metadore, presents us with the character of Julie Noble, who shows us what he sells. In fact, we saw him in action, and he did the best thing he did. <br /> When the Camino Real Madrid bar in Mexico City meets Junior Dunny, he kills Beans and tells his new contacts to spend his life. <br /> <br /> Danny is a Mexican company to sell his programs, but he competes against a local outfit that appears to be in front of a contract. Danny is an innocent guy who gains intellectual Julian intelligence and charm. Not shortly after, during the winter night, the killer asked his friend at Danny Dorr to come back with him to repay a favor and return to Tucson. <br /> <br /> In this case, the secret that they are bound together is unexpectedly revealed. <br /> <br /> Pierce Brosnan, dealing with title, makes great effort with his priceless Julian Noble. His speed and boots give him the right impression about his role to see him through the hotel lobby. Greg Kinner, on the other hand, plays the straight part of this odd couple. Hope Davis will not only be a long time for us why sadness leaves us only visible. <br /> <br /> Philip Baker Hall appeared as a supplement between Julian and his works. <br /> <br /> Richard Shepherd directs the style of working with his own things. The musical score increases everything from Rolfe Kent and David Tatarscell's crisp cinematography.
