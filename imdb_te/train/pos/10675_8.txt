I want to see this film as a fan of both Peter Cushing and David McCullum. I agree that romantic sub-plots are time waste, but McCullum's talent shines through this juvie character. Thanks to the sky for Turner Classic, who last week's show. After the wars there were many problems with children, especially in the 1950s. Some of the boys are a little scary. I definitely would not want to meet them on a lit street, less a dark one. There are some good ideas about the feelings of a firebug, or when they call him a firefly.
