The original Vampires (1998) is one of my favorites. I thought they could not use the original characters in the sequel. I was very surprised how it was played. As a rule, the sequels are never good with some exceptions. Although this is not a great movie, the author has done well to keep the core themes and bloodthirsty tactical from the first. Jon Bon Jovi was initially a defect, but he proved to be a half-way good slayer. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a good watch and I can see it again. <BR <br /> <br /> I am left with two questions ... but what happens to Jack Crowe? How did Derek Bliss come as a slayer? Imagine anticipation.
