When I was 5, my grandmother bought me this movie (I've always loved scary movies) and I'm also enjoying it. The atmosphere is amazing and the story is original and entertaining. I especially love the scenes in the RV desert. The rocks are indeed convincing for a low budget movie. Acting is average for these types of movies and the music is fantastic. This is definitely a wuder-rated gem. I recommend anyone who likes these strange images from the last hundreds like "Alice, Sweet Alice", "Poor Pretty Eddie", "Nightmare", "Hospital Massacre", and "Return of the Aliens, The Deathly". !!
