Man, if someone is expecting a great zombie image after reading that title, then you're a retard and you deserve disappointment. For me, I was expecting a low-budget cheeseball zombie flick- and was sure I got it. I'm not disappointed at all. I thought it was a small movie. The zombies are all right, because they are all just zombies, so they are freshly undead zombies. They made pretty expensive if they made full-on-rotted zombie fx because they made it apparent. I understand the whole thing, someone does not know how to seriously nitpick this movie. It is called "the death and death" for the love of God! Do you want to see the film "Redneck Zombies" and any wol boll and in fact it is awesome? Not at all! So why IMDb There are some morons whining as school girls about this film, I never understand. Oh and YES, there are worse movies, so stop telling you what you've seen before, you will know that you're done! Do you ever see "ZOMBIEZ"? Or "Ferdotot" or "House of the Dead" ??? There are some of the worst I have ever seen. If you make sure that it is a low budget zombie movie that is clearly made by zombie movie fans, then something is wrong with you. I'm happy. Thumbs from me and I want to see a sequel.
