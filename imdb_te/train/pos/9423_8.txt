I can not say if I buy the flavor or after the WWII British comedy produced at Ealing Studios, but I totally addicted, and Man in the White Inn Suite is one of the best. Textile industry and textile unions do not need to go into a well-known plot about the threat from an endless, dirt-resistant fiber. In the pursuit of his polymer for the funniest pleasure, the luckiest idealist Sydney Stratone is enough to say that the slings and arrows are suffering. Many of the well-known faces from the British actors' world - nervous Cecil Parker, the gorgeous hypocrisy Michael Gough, and the blatantly ruthless Ernest Thesinger - excellent performances. Guinness - forever and forever - is amazing, and Joan Greenwood Duffne (she makes the whole movie worth the word "Daddy") <br /> "Nodesen! !!!! "
