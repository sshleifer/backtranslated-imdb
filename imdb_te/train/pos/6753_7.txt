The Noir Classic of Otto Preminas works almost as Lara's flip-side ... The film is appealing and has a high FA-lighting Clifton Web, which is quite seamer. Dana Andrews is a bit less than a good man, killing the guy who effectively pinned the girl he loves. Errors in logic easily neglected so that the printer keeps moving things at a brisk clip. Andrews looks great too (he's far less wood than ever) and stunningly beautiful Jean Tierney is stunningly beautiful! Creepy Craig Stevens is unfortunate victim. SIDEWALK is a must see and must have an excellent luminous whirlpool (also featuring Tierney) of Preminger with an amazing composition piece.
