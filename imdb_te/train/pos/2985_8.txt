The entire point of the film is one of the earliest and best international color releases of the Cinematic Opera, making it more accessible to the public. And it succeeded in so amazing. If a wonderful Egyptian played with vocal instruments to sing 40 tons and sopranos 300 pounds, ordinary people would not be able to put ordinary people into common love about two young porn lovers in general Egypt. Thus the visual substitution of the beautiful president (a young Loren, beautiful della Mara, and a dark Mrs. Maxwell) can not be a lovely arias of the heroine or the music is not well known. Moreover, Verdi is an enchanting introduction to one of the greatest works. I remember this when I was in junior high school and it woke up my interest in the opera, and I did not introduce it very well. I still love this movie and I would highly recommend those who can appreciate the great music better than average visuals. Lubiano della Marada became Radamas, and unfortunately did not appear in any other film for the audience.
