Paul Ricer has done a wonderful job of writing this film. Peter Fawl gives his life's performance. It is worthy of the Academy Award. This year is one of the most sharp and funny movies. Reiser's wit is fantastic and he gets up and looks good in his longtime TV sitcom "Mad of You You". Peter Fawl made a skillful job as his father, and at the age of 78 Peter smiled at us at the same time and shouted. The supporting cast is particularly similar to the beautiful beautiful Elizabeth Perkins work. It must watch the film in 2005. People of all ages and religions love this movie and somehow it is in a way or another. The film includes mothers, fathers and siblings. We all have good and bad times together and wish things were the same but different.
