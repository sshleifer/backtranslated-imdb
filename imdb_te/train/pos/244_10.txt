I did not know it was from Ned Kelly, but it totally liked it. It is dark, dramatic and persistent. I thought it was very authentic, and I thought I was back in 1800. I have never seen a Heath Ledger fan, and he is very compelling in this role, watching him in teen movies. Ledger Nade plays Kelly with respect and intensity, showing us what a stupid boy looks like Australia's most brutal killer. Naomi Watts is the greatest assistant in Kelly's social lover. Highly recommended - and it is from an Aussie!
