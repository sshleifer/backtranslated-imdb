I agree that the film is a little slow because there are not many scenes and conversations in the daily life of this movie. I was not impressed when I saw it. However, a few days later, the film is with me and this raises my deepest bleak feelings in my mind. This film will increase my appreciation. <br /> Many commented that the film is a non-linear and feature of European film-making, which is against the linear story line. Hollywood favors. I'm not really sure if this is true. Many people do not like its confusing structure and lack of clear explanations. I can not say that viewers can change their opinions. However, I would like to challenge this movie to others who are yet to see, and the film may not expect to be able to deliver all the answers and if you do not have more happiness than that. <br /> <br /> The film moves around quite a bit but really only 3 Days Timeline. Pay attention to the hair style and you can easily separate 2 out of 3 periods. It is not as confusing as suggested; <br /> <br /> Yes, many things have failed or are not shown, and in many cases they disappear. But what is life? If you are not sure of the intentions of your friends / loved ones, if you do not meet them then you can not be 100% sure if they tell you your whole truth. These films support us to understand the reasons behind the actions. However, give you enough instructions to make this film some positive assumptions. For example, Matthew Mannick depresses suicide. Why? I do not know, his life is not exactly as he hopes. Perhaps he missed his family but did not apologize to his father for not forgiving his father; After all he is sacrificed for Cedric, re-fitting and actually, his life is broken to be with him, he finds that he is all "upcoming cancellation". I thought the director wanted to show us that he was always small, and the scene was weak by the w / bird of the dead. Perhaps he has a very delicate mind and he suffers from all this pressure. But he is also shown that he is not some animal traumatized by his love mutual w / worm cat. In addition, a conversation between Dr. and Cedric disintegrates and reveals the reason behind suicide attempt. The doctor asks if everything is okay, and Cedric once thought he was once cheated by Matthew, but according to sedic, nothing feels. The only reason for this, we do not know, others are probably there, all mix together. Is it important to know what they are? I think so for this film. The scene of the historic ruins is yet to say that they are not suitable. Mathieu is interested in studying the ruins, not Cedric. <br /> <br /> Matthew relies only on the physical side without an intellectual need. <br /> Finally, the ending is really hopeful and sweet. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you feel like you do not know what to say, And then it becomes too loud when it changes to the bar or external audience scenario, the other subtitled can not be stopped, they are on the screen, and most foreign movie DVDs released in the main studio are unusual in this way.
