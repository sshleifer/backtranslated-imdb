I saw only the first sequence on DVD, but I would summarize Sopranos as a Shakespeare plot with a Tarantino-like script. The range is good as Goodfellas and Casino, and the Godfather (which is not a "10") is better than Guy Ritchie's efforts. Despite the plenty of action, it is a pretty bloody, storytelling character driven. Some minor characters contribute to great stories; Eg: Carmilla and the mistress of the restaurant, and Christopher and his friend (or Darwini Award nominee). (Or absence) of a priest who did not last for a long time <br /> <br /> Apart from this plot, I have scripted and acting, other reasons for me, it made me want to visit New Jersey and eat pasta with a tomato sauce 2. Music 3. Literally someone's mental Rogya shows that suffer from problems.
