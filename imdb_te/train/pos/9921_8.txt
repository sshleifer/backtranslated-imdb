I have been Edward Burdinski's admirer of years, and I'm happy to thank Jennifer Bychawal's documentary to see the man in work. The fierce beauty of the ship breaking yard in Bangladesh, the stone quarry in Vermont, the enormous assembly plant in China, the awkward old neighborhoods in Shanghai are just waiting to be cracked: These landscapes are photographer <br /> <br /> Some of the old old TV documentaries at times have been lost to coal miners, I saw plastic mold factories. That's what I see. Burinski's work has the greatest value that highlights what the industry has done to Asia, which has not stopped. In China there is a scene for computer scrap-yard for me - waste is a frightening wind, workers are very happy.
