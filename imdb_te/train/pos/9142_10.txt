Purple rain ... what can I say, title also speaks. But I have a good choice for all the actors. This film is a great story. I loved it! Since I saw the film, I stuck in the eighties, and I'm only 13 years old! My father died when his father died and he began to take out all of his musical compositions, and Apolonia was sitting on the stairs with his passion in his hand. Critics make its play but I think it's more of a romantic. Murphy Brown also did a great job in the film. I'm very glad I saw this movie. Purple rain song, beautiful sung, heartfelt song. I cried more than once.
