I saw this film at BIFFF Festival in Brusell, Spring 2004. No surprise! This German production, a stylish and imaginative shaker, is one of the terrible slums I've seen. Warn: It's not a joke! The big cast of this militant actors (eg, Peter Martel has a strong presence as a European guru), excellent direction, nice production design, very good soundtrack and heavy gour SFXs eighties. Flesh has been cleaned to the bone ... and blood runs through the red ... this Savage Heart Stopper catches you ... and some dark dreams ... Must see !!
