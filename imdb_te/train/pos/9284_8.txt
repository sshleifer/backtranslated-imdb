The film is described as comedy, but it's not comedy. Like any Panahi film, it is a realistic play that portrays the general misery of social inequality and hypocrisy. But it is very funny; It's much easier than the director's dark and intense The Circle (my favorite Iranian film). Girls resource and ridicule between them and the soldiers are completely reliable (as a documentary) and totally happy. <br /> <br /> The original match and the consequences are surprising. It adds the originality of a very different film like Australia Kenny. <br /> Performances from all professional actors ?? Soldiers and girls ?? Very reliable. This is a lot of moves to see the girls' passion, despair and enthusiasm. Who are the Muslim girls in this country wearing chuda are different from their daughters? It is a real eye-opener. <br /> <br /> In my presence, the soldiers represent the current model. They started stock standard official policy responses to all the requests for girls. As the film progresses, they find it more complicated to preserve this perspective. <br /> <br /> When Teheran was all set to be a jungle celebration, everyone was caught in it, and one of the rumors about the current policies and everything is clear. <br /> <br /> This is a very moving and unexpected ending, and the film gave a really nice blend of emotions, frivolity, drama and social commentary. Although this is an adult film, I have really appreciated the movie (as long as they are able to read the subtitles) of the children born from seven. <br /> <br /> The repression of Iran such as the Panahi and the Kyorostami is the building of such high quality images. Presumably there are directors forced to be strong. Australian (and other) filmmakers can take a leaf in their book.
