<br /> <br /> "Holo Man" is probably the director of great films like Paul Verhoenen, "Total Recall", "Starship Troopers" and "Robocop". <br /> That's not his fault. For some reason, Verhoeven is stuck with the median script entirely, and he has done its best. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film is very good, cynicism, great special effects and soundtrack scan anancy. Unfortunately, in the second episode the film is flat, it is a standard straws film or perhaps a very bad "foreign" cloak. Kevin Bacon returned to life after many events that killed him (especially in the logical sense of the word), especially the funniest <SPOILER>. </ Spoiler>. Moreover, the whole thing is very unpleasant: the subject of disappearing is never fully investigated. <br /> <br /> For all, Verhoeven is going to be less than average for this film. <br /> <br/> Out of 1/2 out of the stars
