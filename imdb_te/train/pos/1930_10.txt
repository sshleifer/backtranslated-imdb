The film is a happy, original, beautifully directed movie. I became a Big Bad SWIM team at anytime, anytime for tracking film festivals. I've seen about half a dozen times, every time, an amateur audience response has confirmed my feeling that one of the best movies of the year. It was exhibited at almost every festival, which was sold or won the Audience Favorite Award. It is clear that people like this movie, and it is clear how they do it. Cinematography is good, amazing, acting is amazing, ultimate miracle, & full of compassion, knowledge and full time arts. I believe it is Isha Setson's first movie. I hope everyone will be released soon to see it.
