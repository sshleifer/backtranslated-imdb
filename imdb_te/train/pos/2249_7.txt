I enjoyed watching Brigham Young and found a positive and more real role of LDS faith. I think the remake of this epic journey across the field will be useful, and many people today are familiar with the trials and persecutions facing the Mormon Church. <br /> <br /> As a member of the Church, the most disturbing element in the film (the most historic bugs do not bother me) has been known as Joseph's heir as a prophet of "Bewithered" as he believed the church members of Bregham Young. I understood the dramatic reasons for this plot line, in fact, that his doubts in this regard were a historical fact, in fact, understood by a group of Brigham and church members, and he was a strong church. Braigam's intelligence was not cheated by the saints; Apart from that he led them confidently through inspiration. This is important for Mormons because it fills the important aspect of our faith: God really speaks to the prophets today, and Brigham Young, like Joseph Smith, is God's inspired prophet. Or if you believe in this statement or not, Brigham does not know exactly what he believes.
