This film is not so great. The book is good. But the film is not so bad. It is interesting to say the least. The film has enough suspense to me, but I can not say I'm interested in the movie too. Janine Turner and Antonio Sabato Jr. are both beautiful enough to stay watching you :) They should appeal to the romance of having some beautiful sequences. Overall I'd give the picture 7 or 8. It's not bad, just a small lack of plot-wise.
