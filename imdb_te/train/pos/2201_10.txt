I saw 1st disc in a collection of 4-disc (26 episodes) created with UCLA Film & Television Archive (S'More Entertainment, Inc.). So far (from 1 episode), the picture quality is great. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Pipes" When I first saw it (at the age of 5) and Wally Cox really was lovely in this role. If you're in the mood for the silent comedy that turns you cool against you, you'll fund this opportunity to experience all the amazing characters you might remember from your childhood. Some gags are very clever and well executed, even though it's a bit corny ... and even corny ones are fun. This is a TV series where I have my childhood memories.
