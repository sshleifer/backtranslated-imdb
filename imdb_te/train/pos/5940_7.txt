This short film trailer is primarily working with Superman and Batman to create an uncomfortable bloc. Obviously, these two characters have different disagreements about how to deal with crimes, and I'm going to penalties here. But I'm not coming into acting, it's wonderful.Everyone has done well. Two actors in Superman and Batman are well suited for their roles. The same filmmakers Batman: Dead End and Graceson also made this small movie. Three, I probably liked it, but I thought I did better. For me, the best of the world is 7/10
