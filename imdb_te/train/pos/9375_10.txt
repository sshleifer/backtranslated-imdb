Nicolas Cage is a great actor before starring as a big action actress. Cage is the less-known movie to be one of his best performances. "Red Rock West" is a low-budget, almost unknown movie, but it is one of my favorite movies. I found that I was walking in video styling, and wanted to see Cage and Hopper together (who was also great in this movie). Get this one, and I'm sure you will not be disappointed.
