I do not think many people deserve the role of this film. I love low budget horror movies and this takes the cake, especially for realism. Yes Scarecrow is a kung-fu fighting scare, but why not? Nobody is ready to go so far. I'm not really watching the movie from the most fun candiest. So this little child in town looks at him and his mother does not care about him. Then he is killed and scarcely meets the spirit, then he goes to the killing spree. The film gets relatively simple once guessing his death. Eventually, the dedication horror went into the group of directors, but Dario Urgoon turned me coolly with the most dedication and made those who made the films of this new genre. Over the picture is Arnold Rip offs, with a liners you laugh like a stick around and he kills the sheriff with a stick. I tell you, a pizza is a smile of your A $$ off with some friends. I love its originality and great fun.
