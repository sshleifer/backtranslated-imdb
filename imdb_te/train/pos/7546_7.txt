CAT SOUP two "Hello Kitty" - two cats get out of a tremendous trip on a tremendous trip, where anything can happen, and there. This mind-tripping uses little instead dialogue with Asia, instead of word bubbles instead. There is no exception to this tragic cartoon. Make sure no one is in the room for under 10 years. Common themes of murders and cannibalism and cruelty and cruelty and sudden death and refusing innocent people for others. Honest. Perhaps the most memorable image is an elephant that is composed of water, which carries the kittens swim and inward, and also runs. But as practically everything in this film, that crazy, picaresque interlude soon comes a terrible end.
