I saw this film from Paris in August 1996 to the first film I went to Newark on Air France on Air France. The film is very exciting for me. It is the kind of image that people should make. I still feel like one of the sexiest actors around Daniel Audille. In the French film he portrayed the divorced father and businessman, who loses his passion for life until he is a down syndrome man living in an institution with Down Syndrome. Actors including Actor who actually have Down Syndrome create reliable friendship and relationship between these two likely men. Daniel's life with Down Down syndrome and ours will change forever. He finds that life should not just work and not play but for living and loving and all about life. The end is silly though but I still feel one of my favorite movies. This is enough to bring tears to your eye.
