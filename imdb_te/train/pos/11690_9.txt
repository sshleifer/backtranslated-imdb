I am dying this movie. In fact it took until it was decided to rent. It's totally worth it. From the beginning of the film, I laughed. Chris Rock is funny no matter what film he is, however, this should come close to being true of his being great. If u look for a family image, ie before teens and u then this will not pass u.
