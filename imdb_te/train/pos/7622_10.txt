I love this show! It's like watching a little movie every week! The first episode is very persistent and awful ... so the pilot is part 2 ... I'm definitely gonna keep tuning on this program! It's a real Survivor! I have seen a few more comments and it seems that Wolf is already crying after one or two episodes ... If it's not a reality, sorry! There's a time there ... brace yourself now! Original TV Shows! And this is a law & order or ump-teenth carbon copy of the NYPD Blue or CSI series today or they're hitting ... crappy sitcoms are rather good too ... See yourself to set up your own opinion, t take a boneheads here !
