The story of peace-loving farmers and urban people struggling with land, water, law and order, long-lasting livestock interests and respect for their rented guns and ultimate repression (Shane) and perhaps better in the next films. There are some good action scenes and a simple layout of the story, except for the disappointment ending, well executed. Law and Order and Religion established the roots in the town, but the old order of old cattle, cowboys, and pistols is still around. The two were in conflict, where there were scenes filled with urban people in the right hand. Granger, a former gunman, plays a guy who shunned through most towns that needed his expertise in the gun.
