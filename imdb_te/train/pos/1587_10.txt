Do you know anyone who sees or downloads Season 4 episodes on the Internet "What I Like about You"? I die to see them in Germany because they are not shown on TV. Please help. I see Season 4 episodes very seriously. I already saw Episode 4 and Episode 18 on YouTube. But I could not find more episodes of Season 4. Can I have a website that can see episodes? I have read a few comments from the forum in Germany and have already seen Season 4 episodes, even though not shown in TV in Germany. I am happy with every information I can get. Thanks Kate
