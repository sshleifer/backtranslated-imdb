I am a pedestrian with fewer weighty flavors. Still, I am occasionally trying to increase the bar on my cultural perception. This film is one of my attempts. I was surprised at the whole picture. I like it very much, and I can see it again because of my own tape. This is a very attentive and emotionally portrayed image. I have seen the viewer a big question: what can the acceptance of the sacrifice of the sacrifice, ask, approve, accept? As a member of the military, this is an important question for me. <br /> <br /> This question is most likely on the audience.
