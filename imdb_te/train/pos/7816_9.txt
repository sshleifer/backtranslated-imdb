Richard Attenborough is a director whose name is back in the Academy Award 'Gandhi', '83. I recently did not know about other programs in 'Cry Freedom' released in 1987. Although it is not as popular as his Gandhis, it is not every bit bit and more, and South Africa is still released while the shackles of apartheid have been removed. After the event, most of the films on social issues have come and I will release this time. <br /> The story is based on real life characters and events. The film based on the book Donald Woods (Kevin Kline) wrote a journalist working in South Africa until the end of the seventies. Dangel Washington emerges of Woods' friendship with the glamorous black leader Steve Bucco. I can not imagine a good choice for the character. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, after a meeting with Woods, he was unable to use the black racist biko that he thought was spreading. Into his struggles and ideas. <br /> <br /> Finally, tragedy attacks, and Woods now needs to escape from the South, but the relationship between them grows stronger, and Woods and his family are recognized and more sensitive to the plight of the people. In Africa, with his book, thereby revealing what's going on in the world to be published and beyond. <br /> <br /> The film will make the second half run away from South Africa with his family, and puts you in terror territories where you live. <br /> <br /> There are some delicious funny conversations. The scene between the biko and the attorney in the court is an example. <br /> Lawyer: Do you support violence? BICO: I support a confrontation. Lawyer: Well, not torture, Mr. Bicco? BIKO: Not necessarily. <br /> <br /> Anyway, there are moments that bring you back to horror events across the country before you get a better understanding. <br /> <br /> I do not advocate those who do not know Attenborough's work, take a moment to stare the scene where the army opens the protest of all schoolchildren. There are movies making money. And there are movies that make life. I like it any day.
