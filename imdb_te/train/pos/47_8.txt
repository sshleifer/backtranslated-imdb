It will break my heart that this film is not worth it. Its very poorly estimated. People forget what movies are really about, these days they think about bump bum movies, which are quite fun watching popcorn and movies like transformers, movies, which are only based on hyper-mega high budget, like 300mln or more on exclusive effects, and only dumb films without storyline there. I have done many movies. <br /> <br /> It is fun to see the CGIs which are very enthusiastic, but we do not get enough from those kinds of movies. <br /> I think honest acting is excellent. Erica Christensen and Victor Garber (I respect), along with BC Phillips, the film is an Oscar. The emotional performance by Busy Phillips is a surprise, we wont see Oscar in her hand which she deserves.
