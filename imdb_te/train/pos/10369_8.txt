"A Cry in the Dark" is a wonderful piece of the movie, exciting, and very inspiring. In 1980, Limy's real story of Chamberland saw a horrifying scene when she was taken out of her family's tent by her 3-month-old baby, leaving the Austrian exile. Azhari (baby) did not see it again, and her real life spills throughout the world as a result of her horror disappearance. Maril Streep makes a great deal of character to Lindy, as she always does. But one thing that helps "a cry in the dark" is never going to be flat. This is a really inspirational and accurate outlook in the baffeling case, carrying the tears eyes. The feeling is less then terrifying, and then you are haunted, but also inspired.
