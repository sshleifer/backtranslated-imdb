There is no other world in the back of the post office. Here, Alice arrives at the job with the hope of finding her lost father. Frank is the source of her master's suffering. A quiet little assy fiction came and took place at the cinema. Now you find it in the deep dark corner of the video shop, and the fifty copies of that terrible gossy picture are covered. It became a lot since it had become a satirical movie with strong simple images and effective performances from the two songs. The film failed with Gary Marshall's other dead letter office (DLL - 1996), and Kevin Costner is not a turkey, but he comes close to the brightness of Jianzin's postman (1995 - China).
