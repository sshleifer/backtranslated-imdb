Titanic should be one of my all-time favorite movies. <br /> <br /> When I was mistaken for anyone who liked to love Titanic, my first reaction was "Wait a minute, do not you?" I do not like this movie, and I do not know why I do not see why. "Love Story is Very Cheesy" Well, yes but is it not enjoyable and moving? All right, the love story between Jack and Rose is very unrealistic, everyone knows that love like this does not actually exist. But this is not a beautiful story that makes a movie, a little bit of fun for everyone for a while. Next Complaint, DiCaprio and Winslet are terrible actors. Okay, okay, in this movie, I agree that they do not show their full potential. Yet, I think it's unfair to say they are horrific actors. I personally feel very talented actors who are very famous for a movie that they are not incredible but they seem simple enough, and the characters seem real enough to care for you a little bit, but because they hate romance Finally, if they're going to complain that they're history, or not Sada hate the movies, then I'm sorry but these things are going on the ground, so that they clearly see why all of a movie. The Dark Knight is like people who complain of a bad movie because they hate action films. <br /> <br /> If you do not like the movie, the movie is not good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ <br /> <br /> I am a part of the work I'm failing, and consistently throwing each other in the movie. The flashback time of the story is very weak, but overall it's a great success in making Titanic look real, and epic is sinking. <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image , I have read five books about Titanic, including the memories of them, the film is quite accurate and accurate, there are only a few mistakes. <br /> <br /> The only major findings I have found is that the pipe locked copper, not steel, and the ice-scene that the ice sheds on it is very unrealistic. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />]
