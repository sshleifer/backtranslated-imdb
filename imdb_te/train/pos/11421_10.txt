I do not know what the previous reviewer is looking for but I guess what reviews and personal tastes are. The film is deep in depth, deep, very deep film, affecting many layers of emotion. I felt like social inclinations, times and classes prohibitions, ethnic relations, equality, guilt, anxiety, hatred, confusion, and very dark. As mentioned earlier, not to slow down, to release yourself to the cinematic flow, the emotions themselves, the characters their faults, their evil powers, are fantastic and actually very cruel!
