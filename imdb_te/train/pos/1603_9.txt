I am really impressed that this film did not get a high rating in IMDB. It is one of those movies that can easily be obtained by anyone, but there is really a class for romantic comedy "Moonstruck". There are things that it takes to establish and rally charm people take for granted. Casting alone is a perfect image. Some of the 1980's movies were good as "Moon Struck" and it was fun too. **** out *****
