Anyone noticed that James Earl Jones was a waiter, Hughthree's wife tells her that she was pregnant when she was near a restaurant near her grandfather. I saw this movie in a tape video on television. When I saw this scene, I thought I was finding Jones's voice when I was laughed at the end of the "waiter". I pulled the tape slowly through that part because the camera pulled back and showed me the waiter. When Hagerty appears they say that the waiter is laughing and telling them they are going to the baby, and immediately after the camera waiter, the scene slows down or sees the scene.
