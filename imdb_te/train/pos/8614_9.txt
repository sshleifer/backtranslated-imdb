Diane Keaton is my favorite actress because this film has my interest. I disagree with some of the other posts on the ground that the plot is not shivering. I did not bother after (perhaps some people put too much egg the night before). The film was very sad and touching. What do you want Alexa Davolos has a nice new talent (very beautiful), and Tom Everett Scott also makes an excellent job on his part. The relationship of the mother and daughter may be a bit untrue, but not the young behavior of the film. It's sad but sad. It definitely beat other programs on TV New Year's Day Evenings
