I first saw this film 5 years ago at the cab and I could not be laughing. Click on everything about this image, storyline, letters, setting. As I read about this movie, this film is not a great movie, it is amazing what you think. It will mean throughout. The cast is always good in the comedy film. Carben Bourbison, Fred Guinney, Ruben Blades and Ed O'Neill are happy. For this I have not seen it, I will give you a brief summary: Four criminals meet in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank robbery. But when their two police arrests their friend from New Jersey, they are trying to figure out what's going on and all the hell is broken. The film is truly a great bank caf√© comedy and is a poor man's version of Oscars Eleven, with four criminals who can not stand one and is more than Las Vegas in Montana. I'd strongly encourage you to see this film if you'd like to laugh at all.
