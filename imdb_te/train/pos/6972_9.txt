The Caprio episode (S01E01) is a great pilot. Really, this episode is the perfect content as a DVD pilot release. According to Episode 01, the most popular "Battlestar Galactica" series (in both the original and 2007 remake) gives a more realistic look. This applies to most of the 2007 series. Delayed sci-fi's Trending Plots, this series is looking for "virtual" life or environment. On top of this, we have a lot of relation to their relationship in the Battlestar Galactica series, the creator of the Attala Family series and the Silence. For the most part, this first episode is a well known topic of "virtual" life and the early life of Calleins (as expected), and the origins of the cylons. <br /> <br /> More than anything else, I loved this episode. Even so, it's not something new to me or anyone already seeing the release of the Capitol Pilot DVD, the series seems pretty good. As with most pilots, episode 01 goes with a hill-hanger, so the spectators (sci-fi community) should follow. I'm going to fix it perfectly and keep looking for improvement. <br /> <br /> In this series, I give 8 stars.
