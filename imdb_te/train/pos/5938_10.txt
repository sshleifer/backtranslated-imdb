Another super sensitive taste of our super-flavor film of the Dead End is a stunning taste of the movie Batman stimulates our taste buds and leaves us more! This is what the real superhero should look like in the movie and feel! These kinds of tough ones are also a favorite currency. Details, character and action attention is undoubtedly true. Although it produces limited resources, it can be disgraced in big budget, star-casting, hype productions "other" superhero related films. Here the main and supporting characters act and look like real people. Finally, Superman is actually "super" and the real thing looks like! Batman must be the way, without the elegant rubber cast, not scraped body armor to hide scrawny physiques for paid actors. I gave some brilliance Warner Brothers Egg to produce the full length of this ornament. I do not care if it goes to theaters or directly to DVD, I'll never be tired of watching. This same plot itself is worth my hard earned dough. Let's look at "bigwigs" at Marvel & DC Productions and see what is actually a well-produced superhero film. "Batman & Robin" flop or Hulk, Daredevil etc. Learn from these short time directors and find out that there is no reason to "redefine" the hero for the film, which includes "bomb" theaters. Mr. Kollara ... We need more directors!
