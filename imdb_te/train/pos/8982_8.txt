Damn, there is much to take too much. I was pretty much mesmerized throughout. It's perfectly complete, though I'll say it will do a lot of editing. I'm without this person being too good for them (especially Anton) to get all of these footage without any serious ... beef. Dandy came up with well-groomed and middle-class kids taking advantage of their situation (and correctly!). I thought it was bad for Jonestown and especially Anton, perhaps it was not what most people felt. A great piece of film making and a great selection of stuff (s). I recommend this to any music / film fan. Maybe you can learn about making film.
