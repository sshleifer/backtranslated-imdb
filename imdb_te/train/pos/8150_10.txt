My, cassia lemons are definitely a good looking woman. The film's lost gem, the dead-nude satirical "mockumentary" of the early 90th hip hop scene, MC Hammer has gone that good night. We will follow the three members of the NWH when they leave on their pick-ups travel for riches and fame. Finally, like Nicholas Nickley they could not finish their journey until they started, but at least a little intelligent and very little innocence. This is one of the best films that nobody has ever heard of, but it's a movie you like or hate, and there's a lot like "Company Man". I consider this film like Upstate New York 1000 Islands: There is an amazing little secret that you want to keep yourself.
