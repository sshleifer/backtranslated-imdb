This debut film has its flaws - some overlapping sequences of speculative storyline and dubious dialogue - but it is already apparently demonstrates the use of Hitchcock's album and powerful images. This is one of many expressions in the style of his paintings. <br /> <br /> For example, the eccentric distortions he uses during the party sequence and the echoes of the title and the plot often in the imagery. <br /> <br /> The main theme is still in the final battle, exciting examples of cinema boxing. Although you know he's winning the hero, he is incredibly optimistic that he will be lost and his wife's move from the corner corner of the game promotes the final plot payments, the better the match. Insert of the Stopwatch must do exactly what they want; You can hear almost ineffective (even if it is a silent film, visuals can give them a surprisingly audacious feel). Passing is surprisingly fast, and the viewer sucks into both excitement and brutality of both hazard and sexual jealousy. <br /> <br /> The only DVD release I have introduced is Laserlite, a public domain company. With each Hitchcock silence they were released, they added different musical options, mostly orchestral, to action. Sound editing is often widespread, and the sound quality is widespread, but some genuine precautions seem to have gone into more realistic choices, and the music works well with the last match; <br /> <br /> It is a more attractive image than previously suggested. It earned an honorable place in the narrow list of Hitchcock Cannon and worthy boxing films.
