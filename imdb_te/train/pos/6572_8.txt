One of my favorite films for several years is "Last Action Hero"; Unfortunately, Arnold Schwarzenegger decided to spoil my happiness by becoming a corrupt conspirator politician; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jake Speed ​​' <br /> <br /> Despite the "plot-plot" of white slavery during an African nation's civil war, this is not an action film. The plot on "Plot-At-Plot" is about a question intended to resolve the film: Jake Speed, a real man who helps save his sister from the white slave trader; Or is he actually a fictional character (i.e. the heroine sometimes entered the universe and only in the series of pulp novels)? I've suggested that the film is not explicitly defined, Wayne Crawford and Andrew Lane are absolutely aware of this. The film was created to inspire audiences from such a fictional "adventure-story" universe. In fact it is a great theme, it's fun with the comic sense of the movie's comic and humor. <br /> <br /> The film has weaknesses - mainly cinematography. Show. <br /> <br /> I really like these characters and I enjoyed the adventure they live in. <br /> <br /> I thought this adventure would really happen in this novel.
