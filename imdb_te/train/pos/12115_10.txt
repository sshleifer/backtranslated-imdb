Another comment about this film is that it sounded sound. Most of the pictures talking are new - I think the script and performance are good. Davis is too young and fresh. We did not find his own style yet to look forward. <br /> <br /> The film has many clips and the film has seen some trails in the next 70 years. My vote is how it looks and how this kind of film is young. Open the mind and open the mind and see how you look at the early part of the last century in the picture, as you see in 1934. I love you and did not influence your own mind.
