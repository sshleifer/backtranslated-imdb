Like TALK RADIO, BOOTH is actually very much speculative (TALK RADIO because we know what's going on, because BOOTH-LETS face-to-face and basic setup). This is not necessarily a bad thing, in this case. It means that the filmmakers do not punk out in the end, as they say, an American version of this story. Bath recklessly moves towards its end (the end of the end), but beautifully crafted for each level, can travel a familiar cruise on a good cruise stretch (very beautiful) road. This reminds me of FLAN SWEAT, the HORLEN Ellison's spooky short story. Claustrophobia is sometimes touching, almost touching. A nice long look worth.
