"Vanilla Sky" is an amazingly thought movie. Or, "Abre Los Ojos" was well thought out. I saw that movie last night and was excited about the coming. I'm not disappointed. At the end of the film, I was aware of it. I could not get my mind. This whole idea broke me away. Conclusion, Shyamalan is more surprising than ever. The plot line is also something that kept me interesting by and through. Casting, excellent. It's surrounded by a wonderful picture. Find a movie you can see again and always find something new. I saw four or five times, and I have always found something new. This is a movie you will ever find interesting.
