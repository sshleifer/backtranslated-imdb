A fantastic picture by Pavel and Presbyger, whose work I now want to explore. We find out the film is real and true, and how difficult it is to find out how the two are from each other. Beautifully filmed and starred, although David Niven does not appear to be at the age of 27, his role is arguing. Very young Richard Attenborough is happy to see. I saw this movie, when I looked, and later.
