Really cool movie. Any musical snob is essential. You do not really need to know about the bands to enjoy the movie. Before the movie, I heard only two songs from Daddy Warhols. The only thing that needs is open mind. <br /> <br /> The film is centered around Brian Jonstown Massacre. Dundee Warhols played the role of 'rival band' in the film, but they are the second sonata of BJM. Dundee Warhols I initially assumed that I did not play a major role in the film, but later, they did not have the element of BJM's enthusiasm and imagination. You can not help but the band must be impressed and its attractive front man, Anton Newcomb. By itself, it is a brilliant film and study in the music industry. Just watch this movie and have fun.
