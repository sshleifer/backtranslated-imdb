Perhaps a story is not quite the original way to tell, we've seen all of this before many movies .. but anyway I liked alot of the Sky on October. It's something, great direction and all the pieces, especially Laura Dern (teacher) and Chris Cooper (father) have been good acting. I'm a rocket-engineer!
