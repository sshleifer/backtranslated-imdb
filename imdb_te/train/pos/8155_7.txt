I am very old (or care) to learn what is the difference between rap and hip-hop. <br /> <br /> Canadian, I've never seen MTV ever since, but I'm not sure. <br /> When I saw this film, I thought it was very funny. Hip-hop culture does not extend these days, and it's hard to hear about it. (We can say only about bagpipe music.) I got a lot of comedy (at least I did). Certainly, it originates from the spine pump, but there are a lot of goals that can sustain a counterfeit treatment. They are not just holy.
