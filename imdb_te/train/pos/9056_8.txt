So we have compromised. It's a very fascinating movie, I liked the genre directing (which most kids felt a lot more "real" than the movies), and the dresses are not too cutesy. Child actors are not bad to see (adult shows are gone to cheesy). <br /> <br /> I do not know how many elderly people would like to see for themselves, but this is a great way to get a little kid. And since "Barnyard" clearly attended 100+ kids at the same time, I'm really glad to opt for a little more absent performance instead of "worms".
