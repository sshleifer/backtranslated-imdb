Detroit is not a whodunit. It's gonna who's who they are first. I can not tell you anything about the plot, so it's hard to explain this film without giving away anything. Chris Reeves is a great role Clifford, a young drama until acting. You really see the film in sharpness from the "cheeseburgers throwing" range in his acting capabilities. Clifford plays a very difficult role to play, and at this point I have worked well on both ends of the clipboard spectrum. The actor plays him as a small puppy or homicide maniac. Reeves is the only person I've seen through all the way through character only. He is for Michael Cain ..... he is Michael Cain. He is one of the best actors of the last 50 years and he is as good as ever.
