I'm at the same screenwriters meeting and saw the film. I thought of the author - Sue Smith - what's best about this film. However, the film does not really need an explanation. I think the themes are abundantly clear, and inspiring. Courage, a film dealing with dealing with the ability to deal with - especially fearful of being left out of parental dolls - and a transcendent film that can overcome it and do so, embracing life's possibilities. I've enjoyed much happiness than Somerset. I also feel relentless to Mandy 62 Hugo Naving. A subtle about his vintage, I should look very good! I agree that most Australian movies have been poorly handled, but 'peaches' items. I'm glad.
