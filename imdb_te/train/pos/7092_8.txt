At the beginning of Twelve Monkeys there is a story (probably apocryphal) about Bruce Willis and Terry Gilliam. Gilliam (charges) made a long list (think of a flight from the fifth element) and handed it to Butch Bruce. It is called "Things Bruce Willis Das When He Works". <br /> <br /> I have argued that these two factors have played a big role in creating the exceptional (not commercial non-commercial) success called the Divelive Monkeys. <br / > Visually, twelve Monkeys, right from what we are expecting from Gilliam, is also filled with Gilliusque Surrealism and simple (but magnificent) hypocrisy. <br /> <br /> I love these Garya movies (notably Brazil), but in the Gilliam Clock, Kafka is a formless relentless movement of the characters towards their destiny, despite the surprise of anyone sitting on the first true. But they are feeling the same weakness I'm still refusing what the Brazilian Gilliam's tour de force is, but it's the breath of fresh air in the tight-plot segment of twelve Monkeys. The style, material and form are usually merged with the ones that are not visible from the pie-python. <br /> <br /> The truth of the rumor above is that Gilliam is out of the first rate (and very diverse) baldness. Bruce is very impressive in this film, most notably the cast, particularly the assaulted bonkers - and the most scary - Brad Pitt <br /> The film has been a decade since its release. When I saw it again, I realized that it was not really old. I've changed course. And I saw this film with fresh eyes. It seems to me that this film should be a tribute to a picture that we make at least one, about the reflections on reflections, the changing perspectives and the absurd one way out. First rate image. 8/10.
