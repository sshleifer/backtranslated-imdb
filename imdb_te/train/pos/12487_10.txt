Dark Remains is a home run plain and simpler. The film is full of creepy visuals, and scares' a long time that the horror veteran jumps straight into the seat. Particularly a staircase, these guys are good. It's good if they do not work on a huge budget, and actors come. Dark Remains can be negative to some, but I guess you can think. Cherie Christian and Greg Thompson are a spot like the mourning couple are trying to rebuild lives there, but some side characters like Sharif do not convince me. They are not all important anyway. Dark Remines gives you the perfect ten ratings for the recent studio ghost story / 10 times more than the Japanese remake.
