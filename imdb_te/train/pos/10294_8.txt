Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman combine Jennifer Aniston together with one of the funniest films so far from the 2003 season (in late May), better improved in previous crazy and personal unforgettable roles. With his old self just barely tough down with a jap and crackle, Karey has a height of laughter and even some dramatic, dull dull moments. Elements of gym's true acting abilities appear in the film. This joyous summer entertainment hits a lot of buttons, including dramatic elements along the Goofy moments that fit perfectly with this script. Bruce, who still has a gorgeous collection of humor / drama, deserves to act as a great date film, alongside a solid message and a soft spiritual hatred and simulating a good rich flavor. Eight ten stars.
