Hunstage is a deliberate and alert study of life in Vienna's unique infrastructure. It comes from the former documentary director Ulrich Seydel, who takes up much of the documentary-like approach to this term. However, the film is different from the general types and offers characters that are described as the best "characters". Some are quite alone; Very violent some very strange; Very strange some very disappointing and misunderstood; And so on. The film combines many parts of the area from time to time to interrupts, each of which follows a few days of hunting in the summer of Viney's summer hunting. Do you think that a very few audience entertained from the movie? The purpose is to point out many things that are wrong with people, usually plagues our society plenty of weaknesses. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the meantime, the old wife, who was responsible for her elderly woman, was wearing clothes for her deceased wife. A nightclub dancer is competing with his boy-racer boyfriend's permanently jealous and violent behavior. The couple who are grieving over their dead daughter can not communicate with one another and get some comfort by having a sexual relationship with others. Misuse makes her woman misuse but she again forgave him. A security salesman attempts to find a culprit behind some devastating work, but on an innocent scapegoat. And a psychiatrist betrayed the rides with strangers and insulted her until she fell into the car! The lives of these different characters overlap for several days during extreme warming. <br /> <br /> The film is suffering from depression. Several scenes have long and awkward silence, which are twice effective in the full article of the conversation. Then there are different scenes from the replication of the dialogue and the on-screen events. In particular, the security salesman did not even hit the scene of a victim's reputation - the beaten, rape and shame (fortunately all off-screens) she did not - the sour, almost angry taste. In another scene, the man has a backlit candle and the national anthem must be pointed to the gun, which is part of his punishment for the evil of his wife. We'd be happy to see this robbery coming to his future, but at the same time we are afraid and dissatisfied with the nature of his punishment. In fact, such full contrasts act as a summary of the overall image - every moment of light-mind balances the chill with a moment. The hope is with every sense of disappointment with each cloth. For each character you may like or sympathize, another is another who encourages nothing but anger and hatred. We want to stay away from the huststage, which can be dismissed as a workout in gravity, but it suggests some uncomfortable facts and should be appreciated for it.
