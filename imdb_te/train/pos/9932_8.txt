If you do not go to the film, it will not disappoint you, you will be disappointed with any movie. Heminging described the film as "ice-cream effect". On the surface, random film clips collapsed together to make just one cache an image. If it's written in a book, it's a small story because the action in the movie is very fast, and if you do not try to capture it, the logic behind the plot (including some mysterious references) will pass you very well. Surely an image will have to look twice in order to fully appreciate you. The film illustrates the experimental cinematography. The camera work and post production has a lot of overall flavor, which is a very artistic and open-ended commentary on some points (lately in American movies). In some areas, some viewers are slightly obscene, gruesome and heavily available, and the film is completely irrelevant. The soundtrack option is the only item in the movie I'm going to be "Development Improvement". Although the soundtrack is very good, the start is too long and the other rap songs in the film are really correct (heavy, hard rock or psychedelic) electronica made this film a real trip). The film and dynamic ... The flood of color palettes adds another "artistic" factor, combined with the events that take place throughout the film, and you are not losing any part of the film and can not understand it yet. However, it does much to watch a desirable movie, and you are bored quickly. 8.5 / 10
