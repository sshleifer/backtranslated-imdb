"Party Girl" has a tremendous charm of Parker Posey. In fact, Mrs. Posey is a vehicle that allows her to play as she is in real life. <br /> <br /> The movie is directed by Daisy Van Sherle Meyer and is a treat for Mrs. Posey fans. Ms. Von Sherlour Mayer will take us on a wild tour into Lower Manhattan to show us this manless soul whose life is often dedicated to frequent the different clubs enjoy. This is still the simplest of the region and nearby meat market districts. At least, there are no losses in the movies and if we could call that, we would go back to the earth in a normal way about their lives. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey makes amazing Maria. This is because we are enjoying the film more than Parker Possi than another actress played by Mary. Her entire image. The rest of the cast is good.
