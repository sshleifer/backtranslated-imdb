Start this new and interesting Star Trek series. It is a "bottom of the ground" that has dark and less "bursting" scenes. <br /> <br /> The characters need some time, but they have probability. Very frustrating (really with all the Star Trek Series) is one thing, they paint a narrow picture of equality between men and women in the future, when they all portray a very positive picture. (Earth War, Drought etc.) <br /> <br /> Women's characters are two, Submunics T'Pol, a human who is the Valkon and Communications Officer. <br /> <br /> Some Americans (who have opposed more international feel to TNG staff) but create interesting dynamics. <br /> <br /> Very good pilot for a very good series.
