If you do not enjoy this movie, your dead, or you hate Adam Sandler or Don Chead. <br /> <br /> Good actors are all good actors. Despite the critics, the film has proven that Adam Sandler is a good actor. Adam Sandler is becoming a well-respected actor. It all started with his performance in Big Daddy, he made a couple of bad films, he was 50 First Dates, Longest Yard, then clicked, and now broke with an amazing performance in Over Reign Drama. Adam Sandler plays a guy who lost everything. He was close to his family and mother-in-law and mother-in-law. After his old college roommate (Cheadle) entered him, he continued to revolve around his life. I do not want to destroy the film, but I strongly recommend this film. One of the best films of 2007.
