It's not a big movie. Acting is not a wonder (some sub-charts are also played badly), the film is not beautiful in any sense. It is not really new or new. If you like big movies, it's not for you. And it's big - the story is really big. The story of Larry works, because this story knows from our own lives. We did not ask for the date, we failed the test, the friend we left in our history. This film works because it touches, this is a short story because it's a great story. We all have life, we all have with sadness, yet the message hits: Every life we ​​lived would have been their downside. For the first time I saw it, I was 15 years old. This is shown in the party in my school. 16 years later, I'm reflecting every time for a while, every time I see it, putting a smile on my face. Look. You will do better. You will be happy with what you have.
