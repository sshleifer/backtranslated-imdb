Today's sci-fi thrillers Rambo are like monster special effects in space-space (often humorous as the sounds of explosions in space vacuum). Despite the surrender by today's standards, the special effects of "Forbidden Planet" have worked harder for their time. Even today, they are still capable. Still, the reason for the appeal of radio thrillers is probably the best part of the film. Most of the upcoming events have been abandoned speculation. (How did Kelp's crew appear?) Most of the story's draft was not published or published only at the end, the film was tense and suspense. The end is also very thought-provoking and satisfying. In my mind, this is still the best (not the best) sci-fi images so far.
