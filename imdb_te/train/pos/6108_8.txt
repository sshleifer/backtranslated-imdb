This film is very happy. Many Korean people are familiar with the film because most of them have tutors on their way to school. Cinematography is average. The picture is good if the movement of the angel or the camera is very rare. However, editing is very neat and unusual. <br /> This acting is very good. Kim Ha Neil is an innocent, weak girl in Korean soap-opacity. But this time, she plays a pretty tadpole. Quan Sung Wu also credited his character to a great deal. <br /> <br /> I am very fond of this film, the emotions of characters are not exaggerated. There are so many Korean romantic pictures that the characters kill the river before the audience and I always pay a long time. <br /> <br /> Very funny and well made.
