When I see an extensive DVD box for this and the horrific Red Queen sculpture, I felt I'm in for a big disappointment, but surprised, surprise, I loved it. Of course the inability and inability of such a complex distraction can not just read the subtitles, but only to participate in a humorous explanation. However, the film is in a dream. Fabulous ladies and an amazing Bruno Nikolai score with amazing costumes in the whole thing constantly in excellent settings and amazing movements. He may not be Morricone, but he will remain in these lightweight pieces. A lot of color, really sexiness, some fun killing with some ghouter and less police intervention. Super.
