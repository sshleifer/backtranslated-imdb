The first Michael Vaughan film I saw - I did not see the alias - and I was eager to see if the guy could work. He liked and liked this movie. Natasha Hein Stridz is of course the most beautiful, but she usually finds herself more beautiful and moody in this different "sweet" character of this school, in more physical and behavioral roles. The negative comments I read are true, the film is full of clocs and the story does not have a real ring at all. Along the way, even though each character in the movie opens how good they are together, I do not have screen chemistry there. However, I enjoyed this film. The locals are good, the characters love and the good and the supporting actors are pretty good. If you want to see great love, it's not. It's great if you want to see a fun and innocent movie with the characters you love.
