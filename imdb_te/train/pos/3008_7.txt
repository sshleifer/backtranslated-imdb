Unflappable William Powell. There is a pleasure to see on screen as he makes his way into situations without protection of the world. He always appears on top of his game and hears little attention to anyone who hesitates. These killings are just humans, not just projects. I saw that this is the mainstay of this son. Apart from the occasionally dressed widow, the victims performed the work of the film. Not much more. There are enough turns and turns to keep things interesting along the way and Pavel is a master of this. There are a lot of political errors in regard to performers in Asia. This is a little difficult to take. The cast was very great, and Curtis directing was also a steady property.
