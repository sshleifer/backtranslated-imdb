There is some doubt about my part about this film. For starters, casting is not correct. Kiefer Sutherland has done well in "24" and this preview did not appear to challenge him or the audience. Eva Longoria does not appear in the place and the rest does not seem very interesting. <br /> <br /> Finally, when the film was over, I saw a good thriller that was very good. Responsible parties took care to watch the narrative gaps and gave more attention to the development of the character. We have seen this kind of threats before and the main conflict writers have become very challenging. As a viewer, we do not want the same old story again and again. <br /> <br /> Do you want to see something else, thrill and enjoy entertainment. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with casting. Kim Basinger's delicious first lady. She has her with an undesirable grace and sex appeal to make her part of the memorable part. Michael Douglas was previously and completed. Unfortunately, the President is also a part of his failure to pay attention to his fortune. <br /> <br /> Sutherland rebuilds his "24" tough guy with enough power to make it big enough for the big screen, and Eva makes a passive job as a newcomer. <br /> <br /> Many turns and fireworks are some of the classic classic ("North West West" and "The Fugitive"). Outside your expectations and maybe whatever it is. This is o.k.
