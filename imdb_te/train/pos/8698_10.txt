The film was seen in its release and has since been valued. What a wonderful group of actors (I always see a casting of one of the most interesting aspects of a movie). Really happy to see dramatic actress Jacqueline Bisset in this role and Wallace Shawn is always owl. The script is smart, sly and cheek in tongue, almost everything is poking fun at "Beverly Hills". Paul Bartel's "doctor" and Ray Scharick's psyche. It is so vulgar and floss, but thanks to God! I recommend this film unless you are proud of it. FyI is in "Rock and Roll High School" for anyone to play Kevin Bacon, Mary Wornow & Paul Bartel's six degrees. Mary Voronov and Robert Beltron are in "Night of the Comet". Both of them are in "eating roulette".
