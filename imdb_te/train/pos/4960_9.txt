The film is a short ray of sunshine in the dark season. It celebrates a quality described as plain old ally. Morgan Freeman plays himself as a freeman - picks up a successful actor 70. He went to a small, rather terrible grocery store, where he tries to research an episode of the role. <br /> <br /> The young man (Pazzega) Cranky, who is presiding over 10 items or less checkout lane, has a big announcement to do, particularly fascinating, and does not pretend to do it. As they become friends, Freeman and Vegas follow, the old man gives his advice, instead of a ride home, the movie-company Gopher has never been displayed and Freeman has forgotten his phone number and he can not call for help. I've had a gray Sunday afternoon blues case in New York City and the movie is dying to me.
