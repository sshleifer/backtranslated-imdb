I read a lot of this movie. I have seen this movie (and the whole prophetic series) many times with family members of all the films, we all enjoyed and meditated about what we already know since reading and reading the Bible about the Rapture and the End Times. No one was afraid or injured as I read in some posts. The film is just based on biblical facts. I saw a lot of end time movies "Tribulation", "Armagedon" and so on and this is one of the best in presenting biblical truths. It does not have a lot of great special effects like today's movies but I believe it is a good witness tool. This image and its prophetic series can be found free at highpraise.com this website, and judge for you. Blessings for everyone.
