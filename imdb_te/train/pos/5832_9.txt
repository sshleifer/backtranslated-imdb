Since watching the film, 30 years ago, I was never drinking. Perhaps it's their best film day, since the opening scenes in the Horn factory, from Car Motors back to the car model, answering Olly's phone and taking the window out of the way by Stan. After this they moved to the 20th Century Fox, and though the films were not terrible, they lost the film's comic timing. Jimmy Finnellan, in their last appearance with the boys, their longest time, is super wonder! Quote: "I said goat's milk" How do you answer Stan, who asks him? Charlie Hall and Ben Turpin also appear! I'll tell you all of my favorite L & H comedies.
