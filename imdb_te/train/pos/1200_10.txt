No fads, this morality story. Granger's troubled former buffet hunter tried to return to the plains once again by killing-crazed Taylor. Granger can be seen to be near the end, and the herds, the Indians and the deep on the ground are hunting down. Taylor, on the other hand, slaughtered the buffalo or Indians 'with a woman.' Although the grunge character of the cruel hunter is spectacular, this is the timer, which stole the show, dengue and immoral 'for everyone' fast buck and good times. There is no bang-bang here, but the story moves quickly, and we have played a fine role with Noon. The story of this story today is just as sharp as the 1800's on earth and its relation to humanity, and racism. When it was created, the sensors 'body house', the square relationship of Taylor, and their dialogues in most conversations cut their handicaps. Even though downbeat, this is really a great western film.
