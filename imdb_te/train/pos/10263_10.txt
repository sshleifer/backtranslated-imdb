"House of House" is a flawless constructive film and it is one of the few films I've ever seen, which makes me very intelligent and unexpected. After reading Roger Ebert's review, I saw the first time in the video a few years ago, which was announced as the best film of 1987. I do not know much about other films of that year because I have my doubts. Boy, I was for a surprise. <br /> <br /> Screenplay is not only in terms of plot, it turns out and pulls the rugs when you think you've found the following), but also in terms of character development. In my second view, I began to realize that Mammoth's screenplay was successful only as a suspense suspense film, but each plot helped to understand the development of characters and their motivations. The climax of the film is very effective because it is absolutely inevitable. It comes naturally from what we know about the characters, and it's not just a arbitrary twist end. The performances of Lindsey Croce and Joe Montegna are great. I can not portray the other actor who plays the role of Montecina Mike, and Croes plays a fairly decent role in pointing out his opinions of oppressed criminals. Their work, plus mammoth's unusual screenplay, combines to combine to be one of the greatest films of the 1980s. It really should be seen.
