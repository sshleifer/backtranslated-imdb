I have a bit of distrust before I watch British cinema, because I usually have them removed and boring screen placement (such as Vanity Fair or The Other Bolene Girl), with a striking product design, thick British tunes of landscapes and movies, Identify artistic values ​​that do not really exist Mother. Fortunately, the striking film The Young Victoria does not come in that situation, and appeals to its captivating heroine Emily Blunt, Paul Bettany and Jim Broadbent, and accidentally performing from the outfits and locations that make the film very elegant. And I say "unexpectedly" because I usually do not give much attention to those details. <br /> <br /> The "Victorian era" is one of the most important elements in contemporary civilization, and not only on social issues, but also the scientific, artistic and cultural aspects. I honestly did not know about the originals of that age, and I enjoyed the liberalization of the political and economic events that made the landing of the modern era. Queen Victoria is portrayed as a young and intelligent emperor, but their decisions are not always good, but they are at least inspired by good intentions. I felt a romantic drama between Victoria and Prince Albert, because it was equally interesting in the combination of intellectuals as well as in emotions. The only failure I found in this movie is that the screenwriter Julian Fellowes has used some clues of romantic cinema in love story, something that feels a bit out of place of his screenplay. /> <br /> I really liked the Young Victoria, and I got a very good surprise. The film will have a long time for movies: garments and landscapes to support an interesting hero and do not change it.
