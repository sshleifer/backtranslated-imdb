I took Walters mottou and Jack Lemmon's brilliant intuition. <br /> <br /> Laman is already in a number of well-known films such as Mr. Roberts and The Apartment. Matthew recently completed his Oscar victory for Fortune Cookie (another Billy Wilder, along with Lemmon). This film is not as great as I can not save such a long time (I think it's about 2 hours). However, the introduction of events leading to Lemmon, which ended in Mathou's apartment, was a tad long (this sentence). <br /> I wrote a comment on how to follow this movie and I can not go deep into that. The reason why this joy is made is that the American films have begun to swell rapidly into oblivion. There are some sexual references but you act in such a naive way, in which you can get "Well, I'll never ..." from the person who behaves best. It's fun to watch a movie from a long time lost period, and Meta and Lemmann have little to say, because the sequel is not working and it is not suitable for them. <Br /> <br /> In fact, both of you have gone out and you will still be happy to enjoy them in a fantastic way. I'm still alive, the male actor John Frieder. Edelman died recently. So there you are. <br /> <br /> Add: I recently learned that John Fidler was dead for all his fans, and I'm very sorry. I did not say any disrespect, and I try to be more careful with the blah blahing the next time.
