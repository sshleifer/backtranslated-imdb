Last night I also saw this show. It's totally better than what I expected of this film. <br /> <br /> "It does very well, but I say the performance of Adam Sandler is really refreshing and true. <br /> <br /> The film is not as funny as borat or Billy Madison but has a good pace, and 90% of the audience have been laughed in the film. <br /> <br /> The midway play by this movie Ntanni slow to settle and everything will be combined with a very nice job. <br /> <br /> I have the black / white friends that they can not ignore it, pay attention to their relations.
