I'm trying to find out about this series for age! Thanks, IMDb! I have seen a child and never get out of my mind. At a age of 6, I was especially stuck by the cyclops episode, which was completely chilling (I talked about it, my elder brother made me cyclops from a plastic caveman suitrin, I still have) I also remember, but the atmosphere From the unusual right is - mysterious, tough, and very authentic. Many years later, I felt the same feeling when I read the original. It's probably impossible in Hollywood - it's a difficult thing to capture. Each of the 'Odyssey' I saw was enormous let-down. The characters in the series are realistic, the real people - the ancient Greek people - and not some of the costumes of Hollywood actors. This is a real masterpiece! But - why not know it well? And why is it not available on VHS or DVD? I would love to have a chance to see this again!
