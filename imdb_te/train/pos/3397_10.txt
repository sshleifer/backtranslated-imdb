Sillent green is ... really good image, <br /> I never thought. I really did not like Heston in his science fiction trials. He is one of those actors who, like Superman, operates all over the sneery and invincible most of the time. I like more harmful leaders. <br /> <br /> In fact, he also sneers his way through much Soyland Green, but I do not really mind when he's going to play an overconfident bully <br /> <br /> Why can some people understand their noses at this film up. Soyland does not make any attempt to create green futuristic visuals (what you know - looks like 1973), and it does not lack in action. But I appreciated the attention of the film about the complex, corrupt, and the most rigid society, and Edward G. Robinson saw such a moving, funny final role. <br /> <br /> The message of Sailent Green is beautifully classified today, nowadays no one is in hell to government or corporations. Funny, it's not, a model to see Heston in the film of Michael Moore ...
