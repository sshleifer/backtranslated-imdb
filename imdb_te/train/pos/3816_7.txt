"Secret Sunshine" reminds me of "The Rapture" (1991) with Mimi Rogers and David Duchovni, but this Korean production is a better image. It portrays super-Korean Christians in a regional Korean city and the main character's experiences interact with them in the face of a terrible personal tragedy. Shin-A is a widow's single mother who moves from Seoul to Milaeng ('Secret Sunshine' Chinese) with her son. She was born in her husband (auto accident) because she chose Milyang, and she feels she needs to start a new life in a new place. She did not respond well to the negotiations of local Christian zealots, whose members attempted to convince her that she had come to her church and prayer meetings. Shin-A is unhealthy and these people make her look brusily. In fact, the Brushes are about everyone in Milyang to begin with, but some of them are continuous because she is trying to invade the world, and the consequences are often happy. More to say give away the picture, but it should be noted that the performance of the woman in the main character (Jeon Do-yeon) is tremendous. After reading that she won a Best Actress Award in Cannes in 2007, I feel her a good job. But Ms. Geon is attractive and she is impossible to take your eyes when she is on the screen. The film is a form of Evelyn Wag-Esquire's work, which shows how fate looks intriguingly inevitable.
