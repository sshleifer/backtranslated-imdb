I especially love Kristen Dunst in Elizabethtown. I guess she is a good actress who does not act before the camera, but only to her. She did it, and she looked very natural at Elizabethtown. In the film, however, she attempted to add a more artificial performance, especially in the first half of the film, as she looked more intelligent editor. In the other half, she completely set back on her daily track, and I did not tell her what she was editor. Therefore, her performance in this film is not continuous. <br /> <br /> The film is thrilling and exciting. Young's role is completely and reasonable. Anyway, the film tells the story of a big and sophisticated story. <br /> <br /> The heroine and heroines love story did not turn out. When I kiss at the end of the story, I'm totally confused because it's unclear for the two people.
