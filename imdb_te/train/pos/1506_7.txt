Films such as 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,' 'Suprifia,' and 'Halloween' have changed horrific scenes ever, with more Gothic and minimal violent era. Films such as the Hammer Horror series and 'Rosemary Baby' were horrified and surprisingly crowded in the 60s and 70s. I can not tell you how many times I rent this film in my childhood, because I have something because I did. <br /> <br /> I do not want to limit movies such as the 70s and 80s Slazher and Jambis films and the popular production, but unfortunately the Amicus film industry was a good start. <br /> <br /> Pros: A grand, strange music score. Strong performances from the stellar cast. Bright cinematography. In plenty of good old fashioned thrills and chills, especially in the first and last noise. Some haunting moments and pictures. Slow, but with constant speed. The house is a horror, oppressive habitat. Great production design and set decoration that gives the real old gothic horror feel in the film. <br /> <br /> Cons: Some losing problems in the first half. Unlike 'The Clock', the rest of the stories feel like they did before. There are plenty of cliche. The second story, 'Waxworks,' is good acting and it's moments, but four weak in fear and suspense. <br /> Final thoughts: After watching the film for the first time in many years, how often can I rent? This is not a masterpiece anyway, but it is a good example when horror films are made with style and class. Look at this one of the lights. <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5
