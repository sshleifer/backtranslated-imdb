I know much about the prince, but in the last few years I have seen a very purple rain novel tea and I thought they were cool but I did not want to buy a shirt. So one Saturday got it in the fuse and I decided to see it. I do not know what I saw when I saw the movie but it was great after I found out. In the film the prince is not known as prince or "child". I am great but my favorite purple rain, Darling Nicky all the shows, and I die for you. All the songs were revealed in the movie when all parents spoke about what he felt when his mother and father had ever sang the song. I also like how good he is with Absolunia. I was delighted when I met Prince and Apollonia for the first time in the club and she stood upright and then he disappeared! Great image and now I cant find one of those even T-shirts :(
