'Informer' is not one of the best of American West in John Ford's best films. Ford became known for the drama on the less stringent landscape of the face of British character Viktor McLaughlin instead. The former gift holder, who once faced Joe Lewis in the ring, gave him the worst night of the life of the innocent IRA soldier Geo Nolan's Academy Award-winning role. <br /> <br /> These plots are simpler and simplistic: Dublin, a hungry and humiliated man who threw him out of the IRA for being lost in killing an information in a blood, became a communicator of himself. For Â£ 20 he is a friend of "Tans" and the rest of the night he drinks and substitute acts of disappointing desires to avoid guilt, denial, self-pity and his consequences. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ In many movies Geo's kind of horror sounds are heavily cast, he has two or three lines of good, and the hero and the villain have their showdown. <br /> <br /> Zippo's hero in 'The Informer', as villain, and Showdown in his inner crisis, each bit is clearly shared with the audience. <br /> <br /> Liam O'Filherty's novel was previously shot in 1929, and RKO Ford gave a fairly modest budget. The director and his colleagues, specifically cinematographer Joseph H. August, have changed it for their purpose in creating a claustrophobic masterpiece about a man in war with him. Along with McLaglan's Oscar 'The Informer', John Ford has also won Best Screenplay and Best Score.
