The director begins with the film "John" Bud "Cardus, which starts regularly in a mysterious note and gradually allows images to pass through the studder, crazier and more exciting story. Additionally, Cardos fills the screen with plenty of dazzling visuals and creates a great deal of work to create a sense of awe and surprises. Christopher Mitchem as his beloved Richard like Grant Williams and Dorothy Malone as a paternal grandfather of Jim Davis, played a sweet little role as his lovely wife Beth and Natasha Ryan. Girl Jenny, and Scott C. Goldden as Getsy Steve. Funky special effects jenarley miniatures, inspired combo animated monsters (a small spindly scrumptious person in the animals, a large, slurry, fanged beast and a tight lizard beast) and nifty matte paintings.
