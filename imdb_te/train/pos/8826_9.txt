<br /> <br /> If you are entertaining by the straight-handed gains, you are logical in a legitimate situation given, you'll enjoy this weird 8-minute Spanish film. <br /> A woman enters a small cafe. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, musicians begin to sing and sing a person's title song, dancing table tops with musical-comedy. Signs. Customers were read at the palm of the palm, at first and foremost, with phrases in the break (partially but damaged). <br /> <br /> They dance and dance on the movements of the choreographer (and awkwardly but strong) as backup singers. <br /> Why ??? Wonderful Woman. <br /> If you do not catch the explosion (perhaps sarcastic) literature, the soloist's jacket opens up and she sees what she's put on her chest. The exact shows of the situation give you a smile and a stew ... I'd love to see again!
