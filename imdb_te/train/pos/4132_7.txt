Surprisingly good comedy is a small British effort "The Divorce of Lady X (1938)". It was the first portrait of Laurence Oliver and Merle Oberon's predecessor in the 19th-century English corner of the unseen hobby. Olivier and O'Brien are not particularly well suited to Screwball comedy, all of which flow well. Oberon Leslie, priggish divorce attorney by preventing a nasty English fog, is a young woman who ends up in Logan's (Oliver) hotel suite. She does everything possible to get irritating him - but, crazy things go for her, go for the movies. And she comes to him. However, Oliver feels Oberon's "Lady X" (Oliver being dropped in a note), a serious case of false identity occurs when Olivier feels married. Larry Mary (Ralph Richardson) goes to Olivier and wants a divorce from his wife, whom he loves to be Larry Oberon! Sexual politics has some good war-of-sex dialogue, and fun searching. You can see that you do not believe in Oliver's comedy, but in the real Olivier he is the perfect professional, and distributed. And he turns the screwball turns and turns, not easy, but with pleasure. While O'Barran trembled as a great actress, she was generally capable enough, and worked well with Oliver, even though she did not like the popular off-screen. It was originally portrayed in Technicolor, which appears to be too old (everyone looks like a veterier than Michael Jackson), but probably requires printing.
