I'm a fan of Simon Pegg and have seen all of his movies up to now and no one of them could laugh at me. <br /> <br /> This is the only way to lose friends and how to distance yourself from friends. Nevertheless, he has an experimental set, which prevents him from doing things that are prominent. <br /> <br /> The movie features humor, romance, good acting and lap dance. Its one of those films you're happy with when it ends.
