This film is not as bad as I heard. It's fun, funny and I love the holiday season revolves around. It's completely in the mood for Christmas shop and listen to holiday music. When this movie comes on DVD, I will take a Christmas vacation spot in my collection. It's a movie to see each year after Thanksgiving to get a mood for the best time of the year. I heard that Ben's character was a bit crazy but I think it just adds the movie and why it will be very serious all the time. Take it for what, a Christmas romance with a romantic twist. I enjoyed it. No, it's not a titanic and it does not make your heart pound unexpected but it brings a smile or two. So laugh and have a good time :)
