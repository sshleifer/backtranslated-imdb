Gerard Phillip gives this movie a superior dimension of a picture which is more funny, tender, brave, absolutely perfect and lover.He many of these actors also work (Gina Lollobrigida: miaoooou !!) through the story or the rhythm. Never, boring is always creating new emotions: me, the best French film of all time.
