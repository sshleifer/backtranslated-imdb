My imagination is very high for this movie. I know everyone who has seen this movie in the film, because everyone is standing by credits because they touch it. <br /> <br /> My expectations are not big, but it is a great disappointment for me. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed by this film. How did I deal with difficult things without looking at the simple steps I would like to include in the Hollywood film? They worked through the problems that they had suffered for decades, they worked through objections, they learned to open. But it did not come easily, just by singing or singing two songs. It was painful, it took arguments, it took clashes. <br /> <br /> I thought you were in real life. <br /> <br /> When a song that really met me, Gabriel damaged her song. Helen Sozom was one of my favorite singers, her voice was lovely, and she was not synced to her during filming (often seen in other films), she really sang with her whole body and soul. You feel what Gabrielle felt in that scene. The film is sung to the end of her song as it is made in Hollywood, and her husband will open his eyes and see the errors in his ways, as well as two other people in the village. Instead it came through half, and it does not bring any solutions. Her husband is not indifferent and he finds out what he thinks, and nobody in the village has publicly considered. It's very beautiful, it's pure and it does not solve all the problems, even if it's touching. I have a real feeling, perhaps it's what happened in real life. The whole picture is considered to be a real life for me, so happy and happy that nothing is beautiful. <br /> <br /> There are some things that make me bother, but hey, no movie is right. If you have not already, you have to look at "Heaven" and rarely come to feel for happiness, silence and the touch that you've touched in a level of life. You are sad, sad, and a dozen other emotions. <br /> <br /> One day every singing person in the world sang the band. I see this picture.
