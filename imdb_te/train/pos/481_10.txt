It is one of the most unusual cases in which a movie and two great cases of novel based on it. Perhaps the reason is that Goris' nabokov's early ideas are taken up and gives them a different meaning. <br /> <br /> The only thing I do not like is Valentinov's influence on the duty of Luzhun. I can not imagine if Nabokov created a person like Valentinov and made a great impact on the novel's argument.
