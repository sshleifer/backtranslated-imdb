Well, because I know my friend a friend about this movie, they came to the set really during the filming, so from personal stand-point, I finally found this vague little gem. If you dig up all of the information about this movie, you will find that you are caught up in legal issues (after 7 years of filming), so if you are in all things like me - then you have a copy. Is my source EBay. About $ 15 but when I came it today in the mail it's a very hard and hard copy of the full "screen only" release with annoying top mini time-code, but alas because I have not yet enjoyed it but if I have a correct copy, I suggested to you that the effect might or may not be on you. From what I have collected, it was released on DVD in Germany & now in Spain. With that, good luck & cheerful search / bidder ...;). Score / sndtrk is worth it alone. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> The role of Billy Jane is that he introduces a nurse in a mental ward, stealing his clothes (even boots) and quickly seizing the bank / loan shop, but exploitation, well, I guess I'm starting this "plot" - he accidentally loses it. Many camper over the top crimes & dollars to a calls to a calls to c-list celebs to the find, he finds himself in a cemetery - a funeral - I am a dead person he shoot / bank in the loan office, and - Cops can also see him steady for all - he can not ever see or hold. (He reports daily newspapers as his "crimes"), which I liked, because it provided a thin plot extension. After all, it is a picture (see: fiction) & director Iris Iliopulos I have everything possible 1) Bring Wood's vision to hypocrisy and 2) Give it an updated feel, and still have the police cars shots of the standard 50's, ahh, local LA .99 $ stores - so well my 9 ratings. If the period and clues are authentic - I would have given a 10. Now it's a very weird self-wrap up and I can spoil it for anyone but let's just say it's somewhat frustrating, for me, it promises, action and comedy-everything to the end, so all says - assign a copy of your own discretion. <br /> <br /> Diauju (except for a few commentary and singing) It will be your thinner - maybe not - but I definitely think it's worth a watch. Actors make all fine performances and this is correct only in the time periods I've really made for the correction - keeping these images in the present day, I'll be sure to do this in the future by checking this movie).
