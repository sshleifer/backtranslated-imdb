So what is the reason for this? Is there any contradiction in this awesome program or its participants? Why is the best performance I have seen over the years canceled? I'm addicted. I randomly saw this show with late fall, I immediately liked it and saw it every week. Then it went away, and I tried TiVo, but it was not aired. So I forgot about it for quite a while until I found episodes on ABC's website. Now I want more. I agree with everyone - with the rest of the gag on the rest of the TV, it is well-rounded and developed. I'm looking for Boston Legal for my Extravagant-Comedy solution, House for my intellectual-mystery-jacuzzi riddles. My wife loves Gray's anatomy for its "realism", and I hate love / show, but it's not real to me. WAY is very playable. Everything that is wrong, does. But once, there is a play that is really true. Real people, real problems. Certainly, some people like a former gangster, a girl running from the crowd, etc., but these people (especially in NYC) are really there and I have something to do with each of them. I can not get enough of it. I believe that ABC will get their heads from their bean-counting butts and continue this show. Get some respect for QUALITY play there. It is one of the best performances of all time. If someone leaves it.
