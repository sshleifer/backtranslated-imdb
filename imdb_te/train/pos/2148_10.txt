While I am on TV, I always look forward to this film. I have to get the DVD that I expect. The range of different people is great. They told me that someone is a dancer if they try hard enough. My favorite character must be Mr.Aoki. He is so agile but full of emotions. This is a perfect image with excellent dancing. Unfortunately we can not get them to go to Blackpool and see. If they have a perfect sequel will do. <br /> <br /> I do not see the Hollywood remake and I'm not sure I'll want to I really do not like Jennifer Lopez, and I feel like Richard Gear and Lopez is more real and I have a feeling that the remake is not simple and innocent.
