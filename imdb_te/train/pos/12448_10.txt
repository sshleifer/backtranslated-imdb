First part; I am a special fan of Maddis, I am reading comics when I was young, and I found past movies about our heroine unsatisfactory, but where they failed, these rocks! <br /> <br /> Well, here we go: Ms Blaise comes along with a gang of robbers, working for a casino and starts gambling for the lives of her friends. If the thief won a round, she would have to tell him about her. If she won two consecutive times, one of the staff goes freely. <br /> <br /> "I refused, the elderly in the refugee camp and how they survive, live by nature's own rules They hunt for food, and she teaches her to read and fight. When they reach civilization they get trapped in battle, and as they take for revolt, they are shot dead and old <br /> <br /> What to follow is a fantastic fight and the lines are completely cool. Stenen is a Terrible Modist Blaze! Comic is just as modest and strong, elegant and intellectual. <br /> It's not really funny, but it's definitely not the blaze of the funny book blaze from the not-so-modesty, but it's definitely relevant to the already existing voice acting, the young blaze personifies a must applause even if the child is really good (unnatural one in the Balkans English is not - not to mention ..) <br /> <br! /> <br /> She must be part of my favorite where she kicks her dress up to kick the donkey's stupid thief! Absolutely awesome! : D real adventure next movie / s <br /> <br /> I can not wait until <br /> <br /> Look, you will not be disappointed!
