The Sarah Silverman program ... is better than other shows. No smile tracks, no painful jokes, just a program. The Sarah Silverman Program. If you are like me, and if you love comedy, it's probably a show for you. <br /> <br /> Sarah Silverman brings funny and fun funny to be in the fun table. <br /> <br /> The program does not have to start a comparable war with you, it is with them (other programs). I think this show is its own company, and most comedy heads are good. <br /> See, see.
