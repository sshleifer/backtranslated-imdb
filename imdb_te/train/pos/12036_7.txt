Where am I convinced there is another image version of this novel there is nowhere? I have seen this movie again and again, and I found the changes in the film - the little boy did not appear in the novel and eventually changed. They kill him in the film but the whole point is that he has haunted events at Eel Marsh house for many years but could rehabilitate and eventually put events behind him. Mr. Bentley's most difficult role in the novel is the silhouette of the film that shoots the Kipps office, and the steady performance of toy soldiers to indicate the existence of the child is honestly crazy but nonsense - the child wants to retaliate. I'm sure I've seen a movie that is very close to the novel and is actually going to be. Did i guess it?
