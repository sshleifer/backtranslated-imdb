I was going through a list of Oscar winners and was surprised to see for the best movie after seeing it in the fact that this movie was defeated by Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid in 1969, but I'm not surprised at you. It's way ahead of its style, cinematography, its time, and the use of retrospective use Joe Bucks character. <br /> <br /> The most striking thing for me is the small picture to help the depth of Joe Buck's character in such a one. Void feel innocent and extravagant-when provoked. He gets blowjob in the theater and there are two scenes that really drew me to the old man after his solicits. I think he's trying to see if he is in the mirror-whether he is really done- or terrible something is do-about. <br /> <br /> I thought Hoffman was a wise decision to take this role. Otherwise he could become a titikost after graduate. However, it was thought to be a great time for a reason.
