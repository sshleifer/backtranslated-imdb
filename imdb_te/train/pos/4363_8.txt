It is a little disconcerting to have a character named Gig Young in a movie ... played by Gig Young. <br /> <br /> In this film, Gig has got his name and enhances a good career even after playing small pieces with another name. <br /> <br /> For other comments, this film is primarily because of Barbara Stanwick's powerful performance as Fianna. <br /> <br /> She was funny, angry, hurt, laborious, and agile, and his father was killed in Woar War I after the death of his daughter, Luciana. <br /> <br houses, Fiona is steady for years against fixing her father's will, so it will allow Donald Trump type Charles Barclay's family to get home. But Fiona keeps secret why she hates her barque. Geraldine Fitzgerald is a middle-class, flat sister who marries an Englishman, but prefers her younger sister boyfriend (Gig Young). <br /> <br /> If you're a Stanwick fan, you can not miss it.
