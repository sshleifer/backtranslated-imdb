Good story. A good script. Good cast. Good acting. Good direction. Good art direction. Good photography. Good sound. Good Editing. Everything good. Put it all together and you will end up with good entertainment. <br /> <br /> It is not in the movies that these caliber have made these days of shame. <br /> <br /> The writers / directors like John Hughes occasionally feel lucky to hear their creative voices. <br /> <br /> For the third or fourth time, I must watch the movie and be completely satisfied that I should say something is right about that movie.
