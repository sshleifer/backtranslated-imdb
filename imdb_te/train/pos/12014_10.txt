This is the most spectacular film I have seen in a very long time. The actors gave spectacular images of the characters in the film. The story is definitely shot. The story begins with a young woman from the British Isles and is the father who travels through Stevealt to Navove in Illinois. She became a member of the LDS Church and he was not. He is ludicrous and discouraged to travel. She encourages Joseph Smith to read about the prophet. The story of the story of Joseph Smith begins. The film is a clear picture of the history of the LDS church at its own and at the same time. This is sometimes graphic, but not necessarily. Emotional expression is very believable, causing my emotions to kill. The filming is amazing. The story line is touching. After the end of the film, we could not go there. I was amazed. Joseph Smith, Mormon's Prophet I will encourage you to see this for the lesser-known people. Not only to get some sense of his life. For all church members, I encourage you to see it. Your testimony of this most incredible man will increase. It must be seen.
