I absolutely love this movie and would like to have something really like it. It is just a lovely myth about an eagle wears the Turquoise necklace, I love and want to see again! I did not remember much about it, but a native American boy lived in a nice village with his family, and I could not remember what would happen, but he went to the wilderness alone. His sister has prepared some food for him and he goes. While he is there, some other Indian boys run, some feathers on him, and he turns into a hawk. Myth says if you see an eagle wearing a turquoise necklace, it is a boy. I'm always attracted to legends, especially the Native American legends, and I love to see this DVD release on a DVD.
