The film is not visually spectacular in the traditional scenario. It does not display a range of images. Instead it is an interesting visual picture. This may continuously process the viewer or imagine a different stroke context. This sort of thing is easy to try but hard to succeed at. The film rejected the use of a movie in the film to help determine what's going on for a fully engaged viewer. Instead, the film moves and moves through a variety of moves. The movie-loving trick is getting this delightful pleasure. I suspect 99% of the North American audience simply can not afford it. If you try to pin this movie story, or philosophical message, or symbols, you will waste your time. Nothing of them. This film is only used for these films and others. The uniform strength of the film is sufficient for any of Claire Denis's. There are very few films that satisfy the look of the art of the art, the pleasure of the judgment's power, not just the experiences under the concepts. The movie is generally light and brings in for simple pleasure to understand what's going on. Not quite a film art. Most do not come close to art. When an image is made, this one does, and still enjoying a large number of viewers, it's something of a miracle. In my negative comments, I realized that at some times the movie would buy different heroes that read the most. Tahtie's father-son story, though not correctly conventional, ends to make things clear and simpler. It is very high.
