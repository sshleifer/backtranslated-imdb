Truman Capote's novel Cold Blood's Rich 1967 film of 2005 is a perfect companion for Philip Seymour Hoffman's Oscar winning show in CAPOTE. They really play well together (try them on special nights). It is unusual to find movies for 38 years. These two really enhance each other. Although the characters of Perry Smith and Dick Hickoks are different actors, the two pieces are perfectly integrated. The only part of Brooks' films (played by Paul Stewart) is weak because Capote is named after him. I first started looking at CAPOTE, then it was cold bold. It makes for a powerful experience!
