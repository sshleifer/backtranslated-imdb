I really enjoyed this movie. I was a smart, athletic and single-father with a 17 year old daughter. My girl has applied well to solve crimes and help others! So for me, maybe this PG level is Fantasyland. I have read many Nancy Drew books in my teen years. Emma Roberts certainly played this role but Nancy Drew I did not recall from these books. <br /> <br /> Emma plays self-confident, hard and proud character with good manners and good taste. She was not caught in an advanced competition around her. <br /> <br /> There are some weaknesses in the plot, and not the Nancy Drew book, and we've been trying to find out what decade we've been (what is a car, what?) I'm researching other films from Rachel League Cook, I read the overview. This is not one of the best roles in her, but I'm looking at her movies too. <br /> <br /> "Some people are looking for perfect connections with some books, some loyal conditions or adult action films. I enjoyed! Good entertainment is very well targeted young teen girls, and the behavior and achievement high standards are good for their children good kids It is not Teen PG Movie, James Bond! Would you like for a model model?
