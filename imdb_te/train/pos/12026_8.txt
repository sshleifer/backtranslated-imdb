I have to say that this TV movie was really a work that showed how talented Melissa Jon Heart was. We are looking at her in a sitcom and are now using it and I really hope that the TV station is going to show off this TV movie soon, which MJH will show fans of the shining Sabrina in a drama. She has been in Sabrina for 5 years now and is a plus for her to view the most useful talent for viewers. Melissa plays her role in this role, as her parents have "done" with the person she loves. One thing that all Sabrina spectators will notice is that Melissa worked with David Lacher, before he took up the role of Josh on Sabrina. So it's nice to see this now when it's going to be over again. Hopefully MJH movies or more TV movies, sort of gets some good characters like Kelly Martin who always shined TV movies. Lots of unused talents When it comes to Melissa Jon Hart Bust Wait, you always shine Melissa !!!
