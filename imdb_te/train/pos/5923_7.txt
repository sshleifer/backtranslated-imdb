A woman who hates cats (Alice Craig) and her son (Brian Cross) goes into a small town and is an intermediate teacher (Glen Shadics), their abusive relationship, lovely girl (Madchen Amik) and a hell. Well, technically, it's a "bad picture". But who cares? It's so fun! <br /> <br /> If you do not know what you are doing, you can do it yourself, But it's entertaining and laughable to you!
