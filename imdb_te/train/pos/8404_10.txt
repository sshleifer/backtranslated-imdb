A simple-thought-minded and well-driven drive-in film about a simple-thought-minded but good-natured high school graduate who has the world's coolest props to use as his "ballroom". <br /> <br /> Bobby, our hero, spends his savings to get the vehicle of his dreams. Bobby picked up at the local pizza parlor, but he was responsible for a lot of responsibility, danger and heartbeat, the owner of such mechanical marvel. <br /> <br /> The flawed pleasure of the van van mine. It captured fresh water at the end of the 70s and had enough random humor to keep in the "Good Good" category.
