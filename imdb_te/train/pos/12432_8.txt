I look forward to being the same kind of skunk as the previous modest blaze film, so I did not leave it for a long time, but I was very pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The silly gun battles and the car / boat along the way, it's how you look like a pretty girl nails, which is almost thoughtful, almost nothing, or more-rational. <br /> <br /> It was helpful with the fact that budget shocks actually helped: Stunt men spent less time and effort finding the exact ways to act as an actress, and were more dedicated to watching the movie value. Hell, the biggest gun battle takes off - it's the best of the background noise that adds to the scene of the scene that's heard, who won? <br /> <br /> Alexandra Staden is not as gorgeous as Monica Witty, but some, and she certainly has every ounce of class and fire needed to make the character work - and the shape of her face, her hair, and her long, thin The body may be lifted directly from the comic strip graphics. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Coster-Waldau a Blaze is the right choice for the evil-man, he is able to see the character interesting and enjoyable - even the one who likes (I think most serious and mental murderers will consider taking friends). <br /> <br /> Luckily, all the girls who are spending their time swooning over such a disgustingly beautiful and interesting hunk are now diligently resolved to solve Joes routinely, because Blaze Badies will never die (there are no spoiler s there).
