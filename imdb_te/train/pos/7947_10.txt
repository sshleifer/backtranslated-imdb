I have seen this movie many times by my baby hood, to this day I will show all the conversations pretty much. And when I look at it now it makes me happy and surprisingly still smiles. I think it's amazing how the animals managed to train cat especially when they are capable of playing a feature film. But looking at this now, I have noticed that this is not a masterpiece. But I prefer to remember how I felt about it when I was young looking at it on VHS on my fist TV that is yellow cloud image. And in mind it's a child's picture, I'm still sure 10/10 why.
