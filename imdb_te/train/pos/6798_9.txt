(Not spoilers, just plot details) I can not understand such a hate for this episode. Want to see a small episode of Smallville? See landlord - now in the sack of the trash. Tom Welling gives me a good performance (I've said so often), and Michael Rosenbaum is great, but he's a lot of time. The alternate universe appears to be very realistic in the scenario. Marsian Manhunter, who first appeared in "static", tells Clarke to return and Clark, the head of the mad shelter they were holding, actually a Phantom from Phantom Zone, and Clark to kill him, the universe. A great deal of good acting and good pace.
