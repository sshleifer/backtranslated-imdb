The film is perhaps the most touching and exciting I have ever seen. I'm not a religious person, but sometimes a great art in this film gives me a very religious experience. <br /> <br /> When I hear about this film, I must admit that I am suspicious. I thought I had alerted the story plot and I was scared that the story was baseless. But as a David Lynch fan I decided to take it. It took 30 minutes to capture the film completely, but I missed it completely. This film has so much knowledge and warmth! <br /> <br /> It's not a typical David Lynch film, it's a surprise to be able to make the film in some ways. The dark shoulders of human nature for many years. On the other hand, he was not surprised to let deep emotions and deeper human insight, because I thought he was doing very well at Elephant Man. Lynch is one of the most gifted directors around and I think Straight Still is still his best. 9.5 / 10
