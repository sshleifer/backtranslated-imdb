This film is great. Perhaps set back in the 40s, Meg Ryan's character is called 'Smart'. Plus the Tim Robbins is very beautiful in the film. And everything about it is a magical feeling. Every time I feel happy. It is definitely a girl picture, and I'm a girl, so I like it. I also loved music. Violin is awesome. But besides that I think it's a beautiful story and everyone should watch.
