This is the best film I have seen through all categories. Forget Hollywood - Their movies always suck - this art! Moon Child starts with the story - a Japanese Vampire, who lives in what he is and disillusioned. His wish for the ultimate death leads to mallepa, where refugees live from many Asian countries. <br /> <br /> From here, the film is a serious feeling based on visual and emotional material. It is everything; You laugh, you cry, you are angry, curious, sad, and happy ... Never has this movie done for me. And the actors are amazing - I've never heard anyone speak too much languages ​​without the strange sound. <br /> <br /> One last comment on this fantastic movie is that it is a gagat (the former singer of Malice Meizer) and Hyde (La Arc singer) ~ en ~ ciel). <br /> <br /> "If you do not see movies, Moon Child, The Crow (Brandon Lee) and the newly released Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children All of their original languages, of course!
