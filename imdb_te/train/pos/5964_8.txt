Fine of an art film, a child of 80s and hard rock music fan ... This film has a special place in my heart. It has everything you can do in a supernatural film: Action, Great Special Effects (1986), and Guitar WALLOCKING Glam-Rock Soundtrack. It is certainly the image of all the heavy metal fans at that time. I did not see it in the movie because it was not theatrical here ... but in the eighties it became popular in the video up to eighty years, it received the status of worship and eventually led to a (sad, mediocre) DVD release in 2002. If you are not a fan of creepy movies or rock music this is probably not your tea cup ... But, trust me, there are the worst pictures of this kind ... and average acting and some outrageously ridiculous situations, trick or treat most definitely a frightening riff On horror fare. You will not see your stereo again. Or should I say MP3 player? <br /> <br /> TRICKIA-MARCH PRICE (ADY) Trick-Mark Price (Eddie) has played the character of Jikie Skipi Handelman in the popular long-term comedy sitcom 'Family Ties'.
