I gave this film such a high mark because it's really cute, really cute, all though unpretentious. When I was playing Philli in the area, I went to see this film, it was a great night with friends and friends. The film is well written and well done, and if it's a bit like a sitcom, it will not be away from the film. You can never see the comedies you like and you should not shock people to be funny. The movie is centered around a Ukrainian housekeeper, which will work for a young couple to help. Although at first she helps, bargained for her soon adds more craziness to their lives. Until Things Get From More and More Control .... You Will See! I ridiculed me after leaving the theater. This film kept me in good mood. I can not wait until it's released on DVD because I want this movie in my collection.
