This film is very beautiful. The art of Golds Worthy is really mediocre, because you can see art as its beautiful, moving and changing and blooming. I strongly recommend this picture to everyone. I can not think of anything else to say about it. When you leave the theater, it's only a picture you want to see because it is visually compelling and very refreshing.
