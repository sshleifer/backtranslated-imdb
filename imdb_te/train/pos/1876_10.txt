Simulation of the book 'Finding Fish'. The story is about an influential young sailor Anthon Fisher (Derek Luke) who claims to be a psychiatrist for Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington), a psychiatrist. <br /> <br /> Derek Luke is an excellent performance by a wonderful debut and Denzel Washington. <br /> <br /> This film is not very spectacular, it was released during a bad time and why it did not care. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this story to everyone, if you touch his story, it will sympathize with the audience that the audience is called finsar. <br /> <br /> If you like the true stories of inspiration <br /> <br /> Thank you
