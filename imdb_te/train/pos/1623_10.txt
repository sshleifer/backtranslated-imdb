Tea cartoon was replaced by cousin instead of this country. Visually well done and more entertaining and memorable. Worth watching only for music! While there is undoubtedly some of the things that are sensitive to sensitivities, the cartoon should give a bit of perspective. It has been over sixty years and after all, just a cartoon. I am disabled and if I look at things like this cartoon and folks to take the umbrage, if I have very sensitive, I will be curled up and away in a fetal position for a long time. Sometimes you need to put your head back and float, to light up! The cinematography of the celebs in the cartoons is common and almost never terrible in the 1930s and 1940s. Bing Crosby hates it when he uses it in more than one occasion. * Sigh *
