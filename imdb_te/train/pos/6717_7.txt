The documentary was very thorough and revealed, and was fun at the same time, which I thought was impressive. I felt that I had done a good job by linking the game to this movie so far, although I did not give such a high score to the film ... I think the story of the 'correct nouns' , So to speak: to surf in individual places and especially in the surfers, especially the most Countries. With the nature of the game, with the concept of the game, I thought it was more about the theory of the game, it would be nice (although I do not think this was a long time to guarantee it though it was covered). <br /> Also, for many people who are not fully nourishing about surfing, when they hear them, specific surfers become boring at specific locations. <br /> <br /> While video clips and depth research are well respected, it is best for those who are not interested surfers. <br /> <br /> Yet, my biggest disappointment times are the times that they are completely amazing and exciting in some of the history of surfing how they did not have the actual footage of unfolding these events, and the whole time you waited to see this exciting, breath-taking event silver screen There are men talking about changing moments of life, and eventually all you get is g Inci has been talking to a lot of men, and not the original footage. These stories are very durable to hear, and I can not see them later. I understand that it's hard to get the footage of everything, but please: Do not brag up the event too, and it does not show up. <br /> <br /> Overall, the most recent documentary I'm looking for; Not the best documentary for the aforementioned reasons, but it's very fresh and having some very exciting footage and good soundtrack, a documentary that I advise everyone to check.
