Like Tarzan the Ape Man (1932), more than that. Everything, more animals, more diverse African tribes, and if the idea is good with three, four lions, it is forty good. Tarzan wrestling with crocodiles ?? A rolling pin with crocodile machine, around and around, spins in water like flapping jaws. Tarzan can kill with his ubiquitous knife. Tarzan kills lions and rhinos and the animals are constantly growing. His friends wore real chimps, big monkey costumes and elephants. In fact, they are more friendly and trained than the Africans with the Indian elephants attached to their heads. Human story: The rest of the white man meets the elephant graveyard to walk after the ivory and meet with the hold. Tarzan does not show them the way, so the evil man shoots an elephant so that they can follow it to its death. Tarzan intercedes, and the bad man shoots him? But, in fact, he lives and returns to save Jane. Everyone will die, Holt and the bad guy and each one of them "dies." People work through the banned white men and black members who kill them because there is not much difference between people expendable, especially Africans, and dead blacks. This is the last Tarzan movie before Jane's predefined outfits. There are many underwater scenes in which Jane is naked, and glimps are glamorous while experiencing light movement. Apparently one of Wales's friends from the Olympic swimming team is Nude scenes, and Maureen O'Sullivan. Nevertheless, a similar lounger moves through the film wearing, weiss Weilmor and the thigh and hip's magnificent glimpse. They still do not need to talk too much. They sleep together and hang out with the cool animals and stay away from the cities. They are happy.
