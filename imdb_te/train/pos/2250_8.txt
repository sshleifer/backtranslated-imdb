This is a fantastic picture about Mormons fighting and their final solution to Salt Lake, Utah. The start and end are particularly powerful, and the message we need to remember - God does not speak, but he speaks, we only listen. I am writing this in the midst of horror in New Orleans and surrounding areas due to Katrina, especially after the murder of Joseph Smith and I left everything behind Mormons behind. People came to this country to escape religious persecution. In the Mormons fighting nation, the casualties, the difficulties they have experienced are really scary, demonstrating their tremendous strength. <br /> <br /> For the true beliefs of Mormons, this is heavily lost and polygamy is mentioned but not the film's headquarters. <br /> <br /> The cast is commented on the top-lyric, the original characters, and talk about how real the shoots are. But the actors, Dean Jagger, Marie Astor, Brian Donnelly, John Caradine, and Jane Darwell have both performed fantastic. Today) Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell have been included in the movie theaters to include movies about Mormons for the cast. Power is beautiful as a young Mormon, and Danal, like Jina, is not a Mormon but with her family after her father kills. When he was on a big scene, there was no need for power until the end of the film, and while Darnell (still a young man at the time of filming), they made a lovely couple. Their destiny is not clear about their consequences, and they are surprised by their polygamy. But you can not beat anything for eye candy.
