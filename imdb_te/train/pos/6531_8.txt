I really liked this movie ... it's beautiful. I enjoyed it, but if you did not, it was your fault. Emma Roberts has played a nice Nancy Drew role, although she is not like many books. Old fashionable clothes are unrealistic when you see them in modern times, but she looks good to them. For me, the rich girls do not have clothes that make them look great. I mean, they seem to have taken all the clothes - at a garage sale - and decided to put it all together. All of the dresses are yellow, especially when they wore penny loafers with their regular outfit. I do not like to look bad, because the movie is not perfect! Just go to the theater and watch it !!! You will enjoy!
