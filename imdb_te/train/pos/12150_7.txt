The film is one of the most "Kung Fu" action films made in Asia in the late 1970s and early 80s, and has done cheap sound effects, the dialogue and the lightning fast martial arts act. But unlike many movies of this genre, this is a good comedy and a great joke. When the ice cream factory workers are to be abused by their jobs, they can assign con artist (Gordon Liu) to frighten them. When his endeavor fails, he goes into the Shaolin Temple to learn to fight for the truth. But instead of making him a Kung Fu Fu student, the master ordered 36 rooms to be constructed for a scaffolding. Well, he is learning this skills as a kung fu expert and attends these yellow tasks (equipping stacking and bamboo polls)! While it is similar to carrot kid, Miyagi makes a karate of Daniel Karate by performing simple household tasks - "wax, wax" and cetera. From the beginning to the end of the great comedy, and Gordon Liu once again must take action when he faced his blizzards. "This time it's not just tricks - it's the real thing!" Liu is proud of her chest, declares. If you like classic kung fu pictures, you should not miss it!
