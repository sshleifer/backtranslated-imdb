I enjoyed watching this movie too. It's already in great direction for Beas Luna, born in Spain. <br /> <br /> Luna is more conscious in this sense. In Spain it is very accurate. <br /> <br /> Luna is a riot of a young boy for women in this case. There are some psychological concepts in this story, and the eldest son suffers from the birth of his brother. In the film this sees the unhappiness of this young man suddenly sees his mother go to a recently born son. So he tries to find a broom that he can eat. <br /> <br /> This film captures a few moments (unforgettable moments) of the espectator, and some signs (almost everything that happens because the film usually understands something deserves a thourough analysis ...). Nicola Piowani's excel world exports the world to another, not parallel to the world but from time to time it is worth it ... The image is worth watching in the world Worth the value, we are tired and eventually tired Even though the excessive absence, which probably crosses the limits, gets a bit sick ... <br /> <i also enjoyed the performance of the prophet ... 8/10
