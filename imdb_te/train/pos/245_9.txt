Orlando Bloom is the only reason I want to see. To put it easy, the picture is exceptionally average. It's not bad, but it's not very good. Editing is good; The picture looks good. Directing and promising direction. The story is plodding. The film is directed by Ledger, Bloom and generally great watts and rus. If you come from the US, the tones are impenetrable, so sit back and enjoy the scene (or I'd love to call Orlando Bloom). By the end of the film, I was not bored or moved. Some people asked what happened to Ned Kelly at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Of course, the only reason I can recommend is that Orlando Bloom has some kind of suggestions (although it is now - it is important to see "I'm pretty and confused"), so it can be found in the midday price of the finer. Besides, it did not see. It's not good enough or entertaining enough.
