And anyone who sees this movie will agree. <br /> <br /> The stories are directed, when the character is confident and the theme is very important. <br /> <br /> Jean Peters, Widmark, and Telma Ritter steal the spotlight. <br /> <br /> Riore is in the top of NY's boris section, playing the role of a stool pigeon for New York police. <br /> Another movie I saw Peters was "Niagara", and she certainly proves her acting ability, complete with Brooklyn's accent. The scholar is afraid of the opposite hero who needs to understand what is right, even if he needs it. <br /> <br /> The photography is great. Neon, the subway station (even though it is cleaner than the real thing!) Is a temporary shelter from the wadmark. The city's amazing use was designed with "Lightning Louie" in Chinatown; Many flavors and appetites of the city are addressed here; The political atmosphere of time is a haunting background. 10/10.
