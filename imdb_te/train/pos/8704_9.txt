<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Not to stop watching, it's a play, but with an odd twist. Imagine if Romeo had a super power in Shakespeare. It is sad and poetic at the same time. Hollywood must take a new Russian cinema notice, they are telling stories about big explosions and not about CGI. It takes a simple primary campus and tells the story, without a scene. It is like the Asian film with a dark Russian twist. It's not perfect, but nothing ever. You know what power is, but it does not explain, or fully realized. This is secondary to the story's emotions. I would like to see a remake, it's pretty cool, the Hollywood system is usually cumbersome. Acting is all around the line. There were too much rubbish out there and the camera was too out there to work out the work. All the kudos involved, and I will make a lot of people to this independent epic. A +++++ <br /> If you find me, see it.
