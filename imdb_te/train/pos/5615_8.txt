Caffcasque thriller of alienation and mental illness. He did very well and made his effort to work with his Dingie Paris Lodgings and his fellow Lads. Being initially terrifying due to long-time and self-interested fellow tenants, he is terrified when developing his defense, and eventually he misses. Personally I've done it without the cross dressing element but I have a story in mind, the fact that I have to accept the psycho acceptance and have some logic on it. Although it could work without it and had to remove a little theater element, but it probably meant that the campus would definitely take the form of the theater at the end. I think the directors' own feelings are little more than 'real' French and Jewish. Still, there's plenty of fun to enjoy here including a beautiful looking Isabelle Adjani and a fine show from the good old Shelley Winters.
