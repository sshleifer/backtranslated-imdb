I walked into the local video store during their three years of marketing. When thousands of videos were scanned, I wanted to sell some cartoon films, the film came across. I have read this movie back and I know that it is God's hand in the work to buy this movie. You see, I have children with my family and I have three elderly (and should be adopted) children. Soon my pets have been linked with the three children who played the film. The film has helped to better understand their own conditions. For the first time, too, the oldest (7 year old / her) group of siblings decided to open me about her past and the injury she suffered. She is faced with the whole trust issue. It was the first time I saw her face. After watching the film, I asked her to intend to adopt a child. She replied, "It should be happy." It is necessary to take into account the adoption of families and adoption of children. It definitely opened the communication lines for us.
