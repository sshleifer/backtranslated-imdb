This is one of the best Indian films I have seen lately, instead of the worst song and dancing or dirty dog ​​films. All actors have shown the right emotions right at the right time. This is a hallmark of a good movie, which will go back to the viewer and research on the subject, which is exactly what I checked in Harris. I have always enjoyed the sensitive style of acting Akshay Khanna and has a very complicated relationship with his own father Vinod Khanna, but surprised by Gandhi not how dramatically he can help explain the character. Directed by Anil Kapoor to build such a carriage and 2 thumbs impressed me.
