This may be the Tale remake of the 1987 Autumn Elegance, as director Mabel Cheung says. The film uses the rock music as a medium to express his personal attitude in the life of Mabel, where love, desire, and consequent disappointments play crucial roles. Rock music may not be the best vehicle to express deep feelings, and it is not uncommon to use it as the underground rock musicians are more intensively aggressive than normal. The director only focuses on the depiction of subtle romance and ultimate vanity rather than rock music. The love between father and son, lovers, and friends is delicate and consciously delivered through the best performance. Mabel did not try to make rock artists beautiful for all artists, instead she attempts to reproduce a real life on the screen, collecting information on Beijing underground pubs, making huge efforts in the years that work on this project. <Br> All movies that Daniel has done so far have probably given the best performance. His underwhelming imbalance and enthusiasm perfectly fit the blue dumbs in the film.
