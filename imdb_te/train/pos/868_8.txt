It's time for the French to establish two prominent characters. This may be a little bit of patience, especially "not attractive" in the particular Hollywood definition. However, the "Hist" kicks and the film is going to be very fast, perhaps very quickly. But it is a real roller coaster ride and it is very believable if you do not look too close. Hollywood is the kind of cinema you know.
