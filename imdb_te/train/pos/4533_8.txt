It was the first time Buster had seen Keaton's first film and I admit I liked it a lot, and I've been misguided across a few years ago. Initially, Rohr's book revised the three-century single nitrate print and warned that it was preserved for a short time before the combustion in 1954, and many frames were mixed together. <br /> <br /> It was okay for 3 small films, but it was inventive and funny from the beginning to take the interlarons. Conclusion: riding a pet brontosaurus in a Stone Age with stone beery riding an elephant and goodie buster; Riding the chariot with the Right Locks in the Roman Ages Buster and the parking lot codes in Latin, in accordance with the Sledgeag; In this technological age of Speed ​​Neat and Greed, his car comes in bits in pretty early part. He and the bakery are both aged, then the girl who is aged forever. Favorite Bit: Caveman hits back on the edge of the cliff but kissing the camera - amazing second or two! <br /> <br /> It is a great thing to reiterate my love for quiet silent comedy.
