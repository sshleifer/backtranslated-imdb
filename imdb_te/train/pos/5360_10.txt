One of the standardized liner type action films that are checked at the acting and logical door, this movie is on top of the class. "Good" actors in this film have been asked to act. You can ask yourself "acting" except Richard Dawson, except Richard Dawson. I love this movie! Running man is the gift of God (best for man). I'll be part of you with my favorite line: "It's part of life's great model Brenda, and you're good to use it as f ***** g." Ah, most people call this film "Brenda than I can imagine."
