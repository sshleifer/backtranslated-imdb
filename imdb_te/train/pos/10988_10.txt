Do not read anything about this movie (especially if there is no spoiler). See this amazing movie without knowing anything about it - and you really have a great feel. If you want to see the clever, twisted story, go to the DVD, and you will not really be disappointed. "Cypher" is not really a science fiction film, but a more mental thriller that settles in a global business environment. It's about corporate secrets, how big companies spy on each other's research disciplines and methods that use them. The actors perform great performance and provide the coolest mode of coolness in the overall visual style of the film. Cipher is a very deep, more complicated, and - for the story and the end - other movies of Vincenzo Natali are more satisfying than "Cube" and "Nothing". Actually it was one of the best movies I've ever seen (and it's not really about a fifth well-built movie). Sorry, I can not tell you more about this film without hurting your feelings. Give it a chance. ;-)
