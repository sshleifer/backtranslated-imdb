I am a big fan of cinematic variety and I have seen this movie because I heard how interesting it is. To be honest, it's very interesting. The two main actors are awesome, the film is not always boring, the idea behind it (although inspired by the home films of Columbine murders and killers) is really interesting. Eventually there are some weaknesses like 20 minutes, which really emerges from reality that appears in the first hour and the conclusion does not really make any sense. The moving camera is sometimes a distraction, but the film is given in Variety. But I still did the movie well and director Ben Cocoo deserves some credit.
