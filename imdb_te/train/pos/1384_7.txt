The film, also known as "Water Lilies", tells the story of two girls because they struggle hard in the love and sex world. This story is said to be slow and it works well. <br /> <br /> It gives you time and space to find different characters and grow up with them. <br /> <br /> Using a mini cast star, people performing better than usual but perform well in this movie. Everyone is completely reliable. <br /> <br /> Many movies have been made in the same case, but none of them really stand out. This pulls some "standard" pressure methods from the high cap and works on them. It's not bad, but it's not necessarily great, and I think it's better if it takes less and lesser looking dimensions. <br /> <br /> 7 swimmers in 10 sync
