I feel that many people have posted comments on this film and can not understand how low a picture and / or a lesser sense of elegance. First of all, you need to understand everything in the picture to evaluate a movie. Modern responses demand great play. No, I'm not a great set of characters and plots, but they seem to be demanding emotional trajectories that are too tragic or too funny. This is a thumbnail. Its beauty is its delicate (is not confused with simplicity). There is no story or character in this movie. It is the most influential film of a combination of sensitive, politics, human weakness, prostitutes ... you have been named. It's a world alien that is set up and today does not mean ... if you have it, you have to have it now and you think you only have it. <br /> <br /> Many people today do not understand that Victorian society is not really Victorian because people understand this term.
