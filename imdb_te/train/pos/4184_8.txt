Some of the war films that have not been won are successful and are judged from different angles. Mankind's perspective, where you can experience the raw emotions (Coming between an uprising, comrades, rigorous trials people in a raid, confront them when people struggle.) Always find movies I'm compelling. <br /> <br /> Das Boot and A Midnight Clear are two examples of films that do not mean connection to the characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> This film will succeed at that level. It's about "high esteem" and respect is doing the right thing. These 23 soldiers have done the right thing, they are respected and found to be completely contrary to Western thought, but it is ultimately the true respectable story. Unforgettable image. Based on the true story.
