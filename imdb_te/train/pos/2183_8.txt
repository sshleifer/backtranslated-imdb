Billy Wilder is co-credited with the story, and his most notable story of Ghost Writing songwriters working for Oliver Kurtney from his rational touch ghost-free music. His most beautiful, Broadway Legend Mary Martin is a witty and strong concoction and Basil Rothbone and Oscar Levant at a great turn for the rest of the obvious misunderstood, thanks to heaven, and some remaining fine songs (and forget some of them) (Levant is in rare form and his criticisms Nnintini omitted) provided. A delightful surprise, and recommended for all fans of the genre.
