I read holes in the 5th grade so I'm ecstatic when I hear that I'm making a movie! However, since I was busy, I had no opportunity to watch the movie in theaters. The holes are out of town but, alas, we are very busy. I was surprised to see that all my friends saw me and that one of them did not invite me! <br /> <br /> I told them they were all good but I read the great books I made with the worst films because I felt very stupid. <br /> Suddenly it got the right opportunity to see it. It was that week and my parents were going to cruise, and I went to bass. My sister, who is 9, and I've seen and completely loved it! I was at home and in their home and their kids, 9 and 4, it liked the most. Even my parents loved it and they were deffinately cinematic critics. Overall, I recommend this movie is for someone who understands family bravery and loves a hilarious cast! This image should be on the "View" list in your first 5 !!!!
