I got this film recommended by Matt Groening. Well I actually saw both The Simpsons and Futurumma and I found "What the Heck" because it had a mention in both. We take home some of "what's going on at home" to find out how lucky it is today in this age and age, where we have granted simple things like soap and water. In 2022 men are still shaving with a single blade safety razor. Nice is good that the film is not responsible for unnecessary exclusive effects, ray guns etc. Remember, "Tuesday's Soyent Green Day"
