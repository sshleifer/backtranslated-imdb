One of the better Kung Fu movies, but I hoped to have durable reviews. The film is good because they are language barrier (rare than you think in this era) and non-fight dialogue sequences passage (great keen for a kung fu movie). Unlike other movie movies, the Pittblock Driver will appear in contemporary rural China, rather than copies of the periods, or the cop drama (in the background of Jackie Chan's Police Story I). Unfortunately, the dark drama that is considered unnecessary in the third 1/3 film takes a cartilage into the tragedy. <br /> <br /> Reaction Sammo and 1/2 Debt Brokers 'Shr Brothers' only 2 stars, Kar-Tuang Lau and finally Jett's bad guy always ends with that long man. There are only 20 minutes of fighting, it's authentic, but the camera frames are clearly speeding me to be angry. They have to shoot a half-speed to avoid hurting them, but there are soft edits, and it's there. <br /> If you want Kung Fu movies, you do not deny my opinion here, and if you do not, you are reading this for 2 minutes of your life.
