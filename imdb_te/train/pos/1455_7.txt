Mardi Gras: Made in China The two cultures are simple, but not every community has an impact on one another. David Redmond will open your eyes and allow you to see how workers in China can spend and how to make up for US dolls sold in the US for 20 dollars. There is no evidence for Americans Redmond questions about where and when the beads have come from. When Americans told them that he had done in China for less then nothing with terrible payment and acceptable working conditions, Americans looked sad, hurt, and slightly remorseful but did not seem to really mean they could stop buying beads after finding the truth. When Redman questioned workers in China, they did not know that Americans wore their necks and paid a lot for these beads. The workers had the advantage that the beads did not laugh at anywhere. <br /> <br /> This film is a great movie we can think of in other countries than our own. Pitts
