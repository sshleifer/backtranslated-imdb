<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br <br /> "Innocent proven guilty" civil society; But Fred Schatzz's bias, but the story of the Western Australian murder investigation, was not given to Lindy Chamberlain, who allegedly killed his child. The implication of her innocence (a dingo is alleged to have taken it), but she understands guilt, and has no evidence against her. But the Australian referendum was canceled by her guilty, and deeply religious chambers seemed creepy (and the media themselves, however, in this process is innocent) when appearing in the media. Despite being removed by the primary jurisdiction, they were later prosecuted and found guilty. Although Chamberlain was finally released, it would not have been necessary to produce any new evidence after the "proof" of their innocence in the insulting new evidence. <br /> <br /> 'Dorre in a Dark' Merrill Streep puts a trustworthy Australian voice (at least this poker ear) and Lindy keeps sympathizers (still), but still she becomes a national hated person. The scenes we're really imprisoned are simple but moving the heart. <br /> <br /> Without the accuracy of this story (which I can not comment on), the film's extensive theme is the brilliant theme of the British public, and the least charismatic instincts of their readership are directly impressive. No legal system is accurate; But in the contemporary British newspapers, the same crime against the refugees comes from exactly the same pit as the voices that distance the Lindy Chamberlain. I'm not a religious person, but the Bible still has some killer lines (if you ignore the pun). "Do not judge that you will not be judged."
