For the first time, director (Bromell) assembled a younger, stronger actor to see the world of war with a middle-aged, middle class, depressed hitman and his father. The film, at the age of 90 minutes, is a very interesting contrast to human nature. David Darfman William H. I saw briefly as Masi's six-year-old son. Mace is almost a part of what he wrote as a self-tortured man struggling to break his reins of his father and his business. It's always nice to see Donald Sutherland, and here he is Mackey's innocent father. The alternate audio track of these films is very valuable to hear the director, explaining how he cast, cast, and film. Basic Dolby 2 Channel Sound fits and records for this film. Cinematography creates mental status with a very small musical theme. He is specially enjoyed by any film buff, or observer, especially if it is a conflicting fan.
