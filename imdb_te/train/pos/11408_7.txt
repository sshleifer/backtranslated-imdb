Etienne Girardot is just a character actor - the sort of person knows by name almost. Nevertheless, he once again plays the role of Caroner - one of the only actors in the Philo Vance films has played more than one role. I have seen two more times before and because he loves him every time because he is very funny and fresh breath of breath. Grand Mitchell, Jean Lockhart, Henry Valthal, Kent Smith, HB, along with Giraud and many other amazing characters. Warner and Knott Pendleton. This is a very impressive cast, and they certainly made the man and woman the famous job of Edmund Lowe and Virginia Bruce. <br /> <br /> These great character actors are one of the biggest reasons I love these old B-movies. Mystery is rarely so awesome because movies are really satisfied by writing and playing with winds. For this film, Vance is magically adapted by Lowe, but, as I have mentioned, mystery is also a thoughtful - crazy plot with hypnosis and suicide. Unfortunately, you can not be hypnotized to anyone - I trained in clinical hypnosis and if I was able to do this film as bad man, I could do it! Some used car salesmen and some of my older leaders had obvious goals! <br /> <br /> Overall, not the best Philo Vance film, it's great and Lavelle only played this role. In fact, apart from William Powell (Vance five times), the series has long been actors Basil Rathbone, Wilfred Hyde-White and Warren William (and many others) as Vance. <br /> <br /> Many different actors play a prominent figure - the same problem that the Bulldog drummond series is troubling.
