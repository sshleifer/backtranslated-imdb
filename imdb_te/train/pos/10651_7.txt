Some movies should not be merely remade. This is one of them. And it's not a bad image. But the 1963 film of the same name failed to capture the tastes and terror. Liam Neeson was good, except for Owen Wilson, for most of the cast, did not bring proper feel to Luca's character. But the main mistake with this version is that it's too far away from the story of Shirley Jackson, which has lost some of the previous film's thrill of trade for the heavy and snazzier special effects. Again I'm not a bad movie and I'll tell you about it. But you get panic in the old version.
