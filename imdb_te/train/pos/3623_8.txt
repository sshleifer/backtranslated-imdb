Disney just has something here. First, they "remember the Titans" with Denzel, which is based on the truth of a small town in sports and in Central America. Now, Quaid and The Rookie ... another sports story based on truth. <br /> <br /> The two films move with tears. My wife and I did the rookie and it was a great feeling to be a good movie. When it comes out asking if we buy it on the DVD, it's not a no brainer. Very sure.
