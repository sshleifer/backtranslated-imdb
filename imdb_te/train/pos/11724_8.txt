Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is a host of cheap horror show. After discovering that her dead aunt left her a few things, LVRRA goes to England, hoping it will be with some money. But for her horror, Elvira left her aunt's house, her dog and cook book. Elvira decides to settle in the house anyway, but she looks fantastic dark and with her amazing qualities, she will not be able to live in peace. Now all neighbors are moving around the city against her, and Elvara's appalling attitude and looks, looking better for everyone because Elvira is in the fire! I really enjoyed this movie, it's really fun to see Elvira get into these adventures, she's just great. The whole image keeps you into a Halloween mood, obviously, it's crazy and jokes are cheap but it is a pleasure to watch. I'll give Elvis, Mistress of the Dark 8/10
