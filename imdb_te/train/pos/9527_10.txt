It's the best mob ever made. It is more deserving of what's got in the Oscars. The director, director (mendis), actor (hanks), assistant actor (Newman and La) and win the film has been nominated for easy scoring, art direction, and supporting role (Newman). Hanks gives one of his best performances, and the kid who plays Michael Jr. is very good I'm surprised not to see him in the movies today. Critics have not given enough credit to this film. But in addition to the amazing performances, another true star of this film is incredible music. This is the best score of the year. It was nominated but did not win. This is a great movie to be seen by everyone. My grade A +
