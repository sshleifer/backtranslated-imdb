When I came in the 80s, I liked this movie and will still do it! I still quote the classic lines like "say it again" and "you'd rip my balls off the sur". Ron Leibman is hot and very funny! Even though it is less and rejected because MAD, I have to say this little gem is always a portrait of mine and a deserted island and I will have a picture that will take with me! Because I wear my VHS tape because I will release a DVD! If you want to cheer up comedy, it's perfect for you and should be considered a cult classic! It is the best and worse military humor! Rent it if you do not own it!
