<br /> <br /> What is the future for the future of "Germany"? <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br The ludicrous situation is well connected. I feel that a game (female and a soccer fan) can be deeply disappointing that I was disappointed and I can not think of how to do it accordingly. <br /> <br /> I am surprised to wonder why the women section of dirty language and bad behavior can be defeated by defeating the wrong reasons for refusing. <br /> <br /> The film is made quite intelligently - during the fantastic title realistic game, different techniques for audiences to the audience of shoes and characters - the most important but impossible (not shown), the sensation from the rare light and the cheerful sound stadium, and Its frustration is celebrated outside of those celebrations. Radio, drinks and food, and of course, I can understand the comfort from compassion and observation to each other from each character. At the end credits, I am very excited to have a name for any character - he is just any "soldier" and she is just "girl" or "sister".
