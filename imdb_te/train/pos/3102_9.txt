I saw last friend The Bourne Ultimatum last summer and Wow! <br /> <br /> Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, who suffers from a running CIA agent trying to find out who he is. I already said that I wanted to finish this film from scratch, any plot holes, slow scenes, everything is fine, nicely suited to other movies, but in all sorts <br /> Spiderman 3, Pirates, etc. I'm surprised All Action Action Cinemas, All Action Stars, Best Stunts, Car Chases, Actors and Prabhas Leaning. Just in action in this movie, Jason just does not kill and run. He had a soul and the audience feels for him, so drama was added. <br /> <br /> "Last three summers" "Three Clubs" is the best one.
