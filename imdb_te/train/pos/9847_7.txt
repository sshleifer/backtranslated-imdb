I have seen this movie a lot of the time. The film has got a lot of time. Looks like copying. Many things between the two, an animal / monster and a small child, other animals trying to break that relationship, etc. It's all pretty good for the movie. <br /> <br /> One of the zealous features, Scotte :) Very funny character, even if he does not have any purpose :)
