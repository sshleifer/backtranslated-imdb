I have seen this movie for a long time in the film. However, I can not say whether this is a good or bad image, because such general qualifications are not just applied. There is no film in this movie. It features a romantic comedy, a political commentary, a thriller, a drama, an action movie, a musical and a lack of self-motion picture art. <br /> <br /> Nandini (Karisma Kapoor) and Shekhar (Sanjay Kapoor) are living in Canada in the basic premise about the Indian couple, suddenly visit the husband's parents after a news report. The rest of the story takes place in India, where they find themselves in one of the twin fraternised torture. At one time, the story comes from "Not Without My Baby", but the power is called a remake unfair. <br /> <br /> In the dreams of Shahrukh Khan of Aishwarya Rai, it comes from another movie with the most unpredictable disruption to the hero. In fact, the two stars are in all posters, but they are very late in the film, and Shahrukh only ends in the real role. He also has an enthusiastic and really unexpected performance. <br /> <br /> Karisma Kapoor is one of the things to do in the film, and she does a fantastic job, changing the cinematic turns of the film and reliable emotion. Another important presence is Nana Patekar, who plays the role of husband Sekhar's totalitarian father Narasimha. <br /> <br /> Nana Patekar dominated every scene with a scary but active character. <br /> <br /> This film is not without realism. Violence is predominant, but Karisma has been angered on many occasions, as women's roles have really disturbed the misuse of abuse. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, this violence is clearly disturbing, but ultimately it becomes dramatic, so each dramatic order usually follows comic and striking turns, the overall effect is not emotional. <br /> <br /> I am a bunch of releases in Bollywood, and the combination of genres and incredible plot reservations are definitely their standard. But the "energy" will increase the bar by absorbing large amounts of alcohol. It is a movie that achieves the greatness of Shakespeare's tragedy, in which spectators and royalties are equally entertained. It is a pure, grateful film, and the director wants to have a good time to throw everything in the trilogy of Krishna Vamsi's book. Perhaps, it is not the thoughts of my mind that the violence that violates violence and the love of matriarchal love, but I see the "power" Doing movies is the most entertaining in the world!
