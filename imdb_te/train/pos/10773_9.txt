I will recompense this film for everyone. Rocker Luciano is not only for the Ligabue fans, but to all the film buffs. Because it's honest, moving, funny and true. Ligabu is a birthday storyteller and film lover and every frame of his film is made with love and care. Because his characters are loved and loved. The majority of Italian films were made by lousy and outsiders, a real pleasure to see and hear. Remembers me, because Stefano Accorsi looks gorgeous and Andrei Pazienza, who, like the beautiful, good and talented and good, and Leoube, shows that it is as drowning in unoralized and ugly, easy moral fashion. It is our heart, our ears, because our souls speak the image. And that's exactly because I lived with the experience of FM radios. Thank you, Luciano!
