First of all, one explanation: Not one of the best films made in the whole, because I gave the film only 8 stars. Registrated criticisms have valid points. Also, be warned to enjoy the script you really need to appreciate Neil Simon's brilliance in finding wit inside the real human banter. <br /> <br /> If you have a New York ear specifically for dialogue and you accept the expression of love expression, then you may be bothering to accept the optimism at the heart of this film - especially dry, Jewish, love-satisfying sarcasm - <br /> <br /> Many of the alerts. Here's my main thing: Walter Mattau in this film is also perfect on the exact same. I never saw him, or even touched for the subject - at the same time he shows the parody of this character, he refuses his big star self-image or disagreeable attitude, even though his relationship is diminished, he shows us more harm, perhaps even heartbreakingly scared . And if you happen to live with your own father or husband's mental decline now (I mentioned this as a warning) it's just enough to get you really, but artfully, it's just enough this role I can see in any movie show - and he only shows only that sad part I am very sorry to give you the most legitimate sources. This is beyond the method of performance - the functioning role of Matthew and the delicate delicacy as a delicate delivery. <br /> <br /> About Richard Benjamin: I personally treat his acting personally, his work is not exempt - he has some good moments here. ("Chicken chicken funny ....") If you like him, you should like him here and you will not change your mind if you do not. <br /> <br /> About 1976 Oscars ... I confess that Matthew was unfortunate against Nicholson in "Cook's Nest" in that year. This is a killer year for a leading actress contest; If there were only special Oscars for comedy and drama, then I would have thought I would have gone to Al Pacino for Walter Mattu for Best Actor Oscar "The Dog Day Afternoon" and "The Sunshine Boys" - Jack's fine work as McMurphy, but I Pacino and Matthew each show is more awesome and epic I thought it was an effective and clear myth. Also, I believe Barnes got more supporting actor Oscar for sentimental reasons than his performance quality - that is, he's good in this movie, but not good. (Burns's fine as ever but unexceptional-in-itself I think it's proof of my theory - is not about Chris Sarandon's stunning debut in "Dog Day Afternoon", again to show Biz Beat Brad Dourif's really brilliant debut in "Cuckoo's Nest" <br /> <br /> Beside Oscar theories, here is my bottom line review: If you like Matho's comic performance, watch this movie and His Powerhouse Trides and Excellent Grandmother inspired expressions, laughing facial expressions (but now if you're dealing with an old man losing his grip, be sure that the film might be comic relief or may be a very painful reality dose to see now.)
