Looking at this I laughed too much. It's very fun with a pleasant musical act and simplicity. The letters are simple, but their simplicity increases the style of comedy. The dialogue is funny and often unexpected, and from the first line to the last everything looks awesome flow. Max is there, who clearly led a terrible life. And Edward, who is not sure what life he wants to lead. My favorite character is Tom and Edward's mad boss. Tom is a minor character but a memorable one. Highly recommended for anyone who likes crazy humor. And you can get it online, this is a bonus! I'm a fan of Jason's cartoons and can not wait to see what's coming later.
