Contrary to some people's compilations, women who portrayed in the film are not Geisha. Oron (prostitutes) who live outside the most famous pleasure districts, and their lives and experiences represent the lives of women from the Tokugawa age. I can not tell you that the stories are not particularly bright, but their charms are typical. <br /> <br /> Love, friendship, and sacrifice: There are themes and everyday. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed art direction and performance. I felt like I was getting a glimpse of a time and place I would never have glimpse otherwise. There are 4 women who have played the role of actors, especially the main Oran, a thrill to watch. I would recommend this to those who want to taste the Japanese culture, or those who enjoy quiet and emotional stories. This is a great example.
