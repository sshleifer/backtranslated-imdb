Although Kurt Russell and the closest person to be seen as Elvis in the show business, there are many things wrong with the film. For the first time, Elvis opened his famous live shows after 9 years of Chanel for his films by wearing a white jump-suit in 1972. In 1972 he sang 'Burning Love' for his first and 'You Wonder of You' recorded in 1970. They also say that he had received his first guitar for Christmas, as they brought Elvis fans to his birthday. I know that all previous movies have something wrong but the people who like Elvis and these things are very clear.
