... I loved it. For a film that does not have a lot of special effects and mega budget, this film is really a great way of creating a fantasy masterpiece. I'm one of the guys who do not understand all the stories, but this is still a great movie to watch. It is perfectly equivalent to the crashing out of the rings' boredom and the likes of Harry Potter. In part of this international hits' budget, it says again for a movie. <br /> <br /> One thing I really love about this film is that of a daring film from Hong Kong. The subject is exotic and original. Outside of HK for the Fantasy Action film is unproductive, and acting is great. <br /> <br /> The best films from Hong Kong are the Infernal affairs of Hong Kong Fantasy film, and I hope they will work in this area until they exceed Hollywood adventure films. <br /> Just amazing.
