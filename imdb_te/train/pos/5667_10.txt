Definitely the spoilers in this review! I adore ** American Gothic and I have seen since the first night I first broadcast the Ch4 in the UK. Comparisons I made by Stephen King are just right. It's small town superhuman eeriness but with amazing layered characters. Best of all, I have loved so much, black and white is never too tight! While Lukas Buck is without conscience, as he says, people give enough cord to kill themselves. His manipulation works only for the weak moral reasons of others. Caleb is generally a brilliant, kind, intelligent man but shows the dark side that inherited from his father. None of the characters are completely or better with the angelic Merleine, which shows the brutal side by reckless vengeance in the Plague Sower. Only Gail has a close relationship with a mother for Caleb, not only to fall in love with Lucas, but she knows that this show may just go there and apologize. I'm a huge buffy fan, but when it was really trying to go back to the season, it was badly failed because it lost to humor and did not guarantee its ideas. <br /> <br /> In the show, you show a morally bankrupt role in the heart, and hell to laugh. <br /> <br /> "It's all about the ridiculousness of the movie, and it's very bad to say about TV and good, genuine programs, thanks to the light of the DVD thanks to at least I can see the show! Yes, some of the visuals dated now, but the creepy strange atmosphere The story is well received by the story and the actors also give such perfect performances, some bay Fitting for camera work <br /> <br /> The reason I suspect this presentation is that I do not like the X-heavy files that contain unscrupulous questions about files that have 'fix' or lost Lucas Buck has some kind of nasty powers, It's pretty obvious from which to get all about fighting for the soul   జనం లేదా తెలియని 'నిజం' కోసం చూస్తున్న ప్రజలు నిరాశ ఉండవచ్చు. అవును కొన్ని గోప్యమైన సమాధానం లేని అంశాలు ఉన్నాయి, గైల్స్ తల్లిదండ్రుల గురించి నిజం వంటి కొన్ని పరిష్కారాలు, కానీ లాస్ట్ మరియు X- ఫైల్స్ వలె కాకుండా ఈ కార్యక్రమం IMO జరగబోతోంది గురించి మరింత 'వాస్తవాలు' కనుగొనడానికి ప్రయత్నిస్తున్న గురించి కాదు. It is about the characters and the way to face moral alternatives in the twisted world of the Trinity. Personally, I will make such a kick out that Lucas reflects his situation for every purpose. <br /> <br /> What is the most important thing I have to say more than anything? I'm pretty sure I love the most fantasy / horror fans. Even though it may have been canceled, it would be enough to end up giving all the stories a slight idea of ​​the arc and closure. The only hanging thread I thought was Dr. Matt. It is strange that he is not in the final episodes. <br /> <br /> I have been able to do anything in the second season, but at least 22 episodes have been offered and I have been happy with some amazing TV shows. !
