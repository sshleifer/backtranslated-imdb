Roman Polanski makes this distinction clear, where he has his own devotion. Polans himself plays a weak guy who has rented a Parisian apartment, where the previous tenant committed suicide. He was engaged to discover things that led to him, as he was dragging into the drag and running events as they went out. The film is losing ground, and it has the creeping horror atmosphere at Polanski, but it comes in the pictures of two amazing Polans, such as "Rosemary's Baby" and "Rehash of Revolution". <br /> <br /> But I believe that I am reading a lot in this film, and I believe that this is a reaction to the feelings of violence that I feel in this case is sexually abusive label and was expelled from the United States. He is not judging about a verdict or another about him, but it is hard to deny the evidence of the film. <br /> Grade: B +
