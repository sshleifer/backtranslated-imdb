One of the best documentaries released in recent years. <br /> <br /> Hugo Chavez was elected president in Venezuela in 1998, his support from the poorer areas of Venezuela is increasing. <br /> <br /> In 2002, a rebellion had eliminated Chavez briefly. At the time, Irish filmmakers Kim Bartley and Donacha O'Brien were in Caracas, shooting a documentary about Chavez for British television. <br /> <br /> Their image can eradicate the rebellion and its consequences, and records the history in and out of the presidential palace. <br /> <br /> Chavez aims to liberate Venezuela from free market policies imposed by the US. <br /> While Venezuela's oil is already under government, it has been implemented for private purpose by executives at Chavez's place. <br /> <br /> 4. Despite being the fourth largest oil supplier in the world, Venezuela is filled with poverty and its resources are literally absorbed by foreign multinational corporations. <br /> <br /> The documentary begins before Chavez's first years as president. In keeping with his popularity of the poor, his various policies, labor class natives (education schemes, oil revenue distribution, grass-roots democracy etc.) have been proven. <br /> <br /> The big proponent for Chavez's education has been published by thousands of copies of the Constitution of Venezuela, encouraging children and adults to encourage them to understand it. <br /> When Chavez came to power, he immediately vowed to redistribute oil benefits. <br /> <br /> It is the nervousness of oil companies. There was a media war. Six private TV stations are immediately opposed to state-run TV station. <br /> <br /> They questioned Chavez's intentions, integrity and sexual orientation. <br /> 9. Without media support, the rebellion was unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> These pages are based on the media for promoting communications and can easily make the news easier. In the guise of "rebuilding democracy," the opposition silenced state-run TV station, the National Electoral Board, the Supreme Court, the National Assembly dissolved and took up military control. <br /> <br /> The wealthy interests, backed by military superiority (supported by the US and CIA), have conducted a citizen in the presidential palace to influence the rebellion. <br /> <br /> Swaters were shot at Chavez supporters, but private media stations had modified the footage, so the return was aimed at the opposite direction, which was actually safely diverted. <br /> <br /> The police opened fire against Chavez supporters. Chavez was arrested and refused to resign. In fact, the media / government had already resigned, but Chavez's cabinet members informed the truth of the international community and eventually sent a message to Venezuela via cable TV. <br /> <br /> 8.9 / 10 - Less than an hour, this document is very small. However, it is an immersive part of journalism and deals with a form of "media war", rarely when it touches. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
