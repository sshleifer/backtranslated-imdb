Alain Rena√±as feature films are not really edited for continuity, but instead seems to be right on the right where a shot is edited. Love to Death is sometimes a quiet existential drama and a creative creative magical realistic picture, and either way treats a whole new aspect of the relationship with Eros / Thanatos ... or perhaps creates a new relationship, Agape / Thanatos <br /> <br / > The start is a bizarre surrealist horror movie. While a man is going to die on his bed a woman drives a house badly - whether she killed him or what happened? When a doctor arrives and announces that he is dead, the tension melts, but the new, stranger drama begins: the man is awake and after the killing of a woman and a man, it actually leads to very tragic consequences. Meanwhile, their friends, two priests, watch, submission and submission of their own debate to the nature of devotion. <br /> <br /> Renanas has always worked to work on these devices, and his images are so awesome that the devices always work. In this case, Renaissance moves with scenes that show snow shots, which drops to an exciting orchestral score, which drops into the next shots that continue the story. Trapped in this elegance from time to time, the film is much more surreal than the legend of this epic, and there is no direct reference in the film, from which Dante's divine comedy has strange glasses. Renaissy is known as the poetry filmmaker, but it has just expanded the syntompany of the past, which some of the audience support the audience, which is likely to surface some odd memories. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
