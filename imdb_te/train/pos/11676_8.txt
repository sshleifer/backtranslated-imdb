If you like the long way, you'll get the most out of it. It is education, funny, interesting and time. Charlie shares the screen with two curious colleagues, two exhausted mechanics, two amazing camera cameras and much more. Ivan performs some shows, but Charlie really plays alone. He was funny, obsessed and still in a ditch with stress and suspicion. <br /> <br /> The series ends in 7 episodes. Like LWR, preparation like race is very interesting. Although they cover ins and outs of the race, there may be more explanation about trucks and cars, which can be seen and rarely seen as racing. Although it is a motorcycle movie, anyone will love the two wheels. <br /> <br /> This range includes some of the amazing photography as well as some of the people's notes. Oh, no. Another very attractive theme song like LWR but this one is not as good as a stereophonic. <br /> If you live in America, Amazon is so God knows when it's released. See it on your computer as I did. Oh, and ready to buy another motorbike.
