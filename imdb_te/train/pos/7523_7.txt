The movie I saw at the 2006 Palm Springs International Film Festival and the film was not a movie and the film was filmed by HBO to be shown on their cable network anytime this year. The film is the foundation and discipline of the pinup and provides the B & D stand for the actress to be a true actress. The page is slightly more than that and she does not fit in the 50's Pinup Icon's career, even though she has touched on some of the other characters. The film is based on Richard Foster's book "The Real Beetie Page". It was filmed in black and white for the memories of the 1950s. I have a lot of great photos in Page Career history, including the "Batty Page The Poppy Legend Life", the film that was shot on the page as Gretchen Mole, that very famous photo. Mott Betty Page with Bettie Page Black Wig and Brown Contact Lenses. She does not have a Betty Page appearance but she has a laughing out of the camera and features the character of her personality. And her body is close to the reflection of the page as much as possible. Excellent casting. The story is narrower and tabloidic type and perfectly perfect. But this is a pretty good TV movie. I would rate the scale of 10 by 7.0 and recommend it to be viewed on TV when it comes on.
