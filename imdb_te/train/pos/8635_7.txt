A good Hollywood odyssey of "California" Suspense and Terror, which tells two couples who share gas price for California: a pair of losers (Louis & Pitt) and two backbeat artists, a photographer and author (Ducony & Forbes). Pit "nails" this role is somewhat hypothetical thriller. Good watch for them into the mental-killer flix.
