This timeless proverb resonates in this film and in my heart. I have been waiting for many years to see this eternal story! I'm not ready. My consciousness can not appreciate its power. <br /> <br /> I am happy with my soul thanks to it. <br /> <br /> My respect and praise for Paul Muir are long term. His now is a legendary luminescence. But now I finally find priceless gifts for LUISE RAINER's excellent talent. Oh, how many faces can she talk to? It may be nice to say that some have worked since quiet years, but her speech is eloquent when it's given a chance. <br /> <br /> The film is in one of the most traditional ratios in an epic. All parts are equally, necessary and accurate. <br /> If they want Noyes they can walk, but they repel the story of a lifetime. <br /> <br /> The good land improves one of the unexpected ways. But I did not come out of it all with the pleasure I made. <br /> <br /> I would only hope that the film will be remembered for many years. <br /> <br /> Do not encourage me with just the techniques about the race of major players. These modern times are predictions when we are fully engaged in perfection. <br /> <br /> If any modern artist dares to rebuild this painting, I will warn them. The perfume does not come close to the scent, which still comes from the mainstream. Time will not decrease this effort or improve its greatness.
