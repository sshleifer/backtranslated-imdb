Product Quality, Cast, Standard New England (Waterbury, CT?) Locale and Lush John Williams score must be the result of a 3-4 star collector's item. Unfortunately, we were all a good "2" star of the durable 2 star, which was more than likely to remember what to do ............................... .................................................. .................................................. ........................... Little town language and the story of ordinary people It is a genre, and if done well, most grownups will be satisfied. Jane Fonda did not hide her mind to make her character reliable. I wonder why she did not do post doctorate at Yale instead of working at a dead end factory in Waterbury. Robert DeNiro's role is just a bit too contrived. With a little help from Jane's character, Henry Ford or Thomas Edison's 1990 version is an illiterate and loser. <br /> <br /> This genre was not successfully performed "No one's fool" in the mid 90s and this year (2003) "about Shimid." <br /> The main Stoom Studios is trying to get more stuff into adolescence and that I would like to reserve some screens at multiple cinema complexes for trials. <br /> <br /> I will give "A" for the effort.
