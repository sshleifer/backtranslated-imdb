I want to comment on the April Love movie. This is my favorite time because my father, Nelson Malone, is playing horse training. When I came to Hollywood Lexington, I clearly remember, KY, when we were living at that time to make Love Love. My father is in many plays and talented. I try for one of the bit parts I've given, and he's home. How exciting it is! In addition, many colleagues are present in audience scenes - especially in the amusement park. Every time I'm out in April, and the song of the song "Love Love" is still on the radio by Pat Boon, which is very prestigious. Timeless and memorable when you watch movies on this day, sex, foul language and violence. It will refresh to see more images like April Love.
