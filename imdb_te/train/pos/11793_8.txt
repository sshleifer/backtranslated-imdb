I'm looking back to the series as fast as possible. I'm trying to see Star Trek all the things. This month 3 and I'm now in Season 3 of TNG and I have already gone thru DS9 thoroughly. <br /> <br /> "Gray Shades" is the first recap episode in the TNG series Star Trek. After watching the performances, these clips were fresh in my mind, but I saw how they both re-shot as the film looked good. Season 1 always seemed to me a real dark and lazy - and they saw the actors foolish to their own skins. <br /> <br /> This is just the happiest and biggest hit of the show, and during this time there are embarrassing moments in the entertainment of Ricker's life. The Holocaust data and the Ricker scene is the standard moment of new friendship. The 2nd officer in the Clinic ship challenges Ricker's authority as the first officer, and Ricker defeated the CRAP in that clinic. Admiral then kicks his $$ but good. This whole episode is a heck of a reminder that many crazy, great things happen in just 2 seasons and 5 movies and some movies! At this time in the series they really began to develop the emotions that Dean Troy is considered to be a stereotype. Until this time they have been told the truth, but they still have to use it. ST Wiki - Memory Alpha indicates that the imaji is "first" and "close" with "ricker" and a serious emotional issue. This episode shows the romantic interest of each other for a long time to come. <br /> <br /> This article in the series by http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Imzadi, the product value is accelerated and Star Trek TNG settles into a destiny science fiction monster. Star Trek Universe offers great actors now looking back as an adult that I see. They really need to make a new ST performance set after all current shows. A DS9 image is very good.
