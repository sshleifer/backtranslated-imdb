A classy film pulled in 2 directions. Wes Craven directed it for its purpose. The TV movie budget on the bottom shows what would have been much higher with a big budget. It moves when Susan Lucy tries to convince Robert Uriffffy to come into his care and convince him of his health club's secret. His new invention, an aerospace engine that analyzes people or objects, is unexpected in its new surroundings. Anyone who has seen this should pay attention to Susan Lucy. She appeared and had a few years of unexpected rewards for the show. Actor, scientist and evolutionist Stephen Armorte is a fan of the film and reviewed the film. Lucy became a figure, based on the so-called Katherine. In 'Black Sunday' portraits of Lucy and Barbara Steel were used as references for Catherine Portrait, which were quickly withdrawn by Armare. Perhaps due to the individual nature of the artist and Catherine. So by looking at the two movies we can get the look of an unknown woman who makes another story and an interesting film.
