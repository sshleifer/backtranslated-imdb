Stooges are fine in microphones. This concerto works in three recording studios. They ended up watching Alice van Dorren (Christine McNeill) singing the voice of spring. The voice is amazing. Curly Mrs. In Drugs Played by Bixby (Symona Boniface). Mo Curley calls senior Kukaracha. Three Stooges are going to the party where he is dressed in curly drugs. They play a record of spring voices and all are well up to Mori Curly to destroy the record on the head. Baritone recognizes them and ends up using Lucia Sexlett until they unplug it. Alice van Doran Boy laughs and hides behind the scenes to help them. How to play Alice on the back of the crane is how to sing without a phonograph in the bathroom is a miracle. Three Stooges were revealed as frauds but Alice's father discovers his daughter's talent and accepts her as a singer. Get out of the room. Excellent.
