<br /> <br /> When I first saw this film, I was 4 years old. I attracted the story of wizards in World War II. The most impressive scenario is the fight between Nazi soldiers and the medieval army. It is unusual to see the army without a body walk to fight the marvelous song with their march. The film was marvelous at Portobello Road (which became the most magnificent place in London) to go to Naboomboo. Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson are really a wonderful couple. She's always good, she's always a surprise face with her family and David's good mother-in-law is her great co-leader. We'll miss him a lot.
