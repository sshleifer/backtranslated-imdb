Every bit of classic swashbuckler "against all flags". It's all in the adventure fan can have hope for one and more for this, as a child in distress, well, really not in distress. Like Spitfire Stevens, Maureen Hara is good at her athletic, defying the social norms of the period running her enemies. Anthony Quinn rounds the three bills of the ruthless captain Roca Brasiliana, and proves that he is a wily and capable enemy for Brian Hawke (Flynn). For classic adventure fan, see "Against All Flags". Although it was not in the same league as Errol Flynn's previous work (Captain Blood and the Sea Hawk, for example), it is still quite fun.
