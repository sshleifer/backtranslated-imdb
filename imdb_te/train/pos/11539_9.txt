ODD COUPLE is one of Neil Simon's most famous drama, Fillis Unger, a TV newswriter, a classic film version, his divorced best friend, Oscar Madison, and his wife with a full slab, and Francis throws him off of his apartment. Already divorced, Oscar took his best friend, and from the moment he forgave it. Nail Simone's classic comedy was first featured on Broadway with Artney at Felix and Walter Mathau while playing an Oscar. Jack Lemmon took charge of Carne for Carne with a memorable performance as Ferris Unger. Lomon Felix is ​​not terribly funny in the role of Felix Unger, who is the tragic element of a pathetic figure. Matthau, fortunately, has been able to recreate his character's one-of-a-kind gem of a comedy show that offers a steady laugh throughout the Oscar. The Lummon and Matteo band turned out to be a comedy gold reenacting in nine other films. Both of these actors are not with us, the view of this classic is more impressive but less fun. Simon's play expanded well on the screen, making long-term changes to Felix's suicide attempt, a winner with a quiet prolog. Supporting actors include Oscar poker buddies such as Herb Edelman, John Feudor, Larry Hines, and David Sheiner and Moncia Evans and Piedgon Sisters, Carol and Shelley as Felix Blind Dates. In fact, it later became an exciting TV series with Tony Randall and Jack Glugman, but nothing real. Happiness from beginning to finish.
