This is another great Tom Berenger film .. But some people right like another SGT barns character but is still awsome .. Tom Berman has played a great sniper in the jungles of Panama! Billy Jen was the first private rian from Cpl Upham for the first time but he eventually got a little more excitement! Sniper surprise and action buffs should see it .. I remember you wouldnt have too much action like a reg action movie .. I got this one on DVD too and it is amazing!
