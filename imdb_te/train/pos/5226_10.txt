What's with all European (especially England) comments here? All I said was that when I saw this film the first time I was 13 I thought it was great. Of course it's stupid. That's something. To get the joke behind the film, you have to see Dr Strangelow and Men in the black movie, but what do you expect to see when it comes to people? I can think of a lot of worse movies than these films, with Hilville expensive with real actors. Whatever it is worth, there's a movie too stupid-funny mack for Men in White. And with all the stupid-funny stuff that England has made for the last half-century, I'm shocked at all negative comments. Stupid Americans like our stupid humor. P.S., see "Team America: World Police" for some real laughs that specialize in Europe.
