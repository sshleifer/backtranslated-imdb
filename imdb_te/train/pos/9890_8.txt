Unfortunately, the film never changed to DVD. It was when I first appeared in theaters in 1983, and again VHS was released in 1992. When I recently saw a VHS copy at a flea market I immediately bought it. I'm not disappointed. First, clearly: Claudia Ohana is beautiful and delightful to see. But that picture, you have to decide your values ​​and decide what's really important for you, here goes into an unreal world. The film is about a lot of things. The World Bank and the big corporations will exploit their bank capitalist projects in developing countries and arrest them at any time as non-refundable debt. It's about how our economy will exploit us for credit cards, mortgage and car payments as debt. It may be that we never really have and probably we are trying to save an innocence that is not really saved. It's about how good and bad it is sometimes to tell about one and the other one. It increases a lot of questions but does not give answers. Sometimes I think it's good. For this reason, this image is really worth saving and watching.
