Wow! The sort of image you see ten times and still is not its slightest pleasure. Absolutely Incredible! This is Visconti's first movie, but what's good for the film from the movie is that I thought what happened to him. Another single I've seen in Death at Venice (during his writing) - it's totally unbelievable: it looks amazing than Osissae. One of the most beautiful films I've seen, but its story is not like Oscice. If you click on "other" on the links of this page, there is still a movie from that website. Such a fantastic camera movements, such fantastic faces, such fairy tales, such fantastic stories, James M. Cain's "The Postman Always Rings" <br /> Eight years before the introduction of realistic performance to the world with the Brood Streetcard Named Desire (1951) I can not believe it was made in 43 years, and these actors did not use the method, Eight years ago, a new romance on the screen titled Desire brought a new romance, the Ossessione is the electromagnetic sensual! Since the beginning of the movie is very sensual <br /> <br /> Fascist e Lilo made, Mussolini banned the building of the United States. <br /> <br /> I can not say anything more about it - it's good, say, writing is one of the beautiful and exciting. I've seen the movies, and tell you to go out and see! As another reviewer, I'm going to buy it as soon as I can get it!
