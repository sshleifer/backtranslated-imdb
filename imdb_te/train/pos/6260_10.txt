It's spirit-inspiring! I live in an Iranian and 21st century, and I do not know that such big tribes live in such situations during my grandfather's time. <br /> <br /> You may have to serve for clean and demand for a woman or a baby on either side of the world or 1925 on one side of the world, but here 80 years ago, people ventured into their life to go somewhere with more grass. <br /> <br /> The people of this tribe are praising the Americans, who are strict as Bakhtari people. .
