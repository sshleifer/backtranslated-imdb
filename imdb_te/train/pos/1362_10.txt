Me and my groovadelic 20-something pals just can not get enough of this amazing Parker Posey CLASSIC! I tried to rent this on DVD, but it does not seem to find - very bad, I'm sure the features will be "extra special"! :) We all highly recommend Uber-cool comedy Flickerino for this date, or home for a cozy night alone! This will also be the kind of picture purr-factor to watch with your cat, or just like a one in the movie that goes to the just lovable, huggable, squeezable Parker Posey, just like a "Party Girl" party, throwing a party party. Oh, and be on the lookout for a gripping and sharp surprise ... Move aside, the sixth sense, you've crossed through a way Redder image! Sorry, what kind of offense calls it just like that! Take from an old film lover, comedy is not just better than "party girl" with Parker Pi! Do not feel! Yours, Ronald Mary McDougall (Aze Djie Cyber-Rap)
