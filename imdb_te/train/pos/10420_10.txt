The great karosio will show Mario Lanza's unique talent. He shows great performance and Leorex is in the top form of the singer, working with Dorothy Kirsten of Sorrono of the Metropolitan Opera. In fact, I'm glad he has performed some songs than Karusodo (from Rossini and A'Vuchella from La Donza). MGM art and music divisions also have a good job. The film is perfect, it's not the awkward existence of On Blight; We see her trying to be the best, wearing in style in the fifties in the front scenes of 1920 - unforgivable. Lanza deserves a good prominent woman, and Blyth should stick to low-demand productions. Kersen sang duets with opera Laurea, who gave false impression that San Francisco was a permanent celebrity.
