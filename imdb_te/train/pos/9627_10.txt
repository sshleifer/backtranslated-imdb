The two comic menus are the most ridiculous. From the time they walked, Hardy laughs at me from the roof until it laughs at me laughing. I suggest that every fan of Laurel and Hardy should look this short. I also recommend the Ghost Series. If you're looking to laugh, watch this movie and you'll be happy.
