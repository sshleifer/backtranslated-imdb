Not revolutionary here; <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Miners restraint, especially at the start, is a breathtaking and consequently-crucial inner mice-en-scene makes his sensitive management look attractive. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura is succeeding in legitimizing a role, on paper, clich√©: laconic, hard-nosed, world tireless homicide detective. Ventura has survived the role and is completely reliable, even though the script gave less access to its internal performance; <br /> <br /> Michael Serraert is a single-minded exchange between frequent-miscarriage and abortion that is not pregnant with the metamorphosis grounds. Serrault's character is tough and proud, and fraudulent, and pitiable turns; <br /> <br /> If a "message" of Garde Au is searching for a person, a continuity of police methodology and a police force that is under pressure, if necessary, are closely related to the cost of justice. Too long, the shocking drama of the movie motion picture economy shines more than just an example of how a powerful Sopsicic set-Lend scenario revolves around.
