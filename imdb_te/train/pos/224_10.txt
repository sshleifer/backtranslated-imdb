Sunshine Boys is one of my favorite movies to feel my favorite. When it comes to the first time as Christmas attraction at the Radio City Music Hall when it comes first and when it comes to love. I saw 6 times in theaters, and went to see it again while playing today. <br /> <br /> Now the reviews here show great performances. మత్తౌ అద్భుతమైనది, కానీ "జాక్ నికల్సన్ యొక్క ఆస్కార్ గెలవడంతో రాన్డాల్ పి మాక్ మర్ఫీ యొక్క నాటకాన్ని గెలుచుకున్న దురదృష్టం" కోకిల గూడు మీద వన్ ఫ్లూ ఓవర్, రిచర్డ్ బెంజిమన్ కనీసం నామినేట్ చేయటానికి అర్హమైనప్పటికీ బర్న్స్ విజయం సాధించింది. The characters played perfection as Fritz Feld audition for commercial potato chips. <br /> This brings me to my reason for reviewing the film, which is directed by Herbert Ross, a much lesser estimate. "The Owl and the Pussycat" and complete a picture of the screen, it plays back the invisible cestundiatanu drama opens with a photographic venue, he fled into the story and characters. <br /> <br /> Here we come to the film for 20 minutes, before opening the game, Ben Clark comes to see his uncle and tell about the Comedy Special. Play in the first twenty minutes, the order is completely new. A few years ago I looked awesome at the Broadway revival of the play with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall. But I think Ross and screenwriter and playwright Simon is better off. It's just amazing picture.
