Oh 35 years old, the grove tube today looks like a real TV! Dealers (Al Wades, and Chech & Chong Up in Smock in 1978), Weird Beer commercials (little less than Budge Beer, Bud Bowes), specialty niche networks (naked sports), and sterling drug dealers, The clown Coco (shades of Pee We Herman), Chevy Chase Slaptic Humor (a violent barber M), and for the first time in his Saturday Night Live in 1975. And thanks to the infamous initial series of grove tube early X-rated, I still can not hear Curtis Mayfield's "Move On Up" without hitchhiking hippies - namely for similar sketch style movies, see TunnelVision, Kennedy Fried Movie, Amazon Women on the Mood, Monty Python's Beyond the Fringe, Dynamite Chicken, and Everything of the Ferris Theater You Know An Rong Rong.
