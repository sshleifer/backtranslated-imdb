Throughout the film, you can just imagine this film just for the kids. Well, it's mainly pointed towards them, but it's also well rounded as the jokes are also advertised adults. At this time, the Muppet gang attempts to enter Broadway, causing them to be produced, which leads to break-up. But the Kermit will not stop, and his decision keeps moving together after getting the deal he is hit by a car and sent into the memory! <br /> <br /> It is a piece of music in the 40th century, with music in a punch (only Boomerang fish of Louisville; water-stunt display of Gonzalo, whisper campaign, among many others) Very hearty. Muppet writers are not shy of meetings, in contrast, they embrace the site where they are refreshed to see the story in a show, where thick letters and characters feel their dreams come true. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that Muppet is not originally original, it has some of the most impressive and memorable songs, amazing places on Manhattan and the inter-racial dating (and marriage) also have some complexities! Liza Minnelly ("a frog?"), Elliott Gould (police), Brooke Shields (nominated by Rat), Edward I. Koch, Gregory Hines and Jon Rivers. So be ready to sing, or there are a lot of big laughs and romantic (yes romantic) times in the best Muppet movies.
