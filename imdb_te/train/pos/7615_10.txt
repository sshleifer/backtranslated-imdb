The show is one of the greatest performances on television. Acting was very good, suspense, drama, comedy, everything, and with a simple story: An aircraft crashed into an island. The characters are great and the Evangeline Lily HOT !!!!!! Matthew Fox once again shows us what a great actor, Josh Holloway is great, George Garcia is ridiculous, I have gone. Also, the unexpected plot turns, the rear stories of the characters, the music at the end of each episode. JJ Abrams once again proves to be a wonderful writer and producer. I'm better than ALIAS, and I liked ALIAS. No one is watching this show, and definitely consider getting the DVD's and watching because they do not have something great. This program may be the best performance in television history!
