Despite the success of comedy or drama, Turkish directors have failed in the horror-thriller. <br /> If you see "Gen" you understand that it is a strike. <br /> <br /> "Okin-D @ bbe" is a good example of horror horror Turkish films. The atmosphere of the film is impressive and dark. Special features are not colorful and cheap. <br /> <br /> As a result, "Gen" does not add any distinction to horror movies, but it is not disappointing. Thriller fans. In this regard it is a win for Yesilcam and Turkey. (7/10)
