Returning to the 36th Chamber, Shaun is one of the classic Kung-fu movies produced in the 70s and 80s, whose style is equivalent to Western Western spaghetti spaghetti Westerns, and Gordon Liu, the main character of Western's Clint Eastwood. <br /> <br /> The digital remastering and new printing for the Firststast Film Fest is similar to Good Old Days "Shav Scope presented." <br /> <br /> The story of the martial arts films is more or less in practice. Small-scale diamond-mill workers are very unhappy with them and their wages will fall by 20 percent. They can not do much about their exploitation because none of them are skilled martial arts and their owner to take on gangsters. For the first time, Liuni was a little successful in acting as one of the most talented Shaolin monks (one of the best comedy scenes), but their vigilance was revealed when they acted in a number of times, bringing the limits of credibility. <br /> <The law shows the role of wanting to get back two mobs. However, without real martial arts, he walks on a journey to the Shaolin Temple, crushing it and intruding and learning in martial arts. After some slapstick movements, he finally admitted (he cheated him) but was tempted by teaching methods - karate kills Miami's style, but instead of painting, he gets to lay bandages around the temple. No one can keep a good person, he is unaware of the strength, patience and kung fu is the primary way. <br /> <br /> <br /> Act three starts with the fight fest. With the cheesy sound effects, each explicit connection is given to the maximum effectiveness of the film. But it does not have to look at the action scenes, but it also has a broader angle to explain the clarity and details between the sparring partners, and to use the slow movement to perform different stunts. Some quarrels can be seen with some breaks between the wars, but using Un-Voog Ping and Ad-Nosam in his style Hollywood films do not make combat scenes as they are used! The 36th room will receive recurring screening on Monday again, so if you're playing for a nostalgic trip down the memory lane, are you waiting for it?
