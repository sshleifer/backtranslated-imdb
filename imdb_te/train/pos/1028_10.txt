When I saw in the Stargate film, I first told you that it was not like a science fiction film, like most of the movie, such as Star Wars or other science fiction films like aliens, when it became a science fiction film, One is amazing, I'm not a hardcore sci-fi fan for some people I remember a line from those films, I'm not a big fan of Star Wars T shirts, and indeed I see you like the average person, where the slightest fall from point here, my point is unfortunately dropped in its quality as it came close to its end in 2006 This great series, ending in 10 exciting seasons, is a hard core sci-fi That does not have to be a fan of fiction. <br /> <br /> I do not like much film, let me tell you the first season and let me tell you the special effects, the uneven things about the series, chemistry between the characters just bite me away, so much science fiction shows Are better than running better than otherwise. If I'm not for Stirgate, and my dad comes to me in science fiction when I'm 6, and I'm glad I would never have gone into science fi if I'm other science, if a new science fiction series is not as good or as good as SG1, It's all in my mind now setting benchmark for almost all science fiction series and movies Seeing excellent performances like SG1. Basically this is the best science fiction show to date, and if you do not see this, then there is no idea what you do not have!
