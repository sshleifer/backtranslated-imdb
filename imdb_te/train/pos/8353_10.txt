I remembered that the film was in the age of 1977 or 1978. HBO has shown that they have been late for the night and have been the same film page channel. By then it was the only film featured on Invalid Television and was specifically refilled. I like to understand the adult theme now, and I'm more interested in understanding the adult theme. It's the closest thing I've seen pornography at age 7 or 8. On weekends I have stupid children and party-running parents. This movie is quite my own memory and these two guys are completely arbitrary sexual behavior. These guys are few when a stranger breeds homes to bathe underwear, to eat breastfeeding a stranger in a public bus and adultery in a vehicle in one of their male subjects. A very white image for the early 70s. Until I checked the IMDb, this film had a similar idea. Many people I never heard have heard it.
