The movie is a lot of people happy. First, most people saw me in the first place (I accidentally penetrated into it), and then judged by reviews and ratings, many did not enjoy it. <br /> Well, I did. I normally see him and can resist Gear for his charm, and although I do not regard him as a great actor, he knows pretty well (I liked him Mr. Jones). But this show is all different. He's not a pretty one, and he's not beautiful. His character is completely different from him ever since I saw him --- old, ugly, broken, determined. And Gear, I have ever been to his best performance ever, it pulls off pretty. I can not imagine anyone doing that because I guess you're a sign that the actor makes a great deal of work - Hannibal thinks Hannibal Letters or Washington as a training day as Alonso. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is also good for me. I think I did not dance in this role, because she's pretty cool. But she does a fantastic job, actually having her own with a gear in the top form which is a small job. Strickland provides the best supporting act in an episode where she needs substantial amounts from her. <br /> <br /> I really think I have a key look at Gear and Danes, that's a great deal. <br /> <br /> What about the rest of the movie along with the other wonderful acting? The story is not nearly as shocking, but has some 8mm-ish elements, but adding the hero of the "controversial breaks in cycle", and the retirement of the girl and Gere's role (such as the Silence of the Lambs). This is a background for the development of the two main characters because they help each other to settle in their new stations in their lives. It's a lot to achieve in 100 minutes, but it's very well done, and we care for the letters and what happens to them. <br /> Directing and photography is adequate. I was able to do modern musical-video camera movements and cutting, but I'm an old craft, and it's not really bad, it actually helped with the atmosphere of the movie, but it's not worth watching.
