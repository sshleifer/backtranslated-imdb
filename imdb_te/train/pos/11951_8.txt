Something like Sondra Pransky happens when she enters the box with a magician on a London theater stage. A slightly newer journalist Joe Strobe's spirit, on the other side of her journey, asked her to investigate herself, some of whom found the infamous tarot killer in relation to the crime in London. <br /> <br /> When the Sundra Sid Waterman tells his experience of the Great Splendid, the magician is surprised, but decides to go along. Peter Lyman is a club going to the PIS <br /> <br /> Sondra, who is drowning in her sinking, has attracted this hunk's attention and wants to see her more. <br /> <br /> Two of them are revealed at the end of the picture. The real tarot killer assumes that he will cheat an assured Sondra who proves he has more resources than he has given his credit. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Woody Allen has done better, and yet, this sunny comedy proves him for past failures. In "scoop", Mr. Allen takes himself from the romantic premiere of his most famous celebrity. This funny man gesticulating his trademark will never get rid of, since it looks like his trademark. <br /> <br /> Scarlett Johansson, the beautiful star of "scoop", feels perfect foil for Woody. Allen. Mr Allen plays her straight part as her shtick makes a perfect combination. Both mock all the film. Mrs. Johansson is a knockout beauty in her red bathtub suit, although she wears a lot of dresses wearing a lot of dresses. Peter Limman is a sophisticated figure about the town of Hugh Jackman's right pedigree. He plays a good role in the film as Mrs. Johansson chases. Ian McShane led Fleet Street journalist into eternity. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is a light image for hot and humid summer thanks to Woody Allen.
