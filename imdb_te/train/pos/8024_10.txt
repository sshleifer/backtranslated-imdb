When I saw the film in 1980, I was somewhat reluctant when my younger teens and I thought I grew up with "Sesame Street / Muppets". I do not remember honestly if I was at the time or likes. However, somewhere in college I saw the film again and it goes to my personal best films ever (and there is). <br /> <br /> The film is from the Muppets. I mean, the Muppets have always appealed to both adults and children because of the humor concentrating towards two generations. But it will come on ... someone who jests unexpectedly will say "I can not take my clothes for anyone, even though it's artistic ..." A son has a joke from a father Kermit love son Frog then does not want to hear the father ... Gonzo mouth-to-mouth Renaissance (sp?) Saves a chicken and then "we're engaged now" ... this is Many of us have rolled me moments in this film. Very smart talk, very smart New York / Broadway "Wink Wink" is some really joyous songs that are not perfect in comedy, famous camos and "kid-level cheesy" ... this is a masterpiece! I can not throw "10" on a daily basis ... but it is worth it. After 20 years, the film is entirely, perhaps more. The Muppets are never and will never be forever, funny and intelligent and just plain and just like this film. --- Q
