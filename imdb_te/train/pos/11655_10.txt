There are a lot of things in the film. One of them is eating. This picture shows it. It does not glamor it to the audience, it is shown by the true truth, which makes it more powerful. I only saw it once and it happened a few years ago but I still remember everything about it and how it feels like I am. This is a very powerful image and good support for anyone suffering from a disorder giving them the willingness to stop. These films should be about- they should be there to help people and not glamourise things that must.
