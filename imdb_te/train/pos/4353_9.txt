Good luck to see this fantastic film at Palm Springs International Film Festival. After entering the theater we handed a small opinion card that we used for our personal rating.

Sure it's fine but a completely natural reporter of the actors and unfortunately perhaps a film that won a Raincoat wearing a detective than the film, has brought the film to an incredible level. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film there were some powder eyes at home and my usually stoic and relentless heart melted Grinch and I ended up giving this amazing. <br /> <br /> This image is for parents who have a parent. There is not a strong language but violence or nudity.
