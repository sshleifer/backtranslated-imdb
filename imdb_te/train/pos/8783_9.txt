Gentleman Jim is not really a boxing movie. This is a vehicle for Jim Corbett for Errol Flynn. But boxing scenes say that the modern viewer is open to the real eye. There are no 12 rounds and points decisions. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn plays an Irish bank clerk who gets a shot at the Heavyweight World title. Flynn is very pleasant for the character but unpredictable corbets. His rival John Sullivan is still a braceier of the old school played by Ward Bond, although it is still the best. <br /> <br /> The background of this film is the man who pushes for his big chance. Corbett leaves behind his worldly life and makes a new person named Gentleman Jim. Jim is a chancellor in a social environment. He is a liar and arrogant. Heavyweight boxing winner Sullivan was portrayed as a normal brute, but his honesty and sporting contradiction contradicted the main character. <br /> <br /> The action and enthusiasm is quite simple and with a wonderful ending with the necessary ransom. And Errol Flynn gets the girl.
