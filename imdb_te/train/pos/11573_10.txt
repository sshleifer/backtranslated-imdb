I received this movie from a relative in Norway, and I changed it with a video from Norwegian to copying the American format. The film (1965) compared Heroes of Telemark (1965), Compan Om Tungstenet (The Struggle for the Heavy Water), and their actors, and actors, also gave journalists their lives in Norway's struggle for freedom in later movements. This project is in four languages: Norwegian French, German and English (completed with Norwegian subtitles). <br /> <br /> In this process, the process is impressive in the process. French scientists are interested in getting two hundred kilograms of water from Norsk Hydro in Vercourt, to study studies on its return to France. At the same time, the Nazis are also eager to get large water to build a secret weapon. Through the invasion of the Nazis, the Nazis could take the lead, and through secret signs, their man carefully escaped Nazi intelligence when he went to Oslo where he received heavy water and returned without interruption. Two spies saw him when he climbed a spy, but he did not see his cargo on his side stops on the other side when crossing the tarmac road in another vicinity nearby. This ingenious trick was forced to leave in Hamburg after the Nazis. <br /> <br /> On April 9, 1940, Norway's invasion of Nuskis, London underground and British intelligence agency was taken to take action. Professor Leaf Trendstad volunteered for eleven young Norwegian services; "Swallow" and "Gannerside" groups suppress heavy water production in Vermorg. This is shown in detail on how they carried out the operation as Ferr√©boutt was sinking after the Nazis left Norco Hydro to transport heavy water to rail cars to Berlin. <br /> <br /> The film is okay with many splits in the film. I recommend this film to anyone who is interested in World War II history.
