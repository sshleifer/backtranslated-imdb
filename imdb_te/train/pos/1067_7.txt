Like many series pilots, Dark Angel's opener combines great potential and shows a little problem with finding his own feet. It is not unusual in any way, but it is a feeling that the story is thought to be more focused if the story is cut. In today's world it is necessary to catch something instantaneously or with cancelsation, even if the range is blasting all the firearms, making it a bit of a disservice by drawing at least half of the attention. <br /> <br /> The ninety-minute pilot seems to have read together two episodes and has two episodes. In the first half, we will introduce to Max and fill it up on what drives her. It also includes some interesting routines, such as using the capabilities of winning Max capabilities, interacting with the PI or regulating domestic issues of colleagues. The problem here is that it is not normal for ordinary genes, television or another person. <br /> <br /> When the second half hits the purpose and attention. In two-part, Max attracts a dirty dealer from a pirate journalist who believes that life is a mission to save the world by revealing a dirty dealer at one time. In the second half, resistance meets him, and Max reluctantly clears the resulting mess. This creates a premise for the rest of the component, and it works, but it does not click if you get my meaning. It's like a lot of pieces, but left a couple doing a full picture. Maybe they may have filled up with the next episodes, but it's next to it. The fact is that the contents of this episode are easily said within twenty-eight minutes. <br /> <br /> The last of all the disadvantages is that the supporting cast is totally inconvenient. Specially Cindy is specifically an annoyance, and I suspect I have changed in the next twenty episodes. Acting is not as bad as daytime soap, it is not the quality that I recommend. Jessica Alba is not the worst actor in the world, but when she does not need at least one of the stories, she is as small as she is convinced. <br /> <br /> The good news is that the mantle and product values ​​are top notch. In fact, the series was considered very expensive to produce and was canceled to replace it with another show ending the season, which was very unfortunate. When the two shows had time-time - they were able to cancel one of the pieces of the lofty garbage to burn on the reality TV banner. <br /> <br /> You need more shows like Dark Angel, more specifically than here, to attract attention. <br /> <br /> For all I've given the Dark Angel Pilot from ten to seven. It's not far off the distance to the television station, and it can not live up to its ability to show up in its own running time. But there is potential, and it is all the things that are often worry for pilots.
