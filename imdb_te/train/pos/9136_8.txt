This is not a bad thing as some critics, and as an essay on the IMDB page for this image, why? In 1984, filmmakers were plain enough to face a domestic violence issue, one of the plot elements - so critics complaining about the plot have missed one of the major points! Secondly, the film's climax does not work well with his abusive father, so the classical climax does not work - so critics who say that music is good once again lose points - specifically, why it's so good ... because there is a plot element backdrop that music in all of the music is more effective . Third, give this picture a break! For the first time film producers and director, it's not just bad! There are a lot of people in the film where there is a master movie !! In the end, the reviewers who say that the music is "good" is ultimately missing - a stylized musical therapy, a variety of music, and a series of prince's stage performances - really a kind, in the 1980s and no other artist (no clothes with clothes and moves, No musically moving, this is the first thing to do as Michael Jackson or Prince Lustaru this before the eyes of the Prince, trinino Quentin's "Pulp Fiction" for a long time before). The amount of its parts is not a bad image.
