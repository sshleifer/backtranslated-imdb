I liked the movie. I liked the actors too. But, I have very little effort with a voice of Ms. Davis, and her hard acting really makes it a very difficult constructive film to watch. <br /> <br /> Like Mrs. Davis, if other modern actor plays this role, they will be laughed on the screen. <br /> <br /> Now, if I have a part of Mirna Loy or Ingrid Bergman's wife, I'll be very happy. <br /> I guess I can not bet on Davis. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> I have always been an actor playing his role. I feel that she has played a role. Possible exclusion is now Voyager. <br /> <br /> Other critics are very carefully described (and I hope Civil) I'm totally wrong in this regard. But I love the stories / writing / supporting vowels, but I'm thinking about the various actresses that can do good work.
