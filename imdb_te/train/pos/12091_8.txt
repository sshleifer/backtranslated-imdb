'Castle of Blood' ("Castle of Terror") is a well-designed, surprisingly spooky entry from Italian director Anthony Dawson. Sensitive black and white cinematography, flawless dubbing, spectacular casting, fairly logical scripting, deliberate motion and surprise (though not entirely apt) keep this item apart. Not only Elizabeth (Barbara Steel) and Alan (Georges Rivier), some films only hockey music and the first impressive "Loves Love" surprisingly entertained. <br /> <br /> When visiting England, Edgar Allan Poe sits in a pub, telling him one of his ghostly stories of the Black Wad count. Recognizing the younger writers of the great writer Alan, he asks the interview with Po. During the conversation, Po reveals his stories as true. Incredible, Alan expresses his skepticism about life after death. Count Blackwood Allen put 100 pounds, he could not survive this night in Blackwood Castle, the night after Halloween when dead. <br /> <br /> Unlike the 'Black Sunday' of Mario Bava ('Mask of Satan'), 'Blood Castle' can not bear the bets. <br /> <br /> It is especially awesome from a director who has been associated with those horrific Italian space films from the 60s. <br /> I found the only version of this film, the PAN and Scan version severely degraded (and recorded). Nevertheless, he probably cried for a modern remake with Christina Ricky or Jennifer Love Hewitt as Elizabeth. Watch it and enjoy a movie that is well suited to Robert Wise 'The Hunting'.
