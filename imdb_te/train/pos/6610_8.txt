In 2054, Paris controls a computer-generated system called Avlolon, and when a young woman kidnaps, Detective Cresses (Craig) must go against Avalon to find her. <br /> <br /> Picture is a blend of an illustrative futuristic story on the screen in a surprisingly elegant picture with a Nair-themed ideology and conceptual mantes called animation masters. Their many Oscar winning films are from the lovely Toy Story to the endless Wall-E, and any company or director has a real challenge to hit their stalk. Renaissance is not a film intended for younger audiences, and as 2007's Perceptophilus brings a strong and mature approach to the animation style to make an older and more challenging image for older generation of older people. <br /> <br /> <br /> Robert Rodriguez released a scary brilliant Nair Sin City, a year later with the black and white colors and odd spots in white color, the Christian Volkmann </ br> /> Volkmann's image is full of animation, but it's complete 1 hour and 40 minutes The. The faces of the character are well shot and, specifically, the film is always the best of shadows. We never know when Shadows combined across their expression, face to face with its night or day. <br /> <br /> For anyone who has seen perpetopiles, one of the best-performing animations you have ever performed. <br /> <br /> The revival is similar to that of the movie and in many cases it opposes the darker tone to reflect strong graphics and mood. <br /> The story revolves around a stubborn and nose political government while keeping tabs on every citizen. Paris runs to a mysterious Avalon, and we can not see enough of the essence of its true superiority. The revival controls the story around the exhausted cop's attempts to save the mysterious woman, and then look at Craig's tiredness and boring cop rescue while fighting with other subjects. The tired cape routine is now outdated, but there are many things wrong with scripting, but the sharpness of the adrenaline and spruce ridicules between the characters to keep it alive until the last two stages surprise.
