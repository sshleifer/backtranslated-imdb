<br /> <br /> Other films in mind are Edgar Wallace's "Don Before Dawn" Called "unusual" explanation ("vampires"). "And (famous)" Mark of the Vampire ". <br /> When two people see Renfild's Count on the steps of his castle, or when the two men appear on the Vampire's MARK, the film creates a very "horrendous atmosphere", through the ruins of the castle ruins and a corpse playing a corpse Luna sleeps using wings! <br /> <br /> If this (often silent) weather has touched the likes, this film is mandatory! <br /> Norm Vogel
