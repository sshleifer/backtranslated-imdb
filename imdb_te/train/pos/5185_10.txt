I saw this film more than 100-200 times, and I love it every time. Yes, it is very brown but it is also very funny and enjoyable. The camp virtual camp shown in the film, actually I attended for 7 years and the camp was really a great place to spend the summer. Everybody wanted to go to the camp, wanted to send the baby to the camp. You will see this movie and bring back the wonderful memories for your kids and your children.
