The life of director Jean-Marc was brought to the new side of the story of Victoria and Albert. Many people's thoughts about Queen Victoria lived for many decades and lived a life of pain in her life. Emily Blunt is capable of the title role, giving her a different perspective on the audience. Victoria in her youth, ascended to the throne, and starred in the early years. Blunt Victoria both fresh and captivated throughout the film. Her strong looks are with Albert (Rupert Friend) and Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). <br /> <br /> It is not the story of dramatic arcs and hiroshionic "acting" moments, although the story is still interesting, all actors including Miranda Richardson retire themselves. Viewable value. There are some historical libraries taken by screenwriting, which seeks to establish the relationship between Victoria and Albert and the social and royal structures of the time. <br /> <br /> The film is so much appreciated by the history, time plays, and the blunt and other actors. <br /> <br /> Grade: a
