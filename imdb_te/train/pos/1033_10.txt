It can not be blamed on Mr. Bush - after all, we allowed him to run in that direction and reelected after his lies were revealed.

I did not compare George Bush with Adolf Hitler. <br /> <br /> "Leaders of our country, supporting them, buried their heads in the sand <br /> <br /> The film, like a watch on the Rain, reminds us of what we once wanted - a power for the good of humanity - and once again Want to do majestic goals Untunnamu. <br /> <br /> Geoff
