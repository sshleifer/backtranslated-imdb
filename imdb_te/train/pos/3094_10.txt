It is the best and most original show ever seen in years. The more I love it more I watch it in love. The cast is awesome, the writing is great. I personally like every role. However, everyone has a favorite character, a good compound of real people and backgrounds. I believe that the ABC has made a defilement for writers, actors and potential audiences in this program, giving me a real chance of not doing so quickly and adequately promoting or getting the following. There are quite a few demos so I can no longer watch TV is too horrible. This show in my opinion is right with my favorite Grace Anatomy and Brothers and Sisters. In fact I think this show would love if I knew the same audience for the Brothers and Sisters. Anytime it will always be lost at any time and with the greatest potential of winning the show will always be rejected. I can not see anyone in reality shows. It has a new idea for a show, and this program has been very promising to bring amazing actors. The most recent episode is the best one, all of them really get their parts and make the show real. Please watch this show on ABC's video and tell ABC to get this show back. Signal ABC's online perception: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html
