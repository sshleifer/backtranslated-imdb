May 2004, Wonderland is the newest in the UK. The brilliant image of a ruthless true story. If you know LA at the beginning of the 80s, you know how well it is captured. The use of elements that make up its sand motion picture is very close to the original, experience enhancement and the viewer being there. The use of a chaotic "Pulp Fiction" style timing allows the exploration of uncertainty about what really happened, directing and performing the cast as John Holmes, especially Wal-Killer; Exactly Oscar if I give them up.
