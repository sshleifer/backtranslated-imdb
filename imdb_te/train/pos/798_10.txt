This fantastic play has a total time of suspense for me. Every word connects the pieces to this clutter killing because I could not get my eyes on the screen a second. The film really touched me because it showed how sad and hard life it was. And finally I did cry (I did not want to give away!) Which let me realize how cruel and sickening people are when it comes to murder. <br /> This cast is very good. Anne was the only actress who played the role of Mary. The actress did a great job, but the director did not. I said he found an unidentified person like Anne Mary Faye.
