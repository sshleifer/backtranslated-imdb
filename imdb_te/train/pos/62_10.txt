I absolutely loved this movie. I bought it as soon as I found a copy. The film has so many emotions and is true, I have sympathy with the characters. Every time I watch, the end will make me cry. <br /> I can really recognize the role of Busy Philip, and I feel like if it happened to me. <br /> <br /> All high schools want to show this film, do this. I recommend this movie to everyone and everyone. Especially for those who are affected by any school shooting. <br /> It really is one of the greatest movies of all time.
