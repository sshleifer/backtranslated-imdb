I saw Soyland Green back in 1973 that it was T.V. Or the other one on the video may be a little more than eight times released. <br /> Recently, L.A. The Egyptian Theater of Twelve Charlton Heston was reconciled. I left the state for six days to see six pictures. A perfect new print on Soylent Green looked great on the big Egyptian screen. <br /> <br /> Charlotton Heston is a dog who eats the world with some natural resources that live in a dog and has no understanding. The world is used and Eddie Robinson is the greatest recipient of the past. <br /> <br /> Their chemistry is excellent. The film is also great on the great 35mm print. The Fleischer really knows how to complete the screen, and cinematography, writing, music and everything about it works. The film is also very powerful in its worst and most possible scene in the future. The world's population has grown, disappearing rain forest and resources, the greenhouse effect has fallen further since 1973. Why did not this film be played in theaters all year round? <br /> <br /> If Charlton Heston is not a great actor, people often speak. I believe he is one of our best actors when looking back at El-Sid, Soyland Green, The Warlord, The Omega Man, Will Penny, and Major Dundee. <br /> He's about a dozen other great movies and he's made for what you know. <br /> <br />
