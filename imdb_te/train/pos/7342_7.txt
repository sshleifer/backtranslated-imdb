I'm a fan of Ralph, because I'm not. Cone Skin, Wizards, Fritz the Cat and Lord of the Rings, and finally "Fire and Ice" I have seen only five animated films. What can I say, I found "fire and ice" very enjoyable. This is a straightforward fantasy story of knives and sorcery on the Konan the Barbarian style, but the beautiful artistic, realistic animation and lively film score give the film a very classic charm. <br /> <br /> And the animation itself. I do not care what people think about rotoscoping, but my opinion is that Ralph Baksh has been used here very efficiently. I was amazed at how realistic movements were. Directing and photo-realistic designs style "Fire and Ice" is considered a big budget fantasy block buster than a cartoon. Sadly the level of detail in the art detail will get a little staggering, especially at the end of the picture. Some scenes are just barely visible on body shape details or fabric folds and shadows. <br /> <br /> With realistic moving characters, realistic action will be followed naturally. The action is not only good for dancing, but it is really cruel. I'm so bold to compare the brutality of action for Jack Snyder's 300 action action films. Even though blood was killed, I saw that blood splatters were kept at least. <br /> Once again, a great selection by a creative team that only enhances the viewing experience without taking "many things" above. <br /> <br /> In the cast I managed to perform satisfactory performance with the "big names" actors; Delivery of each line is realistically owned and wiped out in the case of bad guys. <br /> Do I say bad? Yes I did. That's exactly the same way about the story, because a good good vs evil story. The story that seems to be mixed in the pre-existing Phantasy film cliches is not really real. Anyone looking for "depth" will be discouraged. These characters did not improve and I heard rumors of some deleted scenes depicting Darkwolf's invasion of Nekron and Darkwolf (the killing of Nekon and his mother), and the final cut to add a depth level to the show). In fact, I'm not surprised to find that the whole movie is just a "tech demo" to showcase an amazing technology, with the story moving along the story and putting the story down. <br /> <br /> The true classic of an ancient period, "Fire and Ice" The blissful spirit of adventure and mysticism is truly a story with its beautiful translations of creatures and lovely characters Rahistundi. It is a unique sight to the world created by Ralph Bakshi and artist Frank Frejetta with a good focus and suspense. <br /> <br /> Is this until the animated film standards today? Not sure. But I'd normally "animate the fans" into your high horses "and gave me a chance to grow this simple but beautiful film with a gem worth a value of 80.
