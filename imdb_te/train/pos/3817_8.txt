If you have drama in your life, your own or anyone who is close to you, this woman goes through the very real steps of pain (but, in my opinion, it may even be a man). This is not about your pain, it's not about what you can do to learn about it. Naturally it is also a picture about how you can then help someone close to get through their pain. This is the picture that you realize is that everyone is alone in their pain. It is a film that hits anyone on the edge ... it's not like a recommendation. I can not tell anyone that this film is particularly recommended for anyone to go to, but for me ... it's a picture that shows the truth that shows the truth, and it's so important to be alive. Hey, you know that you or someone close to you lives through pain, hey, all the things you are worrying now are very small
