A very good war film showing the effects of war on a homeless boy who loses his eyesight on Guadalcanal and returns home and with the help of family and friends. The cast's amazing cast makes this film very entertaining. Ellinar Parker's role as a sweetheart is for Oscar nomination. She is innocent in the film. Anwar Doran's character is equally satisfied with all of her little supporting roles. I'm particularly like the prehistoric predecessor of pre-war Philadelphia. The hunting scene is very good. Of course the scene of the Guadalcanal war really showed the horror faced by our soldiers during this epic battle. A better deserving image and do not forget
