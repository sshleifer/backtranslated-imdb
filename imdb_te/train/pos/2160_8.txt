When he goes home, he looks forward to everything in life as he dances unexpectedly when he sees a beautiful girl every day watching the dance studio while riding a subway. <br /> <br /> "This death is more to life than work for you" It's clear. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br / > <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> And there are liberation.
