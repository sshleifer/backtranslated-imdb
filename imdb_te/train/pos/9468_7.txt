Today I saw a special progress on this day. I need to let you know, I'm not a huge fan of Don Cooke or Steve Karel, so I did not really have these expectations. <br /> <br /> <br /> Real life is a story of the wife of three daughters who spend a weekend with his family. While in a bookstore, he meets the woman of her dreams, only to find out that she is his brother's lover. <br /> <br /> The film is very beautiful - soundtrack, cinematography and acting top notch, especially Steve Karel. The problem with which my problem was that most of the characters lacked, mostly with the character of Don Cook. We never felt close to the relationship between Dan and Steve's characters and thought it was a bit helpful in showing Dawn's internal conflict about being in love with Don's girlfriend. Unlike these, Dawn in Real Life is definitely a solid, sweet picture- a nice break from all the horror and action movies we've been getting this year.
