Cat soup at first is a very random animated film. The best way I could explain was that it was very acidic. It's not totally random. This story is about Natatta, a young cat boy and his sister Nayako. Nyaako is very ill and dies, however, Nyatta sees her soul's death taken away and reaches half of it. <br /> <br /> While most of the content in this movie is completely coincidental, it is not. Most of it is a symbol of life, death and rebirth. You can also find instructions from other stories like Hansel and Gretel. This amazingly beautiful little picture has an interesting story, you have a deeper meaning than the screen surface.
