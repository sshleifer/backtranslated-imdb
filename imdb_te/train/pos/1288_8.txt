Preston Waters goes to a bad summer. <br /> You must first share his room with his brothers who run his business. They can not make them in their rooms because they do not have enough space. While others receive $ 32, $ 35, and $ 50, he gets just $ 6 for a birthday party. When one of his birthday cards arrives initially, he gets a check made just $ 11. <br /> When going to the bank, at least $ 200 is required to start at least one account. The bank leaves, the bully checks the check. Quigley (played by Miguel Ferrar) after being kidnapped by his criminal (who is definitely off his bike). Quigley also came from the bank to give the owner $ 1,000,000 to give to this person. Quigley begins to write a check for the loss, but the police car only succeeds when writing his name before making the circle in circles. <br /> <br /> Even though that evening, Preston tells his father that he needs a new bike, he returns to his own room, and still has his own home. His father interrupts him in the rest of his room. Moving on the contents of Preston dolls in his room, he finds that he has forgotten about the check that he is still in his shirt pocket. This is empty. <br /> <br /> Using computer and carefully examining it, he will increase it to $ 1,000,000. The next day, when he was trying to make money at the bank he had to give 1,000,000 dollars and the owner he'd been supposed to be. <br /> <br /> You need to keep track of two prestones. Meanwhile, Preston purchases all kinds of goods. Including his own home and even really and FBI agent who's going to be disguised bank lady dates (who are trying to track down 3 bad guys down). <br /> He is the one who is called Mr Mekintosh, who works for him on his birthday. <br /> <br /> But finally things (money runs out, the bad ones get him). <br /> <br /> The whole, pretty funny picture. Miguel Ferrer is very good in his role. If you enjoyed him in another stove, you would love him here. <br /> <br /> Rick Dumann (The Bass Stressed From Ghost In The Machine) plays an amazing friendly driver in the film.
