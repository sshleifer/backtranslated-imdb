"Deathlands a Hand" is one of the key components of "Colombo", which has helped to define performance for thirty years. <br /> <br /> Robert Colp's four performances (as the three killers) are the first to play the same role in each show. <br /> <br /> In this regard, Kelp asked a large private detective firm to investigate whether the wife of a wealthy newspaper Magnat was associated with Kennett's wife. She, however, decides not to tell Kennethott that Brinker could blackmail his wife instead of snippets of information about her husband's business associates. She strongly reacts to this advice, and it turns out that Brinmer has been hunted across her face. Because he wore a big ring, the blow blow on the floor and kills her. <br /> <br /> There are some priceless moments in this episode. This is one of my favorite scenes in Colombo Palm-read, although it is a vicious idea to learn the shape and size of the Brinmer ring, without knowing that the killer was wearing a ring. Columbo being Columbo, he only tells what he really knows when he is sure to turn a little bit of time screws. So in the beginning he goofily plays a part of the general-minded person rather than being excited by the mumbo-jumbo reading "Lifeline on the Moon Clay" or some equally humorous palm. Brinmer Columbo is a great scene that seeks to provide a job for his company, effectively bribing him to stop poking his nose. <br /> Once again, Colombo does not know what he knows, he pretends to be honored and happy with this job. <br /> <br /> And before Colombo Bridmer, the murderer listens to their conversation. Brinker does not want to directly blame him, but wants to suggest Bringer that he is on his own, so he decides to play mindless games on Brinker, but he does something intimidating and stupid. He's of course! All the time, grief Kennett is not aware of the subtitle of this conversation. <br /> <br /> I can not openly tell you how Colombo will eventually slow down Kumar's daughter's bang rights, but I say the potato is there. <br /> Really really good episode, perhaps the best in the first sequence. If you like it, you prefer the "double exposure", also played by Robert Kalpe.
