This is a free adaptation of the Clarence Mulford novels; Fans of Willie Boyd's films probably feel little in the ocean (reviews here so far). <br /> <br /> Christopher Coppola is a wise choice - he's a craze for "Western"; Instead, he met Cassidy's story with what he called 'Americaa'; Or any old critics once called 'in the homes'. When this film is removed, I remember the great "Hallmark Theater" version of Mark Twain's "Roughing It" version, when James Gerner commented, that Americans are always myth about the 'Old West' and should not be 'Western'; <br /> <br /> Only films are the only ones that can be American in the film. <br /> <br /> When I see this film, Boyd-Cassidy's legacy has nothing to do with our voice, no irony, no camp. <br /> <br /> In this movie, we positively call it "style" come. And performers plain acting fits neatly with this; The gosh that we expect from an adventure yarn good narration - and sudden violence - just a quirky dressing, just quirks and good humor - really makes it feel really like a cattle drive says around a campfire. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ <br /> Note: 1 review: Hopper is a critic who does not kill the dead guns in the film (so by Boyd's Cassidy); First, Cassidy shoots dead people in novels; Second, if Cassidy was a real cowboy he would kill people - firing guns into the hands of people can always get another gun - it's part of the film's subtraction. <br /> Note 2: I admit that the Coppola family was jealous, with the director of "The Godfather". But a good picture is a good picture; This is a good movie. If it's someone called "Coppola", it's just that. America's likely land (or, until Bush came into office) - that's what great American novels are all about.
