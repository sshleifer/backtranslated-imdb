Everything to be a musical joke. Jean Kelly (Joe Brody) will not lose one step, and Frank Sinatra (as Clarence Dulittle) will miss a note. The scenes are very good with them, showing some talent in which the somewhat uneven plot can be added. Sinatra's "I'll Fall in Love You Ellie" is his best and most successful future. Kelly's "Mexican Hat Dance" is delighted with a young Mexican girl. Kelly earned her performance as Best Actor. And there is a bushel of real funny lines, like: "Do you think the Navy takes dope?"; "Who is a sailor singing to sleep?" And, "We've got a little trouble, we've got a little kid." A completely enjoyable cinema, is just the thing for the dusting of recently finished World War II.
