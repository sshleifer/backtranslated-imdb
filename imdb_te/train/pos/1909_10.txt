I first saw 8 general rules for the first series in Disney Channel UK and hooked up completely. Although they did not show anything, it was annoying, but later shown the ABC 1 series 2. I did not think that another series would start after John Ritter read dead, but the 2nd series was not outstanding, it was the oldest standard of the latest series. I hope they can produce more shows soon, though I can see every presentation a thousand times. Kale Kupo is also my favorite character in the Airhead Bridget and Charmed. Rory is also good, he shares my name and grandpa too. Until then I will be watching.
