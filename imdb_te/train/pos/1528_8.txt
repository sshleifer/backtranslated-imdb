Dick Van Dyke Show days of good, clean fun, good humor and nostalgia - I'm working at home and diagnosis murdered my longtime break companion. How we all are innocent (and how innocent diaignosis is murder). I especially enjoyed episodes with other nostalgia dolls like Joe Mannix. Bad boys always get trapped, good guys can carry on. <br /> One beef: Why are most villains women or at least bitches? Amanda is very dizzy. <br /> <br /> We hope Dick Van Dick in our screens and the family did not see the last, esp. at lunchtimes !!
