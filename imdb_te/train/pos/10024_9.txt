Aero Tolbkhin comes in a lot of things. En la mente del asesino (inside the killer's mind), it's hard to talk about this without giving any warning. The film is like a workout in the movie, but tell me that it really works. It is made of super 8, black and white shots, 35 mm, color, interviews, flashbacks. Aro Tolbukhin is like a movie made by documentary or vice-versa, which is a surprise to you that he really never doubts, is he ever exist? The film follows the later life of a forward sailor who joined Guatemala, where some people died in a religious event. He was captured and an act of death sentence. The film begins because some French documentaries are keen on the role, so they interview him before his death. Nowadays, some people have participated and do a thorough research of the character. <br /> <br /> For the major part in history we are guided by A Partial Slow Duration into Aero's mind, what he has done. However, the most important thing is that the filmmakers can not give us a vision; Even if they leave judgment for all of us and we may understand his actions, we clearly do not justify them. So, the first half depends on the recall of the information; Later things became Aro's childhood, giving such a spectacular new power (not weak or boring). <br /> I do not mean I do not need anything. So what's left to say is that if you come to this, I believe, it's more than worth watching.
