This inaccessible story is a woman in a massage world witch who chases a massage man. Her "congregation" is open between its members, but she hides her witchcraft from men. Oops ... it's a familiar sound. LOL. Not your typical image. Jack Lemmann and Ernie Kovac have put things beyond the "campe" performances. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak has always been a pleasure on the screen, but I found her pairing with James Stewart exceptional (but not fatal to the storyline). Recognized and recovered by old and new audiences ... It's still a lot of hoot!
