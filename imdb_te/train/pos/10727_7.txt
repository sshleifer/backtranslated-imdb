This family image will automatically turn off some people. Many do not want to watch movies and weapons, unsatisfactory torture and failures with enough excitement to fill the New York phone book. This film is not one. It is the clich√©, which is the principle, but also fun. You do not ask to think, it does not demand that you accept the movie as reality. It should just do a good image, it is willing to suspend two hours disbelief and enjoy the adventure. The cast is good, not good. John Williams' sound score as another commentator says, as always, is amazing. And the fact that most people have shot in Huntsville in the virtual camp is more reliable. <br /> <br /> The original release of the film was delayed by the Challenger Shuttle disaster for a few months, even though it played a major role in the original theater, but the end of the film helped focus on the combination of many young people and opportunities in space. Get ready to sit down with your children.
