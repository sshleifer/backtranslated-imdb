I need help and comments from a college student practicing a level education and who have any opinions about the mother and parents' background. If you go beyond something or comment on the film to make more research, any comment will be greatly appreciated. Comments are only used for testing purposes and are included in my written exam. If you have any views at all, im sure I can keep use of them and you could help me an AA! If I see these pictures, I read 'About a Boy' and 'Todo'. Thank you.
