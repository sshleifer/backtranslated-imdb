He is hello !! This is a very fun movie. Usually, in party girl, you have your fun-loving, independently, early 90 New Yorker chic. Along with her party friends, she meets her mature Turkish seller. It's the comming of the story of the old age for new adults that are searching for what they want to do. A woman's maturity is a mammoth woman who feels like a mature woman. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey makes this film so great. I have never seen her a great fan, but the film wants to see all of her movies. Her character is a perfect micro psychology. If you want a good laugh and fun time, watch this movie. Recurrence views must exist.
