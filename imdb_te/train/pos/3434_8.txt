This is the Australian Post Office for recruitment anytime a promotional film is needed. The heart is in the right place and can be seen again and again. Miranda's performance touches as many Europeans have shown a factor of unexpected Australia, which is cold, wet and dark, like anywhere, and from anywhere, and the people around you are important. The characters in the film are warm and welcomed and provide an opportunity to change an idea that is considered a 'dead letter office'. Miranda went to make big movies, but I hope she always puts this into an idea?
