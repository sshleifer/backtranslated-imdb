Total Pirates of the Caribbean Troyage Craze Paramount Pictures Released the film directed by Cecil B. Demille, directed by Anthony Quinn, and removed all of the DVDs and DVDs with all the extra parts included in Blu Ray. Paramount Pictures executives are blind as bats and actually know that they have a good bandit film in their treasury about the real pirate who lived in New Orleans, Louisiana. It is again famous for pirate connections. When the executors at Paramount finally release the film with the program in digital format, I'll be happy cumber. Paramount Pictures is up to you to get your Duff and this movie will be restored now!
