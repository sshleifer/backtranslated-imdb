The cast was nice, and it was a good act from Christopher Lloyd, who I love from previous films. The movie is a great family film, nothing that makes you worry to show it to young kids, a good story line, laugh, playful and enjoyable lot. If you want to make a habit for children without boredom then this bill is enough. Kid pleasing, and watching a parent is not difficult either.
