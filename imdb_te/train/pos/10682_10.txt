A few years ago, the satellite channel U.K. Gold hype encouraged the recurrence of 'Men Behaving Bidle': "The original flat-sharing sitcom here!". This is not true. <br /> <br /> It is the design of Johnny Mortimer and Brian Cookie, the creators of the famous sitcom 'father Dear Father'. When it was over, they wanted to do more in terms of time. <br /> <br /> In the first episode Chris (Paula Wilcox) and Joe (Sally Thomset) are reading their Madlton Terrace flat. He is a Southampton cooker student of Robin Tripp (Richard O'Sullivan), a permanent residence. When his clothes are dry, he puts on a ladies dressing gown and makes them lunch. They invited him to invite him for his culinary skills. But there is no mischievous business there. <br /> <br /> In B.B.C.-2's 'I Love Love 1973' featured in 2000, Julie Burchlle 'House' has shown herself a jealous life. She is not alone. One of the most iconic British videos of '70's ​​(okay, anyway) pictures were taken by Salis Thompsett underground in London underground and spawning his bottom edge movements, double the 'blind' man. <br /> <br /> A girl who lives with two girls does not need to get hot on time, but Ms. Mary Whitehouse does not need to get hot under the caller, it's innocent and good-natured fun. <br /> <br /> Mortimer and Cookie's scripts did not go beyond the edge. <br /> <br /> Richard O'Sullivan had earlier stated that I.T.V. Is playing 'Bingham' in 'Doctor In Charge'. In fact, the second in 'Charge' ends with 'House' first. He was born to play sex madness Robin. Street Street is more than Paula Wilcox's 'Chrissy' 'Beryl', where she played in 'The Lovers', while Sally Thompsett's 'Joe' is a beloved charming blonde. <br /> <br /> For many audiences, Bryan Murphy and Yutu Joyce participated in this competition. George lost interest in sex, but not Mildred. They participated in their own program - aptly named 'George & Mildred'. Last Doug Fisher, Robin's elaborate friend Larry is a good value. <br /> <br /> In the initial year itself, the inevitable film is spin-off. I thought I'd expanded to the big screen because I was not a big fan of 'Man About the House'. <br /> <br /> The format was sold to the United States, which has long been known as the 'Thrice Company' by John Ritter and Suzanne Somers. <br /> <br /> After six seasons, 'house' married sister of Crissis Robin's older brother Norman (Norman Ehlye). Fans failed to see Robin fail to get the girl he loved, but there was some comfort in the fact that he also made his own appearance as 'Robbins Nest'.
