Just returned from the first performance of the Basic Instruction 2. I'm going into it thinking the preview will be crappy based on critically and I was pleasantly surprised! If you liked the original Basic Instinct I think you will enjoy # 2 if you have # or more. Great story that always keeps you thinking and thinking. The music is awesome, rolling back to the background. The Academy Award does not go to expect the material, go see it with joy and fun. It's made of films - Espazism. I can not think of a better way to escape than with the sexy Sharon Stone. I'm thinking again this weekend. Let's see!
