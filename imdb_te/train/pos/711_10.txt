"Rock 'n' Roll High School" is perhaps the ultimate revolutionary party in history. The entire film mile is one minute inspiring to raise their high school pupils using their music by Ramones' music to their despotic principal (Mary Woronov, against "eating raoul" fame). It's basically a big need to savor, and I'm sure you will. Are older people suffering? Check. Darby Music Teacher (also from Paul Bartel, "Right Raoul" *)? Check. Exploding mice? <br /> <br /> Anything that makes life a valuable lifestyle. Ramones Music is not known to anyone like me, it is pure pleasure. With Roger Corman's executive producer and co-director Joe Dante, how can we expect anything less? <br /> <br /> PJ Souls, Vincent van Patten, Clint Howard, Dee Young, Dick Miller (Joe Dante's movies), and many of Roger Corman), Don Steel, and of course Ramones. <br /> It looks like Bartel and Voronev starred together. They also starred in Joe Dante's "Hollywood Boulevard" and Slasher Flick "Chopping Mall" (also starring Dick Miller) ... in which they reunited their roles from "Ratting Raoul".
