Since I started in 1981, I liked this movie! How many times I've tracked! It laughs me or excites me if I'm feeling. Three leads is amazing and the script is priceless, plus how do you listen to the theme song and get nostalgia? I guess I would quote this film without realizing it. I know the whole script mainly, so I'm talking about the next line how much fun it is for the first time. Although Sir John's character is perhaps the most memorable, I can not even lower the narrow. When Arthur announces his intention to take a bath, "I will alert the media" is still priceless, but that list is not true. Arthur's soon-to-be-fianc√©e's father is a scene of his home, especially his interaction with his abuse. See yourself a favor and see this movie!
