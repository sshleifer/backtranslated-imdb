"My left foot" is a beautiful picture that tells the story of Christie Brown, a artist who learned to paint with a cerebral palsy and his left foot. Daniel Day-Lewis won his first Oscar award as Best Actor for the film, I'm definitely not worthy of some, but still important. Day-Lewis Brown Give a realistic and occasionally nearly funny touch. Brenda Fricker, Brown's dedicated mother, has also won an Oscar for a credible and touching role. My problem with this film is sometimes it is a bit too real. When Brown is in desperation and someone can help and do everything with his left foot, it's hard to see that movie. It gives a frequent discouraging experience that can stop some viewers for a while. However, if you do not, you will see the hope and inspiration for those who face hearts and other problems. The film is inspired by the fact that we have problems with people who are not handicapped, because if the situation is somewhat difficult, we can overcome their hardships. Well, occasionally enjoyable, but hard to watch. <br /> <br />
