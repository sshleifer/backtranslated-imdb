Some genres are needed to wear. This is an exception. It's a weird version of the horror genre that has taken its own merit. With minimal special effects, it's a simple yet unstable background that deals with the kind of mental study - the loss of the bus and why she? This is not a great movie, because the story is a little contrived, the story works. Sensitive, and about the interaction of all the characters. In fact, there is a set in the opening sequences, but it may be placed there to set the tone for the next. I have greatly appreciated the balance of male and female power, and do not recommend this story to those who are more interested in people than responding to physical and mental challenges. If you have some empathy, you need a bit of adventure in your life, what will I do in this situation?
