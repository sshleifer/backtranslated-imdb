Cary Grant and Mirna Lai were perfectly cast as a middle class couple who wanted to build their dream house. It starts with reasonable plans and expectations to avoid a number of problems and bits with the explosion of the original budget. <br /> <br /> Many great laughs (though somewhat narrower) are entertaining fans of the stars or the late 1940s Hollywood comedy style. An exact highlight comes when a contractor runs all the expenses, which is very high for the 1948 audience. When he makes his exit, he can guarantee the client (grant), he can cut $ 100.00 from the amount ... or at least $ 50.00 ... but definitely $ 25.00. Hilarious!
