What is so taboo about love? <br /> <br /> The title does not attract attention to the title. It was shot at a maximum of 4 minutes in the film, and I stopped surfing the channel. I can not believe how awesome the film is. When it hit human emotions at several levels, it could not move me in some way. This is one of the best independent films I have ever seen. I do not see these characters as gender, just human. I would recommend it to anyone who loves movies. Particularly independent films. Praise all the fearless filmmakers!
