Anyone who has never seen combat scenes in The Matrix has never seen this film. The action scenes were choreographed by Action Scene Psychopath Yuen Woo Ping, and he also made struggles in The Matrix. <br /> <br /> L plays the power of the soul. He is suffering from pain, and now lives a life as a peaceful librarian (yah i got). <br /> <br /> When other nasty superspal soldiers start killing the local drug lords to take drug commerce, Lee can help him open up the le team with a cop friend. <br /> <br /> Some of the crazy things in this movie are badguy badguy with his hands on the glass pane and rarely off-the-note). Combat scenes are filled with flying kicks and punches; The body count is there. Li is rarely good, and he surrounds himself with a beautiful woman's expensive (a little donkey fellow supersodier for Yip's son). Anthony Wang was also a magician like a lord (there was no doubt, he had a guest role in every HK movie). It is unfortunate that they make action movies like this in the US; I do not have to sit all of these unfortunate dubbing jobs to see this kind of action. Recommended.
