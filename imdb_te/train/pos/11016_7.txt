A good acting performance, but not new. Most of these mountains were made, showing some good view. One person is in the group of mercenaries, the main flies, and he takes butt kicks. It is called "Rambo goes to the rockies", which is pat. This is the most effective scene in the first film that killed me in horror. Not a bad movie, that is the same, the same Ol.
