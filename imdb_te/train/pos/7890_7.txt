Freddies Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991) is the last film featuring Freddy Krueger as a solo act (not the last or co-star). There were a toll in the years that killed Springwood. It has little gotten to the point that the city has become a virtual ghost town. Many years ago, the parents who killed Freddy Kruger paid the final price. Only mad lives in the town and the survivors are scattered everywhere. But it does not stop Freddie's final revenge. If they try to stop him, he will always get back more. But this time he learns little about his old life. Can kids stop Freddy for the better of the end? What is this secret that was buried in Freddie's twisted mind? You have to watch Freddy Dead. It was originally filmed in 3-D. <br /> <br /> A fitting way to end the franchise. Freddy finds something about herself and her perilous life and he gets a bang to go out! Lisa Zen, Yepte Koto and Freddy Krueger are in this final installment. Rosenne, Tom Arnold and Johnny Depp have appeared exclusively. The whole amount is better than the last one but it's filled with some dated jokes. <br /> If you enjoyed this series, you should not lose it. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to Freddie fans.
