At the Kurt Wheel festival in Brooklyn, WHERE are from here? Ultimately it was dug for a screening. A movie from any period of time with Wile-Gershwin collaboration goes away from the screens. The CD of the length of the score, the Gershwin and the Weill, only recognizes the merits of its significance. Yes, the film has its problems, but the score is not one of them. Rothoff does not have his element as the director of this musical fantasy, and Fred Mac Marie can not understand this. Even then, the 'modern' section was written weakly. But the two fantasy women's work - the fantasy elements carries the image to a high mark - Jon Leslie and June Hawthorn. This kind of work requires two kinds of work. The history of our country is like the Second World War salute - in a 'today' frame, the film is featured in the Hollywood musical history and is available for all to see and gain considerable merits.
