<br /> <br /> Before this began, the advantages and "authorization" that I saw on this big screen are the advantages of <br /> <br /> These two benefits congratulate me for this version of "The Shining". <br /> <br /> Also, I have read the book, "The Shining", a book by Mr. King, who spent years, and while Stanley Kubrick's resume of this story is very compelling, when I love the book and is a favorite fan of his work ... < <br /> <br /> Cookie really knows how to paint the tension in the cosmos. In the film's direction and screenplay, he gained the title "Magus" beyond the question. Kubrick's genius is like magic. The film world lost a great director when he died in 1999. Among his other best credits include: Eyes Wide Shut, 1999; Full metal jacket, 1987; Barry Lyndon, 1975; A Clockwork Orange, 1971; 2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968; Spartacus, 1960 and more. <br /> <br /> Torrentenses (Jack, Wendy's wife and Danny, their son) live in the winter over-the-hotel; Jack was appointed caretaker. His work to oversee the hotel's upkeep during the frosts for several months, until the ovallock opens its doors until spring. <br /> <br /> It moves to the Colorado Mountains for an icy summer vacation. <br /> <br /> This is an impressive part of the construction and architecture of the hotel. It owes the atmosphere to the dark, at the same time the "welcoming" climate itself. Homeoptions and furniture All the period (at the beginning of the 70s - early 80s), and the opening of the hotel in the opening sequence of the landscape is good. This allows you to enjoy the overkeeping approach, which is ignored and disassembled, leaving the hotel in the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> The introduction of Wendy and Danny's characters is a stroke genius. Don's "imaginative friend", Tony, and Jack's Drinking Story, the story that goes on in these nice and neat introductory scenes, you get the whole story of the past. There is no need to stretch the history of the past two hours; <br /> <br /> Kubrick looked at the beginning. <br /> The end day. Again, the hotel is happy when the mountains (at this time, the family with the tooth), the interaction between the amazing Jack and Danny, painted a very disturbing exchange. <br /> <br /> While the staff are coming out, you have the chance to see majestic fire sites, high cathedral ceilings and expensive decorations, dormants and crown molds in construction. "They did a good job! My favorite colors of pink and gold." <br /> <br /> This maze is pretty awesome. <br /> <br /> This maze is a commemoration of Larith, in which Minot Guardian of Crete. Jack Nicholson, Wendy and Danny Enter, when at the scale model of the maze and stares in the middle, it's a magic moment; Immediately telling you that there are huge powers in the house; Something bad is something wrong, already started. "If I did not have at least one hour to find my way I would not want to go there." (Hotel Manager) <br /> <br /> Scatman Cruthers, like Dick Halloran, is real and open for his performances. His smiles were natural and his performance was amazing. You may be sure that you are in the hotel, and the kitchen tour is taken with Wendy and "Dock". His description of "shining" Danny, like his conversation about Toni and the hotel, has been well received. It's ridiculous and honest. <br /> <br /> The mountaineering hotel is surrounded by cold winds behind the floating mountains from the warm roof. So the atmosphere of the film too. It refers to "hell from point to half" to talk; <br /> She played the character of Shelley Duval's Wendy Torrance. (So ​​if she played Olive Oyl!) It was honestly before I saw the film on the big screen in 1980, what did I do? "Oliv Oyl? * Lol * (Popeye was also released in 1980), but when I started the film, she took this film. In this finland view, it's her best performance ever since!" (Steve Martin's "Roxanne" ) /> <br /> Don 's broken arm; Toni; The history of the hotel; Danny. <br /> <br /> "You are not mentally", instead of relatives, and hotel The general layout of the show, you'll find in the early 3 scenes; the previous caretaker, Delbert Grady (Danny's many girls, formerly in the apartment in Tony's apartment, otel) Danny had signs, and he was frightened. br> They are heartfelt (haunted) and graphically how and where they killed In the physical way. <br /> <br /> Kubrick's Tony as an assistant, as a result of his arm, turned his father back to his body ... He was a "little boy living in my mouth." At the end of Danny's finger he was clearly visible and talked to Danny He spoke physically by Danny. I do not like in the book, I find out where Tonny is intended to be Danny's projection by Stephen King as an older boy trying to save his father. Kubrick left that little turn and Tony took it "... Danny ... over." <br /> <br /> The "Shower in the Shower" scenario made by Leo Beldon (who I could not get from other credits) was a bad and totally frustrating young man and Billy Gibson (who appears to be suffering from a lack of credit for the previous or previous works). It's dramatic and intimidating. Lying and scary. Nicholson sees himself in the mirror and sees the meat falling down on his hands; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jock rapidly moved from alcoholic smokers to a certified mad person from "trolling". The degradation of the mood of his character is carefully and fully documented by Kubrick. Jack's immediate friendship with Lloyd The Bartender (such as alcoholics, mental illness and drug addicts) loyalty plays the role of the NEED climate that he likes; That is, alcohol ... "My dog ​​that sniffs my hair." (Jack Torrance) in Jack, it's not Bourbon on the rocks, Jack has no charge. "Orders from home." (Lloyd The Bartender) Words Play Nice. <br /> <br /> When Jack finds "Jack"'s "screenplay" is no more than a page next to the same line of page that is typed in 8 or 9 different creative styles. When asked from the shadows, "How do you like it?" And screams with silver whirls and baseball bat in her hand ... so sharp. It's the point at which the whole situation gets messed up ... how much jack is in chaos. It offers a very scary, dramatic and strong presence. Danny's scenes from the hotel lobby filled with blood on the scene between Jack and Wendy, and the scene of this scene make a strong image of the film. <br /> <br /> "REDRUM" scene. Wow. What do i say Their young, troubled son stood up with a big knife and spoke in a very small voice, "REDRUM" and no mother completely emancipated by emotionally speaking? Although it does not understand, it is still scary as the 7th level of Hell. Everybody has something (and) mark (ed). <br /> <br /> When talking about memorable scenes <br /> <br /> Nicholson was embarrassed to strike a gun with an ax to his family. His statement-free line, "Heiress's Johnny!" Brightness is one of the most memorable scenes in a stroke and horror history. It also falls in horror film history. <br /> <br /> Ending? Kubrick's end completion. I felt pretty ending. There is no charm, no strong movement, no tired idiot ending for this film. Just perfection is perfect. <br /> <br /> In addition, I told you about the ultimate subject. <br /> Who took it? See what the kubrick has put. Rent it, see it, buy it. It's a classic in the genre of horror, and for good reason. <br /> * Keep me * ... Take this picture and sit in your Stephen King collection and take the "official" version of 1997, the Kiddie Division. It belongs. : This movie is rated at 9.98 from Finada :.
