Sometimes you have to look back to go forward. That's done 60's work. We must remember in the past. Past is part of the future. <br /> <br /> <br /> Great mix Gary J. Coppola. I see a great future. You deserve to nominate and win, the 60's best mixer of the year. <br /> <br /> The best short range of all times <br /> <br /> Thanks Ursula <br /> <br />
