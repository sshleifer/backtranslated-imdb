This is Eddie Murphy's ultimate man show which is his best. Just forget the nutty professor and the distinctive gentlemen, this is a real Eddie Murphy. His simulations of Mr. TT (he deals with homosexuals), Michael Jackson and other artists murderers. I also feel so daring to make fun of artists who are really celebrated at that time. <br /> <br /> My favorite family is where he plays at his annual BBQ with family and plays his drunken father and aunt bunny who comes from the stairs <br /> <br /> This show is the best medicine when you feel down! Do not be disappointed if you look at the sequel 'Raw'. It looks good but does not match with 'delirious'.
