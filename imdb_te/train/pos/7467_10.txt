David Aimes is a Rich Good-Face Guy who lives in New York City. When David's Spanish beauty has fallen for Sofia, her 'sleepy partner' Julie Giant is very jealous, she has spent David in her car and wants to be with him, and he wants to be with him, falling in love with Sophia, deciding to commit suicide by driving a bridge with David. David survives the crash, but remains with a bizarre face. He killed Julie. The thing is that David has these strange dreams (actually nightmares.) And flashbacks, some of which are not real and do not make sense to him. <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, Jason Lee, Noah Taylor perform good performance in this film. In the film they stopped different things about all the characters, like pleasure, sadness, anger, etc. Well. There is also a guest role in this movie from Steven Spielberg. <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky is a well-made, diverse, interesting and original image of it. It's not just a thriller, but it's a real mental thriller. The trailer for the movie is very good, but this movie is very different. It is very well directed and there are a couple of great scenes here. All in all, it's an enjoyable movie which should really be very attention. They have a lot of movies "they are dead if they die recently".
