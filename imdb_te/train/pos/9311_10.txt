This is the worst movie I have ever seen, which is also the best film. Science Fiction was the worst of the original film, what makes them fun! Line, "I did well with my dinosaur meat!" Perhaps the best quote! Also, the plot is something like a pot-induced dream. I can now imagine that the writers spent a long time walking and dancing with the dancing dance revolution, which included the following: Space ships came to the alien planet that was experiencing aliens and had medieval houses in it to protect a science team studying the planet. The best idea! In fact, the complete science fiction genuine movie checklist is fitting: the terrible acting of the space dinosaurs medieval times. <br /> <br /> So watch this movie, but do not buy it.
