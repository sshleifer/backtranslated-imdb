The movie is rich in Citizen Kane, Casablanca and Waterfront. Please convince Leno to make a sequel! Lenno and Martha are a comic duo with no likes from Abot and Costello. Chris Sarandon, Tom Noonan, and Randall's "Tex" Cobb will give you chills. Duffman's role as Buffon Often feast on Shakespeare's comedy days. And Climax. My Goodness, Climax. I will not destroy it for you, but it will blast death star to match it. If you can track this strongly found gem, buy it right away and buy it immediately. I am hoping for a special edition DVD these days.
