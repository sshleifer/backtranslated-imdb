This is one of the few movies I can see and over. If you have never seen it, give it a shot. Richard Dreyfus and Raoul Julia are awesome together, but while the film me amuses well, it reminds me of Julia's premature death. This is a good opportunity for terror and fear to sit back at international intrigue that many of us at this time laugh.
