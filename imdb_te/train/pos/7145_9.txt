The film was a great mix of adult actors alongside young actors, which would have been a long time in movies. Directing and editing was great. I can see the book I received from this book, which should be great. (I like it.) A blast to see Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voitt, and Tim Blake Nelson! Henry Winkler and Nathan Davies can not see enough, but they are fun when they are on the screen. Children are not good at camp. (As I said, I like it!)
