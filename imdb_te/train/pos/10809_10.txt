Russell, My Fay, is gorgeous in this film. But more than that, the film has a tremendous scope of human race and mourning. Everything from marriage to homosexuality is addressed and respected. The viewer realized that the patience of other humans provides a way to preserve humanity. Fairytale love story between Lachlan and Lilly. I'll play again and again with their scenes. Anyone in love can sympathize with these people. All the characters are cast and are well documented.
