Once again, I browse through the discounted video bin and picked up this movie for $ 4.88. Fifty percent of the films I find in the bin are pure garbage (I believe terrible) but half the time they are surprised. This film is better than I expected. <br /> This is not unique in this direction, but this story is surprising with some good thrills. <br /> <br /> For a thriller, this film has a surprisingly good nature. There is no bloody violence, no profanity, no nudity, no sex. Generally, all of these drawings require four elements. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br <br /> <br /> The PG rating is well-deserved - "F Word" has twice been used and "love interest has not improved, and the film is plot-heavy, and it's driven towards potentially good subcategories. Instead of developing chemistry, they are looking at their romantic attempts to ignore their negligent three-minute montage <br /> <br /> "Dream Machine" is not a gem, but it is good, pure entertainment. <br /> <br /> It is very durable - except for the cast of unknown people, especially the hym - but much more than you expect <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (from 10)
