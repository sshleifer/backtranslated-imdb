The memory of "The Last Hunt" is with me, and since I was seeing it in 1956 it was only 13 years old. At this time it is the current contradiction between the short and long term effects of greed, environment, and greed. This was related to the cinematic debate of the deepest and the most relevant in 1956. It's the most beautiful in the setting and the cinematography is amazing. The film will be remembered for me and my days.
