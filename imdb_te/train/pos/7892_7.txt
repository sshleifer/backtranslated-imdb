<br /> <br /> The film is 11 years since 2001 in 2001, and is actually 11 years old. John Doe (Jack, from Part 5, also gives a hint of his own), which he used to bring more children to come to Freed Elm Street. Freddie did not get his wishes, but he also got his daughter back to Elm Street. As she learns what is going on, she and other children decide to kill FREDDY once and for all. We can also see some of the strange themes of FreDDY. <br /> <br /> Rachel Thalle is connected to a series of nightmares. Many people hate this movie, but I liked it.It tried to bring the FreDDY doing work with his instrument ... COMDEY and scary in this series. This film is a comdey sore to really talk. It's not wrost in the series, part 2 still has. <br /> <br />
