I first saw the idea of ​​this film, first I saw the trailer. Einstein is always one of my heroes and me to see his film, gracious, fun, little mad intellectual cinema. <br /> <br /> This story is a pure fantasy but delightful. An auto mechanic fell in love with a beautiful woman named Einstein's niece. With the help of the Four Fairy Godfathers of Physics, Ed Catherine embarks on a quest to win the heart. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with great characters and delightful sweet and daffy performances. Walter Matu plays Einstein with an unfortunate role; Cupid with slide rule. Tim Robbins is wonderfully fascinating as Ed and Meg Ryan plays a step above her normal rom-cam level. Stephen Fry "RRRatman" and Ryan's fiancée; <br /> <br /> The movie has fallen below radars, but it is a pleasant treasure that never thrives with recurring views. It has the first-rate writing and performances and a delicate dish that is less than the sensitive world.
