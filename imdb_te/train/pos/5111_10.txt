Does anyone know what kind of pick up John T. Drock? I look in the middle of the last 70s. This film is my favorite as well as my wife. This was the first memorable film we saw as a married couple. This pickup was of interest to me as it was the first truck I took, and recently it was another. I have to act in the film. Music is awesome, and acting is great. Where was the woman who played the role of John's aunt? Is John Stunt Double having a scene on the tower even when he is almost falling? Mustaang also made Debra Drive in the show any year. It looked like a 60 model. Thank you,
