Robert Altman should not make such a film, but the fact that he did- and it turns out to be a reasonably good and hard-wound thriller in the Paperback-tradition of Grisham thrillers- which shows a versatile tendency. Unfortunately, he is not always very successful, or at least it's not the first thing his director is the checklist: in gingerbread man he is actually working. A worst advocate was caught with a disappointing low-class woman, and then the woman was a very frustrating, irreverent man who had no connection with the twists and slugs in the plot. And Artman really was one of these "I saw seeing from there coming!" Ends, or such semi-traditional thriller. <br /> <br /> But unusually, Altman is able to catch some of the best behavior, or accidentally coke it from a very well-casting ensemble of a small-town Georgian environment. Savannah is probably a large hurricane and wetland and marshes and rains so that it is soaked and muddy and moist, because the atmosphere (if not the best of skillful skill, sometimes it's good and sometimes good for Altman). Hence the weather is really strong, but sometimes the sometimes (sometimes) Werner Kenneth Brang, a lawyer from Embeth Davitsz, was caught by Brandon, and Robert Downey Jr. (he was not good?) Was a personal detective in the job of Brang. Have I neglected Robert Duvall, such an indelible impression, to stop the bad-vibes in the film within five minutes of the screen? <br /> When the plot is a bit weak or authentic (advocate divorce, bitter claws, innocent and goofy children), but at the same time I saw Altman that something glamorous in something, something darker than some of the other Grisham works something. If it is not entirely master, it still works with its limited terms-what-will-happen-the next secret-south-noir.
