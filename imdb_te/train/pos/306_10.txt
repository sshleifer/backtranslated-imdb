<br /> <br /> In 1982, Europe and the obscure beloved monument was kept. I've seen almost twenty years later on the tape ... Bogdanovich has a genuinely hearty sensitivity to his characters and a kind of sympathetic graciousness to feel. Excellent comedians and actors, good lines and pretty good editing for everyone. I laughed and smiled all the time. Sometimes we do all the time. 0. Go and get it.
