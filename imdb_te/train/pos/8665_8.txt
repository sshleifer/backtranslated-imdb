I accidentally eliminated this title with the Grindhouse Volume. 1 collection of pure euro-trash movies. But this film has a good stamp of approval and should qualify for better transfer than what is there. Stupidity is not it ... it's satisfying! I was not surprised to see this film ... Sergio Martino did not make this film? It has everything for her signature and Eddede Phenchech (she does not know anything but she gets a good comic in Hostel II). Deep-cross and triple-cross underline and cement strained in the second from the start of the film to the leak van Klef at the end of the second. Would this person go to Italy to finally get to his ability, or will the studio slip this person? In addition to Lee's more recognizable images, it should be tried in size of film-telescopes, and Sergio Leone has set his epic level in America in Once Upon a Time (in the 1/4 budget) what it has turned out to be. So refreshing, it should be taken during the day in the home and should be prepared for a bed afternoon
