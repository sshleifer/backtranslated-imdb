The WHITE SUIT is a man who, like all kinds of jack, takes a thick impression on both labor and capital. Alec Guinness is a scientific genius - but an extraordinary man (he never gained a university degree ... the offender in a college laboratory ... the risk). He leads himself in various industrial laboratories in the textile industry. When the film began, he was in the company of Michael Gaff and tried to impress him by showing his father-in-law (Cecil Parker), a ship-decorating company run by him in a golf (in a momentous moment). When the dinner with Parker and Parker's daughter (Jon Greenwood), Goff receives a message about unexpected big budget issues. <br /> <br /> Guinness Parker goes to work at the company and repeats the same ideas he has done with the golf - but Parker also learns. Greenwood discovered that Gwyn was working, persuading Parker to continue (but legally) to continue the experiments. As a result: Guinness and his assistant have clearly discovered how to make a synthetic fiber so that it can continuously change electronic bonds in its atomic construction, so that the fiber is tactical for good (for all targets and purposes). <br /> <br /> When he saw the ginne to the great man, but he did Whenever he describes them, they turn to him, and if they have permanent clothes for everyone, they do not need new clothes! Soon the Parkers are headed by fellow garment tunes (Guff, Ernest Thysinger - a wonderful acting, and Howard Marion-Crawford) <br /> <br /> In the end, Guinness's science will be beaten as well as greedy, with the greenwood in his corner (even though Parker is sympathetic to him), and Guinness attempts to get the news of his discovery. But he did not see his account error and end the movie And we are predicting that one day he will remove his invention. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful comedy, but the argument for crushing is difficult to make at one time (in fact, threads to high temperatures to actually unify the ends of the elements He will have to heat. If the owner gets fat (or the contract owner gets thin) do we believe that people only want a costume dress? What are fashion modifications and new styles? <br /> <br /> This is not a science paper but about labor and capital in the modern industry An image is fantastic but the queries I mentioned to keep me in trouble about the validity of Guinness' discovery repression
