<br /> <br /> James Stewart is a deeply deeper part of Chip Hurdstie's role, bringing the hard-working and dedicated FBI agent. His life in the bureau is mutually exclusive with his family life, not all is rosy. His wife (Vera Miles is a fantastic character) fear her job dangerous nature, and they are also separated at one time; Chip's best friend and fellow agent Sam Cradal (Murray Hamilton) was killed with a gun; Chip, Mike, Enlists in Marines during World War II. By all means, the family will continue with courage and respect. <br /> Action scenes are very exciting and the film works effectively with semi-documentary style. And music by Max Steiner; Faith, courage and integrity. <br /> <br /> This country is grateful to the men and women of the Fb and yes, Edgar Hoover. If Mr Hoover's vigilance type is observed, we have escaped from 9/11, and we face the offenses committed by children and crimes.
