It's a fantastic part of the best of two seasons. If the right horror down for a change, way way than the average MOH episodes, it's one thing. A man's wife is almost dead, in which he died in a tragic car accident driving. His airbag worked, she did not. She does not have much chance to live up to her noticeably (great makeup btw), and full skin without grafting. But, in the coma she was dying, brought back by modern technology, and for a few minutes to die, her ghost was a very venerable spirit. Of course there is a massacre, and some very Gary murders, and some very sexy scenes. When you ask, what you ask? Well, too, because this baby is all in it, and with a very sarcastic ending, most viewers should leave a smile. I also loved to direct Rob Schmidt's (wrong turn), he had a great nude for horror. Excellent episode, this is one I am definitely buying.
