God! Zorro is the subject of many films like Tarzan, and the title role is probably a number of actors. <br /> <br /> This serial is one of my personal favorites, one of the top 5 sound serials as mentioned in the past. Surprisingly, it was a product that started in the year 1939 irrigation. * During the production of '39, Zorro was well known as the Pulp Literary and Film Role. The film opens with a small foot note about the Mexican fighting history for independence from the European monarchy of Spain. This story invites comparison with the American revolutionary war. <br /> The story focuses its attention on the mythical province of San Mendoletio and its 'Council'. It was addressed by Benito Juarez in the Mexican Republic of the new gold mine. Gold shipments should be taken to Mexico City. <br /> <br /> Dan Francois Uncle Diego set up a patriot team to work as a defensive force for speed and golden armor. <br /> <br /> Suddenly a knife of knives cut out with a dark knife, the trademark 'Z' is the face of the evil man, henceforth he delivered to him. Don Francisco announced his wardrod Ramon (William Corpson) with his dead breath, Zorro, his nephew in the Los Angeles City. He tries to tell the true identity of Dan del Oro, but before the statement ends. <br /> <br /> Diego has a large reception at the Hassenenda of Don Francisco, where he is disappointed with Diane Ramonescorso dan Francesco). <br /> <br /> After that, Diego and Ramon are away to meet the charity charity. "Who will they lead us to die with Don Francisco?" When asked, "Zorro, we're Zorro's fighting legion!" Well there is a big battle with the Legion, now with all the gray color, with masks and capes, protecting the gold train. <br /> <br /> Then Zorro seems to be trapped in an accident that was created by a man intended for the convoy, and whenever you know the cliffhanger end of Chapter One. <br /> Wow! It is a lot of writing for a chapter, but like most other serials, the start is a long and laid down story line is a lot of ground. <br /> <br /> Zorro's fighting LEGION has all the stuff done for the top cliffhanger action. We are not an evil leader who is experiencing difficulties among different groups. There are suspicions about who is behind the mask of 'Dan del Oro'. We have soldiers, rebels, insurgent Indians and legions. <br /> <br /> In short, it is safe to say that some of these serials, then some people are getting ready. <br /> <br /> Those who do not think any astrologers will influence the astrologers. Is it different or unique? <br /> <br /> In all, playing the drama and action on the screen has a more elaborate and exciting musical score. In the opening theme chapter one can be found in the flamenco guitar composition in Cantina. <br /> <br /> There is another feature that still has many other sets of fighting legions saga. That is, the film is not only a heroic musical theme, but it also sports literature sports, yes, Legionairres! We hear early credits and in many chapters they sing! It really works well and adds to the feelings we receive from the view. <br /> <br /> When the first time in our local television (Sierca 1955) showed, the gang was immediately recovered from Reed Hadley Rocket Scud, TV series Captain Braddock. Mr. Hadley has a very distinct, deep voice. *** He played the character well. His dress and especially extended mask was very good and very functional. <br /> There is a little slip there. While Juraj was at 18 at the time (1824), when he was probably the greatest single in the history of Mexico, he did not achieve such a significance as Benito Juarez (Carleton Young), a small manoracan, for the San Mendelito Council. <br /> <br /> His inclusion in the story probably portrayed Paul Muni in the lead role of Warner Bros. Jury's release of the year. <br /> This is the top 5 soundtrack, but my favorite zorro movie. <br /> The great harvest of the best flight movie that year, with the WIND with the WIND, MR.Smith Washington, Citadel, Juraj, The <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Once again, Not to climb national importance, Mass and Men, ONE Million and Zenobia, OZ Winner, 1850, 25 years later. Also, political subdivisions are called 'provinces' in the story. In fact they are called 'States'. Like the United States of America, they are known as the United States of Mexico for their republic to the south of the border. <br /> <br /> Reed Hadley Some 'A' pictures in which his great sound voice was exploited for good effect. Watch and Hear in the House on 92rd Street (1945) and GuadalCanal DIARY (1945).
