I loved this exit Republic Serial! The story is one of the best I've seen! Even tough, the image quality is not the best, but OK. Fencing in this serial is also a bit bad, but not terrible. They should just learn some more. The story that I said is very good! Who are you in Dan del Oro sitting there? Theme music is amazing! This is the same person who provided music for the version of Zorro's Walt Disney, working with fired legion music. Costumes and buildings are very good. Zorro is really cool and legions! I highly recommend this serial. Buy it! <br /> <br /> I will play Reid Hadley Zorro. He is funny, smart and brave! Mark: 6.
