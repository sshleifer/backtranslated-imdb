In fact, the Japanese pop / rock star is the only one in the movie - the use of drugs, warehouse shoot-ups, 'Matrix' esc bullet dodging, future city with a mix of Asian species, and a single vampire. And what is the 'moon of the moon' and more. Even though these things are combined, like the weekly campus B-film, the 'Moon Child' pulls with it, but some of the expected bumps and hitchches. <br /> <br /> A scenery, absolutely independently, is not a smooth transition from the scene, but also the next twists and borders, giving clients the lives of characters and scraping at the real plot. The film, however, turned the story into a vibrant community, fought with gangsters and vampires, instead of sugar, love, reliability and betrayal. <br /> <br /> Hyde red vampire 'key' is wonderful, giving depth to character and gaek's excessive enthusiastic acting 'show,' a friend of Keith's friendship. Lee-ho Wong also shines as a bright 'Sun', he's friendship with a grown-up shoe. The story revolves around these characters and their friends and families in different periods of life, and simple friendship can easily turn into grief and betrayal. Unrealistic and distinctive effects are only for showcasing, the film is never in the film, it is related to the most popular Asian singers. Super stars like their actors make their flaws, and their characters. The film is rarely frustrated, and ends where it goes, after a little jumping about. 'Moon Child' is rather enjoyable, fun at times, and very touching: it is definitely worth your time!
