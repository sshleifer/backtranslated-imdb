After reading tons of good reviews about the film, I decided to take a spin (I bought on DVD, so I was "spin" pun ... I'm Dirk). For what initially I should be a good movie, I was expecting for the perfect set up (along with some quotes I've heard on various Wu Tang albums). But the story I heard was great, so it is speculative. Every time I saw a character (except Lizard). Plus, the cold character in the middle of the movie will die only. Well, the plot is not very good but at least is the good Kung-fu right? Wrong. The fights are very low and very small. All of the different styles sanctioned are pretty cool but I wish the fights were longer. I will see Lizard runs and some crazy Ish on the walls but this does not happen. I see the Centipede make some hard-eyed, but never happened. I wanted to see Scorpion in the movie more than 7 minutes, but never happened. In short, it happens a lot. The combat is pretty beautiful. This film is not a joke because it has a story, it's not good.
