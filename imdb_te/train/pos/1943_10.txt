I have the opportunity to see the film twice at the 2006 Moving Picture Festival in Birmingham, Alabama. <br /> <br /> When I think about the films shown in the festivals, I think they are often more admirable and momentum. Feel the elaborate student project. There is nothing wrong with these kinds of projects of course, and I enjoyed the unique styles of independent films, but sometimes I would like to see a more basic approach to filmmaking independently. By "mainstream" I mean more like a movie made for a national release - in other words, a movie that you see in a simple movie theater. <br /> <br /> Writing, directing, cinematography, casting and acting is all in Pro movie completely. There is usually nothing independently about this film. As an amateur director, I'm always looking for movies, stimulating me to keep me stressed and hard to continue my career. It is one of these films. When I see the Big Bad Swim, my inspiration level is amazing. I felt like my adrenaline kicking. I was attracted to every aspect of this product because I thought this way. I am excited to the theater and am ready to start writing a long lasting project. When a film made me feel so, I was really good. This is the first feature project project from Isha Seton and I wanted it to be my project. For me, it is very rare. <br /> Watch this movie. It is beautifully filmed and directed, and casting is amazing. Paget Brewster provides a very believable and preferred performance. She has a quality about herself, an attraction, which really attracts you and keeps you focused on her at any time on her screen. She thinks that you personally feel her friend. This is a gift. I think the industry really missed by not using more of her acting abilities. Jefffron and Jess Weisler also made top-notch jobs. I can not say good things about Big Bad Swim. I look forward to future projects from all those involved in it.
