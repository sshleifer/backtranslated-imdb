Over the weekend I saw two movies, one "call" and the other "vaxt". Both films are made in "Bollywood", but they are different from the world. The basic difference is the story and the director. Vipul Shah is one of the best comedy Hindi films with an unlikely mark of "Ankhen". His cast of Charextrous is perfect. The story clearly taken from a Gujerati play is amazing, the treatment is amazing with some exceptions. The first thing Bollywood director has done in Bollywood is the music director and the man (in this case Madik Malik) was responsible for druming six songs to fulfill his contract. Hence a good director like Vipul Shah should use the finesse to appease them, which is not enough to get enough of all these numbers. The music director of this movie is clearly clear and clearly apparently clear. None of the songs have any melody and they are apparently inappropriate for the story's story, rather than the background of the background music and the Western version of Bharat-dancing. Bachchan and Akshay Kumar are good actors in the role and role played by father and son. His stunt scenes are clear. A good director will be with him in good actors and he wants to wait until it comes to good news in this super movie. Then we do not have a cheaply unclassified filmmaker like Shahrukh Khan, who is a little less like a dancer like "kal" and has a great deal of art in the arts, and they round themselves with the edge of the art, before the word gets invested. Bollywood Mudras for suspected audiences who do not receive Bollywood Chanchi's "FilmForce" awards. Most of them are in the media.
