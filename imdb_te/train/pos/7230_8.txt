"The Invisible Mouse" is a joyous and diverse Tom & Jerry cartoon. This is a simple cat / mouse chases and battles, but this time in a different way. Jerry accidentally falls in an invisible ink bottle and he is very happy about it because he prepares "surprise" for Tom, threatens him, tortures him and confuses him. <br /> <br /> If we are unrealistic, it is also very cool and funny to see what we can not see: Jerry disappears. It's amusing to see things lifting in the air without seeing who's doing it (who we know who's right, who are we?) - That's like things like their own life or almost a matter of ghosts. While he does not appear, Jerry is equally entertaining to eat some candies and fruits. <br /> <br /> Tom is at this time some of the best jokes of Jerry when he looks at the shadow of Jerry and killed him and tried to slam him with a pan to make Tom. And Jerry "missed me". <br /> <br /> Tom, if you drink milk of chocolate, is happy with his face. <br /> <br /> Overall the basic ingredients needed for this classic classic cartoon are: humor, entertainment, entertainment and very good art.
