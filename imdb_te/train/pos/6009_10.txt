Mark Freakt Mark, as a radical vagrant in college. Marc accused of killing a policeman during campus riots, who flees to the desert. He stole a small plane at the local airport, and it will fly himself. <br /> <br /> Once flying in the desert, Mark scares a car from the air. Drew a young woman, and Mark sees her in the plane. Mark's plane flew several times a little, causing a duck duck or hitting. When he lands, he gets acquainted with Darry, who is fascinated by Mark's Air Hainics. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After the hourly intervals, Mark and Daria make love in nude and sand. But, with Marc, he learns that he keeps the law. <br /> <br /> Mark and Daria's brief conversation is very sharp, because it is full of romantic growth. <br /> <br /> Zabriski Point is the Error Head in the initial 70 years. Both of these films include rambling, vague quality, complex meanings and characters. Because his character is in the film, Freckett is personally neglected. A few years after Zabrisky Point, Frechet robbed a bank in real life. At the time of his imprisonment, Mark died of an abominable death. He was killed by weight of 150 lb and fell on him while he was in weightlifting. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this film is the amazing cinematography and special visual effects. The incredible, slow motion scenes and intellectual stroke of the ruins in the air after the explosion. Even though the film failed to become an easy rider, Zabriski Point still resonated with the anti-70s culture. I recommend those who love the avant-garde films that show the rebellion of the young rebellion in the early 70s.
