<br /> <br /> Repulsion and Rosemarys in The Termant Polanski returns to the themes of the madness and madness that explored such a tremendous impact on the baby. <br /> <br /> Swan Ngivvist, who is responsible for Bergman's most beautiful films, does not do justice to himself here - <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is trademark polansis - dark, breeding, unwanted. I was disappointed in some cases of cinematography in the film, as the film was one of the things that really impressed me. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really casts the movie is acting down. Polanski is not exactly a bad actor, but he seems to have bitten more than chew with Trelkovsky difficult character. Some of the supporting actors are mainly Melvine Douglas landlord and Shelley Winters, but others are weak and unfortunate. <br /> <br /> There are some good moments in the dark comedy in this movie. Anyone who has seen Fearless Vampire Killers knows that Polans is definitely a good comedian. Nevertheless, moments are also becoming a ridiculous and dangerous. <br /> <br /> The sudden (and somewhat unexplained) 'variant' of Treklovsky is likely to grow in the psyche-dramatic journey ahead of eyebrow eyebrows from what a powerful moment must be. An enjoyable and intriguing experience, if slightly too languorous for its own good. There are quite unexpectedly chilling moments and constant uncomfortable and backward atmospheres, although the film is very good, and it has not been able to successfully achieve the mark. <br /> <br /> However, today, a 'ok' Polanski movie is still better than other 'good' films. Definitely worth a watch, just do not expect it blown away.
