A wonderful and accurate picture ... McGovern takes great pains to research and write and pays off it. <br /> Once again, McGuvern is brought back to Christopher Ecclestone once again, however, it is not afraid to tell the truth. He played a major role in the role played in Hillsborough. I recognized this film as perfect, well acted and well presented as Hillsboro and I praised McGavern for his sharp endless writing. It's fine and my hat belongs to the writer, actors, production group. A great picture!
