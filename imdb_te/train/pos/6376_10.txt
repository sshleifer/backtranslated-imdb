Do not break the song every twelve minutes - if you have sons or daughters who love actions, adventure, plot and imagination - then you have a Disney movie! My sons loved this movie every minute, and I have to admit that I laughed so many times throughout the film. There is no absolute song in the fabulous story, and the characters are all lovely and recognizable in their own right. It's a beautifully painted scene and one of Disney's "classics" should be left due to its continuous excitement!
