The darkest hour in America's history was the war in America; A war against brother and family against brother and family, and still has not yet been cured, and is never in all probability. And beyond any historical significance, there is a personal disagreement behind the great conflict that creates the emotional impulse that any participant in any war can take. This is a case where you want to give a human perspective, provided by director Ang Lee, 'Ride with the Devil', a civil war play in which he focuses on a wide range of war scenarios, and one of the bloodiest chapters along the way, Lawrence, Kansas, Quantrille His riders, on the scandal raid managed to include a test, he con If succeeding in a fairly impartial view from the Federal Point of View. <br /> <br /> In 1863, the union effected Kansas State, and confederate loyalists in neighboring Missouri borders, considered by the provincial Northerners to be any 'regulatory' confederate forces. And when conditions start out really hot on their hometowns, Jack Bull Chies (Skeel Ulrich) and Jake Rodell (Tobey Maguire) form their own team and get in trouble, allowing the union to be damaged. Jack Bull and Jake do not like war and kill the war; But they stand that they believe they are right. <br /> <br /> Other people include men like their young pit MacKayzon (Jonathan Rice-Mayors) who use the conflict for personal gain and express their own violent nature by causing a number of violent attacks by unnecessary cruelty. . Therefore, it is time for Jack Bull and Jake, as well as many of them, to test the credibility and moral judgment seriously; At one time their spirits will be in the nature of blood. <br /> <br />] Director Angle Leigh depicts his story for all his films through a chaotic and subtle test of traditions, cultural and cultural people and moral attitudes of time. In doing so, Lee has at least some awareness of his audience beyond the original story, and ultimately he provides a deep understanding of the motivating impulse of his characters and the play they are engaged in. The effects of the class distinction (`sense and sensibility '), respect and code, (` The Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon') or all the above mentioned errors ("The Ice Storm"), a father and his daughters ("Eat Drink Man Woman" "), And Lee takes his pictures to human level. This film is no exception; (As he has appeared in all of his films), Lee delivers his story with a breathtaking cinematography ("The Ice Storm" by Frederick Elms in this movie), and his guiding poetry. This is a special leaf touch, and adds a wider, reflective feel to the narrative of one of his most memorable themes. <br /> <br /> <br /> Jake, Taube Maguire is a sense of youthful innocence at the beginning of the film that is effectively contrasted with maturity, as he later develops the story, and tells his character. In particular, Maguire responded to the events that revolved around him and reacted confidently, which adds the credibility of the entire film and emphasizes the reality of the show: the news that killed him and his death in various conflicts and wars; The ethical nature committed to the encounters of those who meet him; Betrayal, because the nature of controversy is almost normal; And faith and beliefs which he and his colleagues are adamantly clinging. This is achieved by Magarer's performance, and this is not a small achievement. It is, however, the type of study, the poor performance often taken for granted, which is unfortunate; <br /> <br /> Skit Ulrich Jack Bull and Jewel (in her motion picture early) Sue Lee becomes an attractive show. Shelley. It stands out in a significant supporting role for Jonathan Rice-Meyers, who brings the evil of Christopher Walken-like evil by Jeffrey Wright, however, Daniel Holt, and Pitt as a cooler for his role. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is James Cavizel (Black John), Simon Baker (George Claude) Tom Wilkinson (Orton Brown), John Alice (Quantrill), John Judd (Otto Roell) and Kathleen Warfel (Mrs. Chile) . Civil war will have an open injury on the country forever; But hopefully, as time passes, filmmakers like Ang Lee and 'Ride With the Devil' will eventually close criticisms and encourage healing through the intentions of the films. In the light of recent events, it is very important worldwide. The movie is a powerful medium; It is educational and entertaining, and maybe most future filmmakers like Ang Lee, embrace and encourage the sense of unity through the delicate depiction of events and attitudes. 8/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do,
