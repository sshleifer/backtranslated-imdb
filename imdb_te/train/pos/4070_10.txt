I know anime. I'm a lot before it became a national phenomenon; Before I came to know most of the Dragon Ball Z, I liked it. And as I told you, let me tell you about me, tell me: From all the animes I've seen, the Castle in Sky is the best. It's clear people are the best of the spirited ones, but I'm really disagreeing. Many people know about the film because it's an Assamese award; It's not an exaggeration - I showed Princess Mononoke and Sky in Castle, I see only the Spirited look, and the second is the three. Personally, I did not think it was comparable to Prince Mononoke until I finally saw in the Red Fort. I still think that both are better before, but in the Sky in the castle it is equally easy; In many ways, there are the main elements of the monolithic castle. In any case, if you look at the same spirited one, and think that it is Miyazaki's best film, be ready to move your land.
