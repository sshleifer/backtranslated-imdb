This was one of my favorite shows when I first started looking at this. Melissa Joan Hart is very funny and talented and so is the star of the aamats and other characters and the show Salem cat, he is very funny. Sabrina is the youngest in high school in accordance with Mobit's life in the first few seasons in my opinion. They are very ridiculous, highly entertaining and many ... good. When they introduce the cause of Brad and Dreamer I'm not a fan of when I too started to like Valerie, but they're the problem they're only in for a season. You have to keep at least new people. I did not like Josh, he was a couple, I liked Harvey, but he disappeared. And they got rid of the Libby! It would have been wonderful if you had been with you in seven years. And Mr. Craft had got married to him and jelda, as well as getting married! Sabrina then moved her home from home and moved to Roxy / Miles / Morgan's home. I dislike the people of this thesis, it really does not seem like they liked Sabrina. Sabrina seemed to lose her charm and stuff, and the aunamas get out of her life and they are stupid story lines. I kind of stopped looking at it for a while and returned the old back runs and I was like whoo-hoo! LOL. I must say I have been absolutely horrible for the past few seasons. They got rid of the in-laws who sucked for a big part of the show. Suddenly she allows those two freeloaders to move to nice home when they treat like dirt. And now she's working on some magazine shop so they're putting loads of guest guest stars into the show, if they are some kind of ruins in every episode. The program really really went downhill and lost its glitter. I saw the last episode. It had covers in it (Zelda was reduced to a candle) and she would marry but she ended up with Harvey. I wanted to know what happened. The only thing I can say is my review and the only thing I have been self-attractive by seven years is the Salem Cat.
