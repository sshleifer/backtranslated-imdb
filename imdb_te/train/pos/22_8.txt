If you go fast through terrible singing, you will find a classic fairy tale below. Christopher Walken is very ridiculous and surprisingly good. His trademark style, which plays well for the puzz in the boots, works well. Other actors are in good shape. I found any terrible fake or awkward acting. Especially the king appears to be a real turning point, and I wonder if he should be. I can not remember the original story. Special effects are typical of the eighties, but they are not at least fake, like some kind of charge on the computer today. Overall, I recommend this film for the kids in the heart of the kid and the elderly.
