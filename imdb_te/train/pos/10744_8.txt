Events of September 11, 2001 do not require extra human interest in the shape of a rookie firefighter or two French brothers. It's good to leave it in my eyes. I think directors tried very hard, perhaps the day events were a background for a hero. <br /> This is a mandatory view to shoot these events. At the right time, feature filmmakers are in all the right places, from which the other footage from which they shot down.
