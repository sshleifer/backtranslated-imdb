Chevy & Chang's Next Movie (1980) Chevy Marin and Tommy Chang is the second film to star in. People who love smokers are now roommates. They live in a condemned building looking for more smoke and looking for ways to lay out all day. But cheek is one of "responsibility". He is a job and a steadfast girlfriend. One day, Cheech receives his loft, so he tries to get out of the house from Chang. Another problem arises, Cheech's brother "Red" (Chic another character) is in town and wants to hang with him. Firguring that he would kill two birds with a stone, Cheek Pax Chong and Red. What kind of adventures can get into Chong and Red? Does Chech get his instinct? How much does Chong leave without tobacco? <br /> <br /> Tommy Chang takes direct success for the sequel. He had some experience in UP UP IN SMOKE after doing some useless work. Not funny but the first film. But Chech and Chang fans will enjoy it. After Nice DREAMS. <br /> Recommended.
