In a small film festival in Guanajuato, Mexico, I gave a performance for the film Motion Picture. One of the producers was there and gave a brief introduction. Film rolled and I was shocked from the first shot: a long continuous shot of a future Paris in spectacular black and white. <br /> I'm not going to go with the details' reason for watching the movie value. The science fiction story may have found average for many ... it's really good for me. The action is great, the camera is everywhere fly and I am free to understand everywhere. Things can be accomplished beautifully so you can not or can not see it. Cast performance is good, no one in my opinion tip the wrong note. <br /> <br /> Now the animation that I find looks awesome. See 3D graphics 2D A BW comic book brought life. The background details give it more shape as handmade (I'm sure, but the angle of change you see in depth). <br /> <br /> The producer at screening talked about the work behind this movie: 7 years! The director, she said, is amazing, but he is very novice because he is just a small movie in his CV. So, many people had genuine faith. They started their own studio from Scratch and faced the challenge they brought on them. <br /> Do not miss this. I think you will not regret it ... Maybe Richard Linkelter is the final look of this film I was better at him.
