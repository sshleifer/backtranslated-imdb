It should be very hard not to wipe into this gem of a movie. (I saw hundreds of Hindi and Bollywood movies). Actors, beautiful settings, locations and surroundings, depicting deep emotions, sweet songs (especially the voice of Udit Narayan's song, my favorite) - everything is just lovely. The human (incomplete) element is also dramatic, creating some drama, and running the plot, as well as a heartfelt resolution. Alok Nath was such an outstanding actor, opening the emotions of the characters he portrayed, and he was almost stolen from the young stars. I would highly recommend this film to anybody who loves the original love - the best of them beyond the best of love - one of the best films in Hindi or even!
