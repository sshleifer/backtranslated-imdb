I have a Celestial Area 3 DVD of Five Vannes, they have done a super job. <br /> <br /> This story is pretty straightforward, already said, so I do not upload it again. It's too much to buy the movie, and they have to say that the scenes of the fight that do not disappoint. The only problem is that they appear to be a bit few and far between and rehearsal. Bruce Lee can take a lot of time and drink tea at the same time! All kicks and punches come with all the important "typewriter" clicks and airy "whooshes", which is very fun though it is very fun! <br /> <br /> I will give this movie to B + Not good but great. In a way I could have been that bit better. Golden Swallow, a decade ago was the good story and the best work by the same director.
