A picture of beauty is difficult to explain. Perhaps it is a lack of excessive speech, perhaps possibly a stellar soundtrack, or it may be Meena Mumari's feet, but it's a pleasure to see this film again. I have never seen another Indian film I have ever seen and compete for its perfection to any country.
