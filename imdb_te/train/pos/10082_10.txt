The image is really sharp, unique and amazing. The story is in the universe between the good, the evil and the middle world war. The most important thing is that its rating is wrong, misleading, and ridiculous. Blockbuster is rated as an X rated movie. The fact is that it is closer to G than the PG and the kids who read clear and simple subtitles.
