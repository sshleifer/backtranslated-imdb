Start saying "War, Inc." is not everyone's tea cup. But it's very enjoyable (and if you think - "Oh, worst"). <br /> <br /> In the film, the comic figure is not clear at all - this is Very sensitive (Tamerlane tanks, dry cleaning service, etc.), and it turns the turns and turns in the plot. Only one, but I can not compare this to "Grosse Point Blank", because it is different. John Cusack - I can not say he is "wonderful" or "wise" - but he is good. On the other hand, his sister (Jon Cusack) was awesome in her lines and comic moments - even though she was rare in the film (I said about Ben Kingsley). <br /> <br /> Marisa Tommy plays the role of an acceptable reporter, and manages to remove it. Hilary Duff was so much appreciated for her role as the Central Asian pop star Yonika Babyya. Duff's actress is very noticeable and she does a good job (even though her voice is a tad unreal). <br /> <br /> The whole film is "entertaining". It does not have a special storyline, and it's very smart at times, but it has a mini message. I have a watch value.
