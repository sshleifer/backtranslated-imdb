I love old Burt Reynolds movies. They're ridiculous and better than they combine every other movie. They also stopped making films after "Cannonball Run 2", but how can they know that I have not seen anything good? This image is good. Burt Reynolds dress up as a chicken and wanders around a lot in a racecar, and is in the hands of Anderson, which is very hot in many ways. In Burt and in, those days! I've used this magazine containing Andersen in the statement for the toxic cleaner. I definitely liked that statement! Plus there is a part of the film about something stroker Ace (Burty R.) doing at the racetrack at the racetrack, and a man in the audience shows his butt up to show its frustration and it shows! I passed away almost the night when I was too tight laddy! If you find this movie, rent it out! Then do not see another movie again because I said just now: no point.
