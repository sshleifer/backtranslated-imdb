A 2001 sweetheart film featuring some similarities to the hit "My Sassy Girl", but wasted a lot of time. The biggest praise is to go to two leads. Ha-Neil Kim is sweet and quirky, sang-wu kwan attractive and rebellious. The chemistry between these two is very good. <br /> <br /> Director Kaiyong-Haiyong Kim uses some CG-inserts to dazzling visuals and also offers impressive fighting scenes that shine with the Sung-wu Quan. I'm very good at over here than overtered "volcano high." And that boy's future - that looks, fighting techniques, and a romantic lead. <br /> <br /> Well, I have to give it a little: nice picture. My rating: 7/10
