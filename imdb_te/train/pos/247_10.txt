I like this film because they are not killing fun but to save what they like! Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom played Nude and Joe. It has some quick unseen scenes but is more appropriate than the rest. The language is very soft and sometimes it does not even know. Because these films are out, they do not mean vulgar killers. I hope people see this movie and learn about the periods of history in this way. One thing that surprises me about the film is that their inspiration from Ned's book has inspired them! People also recognize them from their armor. I hope to see this film and hope that I will be interested in it.
