I saw Anvin Fisher in Bravo. What a wonderful image and incredibly young man. This film should be seen as anyone who deals with how to overcome childhood abuse and abandonment as an adult. Denzel Washington puts the youngest in an outstanding performance as well as the role of Anvivon Fischer. Kleenex alert - Feel good and tear. He had a very heartfelt moment when he finally met his mother, he was 2 months old. One of the most courageous when he stands up to his abusive mother and sister. I saw this film in Bravo in 2008 and I only want to know it years ago. An image that is definitely worth adding to my DVD collection.
