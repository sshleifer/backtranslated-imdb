Human Tornado (1976) is a better film than ever before. The director knows what works for Rudy Ray Moore as an actor and to work with him. It's a fun movie with more technically sound and starring. Performers do not take themselves too seriously and it seems that everyone is going to joke and stream around this time. Rudy Ray Moore was more relaxed in front of the camera and was not as strong as he was in Dolittle. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed a lot of fun and I highly recommend it. Like his first film, it is intended for a particular audience (Mr. Moore is doubtful that his career is trying to broaden his audience at this time). <br /> Hijack is recommended.
