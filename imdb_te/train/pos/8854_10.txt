The Bible teaches us that the love of money is the root of all evil. Money leads to greed of love, which leads to pride and eventually leads to destruction. Andy Hanks (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and his younger brother Hank (Ethan Hawk) are not differentiated by Andy Hunk. Andy enjoyed the success of New York's real estate market and married his beautiful wife Gina (Maurisa Tommy), who would never have thought of a trophy's wife forever. Hank, however, divorces himself to find himself at the mercy of his ex-wife, his daughter's expensive school bills, and the endless amount of child support payments. <br /> <br /> Andy says: He hid the only difference between him and his brother. He cheated against his company and took part in drug use to escape his fears. The pressure of his life and the lies that he could make seem to think of him now thinking about running away from the country with Zina. However, like Hank, he needs money to do it and he believes he knows how to get it. How? By stealing their parents' own and running jewelry store. Hanson's brothers, their families and many other creatures are destroyed by greed, pride and fear, where deception is dey. <br /> <br /> 'If the robbery goes wrong, Andy and Hank's mother, Nannett Hanson (Rosemary Harris) This story is told of several different opinions before and after the robbery attempt. Apart from Andy and Hank, we will learn more about the reaction to his father's death by his father Charles (Albert Finney). Charles and his two sons, particularly Andy, were also explored and another kind of stimulation was discovered after revealing that there was little love between the two. <br /> <br /> Philip Seymour Hoffman and one of Hollywood's most charismatic actors play Andy's role, without morality, greedy criminal crime, but contrary to a man we sympathize. Ethan Hawk is also a disappointment to Hanke not only to survive but also to hang on the small one he left. Andy and Hank brought life in such a realistic way that it is easier to think about their true images, not only for characters but also for the lost and confusing men who face the consequences of their actions. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want to be relieved, /> <br /> "Our decisions can influence those around us who have never expected us." What year was the best film, our lives are easily broken when money becomes the ultimate profession of love to reduce the troublesome problems of our money. In word of mouth, there are no easy solutions or answers to our problems and th The more things that will try to facilitate home. <br /> <br />
