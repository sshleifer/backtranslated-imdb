Television's "The Godfather", but avoiding praise and Mobster characters, both have nothing. Tony soprano is a psychiatrist who has to go after a lot of panic. His psychiatrist Tony realizes that he is actually part of two families - he is still a perfect husband with a father in love with a family, and in other family. After diagnosis, Dr. Mofelie confirmed that Tony's problems were actually taken from his mother Livia, who suspected the boundary-personality disorder. Gondolphi was praised as a proper character; Their uniform and talented performances, such as Bracoco and Modand Psychologist and Mother, are almost unrecognized respectively. Falco, Imperioli and Dematio have been praised for their excellent supporting roles. Van Gondt (from e-Street Band) plays his first and only role as Tony's best friend, and it is very convincing and bursting. The Chinese, in fact, plays the role of Tony's uncle and the on-and-off-of-the-nemesis, the only repetition actor in a Godfather film. Pastors, Ventimiglia, Karatola, Proval, Pantolino, Lip, Psykora and Buscini have enjoyed many fans. Tony's children are "okay" but not recognizable (except for Eile's awesome performance in "The Second Coming" from the third-to-end); Sirico and Schirripa are incredible and over-the-top, but the show is very strong for them to hold back. Although the show continued for over six seasons, it does not have a frustrating or predictable moment. <br /> <br /> <br />
