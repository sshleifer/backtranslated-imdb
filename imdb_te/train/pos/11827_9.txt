If the dick tracy is black and white, the Pope is not religion. Giving a new feel to the concept of color in a picture, we have a unique experience across the comic strip world and it is one of the few successful films to do so, thanks to the intense script, good direction, great shows (al Pacino is surprising) and especially cinematography, art direction and costume The powerful mix of design. Using just basic colors, the experience is different from anything we've seen before. And there is also a very successful hammaz for all the gangster-style styles that are extinct from modern cinema. Overall, I see a new effort and originality of reality based on the film's old and existing principles. 10 to 7.
