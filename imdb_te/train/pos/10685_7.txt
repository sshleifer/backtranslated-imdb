The film has a clear storyline, which is very unusual for music genre. The framework of "cats", "opera phantom" "bircon bintang manari" (BBM) is essentially the main center of human relationships, especially Indonesian, with the use of "Frame of the Opera" and other musical versions of Andrew Lloyd Webber as their frame. Make it clear about people. In fact, the film is based on a "supposedly" fantasy story, in fact it is a fantasy of 'child' in Indonesian adults. Dancing scenes are not perfect, but these songs express themselves as Indonesia. I do not have to fear the fact that Indonesia's dance development is more Western, and I think the dancer should explore Indonesia dance. Dance scenes appear to be inconvenient in some ways and are not synchronized with songs and / or music. Nevertheless, I still like this movie and I think it's a new wave of Indonesia-based film that I think can be improving in the future.
