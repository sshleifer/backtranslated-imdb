I was amazed to read some comments honestly on this work. Some people looking for a plot ??? Well, when this video came a decade ago, I saw what it was: a collection of music videos. This is not a movie. It's not a plot or a central storyline. It is mostly artistic edition of the long form of videos, all of which are cleverly or creatively. These days, Michael Jackson may be considered a cab, but after all, we have set trends with a thriller (considered to be a great music video for most) and Billy Jean and Beat It. With Moon Walker, the filmmakers and artists who worked with him and his fellow music and dance moves created some amusing themes, including tear, special effects, live footage and self-imitation ("bodder" order). And for those who wondered what Joe Pesky was doing there, this video was just as long as he had to be home and was one of his most memorable shows in the film. And, IMHO, I Smooth Criminal Sequence (choreography section) hit Michael Jackson something that was up to that point!
