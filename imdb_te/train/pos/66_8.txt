The whole "Home Room" got a surprise. It does not pay much time because it does not have any clue about what it is, because it does not have any punches and what we see is how it turns out by the disgruntled young man's law who decides to abuse his classmates. <br /> <br /> Alicia Browning is the old seller who is trying to graduate high school Ayi. She is a few years away and the other students do not seem to be in the same wavelength. For one, she has a rebellion with a punk look, a mouth that has a lot of makeup and someone who dares to dare near her orbit. Nine students of the Alicia home room were killed and her boyfriend kills her. <br /> <br /> Alicia, we have learned, injured girl, who suffered terrible hardships in her life but did not give us any evidence. <br /> What happens after this tragedy? It focuses on a young woman who survived. Dina Cartridge is a wealthy teen age and can not be in school. When a shaved bullet hit her, she was hospitalized more than injured. <br /> <br /> When trying to get this dark time in her mind, nightmares do not forget her. <br /> <br /> Alicia becomes the school principal to go to the hospital. Since she does not cooperate with the police, she wants the head of the school to see Deena in her terrible state, and maybe she is soft and tells the authorities about what she knows. Alicia dislikes Deanna, but in a matter of days, the two girls will make peace. We can not understand what really happened in school. <br /> <br /> The BC Phillips Alicia and Arika Christian censuses are similar to DNA. <br /> <br /> The film is intensifying, as it is not clear how it happened, because the tones Ryan wanted to give this film.
