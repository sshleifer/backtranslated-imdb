Apparently Ruggero Deodato discovered that, in the beginning, his story does not work if he approached it very seriously, so he decided to take it to the camp. The result is a film that can be seen as a humorous sword and enchantment epic or very entertaining comedy! I'll go the second way. The gore moments are brief, and Paul Paul's public outbursts are publicly quarreled (they have been blown into one scene in one scene), and there is a lovely, enthusiastic and good-natured performance by Eva La Rue, along with the "Boys" Plus, where can you see a dragon insides flaming like a discock ??
