After reading some other comments here I was really looking forward to something horrible but was pleasantly surprised. Reality Check: The original series is not good. Some people recollect more love than they like, but along with the car and Daisy Duke's legs scripts are weak and less likely to act. Duke Boys were fashionable for the most intelligent and backwood hacks, the shrunken bass hog is bad and Rosco is hype across every screen moment. <br /> <br /> It is out of story lines in the first series. <br /> Back to the cinema. If you're looking at the film's own right, it's not bad, as you do not have a direct match to remember the TV series. Real Star General Lee course. The car along and the stunts are fantastic and this is really D.O.H. All about Johnny Knoxville Cousin Bo pair is his usual eccentric self and along with Sean William Scott to make some sort of hilarious mute-and-dumber funny that this film really has never achieved in the TV series. The lovely Jessica Simpson is a knock like Miss Daisy, the Burt Reynolds well-developed bass hog and M.C. Gainey is a believably nasty Rosco P. Coltran, in the way he should have always been. But if you do not like slapstick humor and crazy car strokes then you do not like watching this movie <br /> <br /> You need to know what to expect because. If you find a good laughing entertainer car action movie that you can pay taxes on most brain then I am going to enjoy this romantic romance with one heart.
