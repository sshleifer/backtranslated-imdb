An entertaining b picture with Plato's Run Gary Busey.it was an amusing movie which was Gary Busey.it I thought it was fun right so I saw a car boot. Gary Busey plays a strict hire soldier Smith for murder and now lives a long time to prove his innocence with the help of his friends, who played a powerful Cuban crime leader, Steve Bauer (scarf) and action star Jeff Spuckman (expert). I liked the plato run, the film was never boring but it was good and action was fun, and the climax Gary Bassy was a good hero in contrast, he played a bad guy, and Steve Bauer Plato's side was good. Jeff Speaksman Have good performance   మరియు ప్లేటో యొక్క పరుగును పూర్తి చేయటానికి కూడా అతను బాగా నటించాడు, అతను నా చిత్రం చిత్రాల నుండి ఆనందించే ప్రయత్నం మరియు నేను 10 నుండి 7
