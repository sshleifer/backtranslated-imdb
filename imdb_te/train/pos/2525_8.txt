The Tony Hawk's Underground series really came at a time when it began to lose its brightness, Tony Hawk has been receiving the Pro Skater 4 expectations and Neversoft and Activision can really do a series of airplay on what's going on in that series <br /> <br /> Introducing the underground storyline, This is a new world for fans of Tony Hawk Pro Skater. Fans are pretty much argued and another feature that can really get a skateboard, now you can actually climb, run, and do all the new things. <br /> <br /> Levels are good, and the problem that started with Pro Skater 3 was also improved and it was the length of level designs. The first two games on the PS1, N64 and Dreamcast are great because the levels are nice and tall and some have some hidden features. Some features have been dropped due to pro skater 3 and 4 and systems have also added their limits. In this version they reduced the symptoms, not all of them in the streets, in fact there were virtually no few levels, and the graphics and skating physical sciences slightly reduced. <br /> <br /> In this game, a con is a little bit of the storyline, in which Nersfets is the first to do it with the Tony Hawk Pro skater, which can be understood. However, you say that you will definitely complete this game in one day. <br /> <br /> Overall, a great refresh that is very refreshing.
