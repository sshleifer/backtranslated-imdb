The film is an hour or so fun and there are some honest moments. I'm the Matt character, and the little loved too. They are very attractive and funny characters, and certainly looked very interesting. Matt is very nice (not his good cousin), and police woman and blonde biker lady provide some welcome eye candy. I saw amazing similarities between Matt and another Oscar actor, Eric Bana. My personal favorite part is the brothel, that's like. Overall, I liked the movie and it's about an 8 rating. If penalty, I was disappointed. It is a step closer to the appropriate blast. <br /> I'm really funny. :)
