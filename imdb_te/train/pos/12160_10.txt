The best black comedian in the Grand Ginol Film series to follow 'Baby Jane'. Reynolds and Winters are young murdered murdered mothers (who flee to hide in Hollywood). They run a school for movie totes, awful parent group, awful moms attended. Debbie, in her blonde wig ('I'm a Harlow, you're more Merian Davis' she tells Winters) leads to toes in their concert and great father, Weaver wins. She makes a deliciously funny tango and, more than anything, gives her amazing performance, unlike her predecessors. The atmosphere is a mixture of comic and novelty. It is amazing with great period details (of 30's). Lots of lovely swipes and terrifying film at Hollywood. Michael McIliamor has a ball as a drama coach: 'Hamilton Star', he calls 'two r but not prophetic'. Look at it and love it.
