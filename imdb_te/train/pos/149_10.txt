<br /> <br /> If you want to learn something about the Spanish Civil War and all the political details and mischief, let me tell you that you have chosen the wrong image. <br /> <br /> It is a vision of war. Majorca was a small island on the coast of Spain. When such a battle has become almost a scarer on a small island, there is no open war. Soldiers are sent to fight on the mainland, another kind of battle takes place on a small island, at home. Their political opinions are contrary to the new rule, but many people are said to be due to old family struggles or "earn some points" for silent thinking involving friends. And these things did not happen in the open. There are some trials, true, but many other times people walking in the middle of the night, they will be taken out of their homes in the closest cemetery where they will be killed. The next morning the body is found, and people do not know what happened, but no one can speak or do anything. The soldiers do not speak about killing those who have never seen their life. We are killing their neighbors and talking about hello the next day, we will also attend the funeral for the person they killed. <br /> <br /> I heard stories from my little island and my grandparents told me, the film was upset me, oh yeah, it did; But I found it very beautiful and moving. Early violence was not made by the director or the author, how things were during the war. The boy who learned that his companion's father was in the fascist team that killed his father? Completely possible. All that happened later? Very possible. TB is very true. At that time my island was not a holiday day. Poor people, illiterates and small farms. There are difficulties after the war. <br /> <br /> You can not see the war in the film, at least you are not the story of the war that you imagined. There is no battlefield, no soldiers, political scandals. Everyone knows when the two sides are struggling with each other when they are struggling with their neighbors (just check out the size of the island), the lowest type of warfare, when members of the same family struggle each other. <br /> <br /> You can see the story of a particular kind of war that can cause damage to people and their damage, or they do not. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " That's great.
