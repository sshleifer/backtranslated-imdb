I love Tudor stunts and that's why I enjoyed the film very much. Two days before the movie premiere I went to see his concert. I saw "zmeu" before the trailer and video and I thought it all figured out .. I was wrong: Instead of good image I helped a great one! I Felt Film. It's sad .. It's funny but everything is portrayed in love .. I can not even describe the soundtrack .. so I'm not ... I'm not a film critic. My words explain vaguely descriptive all my words .. Thanks to the keyboard :) Thanks Tudor Giurgiu, Thanks Maria Popistasu, Thanks Ioana bar and thank you Tudor CHIRILA. Encore! :)
