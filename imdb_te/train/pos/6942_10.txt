The age-restrictions in Brazil in terms of age are as follows: what kind of regulation, 10 years, 14 years and 18 years old. Usually at age 10, they went to the age of 14 when they were at least a fraction of the violence in violence, but it was rare to limit the number of people under the age of 18 to the West. Winchester 73 is one of them, and I will explain it very well that the film was very different from the mean. The hero, James Stewart, is fighting with his own brother who killed his father. He is looking for vengeance and has suffered from a very good man. Anthony tried to diversify the character of this kind in the next films with Mann Stewart. Shelley Winters, a prominent woman, was not quite aloof, followed by a man who lived with a rifle. Don Duri is always a great memory as the Waco Joni Dean. The story of the film, which always follows the man who is with the rifle, the best suited for the Western. This was changed to Fritz Long, which did not come. When he gave it to Man, he said that he would start from zero again and do not take anything prepared for long. With Winchester, Man created a different concept of Western, but still maintained all its traditions. Winchester is still a great movie to watch again, but it is not enough to make a seal on the ones who first saw it when it was first released.
