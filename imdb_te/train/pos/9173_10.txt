I think this is a great version, first I came here, I found out what version I was using and I went to Jane Eyre 1983 and read a comment from users comment and helped me get this version. I'm sorry to pick this version and you do not like it. I've tried to look at all the other versions and do not have anything to do with it, you do not have a book and you've read something that matches your book when you read the book. When you read the book, it's hard for you to look for something that's true and moving because you want something that's right for you. I personally say this version led me. It refers to true love for humans. I think that God's love is great. If anything good, I would like to see. But so far it's nothing!
