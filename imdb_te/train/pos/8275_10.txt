Wendigo is a pretty good mental thriller, some great drama between movie characters and some good creepy scenes. Acting is good, the characters act like a normal family. Wendigo's effects are good, Deer Farm reminded me a little bit of Rabbit in Donnie Darco. <br /> <br /> The film goes to stay for a while, but accidental one deer arrives at hunters and begins to argue with father George after lifting the car when one of the hunters Otis arrives home. Sun Miles shook a little about deer but his parents try to tell him that it's natural for things to happen. When he was in bed he started to see the unnatural things in the bedroom, the next day they go to the town and meet a man at Miles Ken, who gives him a small statue of Windy, which displays the Miles Kim's statue and she says that she only works as the owner told her that the person in the counter gave her said. Returning home, George sludges his son and there is a lot of time when he gets off the board and Miles drives the wind, and they find him outside the house and find him outside the home. Sheriff Hospital tells Kim that Otis shot him, Sherif goes to Oriss's place, where Otis drives on the road where Odis is known to him as Vendigo. <Br> Wendigo is a pretty good thriller that has some chilling moments. Check it out. 10/10
