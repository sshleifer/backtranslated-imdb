When American writer Edgar Allan Poe visited London, he reached British journalist Alan Foster, who is targeting a strange bargain. Poe's lack of confidence that all his terrific stories are based on the actual experience, Fesser Poe and his friend agreed to a bet from Sir Thomas Blackwood, who could not spend the entire night at Blackwood's Haunted Castle. After being installed in the abandoned castle, he finds that he is not alone, as he joins the various beautiful women and beautiful men, and metaphysics - they describe all souls to repeat their suicidal stories again anniversary of their death! The first time I watched this amazing bit of classic horror, I was mesmerized the whole time. I found the movie really creepy and at the same time woe. Babes Steel is undoubtedly beautiful. Music scoring makes the atmosphere twice as exciting as terror. Because I was not expecting it, thrown me for a low scene loop. Sinapas did a great job with the film's development, because the movie was good for her age, and it was the Uncute International Version, Boot. The film starts with Babes' Steel and Class Kinski collection.
