I, too, loved this series when I was a kid. In 1952 I was 5 years old and my family always saw this show. My favorite character Marion Lorne has acted as a stupid, male and very friendly "aunt" type guy. I can recall the comments she typed in "ubba bubba um um". Then she came back and played a great actress when Atha Clara played in Bewitched! <br /> "Title or End Credits Music" Swedish Rhapsody "by Hugo Alfen? My classic radio station here in Southern California Every time I listen to it will bring back the memories of the film of Mr. Piperers to go back to the camera, and this picture is not perfect for me in my mind's eye.
