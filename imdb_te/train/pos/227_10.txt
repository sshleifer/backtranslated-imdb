According to the IMDb.com film database, Robert Duvall is the direct descendant of Confederate General Robert E Lee. After watching this movie, you can think of it as good if you think it's a reincarnation. One of my most favorite films. I can afford the composer, Peter Rodgers Mellick is a CD or available soundtrack. Excellent scenery and music and "all very real life," especially for our living, or moved to the south. It was "the real moment in time." Life moves slowly, but "strangers will not stand."
