This game is far above all. The graphics are really good so I respect mine playing in the PS2. Voice acting is above the standard. The level of difficulty is correct. Vesker should have the best roles in the RE Series in my opinion. This story surprised me and took several turns that I did not expect. This game only qualifies the rating.
