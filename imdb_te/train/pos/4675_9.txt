At the Tribeca Film Festival I saw "Brothers Shadow" and two days later I'm still thinking of myself. After returning to prison the prison son (Scott Cohen) returns to his family's custom furniture business, providing all the essential features of solid drama - memorable characters; Sharp, observable dialog; The sensitive use of the filmmaker's camera that is visually appealing. <br /> <br /> But, more than that, it is rare in multiplexes these days: an unmistakable vision of a mature sensibility. Director-screen writer Todd S. It seems that Yelin's talent was fully brought to light, but we understand that he (as his character) paid his dues. He knows how true people are fighting in this world, and how happy we are - or at least, as a winner - victory. Yet Yellin respects a lot of his audience to blow up the happy smoke of our rear ends. Eventually, Jake's successes are not in commissions, nor are he in the honor of his family, but he can not leave "work" when he tries. <br /> <br /> The theme of the world (especially the cinema industry) is the theme needed to step up the "bottom line". The film is desirable for a wider audience.
