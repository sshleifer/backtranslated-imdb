I can not tell how much I love this movie. The film is very little known and is one of the funniest films I've ever seen. The film follows the robbery of a rap group, NWH (RS with Ni # $ rs caps). From the beginning of the group to the end of the band, it comes after the tragic breakdown. Following the group, documentary filmmaker Nina Blackburn. <br /> <br /> Film-painting is in budget, but it does not matter, it's a well-made, well-produced film and performances by all these actors and actresses are wonderful. The film's main strength is the writing, the rap in this movie has very clever lines and takeoffs, this is not true. <br /> <br /> Rusty Condieff made a wonderful film with MC Slamer, Vanilla Sherbert, Eyes Cold, Tone Def, Taste-Taste and Songs (Grab Your Boots, Booty Juice, etc.). In the film he plays rapper ice cold. The picture does not quit, it is funny from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> This movie works well because it occurs in the occasion, but it strikes the line without going far beyond it. Trying to talk to one of the best things, like listening to three leads and making false theory record producer tone def, if you take the bus, did you come there, and the producer responded? <br /> <br /> "They have some sort of natural chemistry, they work well together, and there is a weekly moment in the film, remove this movie. How true rap groups are some of the time during the movie <br /> <br /> Many rap groups, sensors, and NWA begin to contract with controversial literature when the group moth Rame is popular and it's something very angry for everybody who has a good nature, the film is off to a very good person out of rap, and Spike Lee's ridiculous, I can not imagine where they came with this conversation. <br /> <br /> I am not surprised that the film meets such a limited release, which is a brilliant, controversial,   ియు రేకెత్తిస్తున్న చిత్రం కూడా ఆలోచన. ఇది చాలా ఉల్లాసంగా ఉంటుంది, మరియు ఇది ఉత్పత్తిలో దాదాపు దోషపూరితమైనది అయినప్పటికీ, ఇది ప్రధాన స్రవంతికి చాలా ఎక్కువ. ప్రధాన నక్షత్రాలు లేవు, కానీ టోన్ డెఫ్ ని పోషించిన మార్క్ లారెన్స్తో సహా పలు ముఖాలు ఉన్నాయి. Look at this movie, at least you have its opinion.
