I saw this film 10 years ago. And the video from a year has been viewed on a video. It is kind of movie that is timeless, because the themes are universal, yet the stories and the dialogue are so personal. Really, despite the fact that there are only two (most involved) characters, it is one of the few films that captures you from the roll tile frame of credits. It owes much to the performances by Hawk and DePy, who believe that they are really Jessie and Saline. This is the first film to be mentioned by the reality TV, and now, the phenomenon is prevalent! I like the movie that conceals audiences in its location, and you do not think you're one of those roles. I also like to ride a train around Europe! I have not met anyone who is not involved with this movie. Maybe I can talk about myself, my friends, or just the pure genius of this film.
