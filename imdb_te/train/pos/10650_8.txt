I hired this movie this past weekend, the sound surround sound system, and got some great sound from the special impact. This film is a great movie rental, special to my fiance to influence enough, but I noticed that some suprisingly looked at computer production. I did not go to the movies and did not see this, but its scary Late Night movie is not going out. I would recommend it!
