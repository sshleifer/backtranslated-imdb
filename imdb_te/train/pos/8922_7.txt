The only thing to note about this film is that it is Steve McQueen's first major role. <br /> <br /> McQueen's talent is growing and raw but refreshingly honest in this campy little science fiction horror piece. <br /> <br /> Steve is himself the opposite, making Hot Rod a loving actor, becoming the iconic icon for the film industry for five years. <br /> <br /> Later, McQueen hated the film and "he blob". But not everyone is somewhere to start and blob, beautiful and innocent. <br /> <br /> Even though this plot is quick and predictable, there is still an entertaining hour. And it's a lot of fun before Steve McQueen is the King of Cool (and Anita Corsow before becoming Aunt Taylor's girlfriend). A close friend sent me a DVD for a while and it was a richer addition to my Steve McQueen film collection.
