Thassi is a great movie. Perhaps the best film I have ever seen. I can see it again and again. I want to give 10/10 stars because I said the best film I have ever seen. You can imagine this movie + popcorn + coke = best mix. I would recommend this one clearly if you want to see some image. First I liked it, I bought it, now I can own it and see it every day. My sons liked it and thought it was the best film ever seen. The film is about Guy in Fantasy World. I do not like to spoil all the pictures, so you can enjoy it after reading my lesson. Lovely Movie Lovely Characters, Lovely Story, and Just The Best Thing. Must see a movie. <br /> Make Jim
