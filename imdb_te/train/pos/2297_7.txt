There is something about every "hammer" film that really takes me into a new fantasy world. In the world of "Hammer" movies, anything can happen. "Abys's Guardian" is one of the films. This leads to deep dangers in occult and hypnosis to bring a different kind of horror fantasy. All in all, an unforgettable image. 7.5 / 10.
