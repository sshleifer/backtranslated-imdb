This is my favorite movie ever. I saw at least 10 times and I cried every time. My family prayed that I should not see me, so I could just cry. If I love the movie, I think it really is a true work that reads itself. Acting is top notch, and actors are perfect for their role. Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors. But so far he's my favorite movie. I was cautious about the little boy who was born in prison. He is the most valuable little child I ever met. He was adopted by a wonderful family who fought for almost two years. While still in struggle, I saw this film and his future is not sure and I am so happy that he is safe and loved. <br /> <br /> I would love to hear more about him and be happy after meeting his family. I can not say good things about it !!
