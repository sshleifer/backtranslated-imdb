It is on TV on a Saturday night and a movie called BASEketball. I always wanted to see it but it never reached the point when it was in the film. Boy I was mistaken. How funny the movie is, when the words are funny, the creators of South Park, who are natural in screen chemistry, I recorded the replay the next day, I saw 7 times a week after it was first seen !! I was engaged with it, and would appreciate the trio and Matt Works to make this film appreciative. See, it's my time # 1
