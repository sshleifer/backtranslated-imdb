I do not know why this movie is such a bad rap by many IMDb users (some say his worst picture .What? Do you see the cradle 2 tomb?) My favorite criticism plot is completely stupid, and all action sequences are not just an excuse. Duh! Which garbage you expect from Jet Lee's film? Do you believe that someone thinks a story, is it loaded with action? Not at all! Black mask is awesome, wall-to-wall action is almost the entire running time. It's also very gruesome, and we get plenty of creative ways of looking at the severed organs, decapitation, and bad guys (and quite a few innocent people, too!). Lee's other martial arts films are much nursery-school compared to Li Mask; Unwanted violence, bloodshed, or action sequences can not hold! And it made me a happy camper. Again: If you go into a jet le film movie with an amazing dialogue and a secret plot, you are going for the wrong reasons. The black mask is probably my favorite of his movies (though, beware of dubbing dubbing).
