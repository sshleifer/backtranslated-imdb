"Criminals" is the third law of the film. All the conversations and interactions that occur in it will come out of the long duration of the southern day at the end. <br /> <br /> This is the first collaboration of director Peter Masterson and author Horton Foot. Six years ago, he worked on "The Trip to Bountylay", a movie that seems to be taking action over the film. Masterson is not a good director. In fact, he's just this side just enough. Slow pose cinematographer Toyomichi Kuraita leaves a lot of room for the perfect sense of brittle light and warmth. <br /> <br /> This is a play, album, or directing of a must-play, which falls for all of the performances. I'm worried that there are no errors here. Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones, two outstanding American actors (both of which were born in January 1931), along with fully living characters, have created unrealistic characters. A young actor known to me from "Testament" and "Sakshi" Lukas Haas plays the role of his other early characters. He was silent, withdrawn, slightly afraid and sad. This means they are natural from him. <br /> <br /> The title "Convict" is probably a disgrace to the film. The title, along with the opening sequence, appears to be creating a high-resolution Western film. Slow Stage Productions If you are not interested in it, you would also like to pass on this. Otherwise, this may be a movie you like best. <br /> Enjoy.
