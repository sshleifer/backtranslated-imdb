For anyone who judges others at the first meeting, here is the perfect tutorial on the depth of the character. Grumpy elderly woman has a soft and attentive heart - and needs new friends. Datsie 'Dame, who is partisan, useless, uncomfortable comments - deepens your soul and has a pure love for all. The cold, first, right, and neglected wife has no desire to move on for any moment - the right fit. Absolute beauty - pursued by rich, sweet, lazy, slums - requires peace, quietness, and love without love. <br /> <br /> If you take the time to look outside the surface, you will find a wealth of daily life from the least expected sources. All it takes is the touch of patience and mantra.
