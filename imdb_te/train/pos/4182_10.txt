I saw this Australian film 10 years ago and did not forget. This movie shows the horrors of the horrors that generally appear to be Hollywood. The relationship between the two warring nations is that the difference in culture and ultimate perception is that we are not entirely different. If you find a copy of this type - buy it or rent it. Do not be disappointed, just feared.
