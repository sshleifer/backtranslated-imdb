It's a split personality with the exceptional Laurel & Hardy Comedy: In some cases it feels like the two films that made distinctive styles into a small one. Happily, each episode carries the funny, and boy's' unremarkable vigilant day in its own right, and enhances the amusing amount of amusing elements of the film. <br /> <br /> I never heard that I heard a favorite Laurel & Hardy comedy as a Diet Factor fan. <br /> <br /> Our protagonist Professor Noodle is a key element of the story-line: a wide-ranging-top simulator of Mad Scientist scenes. This represents a rare attempt in the science fiction landscape for L & H; Abbott & Costello and The StoZos are often stuck with mad doctors over Stan & Ali. In any case, the professor was engaged by creating a young resurgent creator, whose satirical butler Jesse expressed with the viewer's wrapped eyes and occasional extension. Meanwhile, Stan & Ali checks sweeps, performing the day he completes his solution at the professor's home. The "their" part of the picture with the chimney, roof, grass, and many unfortunate accidents features a characteristic (but first-rate) slapstick. If you do not enjoy seeing these guys, you do not like dirty work while hitting the job, but this is a feast for team fans. The oily chimney is covered with stoves, stoves in the oven, and then covered with bricks capable of surrender. I like Olly's shot which also removes the roof in the greenhouse; So slapdash the process of work I suspect something of an inner joke, the way W.C. Fields feature films that have the worst back-projection screens in the world. <br /> <br /> The film is very fun, but this makes the movie offbeat, and the two assistant players are eligible to win the bowler's cap: the sensitive character actor Lucian Littlefield is a magnificent figure, delivering his superlative lines with relish Giving pleasure, Sam Adams has a stitch in the role of Jessup Butler. Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most prominent, ever mentioned by their supporting actors in Hall Roach's studio giving their films a great boost. Likewise, Le Roy did the background music of Shield, but from this period the dirty work suggests a rare case, there is no musical background behind Roach Comedy early credits. Mood music may be improving the proceedings, but the thing; However, this is the most enjoyable comedy, and Laurel & Hardy is a prime example of what is popular in their day.
