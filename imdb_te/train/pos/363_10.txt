This film is about development. People are growing and people are fading, people are surprising and disappointing people. It's all and more. Expectation, depression, injustice, justice, love and hatred. It really is amazing performances from the whole cast but most importantly Wupee Goldberg is a fantastic play in her debut role. <br /> <br /> This film made me very human and proud of it, and I was compulsory in every prisons in the world every Saturday - it touches your compassion. <br /> <br /> PS: I will admit: In the last scene, I have waited with pleasure.
