The romantic movie of the 1970s is good compared to today's Triple X Works. There is a good story around nude rituals and romantic scenes. In fact, I've had vampire effects for some time, when they got a little bit of sex. Plus it's hard to understand periods during some tones, but it's worth looking at the edited version is then revised up version with DEVIL 'Place name. If you do not care for naked women's dance and sexual abuse, it's not a movie for you. However, I enjoyed it and I give it ... 7 Stars.
