Walking home after the movie, I made Humting the waltz music known to be dancing Natalia and Alexander. Where did I hear before? Ah, from Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut" (Track 2), 'I came to the door. "Waltz No. 2 from Jazz Suite No. 2" designed by Dimitri Shostakovich, performed by The City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. Yes, I've gone and selected soundtrack from the towers. No treat! Alexander Desplat's film score was fulfilled - fifteen tracks along with two tracks of the happiest Waltz. Nowadays we have dedicated a soundtrack to a totally comprehensive picture score. Maurice Jarrey, Enioye Morricone (Track 6's early notes "NiVio cinema paradiso"), Georges Delery, and John Barrya remind me of the favorite scores. There are subtleties of species and notes from strings, celesties, piano and harps. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson and John Turturro provided a reliable and useful pairing show. Love story, their closest connection, is very much between Alexander and Natalia - both in their childhood and inner world suffering, and her relentless and bold understanding - the only relationship between them. The director of the Antonio's Line (director of the 1996 Academy Award's Best Foreign Language Film from Netherlands Marine Gorris) gave us a silent film - its unsettling human conflicts, conspiracies, reputations, family effort, love and respect. The front end thing is the mind-game and chess's mathematical logic. Closer to a play set in the late 1920s. Photographing photographs of Lake Como's closest beauty to northern Italy near the Swiss border. <br /> <br /> If you want to go to the movies, I recommend a very soundtrack. Alexander Desplat's lyrical movie score of "The Luzine Defense" was completed.
