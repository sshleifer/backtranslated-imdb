The best thing about this film is that it is fun. It's full of funny characters and interesting situations, the frustrating, naive pecker (played appealingly by Edward Furlong) and beginning to likes to paint almost everything he sees in every day life. Peaker's friend Matt ("He is a thief, but he is really a good man"), Peaker's sister Chrissy (a sweetheart) and Peter's Catholic grandmother, the other major roles in the living room of the Virgin Mary in her room. <br /> <br /> The film makes a point about how gently wealthy is to provide life every day, and it succeeds without having a very heavy hand on it. There is always a danger of walking to a message called "sacred than you" when communicating about the value and dignity of "common people", but "peaker" removes these nets, viewers to compare their own thoughts on the subject. /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I recommend the image is mostly because it is a lot of fun.
