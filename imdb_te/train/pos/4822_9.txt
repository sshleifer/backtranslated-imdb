Can you catch your hand anytime on the stairs or the stairs? Do you taste your food before you eat? Face over bearing mother? There are only a few of the barriers dealing with young Victoria (there are also various official struggles, as well as attempts on her life). <br /> <br /> If you are in the picture, She once again stuck here. I thought I was very attracted to the role of young Victoria and thought that she had driven her character well. At the start of Queen Victoria, she will change the change from young Victoria. The blunt character is cast, all of the different sides (from the weakest, strongest, make mistakes to the queen who takes control from young Victoria). Not enough of Emily Blunt in this role. She - quite simple - delicate, every second of your attention is on her screen. <br /> <br /> Her Rupert Friend also proves that Victoria's love interest (and eventually her husband) is better known as Prince Albert. The actors have nice chemistry and you definitely believe in their developing relationship. They have their disagreements, but you can say that they are in love. Blunt and Friend are very good in every scene, and they're interested in what's happening between Victoria and Albert. Other actors in this film are very good. Paul Bettany as Lord Melbourne, Miranda Richardson as Kent's Duchess, Sir John Conway and Jim Broadbent as King William. There is not a bad act in this movie. People who are less focused are also well documented, which have a small screen time. Victoria's dog (Davy's Cavalier King Charles Spaniel) is memorable and influences in the film. <br /> <br /> The film is not just a few of Victoria's life - and instead tells us what happened * * * (* and Albert) * On the screen, we see more *. After all, a film about 'The Young Victoria' ('The Middle Ages Victoria', or 'The Old Victoria'). There are some decorative elements in the history of the film, focusing on what to do - this is the story of how the young princess came to power. Emily Blunt wears clothes, visually striking and music adds not only the image, it never detracts from it. It is spectacularly portrayed and unlike many films these days, the film is actually pretty long because you feel that you are not interested or drawn without the need. <br /> <br /> The film does so much without Emily Blunt. She is in good shape here as she reverses another wonderful performance and raises the film, which is another important actress in this important / historic role. It's a well-designed movie and an amazing look. If you have an attractive view of the most important woman in history, it should be seen.
