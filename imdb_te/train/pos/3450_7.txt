<br /> <br /> I have never heard of the film until I see the DVD a bit suspiciously, so many movies in the past have not done anything good to the bad script, in some cases <br /> There is no reason to give the movie a theatrical release. That's fine. Many of these stories seem to be forced on many occasions, but there is a very good realism here that is gaining momentum. Justin Timberlake is working properly with such a main character, but he is not yet an Oscar but he learns with each character and I'm very happy to promise for the future here. <br /> <br /> Dylan McDermott is also amazing in his unexpected role and is definitely the cream of the crop in the film. <br /> Finally, this is just a journey. You will not be disappointed, you will not be bored, in fact, I think you will be more than happy with the end result.
