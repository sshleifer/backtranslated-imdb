<br /> <br /> Interesting role of unreliable friendship between first-half activist Steve Bucco and editor Dan Woods (played by Dazzel). Washington and Kevin Klein). The second half of the negotiations are being negotiated for answers to Bicol's death. <br /> <br /> Many people are in favor of the first half of the film, keeping in mind the friendly friendship between Bucco and Woods. The second half of the Don Woods fight I heard the Bigo story more interesting around the world.
