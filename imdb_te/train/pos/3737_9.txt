First and foremost, this film is the whole way of the whole wild ride. <br /> <br /> Soldiers training story, battling with their superiors, and ultimately gathering together. <br /> From the very beginning to the very end. <br /> <br /> It is a battle drama if you are looking for a stable apartment (for some reason) and for the horror events of the boot camp. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of how actors act will sometimes be funny. <br /> <br /> The innovative Free Hand filming adds a specific flavor or deal with Paxton (Matthew Davis) throughout the coach Ferrell (Cat Farrel) storyline. Flavor of the picture. Fixed moving, stable action, and just stable confusion. Sometimes, it's a help 0. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, it is quite realistic. The few points in the picture (especially romantic scenes) seemed to be quite realistic, although they did not influence the film, but without them. <br /> In my opinion, this is one of the best films of Colin Farrell (not his best performance). Acting for each role is amazing. 9/10 -sysnuk3r
