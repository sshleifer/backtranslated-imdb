I should say that I did not hit until I saw this documentary on 9/11. It took a year to catch up with the devastation. Any talks about the towers have changed the station on the radio and on the channel. I'm sick of hearing about it. When it was aired on TV for a year and was broadcasted a day later, I closed my eyes. After the attack I heard for the first time. I highly recommend this documentary. I'm looking now on TV five years later, and I'm still crying on tragedies. The fact that this is one of the first video shops of the first aircraft on the tower is amazing. It's a danger, and see where it got them. These two brothers want to help me.
