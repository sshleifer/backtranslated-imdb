Riding Giants is a wonderful movie. How many people lived while surfing these people? Their lives are basically surfing, lifestyle, breathing, and joy. They do not care about money, jobs, girls or anything. Their waves for them are their girls. I have never been on a surf board, and it looks very difficult, I do not understand how they stay in them, it makes no sense. It's a fantastic movie and if you're surfing then you really need to watch this movie. When you're a surfer and when you start surfing, when it comes to life, it's really popular or anytime you want to see. This might be a documentary, but it's pretty cool. -Tara F.
