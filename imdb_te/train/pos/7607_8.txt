It's not well illustrated, well written or well-played, but it should be the most addictive performance I've seen from Twin Peaks. You have to look for the next episode to get any closure. They have also reduced the pace of the program that they only show you with a small amount of information about the episode as they told you everything you wanted to know. But some acting is just terrible and some of the duality is obviously cruel. Some characters are very much two dimensional. Actually acting actors like Jack, Kate, Saeed, and more experienced actors like Lock and Echo have been put on hold. The development of this show may be very frustrating, because this episode may not show up to the previous episode. The frightening side plot is sometimes part of the story you have not spoken about. Nevertheless, the second season is further revealing stories about the island than they were in the past. All its a great show but not perfect.
