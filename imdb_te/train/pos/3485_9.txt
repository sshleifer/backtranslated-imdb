This WrestleMania did not do that for me. Sometimes, the warrior and celebrity intervention are throwing off to good old days, and it seems to be more in "in your house" than any other. More than average ... The tag team is valued for many matches, such as the title match match, although the note is worthy of the title, there is no header change the next night.
