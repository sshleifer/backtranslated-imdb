Who's the alcoholic drummer Keith Moon's father is named Arthur. I found quite similarities between Dudley Moore and Keith Moon in the film. Liza Minelli, who is usually OVERACTS, has done well in this regard and has been able to grab her on Dudley Moore at every turn. Yes, I agree, Sir John stole every scene. This is quite different, which gives the viewer a glimpse into another life. We often try to resume this movie on a satellite. The rest of God is Dudley Moore; It's a fun movie. Most sarcastic and thumbs are richer and snobby / wealthy. Unlike the close friendship between Moore and Sir John, it is lovely.
