After Dark, my sweet filled a great, modern noir, seedy characters, dirt roads, and, of course, sweaty characters. The great leaders of the last two or three decades have been in South, where men are shining and women, Um, blinkers. Why? Because it is not hoatout. Because everyone has a good moisture (at least men - women with sweaty left me). <br /> <br /> There are some spoilers here. <br /> <br /> The film should be a Nair - a steady pace (though some attention deficits are referred to as 'slow'), although clearly and extensively drawn (not simple) characters, and tons of weather. Noir, if any, about moods and attitudes. So great people are not recognized by your great conventional definitions (Bogart, Mitchchum, Hurt, and Nicholson - they are (and their characters) real - they style and sauce and what a crime film is exactly what you want). Or quickly paced stunts (again all the great noises are a slow flame like cigarette). Great noirs create atmosphere and you just live with a couple hours characters. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Uncle Bad and Collie are witty - the audience will not know what they really do - and Patrick and Dern (I love Bruce Durn) the pitch is perfect, especially Darn (see the previous comment). They take the basic scripts of a character, give them deeper and get our sympathy. <br /> <br /> The story is also interesting. In the world of Noir (a mystery on the platform - most of it is suspense), there is a good plot in the world, but it's great. If anything, just 'OK' plot should be more than anything else with Jim Thomson's work. With Thompson, the plot is almost secondary; He put Hummett and Chandler's labyrinth stories away from simple stories with stronger, more confusing characters. The Killer Inside Look at the novel like you and you will soon see (from the title) about it all. When it comes to Thompson, it's not about it, how about it (to quote Roger Ebert). So, really, kidnapping is not relatively simple plot point and, if you do not like, well you jokes. <br /> <br /> She is not one of the 10 stars than one of the 8 stars because she is the female leader. She's not bad, but she's not Angelica Houston or Annet Benning (I do not know what I'm talking about by Jim Thompson's The Griters - it's a good movie and you're contemporary noir - it's the best of the 1990s and the blood simple challenges for best title from Chinatown). She just does not have chains (or looks for that matter) and although she and Patrick have some chemistry, I'm not with her. So there.
