Faith and deaths ... The middle waver among an elderly Ashkenazi Jewish American gentleman lens and a young, African-American Jewish gentleman who has frank talks about how each other is different and unfolding over their lives over the years. . <br /> <br /> The role of Mostel is uninterrupted problems and a tailor with a terminal wife; Belaphante's character has always been a life hustler, and has left him an odd purgatory in a huge car accident - he should convince the Mostel to renew his faith, that it is his wife's health (and failing along with his own) Levin's own problems, still pining for a friend he left behind. /> <br /> Bellefonte's role It is not a 'normal' Hollywood movie about a person's tension or a person's confidence in the faith, since the end of the movie is brilliant, and the film suffers somewhat more than his ambition .. <br /> <br /> .. It is worth watching and appreciating more than just amazing performances.
