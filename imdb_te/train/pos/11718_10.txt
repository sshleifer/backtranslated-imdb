I love this movie as I love Elivra as she did on her late night film hostess - she's plain good - her car is good, and she's a bit of Transylvania Dolly Parton - she's very naive and simplified at times - <br /> It is well held, and the comic cast is good with Eddie McClark at her regular best plus Sally, Patty Santosamainadi lerman. <br /> <br /> How do I think crunches of Elvira potato chips <br /> <br /> This film is again looking again - just for fun. Now I want to get it to the sequel, the hunted hills of Elvira and see if it lives up to it
