Only one person who has seen the relationship between the myth of Simius' and the discussion of Mary's life? In a hill version a person condemned to spend a large boulder to spend his eternity. Unfortunately, every time he reaches the Boulder slips and ends backwards to start him. There may be a sharp sideways at his eyes, I'm not sure right now. Mary in the film spends her life struggling with her life, unfortunately her drops each drops and loses everything. In her case she is a stranger in a drunken state, she is abducted by Falafel's girlfriend and practically attacked with Livias skipper. When you question this theory, this scene ends up with her, and she tries to run away from the stars when she falls off the books until she's gone. The next morning she was hiding and never climbed up.
