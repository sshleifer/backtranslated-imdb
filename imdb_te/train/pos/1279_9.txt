The film is an entertaining and completely sarcastic scenery of pop culture and producers. <br /> <br /> When you think Jukevic is the first big effort, there are specific vivid colors and spin docked settings. <br /> <br /> If a warning, take seriously the message of the film. It's not a collective use (and it's not a compliment). <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the basic plot line of the fictional 'Jane editor' that breaks the 90th anniversary of Mobrazika.
