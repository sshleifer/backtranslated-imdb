A classic series that is at least repetitive or released on DVD. Billy Tote begins a journey to find his true parents after learning of his parents 'death after his parents' death. After various rituals of nature, his search ends and his father's identity has been exploited and used by a human trafficker in Europe! If I do not remember it, this series ends with a cliff top chase ending with the death of Austrian (?) Ski slopes and bilious fathers. The European round was shot in different destinations and crossed into parts of the film Noir and crime thriller. Some of the episodes were enhanced and looked very well. The main arc often finds the secrets of his mother and father, hiding through pieces of life by toiling in his years. One class law is but less and forgotten.
