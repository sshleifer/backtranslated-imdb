Lily Mars, a young girl living in Indiana, will be given a lift when she comes back to her hometown for a visit to Broadway producer John Thorneau to visit her dreams and hopes of Broadway. Lilly tries her to try her to get her to look for her, but he frustrates with her hands. When Thorneau came to become the venue for her performance, Lilly (of course did not know John) and Thorneau gave her only lasting role to her family, although Thoren was a girl and a romantic blossom, performing the prominent woman of the show, Isabel Rekay, jealous. When Isabel John Lilly gets frustrated with a romantic show, she goes away, and decides to make John Lilly a star. Isabel returns later, and Thornove lilly has been forced to return to her minor bit in her drama, which can even spoil romance. The most fascinating film, and in the role of her character (I read Lady Macbeth's, ridiculous, never threatened her singing career) to see Garland, I enjoyed Halflin's character (Thorne) more lily than lily. The film is somewhat predictable, and the scenes are well integrated, but it's a very enjoyable movie. Rating, 7.
