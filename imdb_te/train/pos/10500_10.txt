Although the Super Mario 64 series is not the same as the rest of the games, it is still every bit as classic and old games. The games with this replay value are very low. Plus, this game has many types. There are 15 levels in each of the many tasks you can do, and many other hidden tasks. The game is not very challenging, but the lack of challenging does not take away from the game. Once you have defeated it, you want to remove your game and start again. And its fun for a second time, or a third time, or two hundred times. Any Nintendo 64 owner must be responsible for and have a reason to have Nintendo 64.
