The film and its sequel Barry McKenzie holds his own, two great comedy films previously produced. <br /> <br /> It's a great story, Acey Blake brings his legacy to England and meets with his colleagues, who he meets with lovers of love and innocence. <br /> <br /> If this is a chalk, where is the drink that dies? Is he dying to die as dingos donggar? The great characters, the top acting, and the use of great shellas and many more fosters, then any other three pictures together. <br /> And you can hear it, and it's filled with great people. Certainly my two favorite movies, I watch them at least a fortnight.
