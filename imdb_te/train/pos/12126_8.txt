Betty Davis in this 1934 movie starred as a cool entertainment show like Mildred Rogers. The film is now out in 2003. This is good for movie fans and Betty Davis fans, but today's average movie viewer does not have much appeal. It was difficult for me to see how Mrs. Davis was young in this effort. Casters are basically the sound and performance meaning and interesting. Leslie Howard as Philip Carey, a club-pediatric student. This is a picture with a strong message about who we love or who we like. However, "the relationship of human beings" has not had a profound effect on me mentally or emotionally. After watching, I felt a bit different about the film. This is an insight to me as a response to the director's departure. <br /> You're a judge! <br /> <br />
