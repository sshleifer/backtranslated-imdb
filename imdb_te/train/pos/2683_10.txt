Once again, Franco proved that he is a surreal & romantic movie Prince. True can be seen as the most fascinating entertainer in his work, but when he really shows his ability with Sukabas (nicronomacan), he contributes to his warped creativity in the riot, and has us inherently romantic in his work as hypnotic and troubled. It may be a schizophrenic, or indeed a ghost (as a mystical character states), a vampire who shared Jerry in a fantastic scene as Jerry van Rowan's excellent score Palleys, while following the trails of Stripstead artist (Reynad) A good and troubled film is a good film for anyone who is interested in passing the film alternatively.
