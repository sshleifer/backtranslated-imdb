Really sad, Six Degrees and Brothers & Sisters are not the worst that real reality TV is not more than darker, darker performances. I think there's been a cult following of the dissatisfaction of the land of dissatisfaction over the past few years of so many premature dismissals. But networks with Jericho's fans (I also enjoy) and more vocal opposition to other performances may bring this trend back. I am like other people, and I do not support new shows until they are given a second season. I'll probably make a decision by watching and catching it through the DVD and online view. By then ABC, you lost me as a viewer for any new show.
