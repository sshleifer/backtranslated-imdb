Many films about New Orleans, or ridiculously bad, and ridiculously inaccurate (see: "The Savage Bees"), but it excludes "Tytroop", which is almost right.) <br /> Here inevitably it is not wrong. The tunes are not too bad (yes, here are more Brooklynis than the "Yacht" slopes down the southern way), the 1950s when the city was caught in the way of "tourism" shots, which way / draw, and they were trying to do a "quirky sounder" for everyone. <br /> One of the few movies to do justice to the city, and a good image boot.
