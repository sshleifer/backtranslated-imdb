I never thought an old cartoon would give my eyes tears! I wanted to see the first Casper cartoon, The Friendly Ghost (1945) when I first bought Caspour & Friends: Spooking about Africa, but when I saw the next cartoon, there was a good Bose to Night (1948), which made me break! I can not believe how sad and sad after seeing Caspin's fox killed! I did not see anything like other Casper Cartoons! This is all saddest one! It's discouraging, I can not see again. It's like seeing a lassie dying at the end of an image. I know it's a classic, but old cartoon fans like us for most of us! If I wanted to see something old and classic, I would rather see something unhappy and funny! But when I think about this Casper Cartoon I'm thinking about my cats!
