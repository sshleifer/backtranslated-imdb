Iranian film or Iranian football: Do you know about the average person more / less? Interestingly, the controversial Iranian filmmaker Zafar Panahi's latest film, "Offside", is a story that uses football, or anywhere to move or extend somewhere and extend the courtesy and the right of the person they like. Most of the controversial issue in the country like Iran is disputed, and it does not like to be a global audience. <P> <p> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ After my first year slag, the summer cup football was a summer-ended tonic in the summer, so I did not need to avoid the events I had seen in Special '82, so they saw each game at once simultaneously with players, so that West Germany and Austria Look at both the cost of Algeria and create the result between them Indi. <br /> broadcast by the BBC of Britain, who see Iran? Mexico game of the tournament, the first appearance of the two countries, the BBC's Gary Lineker Anchorman football match to remember to introduce a snid anumatincavaccani comment. This happened: 'We have seen Germany, England, Argentina and Holland games, but now we want to see ......... Mexico and Iran have fought it out'. The next two low level emphasis is clear and it is a duty to look at them. It's shameful, and movies like Offside, because it is for all people, and Iran is really interested in going to the place where they have their prosperity to achieve it and that people in the position of power feel what they want. <br /> <br /> Immediately, 'Iran' and 'Football' And when I think of the words 'world cup', my mind flies back to the fly '98 ans's game between the country and the United States. Here is a film about the world cup game involving Iran but some or indeed quite Iranian filmmakers have chosen to present a story that revolves around Iran's well-known success over the United States and is intended for them, directed by Panahi What is happening behind scenes and prohibited from women's football matches, enormous Win the game in size Can not be allowed to live They can imagine a heavy hand film that describes Iran's "success" as a worst promotional film designed to exploit a Western force or rival. <br /> <p> Two films that came to surpass the unqualified players in their own game were the 2001 Lagaan film, which defeated the British in Indian farmers cricket. Similreal, 2005's 'The Game of Their Lives' Americans will see English in the 1950 World Cup only this time to defeat English. The differences between these pictures and offsides are vast; Outside the state mentality and courage to explore the essence of women's feminism, where their beloved Iran defeats Bahrain and lifts it into the crud nurseries, while trying to qualify for the World Cup. From a restricted window that allows them to watch the game. Men can not make 'May' with false language, but can be used during play. The film is unequal to Iran, and they can not remove a person's right to ban and ban a bad guy, but should the right to watch the game play with the game? <br /> <br /> Panahi is not prohibited in Iran. <br /> <br /> Panahi is considered to be very dangerous for the human body / mind than tobacco cigarettes, two things doctors and scientists have heard a little bit of foul language in a football match. Panini specializes in his film 'offside' title, which is a decision on the football player when trying to get the benefit of the 'attacker' play field. This progress is held in parallel with the status of women (without supposedly) people trying to keep one on the opposition team; <br /> <br /> It is one of the best movies I've seen in the Middle East and surrounding Gulf. This is a confusing but humble movie about people who do not have any acting history according to IMDb, so the acting is genuine and intuitive, all of which is a fresh new reality. The immediate ending is a continuous sound battle between men and women who mislead, which is daring to demolish the state. I'm showing a different level of unreasonable for someone who does not really like someone for reasons I have said, or I think you will work in the Iranian government.
