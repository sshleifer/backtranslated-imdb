I never knew filmmakers in such a way to express such discussion in my life. Trust me when I say that the movie is finally reminiscent of an alltime classic. I was looking forward to this film, which I love both Lock and Stock and Snatch in the past, but I have been very disappointed after the negative reviews. I absolutely loved this movie and I can not wait to see it again. The film is totally different for the two Ritchie films mentioned above, and it is very good. I have opted for favorite directors but none of those guys have removed a move just like Guy Ritchie has just completed the film. I believe that taking a movie to another level (many people laugh at the movie will react to the film, but I believe it's time to prove it). The film is very confusing and I have not been thinking about it or taken longer than 2hr or more for as long as I try to mix things up. Everything that happens in this film is pretty good judgment (some answers from the endless hours of thinking, some answers from other people's movies) and until Sunday I see again. I hope that I will go to the movie with an open mind and they will be rewarded as I and many others.
