This is a beautiful picture. The true story of bond between father and son. Tom Hanks is his best ever. Tom Hanks is really out of the box in this movie. He has good guy roles. In this film, he will end up with a bit of sand in the film, but it is still the last scene where his character has been killed, the smell of roses emerged. The cast of the film is well integrated. Tom Hanks's character shootings in Mr. Rooney group and I love love even when there is a whole silence. The scene is just cool and deep about the sound, just emotion. John Rooney loves Paul Newman's character's face look when he discovers Tom Hanks' character, and he realizes he has got his destiny, even before he sees. The first time I saw this film, I ran away and I went out and received the video, adding it to my collection of all my favorite films. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is my favorite actor, this film is a special place for me.
