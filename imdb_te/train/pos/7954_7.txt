Great voices, adventure and ingenious conversations are great. The addition of the three main animals "character" gives the relationship between the possibility of the depth and the possibility, especially the older fellow, the shadow, and the young hellraiser. The earlier versions of the film have not been able to provide any true personality or inspiration for animals, which can be done here. Sally Field is elegant in anything, but it really shines like the proud cat, sassy in this movie. Great contrast between the cat and dog perspectives in life, the excellent plot and excellent solution to make and fit with warm warmth. There is also an excellent score and beautiful mountain scenery. The evening with children alone or absolutely perfect. Hats for Disney.
