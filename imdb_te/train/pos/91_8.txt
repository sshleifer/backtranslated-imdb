A good film with an ideal ending in general; Acting is amazing and the characters are not far from their personalities. I especially liked the plot, but still gave the surprise element out of the whole movie while you know what is happening. However, it might last a little longer (it may be extended) - it seemed to me that it went a bit; The author is trying to remove the lines before the rain falls. For example, what happened to Tristan's brother Hayden? We know he died in the hospital. Perhaps he is the whole thing setup?! No one knows! Maybe the sequel will be? May? If there is .. I can not wait to see.
