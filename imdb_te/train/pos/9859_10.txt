Ice Age animation is not the only year (in my view) it's also the best animated feature I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> Teaser excited me last year, the website. Scrat is great! The rest of the sub zero Zero heroes. <br /> The animation is wonderful. Your heart really goes to the characters in this movie. They have good conversations and are growing well. <br /> <br /> I laugh, tears and surprise their journey. Nothing is forced or completed. Emotion is real, especially in the dramatic second half. In 1997, Astacea was also influenced by Fox Production. And before Time Land Time in 1988. All have a real rich charm and tries to entertain all the spectators, not just cynics. <br /> <br /> <br /> "
