Peter Weir's first international success, based on The Last Wave Aboriginal mythology, was an influential chili pepper with a fascinating back story. Richard Chamberlain has given a good performance as a defense attorney whose life is largely disappeared from reality, and he is deeply aware of the murder case of Aboriginal tribal opponents. David Gulpill was one of the suspects, who led Chamberlin to the 'Dreamtime', an alternative reality / timeline center for local Australian history and tribal tradition. In deliberate ambiguity, the film leads to the end of the scholars, which is somewhat reduced due to poor influences, probably because of budget restrictions. Nevertheless, a film that is shining about the mystery and fear under the surface we can see as 'reality' will be with you.
