It's very funny. You know that you like comedy. It's very good like Hollywood Spectrum. So, what do you want more? Huge about very good Sally Fields. She is far better than anything I've seen so far, and she looks so damn good. This film should understand why she is a star. Those eyes! As silent film actor, but good. In fact, all eyes are very good. I act as a bad tea soap actress with my girlfriend. We will make a real virtually visible work from one eye to another of your partner. They do not do all in the soap dish. Great. Ice have it! (Sorry) <br /> <br /> There are so many wonderful performances, each of which is waiting to be seen again. The entire workshop with Kevin Klein is about how to deal with a lot more subtly. Is that Yes, he is good. So Robert Downey, Jr. He created Summit in Slick's Slim Executive Career's career. Kathy Marriotti, though not the most talented actress, is both sexy and inspiring, especially when she is angry. And Hoop Goldberg is good, she's a little jing giving her a little flat delivery here for her natural timing. Well, the Wooup is not bashing, I've heard that. <br /> <br /> And then, there is hair. The soap dish BIG hair was made at the end of the eighties, so the comedy is like a great role. Because they are big and strong, you do. <br /> <br /> So much better than what I thought was a soap dish. I'm sick of films that tell me how to do it about the shallow, self-centered, semi-talented egomaniacs. TV soap actors. Soap dish is just happy to have me just laugh 'em. Thank you.
