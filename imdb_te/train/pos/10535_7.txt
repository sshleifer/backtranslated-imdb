The word agility is the only thing this film can provide. It is a lightweight ease through an existential concept. Bouncy (more than one) and a bit nutty. I do not call it a grand and unforgettable film and it is not as memorable as the director's first movie "Cube", but it's a fluffy pit that spends the Sunday morning. Acting is different from being distinguished from respectful but I believe in how it is written. Perhaps it's a serious film or maybe a well-known state of mind. <br /> The "head" is like "head" and "human nature." <br /> 6.8 in ten
