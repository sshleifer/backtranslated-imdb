After seeing this episode for the first time on DVD in 10 PM, let me start. <br /> <br /> This brief review may include spoilers. <br /> I'm Sophranos and I'm a long time fan. I can safely say this is the best episode I have ever seen. I'm not saying everyone thinks this way, but I'll do it. <br /> <br /> This episode is the equivalent of the weekend I spent with my family, and we have to look at my own father and witty in the ICU. <br /> <br /> This episode begins with an alternative reality with Tony: The identity of a person named Kevin Finnetti was mistaken. <br /> <br /> For ten minutes, Tony is dreaming of me or I see some other shows. <br /> When the Anthony (or "Kevin") appears in the sky at the "helicopter spotlight" option 1 confirmed, a flashlight with a doctor. <br /> I only watch this moment and play it in that order until we go back to real life as compared to what I say. <br /> <br /> Tony coma came from a moment. His boys A.J. <br /> <br /> A signature moment in the episode: In the rest of the episode, we cut in the middle of the real world: the family's probability is the negative result of this coma, and Tony's alternative reality, parallel to both in his mind and in the real world around him is. <br /> <br /> When she comes to Toni, the best way to get that part: "Anthony, did you hear us?" Asked. In Tony's world, he enters a dark hotel room and revolves around a light. He walks from his boots and goes on the phone. He tries to dial, but he can not do it - as he attempts to return to Carmalla, but he is not physically able to do that. <br /> He sits down and sees his window. <br /> <br /> Mob is married to these last films as "When Will It Cold I Will Die". <br /> <br /> You can find out what light is. It's wonderful.
