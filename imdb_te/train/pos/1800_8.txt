All Dogs go to Heaven will be equidistant with the water ship down for scary kiddie movies. Both are dark and pretty bad, but at the same time most mesmerizing experience can have a child. This is one of my favorite films as a kid. I'm in love with Charlie, at age five or six, I agree ... I have a love for a cartoon dog. Lovely Cad of all dogs tells the dark story of his partner in Charlie and crime itch. The story flows from Charlie's death row and waves in a nearby club for some gambling. However, as a child, I did not understand the concept of the film. I loved songs and animation but I was surprised to see why I was upset as a young man in the film because I was younger. It deals with pretty adult themes --- gambling, murder, hell and jail but in the picturesque-scenic Disney films world, every child should look at once. <br /> <br /> Yes, a sort of silly crocodile scene and hell scenes are very scary to me, when I was younger, but it gave me such sharp message that parents did not care!
