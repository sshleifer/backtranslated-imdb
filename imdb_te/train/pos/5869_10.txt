After watching Deer Hunter, after telling a masterpiece, the film had big shoes to fill Jack Fight. Deer Hunter, has a devastating effect on the person after the Vietnam War. Robert De Niro is in the film, The Deer Hunter and is very good, Kathy Baker. But the film belongs to Ed Harris, who gave him a powerful, emotional and influential performance. The film is based on a theatrical drama, and one or two scenes where I felt it was clear. I understand that it was like watching one platform for one or two scenes one. That's not a big deal, and really the movie is not really reduced. Deer Hunter is not an epic. There are similar themes and similar themes, but they are two different films. Deer Hunter was great, and I also believe that this movie is a great acting and it makes a lot of effort in this one. For me, Jack Pai is a 10/10
