The story and the letters are some of the best I've seen. Graphics PS and cut scenes and voice overs are excellent. I defeated the game at least 3 times and liked every second of it. I think the problems faced by the Prophet are believable and realistic and I believe I deserve the sequel. Or at least a remake. If they are remade for the PS3 I will buy a system for that game and maybe a mere bargain on the top of the announcement (stupid buster wand) on the announcement that inventive while inventing a enough rental and sometimes fraudulent to guarantee a rental that mgs4 executes its excellent even thinking and execution system .
