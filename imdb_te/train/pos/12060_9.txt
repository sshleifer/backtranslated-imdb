I really miss the production of good old fashion spooky films. If Ismail Merchant and James Iori give up the work of producing such films, this may be one, save for the absence of internationally known, upper drawer cast. You do not even bother doing dishes until morning, because you want to hide alone under the covers, and one of those pictures that you see alone in a dark evening with a pizza and some popcorn. Brove director Herbert Wise, Writers Susan Hill and Nigel Kennely, Jon Bunker's Outstanding Production Design, Art Direction by John Ralph and a wonderful cast for me, even though I live in one of the most uncompressed cities. In the beginning of the 21st century. I gave it "10" to "9" because they were really a great program with television production and budget barriers.
