(Some Spoilers) I did not read this James M. Kain novel ("The Postman Always Rings Twice"), based on the film, so I could not compare this movie version, but I did use the 1946 US version <br /> The Italian gem is also good, and I read in editing because of the blatant instructions for the fascist rule. Well, is it ?? The rest of the film is the predecessor of the neo-realist movement making the film. Why can you see exactly? <br /> If any tough editing continues, the sense of social and cultural as well as the perception of personal oppression is deeply embedded on mainstream lives, so there are many limitations in life. <br /> <br /> As he saw in Giovanni, he had a pair of shoes, shoulders, stolen people, and a way out, but he walked away because Giovanni had some money with his unmarried marriage , Her job (working at her trotter for her husband, behind the bar and the kitchen back) and her sex. Previously, she had limited options, and decided to marry the restaurant / gas station owner (Giuseppe Brega, played by Juan de Landa), that she was not happy. <br /> <br /> Brenda helps him to settle the car and send him to the village to buy a piece of land (he really is pocketed). Gaino Bregana's success (the lack of life or lack of water on the pumped water) and Giovanni remains the only one. <br /> <br /> Gino thinks he will soon block this relationship, and thinks that Giovanni should move her husband again when she proposes to dispose of her husband. It did not want any part, Gino gave up the city on a train train, which he could not afford, with a fellow train passenger named Spagnolo, a zinc-tied man. Gino represents a kind of freedom in Spagno and they become friends (also refers to Gino's morality and conscience in Spinoo), along with finding work on carnival. Finally, Gino has a steady job. A month out when his concern (he was still in love with Giovanna), Bregana and his wife Carnival, and Bracon Gaino persuaded him to return home and work back with them. <Br / <br /> <br /> After completing the evil work, Giovanni says, "Gianna gives us the opportunity to get rid of her husband shortly after. It seems more cold-blooded than the one, seems to have a very low conscience, but he is guilty and guilty to hurt the man who does not cause any harm to him.He wants to leave her until he wants to leave her again, they are now unreliable and have to deal with consequences. /> <br /> Spaggil The role returned to Gino's life as a judge for his false accusations. <br /> <br /> The 46-US version with Lana Turner and John Garfield gets only a few of the peripheral characters, especially the cops and a breathless loser, but the lawyers are the only criminals It is good to focus more on the psychological effects of it. This gives the final result more power, and makes it a powerful statement that strengthens the inability of community. <br /> <br /> The short question is: How long will everyone kill their husbands before they can be pronounced by loved ones (not the first attempt in the US version); Gina's rapidly grappling with dancer / prostitute? They express their love quickly and she is ready to give a great chance to a person who just met! ?? Unlike all, it is not? Did I find this time frame problem quite disorganized? It made me think I should miss something somewhere. Otherwise, it is well worth the viewer time. Both acting and directing are uniformly good. Recommended.
