A simple and effective movie about the life of the living. This has reached a lot of gallbladder for Homer and his friends, which drops before his son's son, not to be a minor in the local mine and to leave the fate. Homer and his friends took three different challenges to conquer personal and free future. The first man-made artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, a Soviet satellite, a milestone in human history, can not miss a turn that Homer and his friends can not miss. Then challenge the challenge of science and applied mechanics to create a racket rather than from scratch and scratch or from what they collect in books and order in their minds. The challenge of the world that denies and refuses is to try to force you back into the pack, and if you have a casual threat, it will force you to return to the pack for the sake of plain survival and then prove that Homer has accepted his own plans and dreams. But the film is on the other side of the story adequately emphasized. Homer Project is a carrier but inspired carrier he and his friends need. His friends are able to take their own highways and tracks and come out of the mining fate, setting up his stunning example of power before their eyes. Do not follow the example of people like the beacon on the difficult road. But the film is also effective in showing how the father hindered this dream, because science was not a real ground or ground. The duty of the working class in the 1950s and 1960s is still in some places, and so the father's traditional ideas are often implemented. If the mother does not have the courage to speak one day, the task of the class I speak will become a devastating trap. Here also the film is effective and some parents have to think. This may be the fourth challenge Homer faces: taking the road that is not prescribed by his own father and taking the challenge. <br /> Doctor Jacques Cowardowe, University Paris Duufine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Soroben
