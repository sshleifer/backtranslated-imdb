This is the first and foremost amazing series. It is very well done and very interesting. As a huge WWII buff, I learned a lot before seeing this series. Their interviews, as well as the battles with past people, are one of the best for the war. It's nothing against men you see interviewing in today's events, and most of these people do not really take part in what's going on. One of the best episodes is a commentator by Sir Lawrence Oliver. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to know about WWII, but it's really just die-hards (like me) only want to buy it or see it more than once. My true report about this whole range is that some of the facts that we know now are not very accurate. Information about the Soviet Union in particular, is inexplicable or plain in places. We now know this information because of the collapse of the USSR. The whole glamorous in WWII and a WWII historian must look professional or personal alike.
