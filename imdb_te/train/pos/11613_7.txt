Distortion is a picture that drew me to surprise .. At this point it's a sort of multi-layered play that focuses on the person who writes a play about his life experiences that are right to him. To be more sensitive, he feels his wife cheating on him, so he hires a private eye to snip on him. His wife does not know that this is happening. Meanwhile, the actors in the drama revolve with each other, and some slip their sleeves by telling the unscrupulous people of the world of Israel. <br /> <br /> The film's director really moves along with the ensemble cast of characters, and the edits are a way to look after you, which is actually a fun movie, which I do not mind and people recommend to check it out.
