From the early strokes of the lead actor, we are given an initial perspective on how many men's lives are run and everyday 'normal life'. <br /> <br /> How many European men feel that they are in full control of their lives, as director Eric Lategau They can not work without women's help / support. The use of the cover of the film is good and the active position of his senior member (mother). <br /> <br /> While laughing enough in the film, solitary parents / reception and family strength in society. <br /> I have one of the best 50 or film films I have ever seen this year and have five start ratings. I'm looking forward to adding this thing to the DVD collection when it's released and I highly recommend it to all ages.
