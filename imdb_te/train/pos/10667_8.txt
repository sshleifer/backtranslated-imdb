I saw this film after watching Broadway. I love Broadway music and I love the movie. I have seen an unrelated picture of Broadway performance. I saw an interesting reader and what happened to most books when they turned to movies, so I initially developed philosophy. Suppose this movie is based on the book (or musical in this case), but it is not the same if the story line is not the same, so let's see what it looks like. <br /> <br /> I danced before 12 years of my choice. I am a good dancer (picking up chorus work in local architects like a child) but I'm not super talented. I was a show rider but super talent. I had to choose when I changed my dance teacher and my trainer (the year I spent several months in his farm in the state). I spent two hours four hours a week and riding 3 hours a day 7 days a week and one or the other. I love to love dancing and I love this film and a lot of other dance and dance movies. I chose this picture for this film, which is a great movie about raw emotion and human interaction. It's really hard work and heartbreak power to get what you want and you can not get it. I love the movie. I love Broadway music.
