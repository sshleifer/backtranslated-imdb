<br /> <br /> When entertaining, Fay Grim is one of Hartley's public works for many years, and in the movie Stage of Henry Phool Line, the quality of an object in the movie is reflected. In Henry Fool, it was not any sense, even if the Object-encrypted memories were blurred, fake, and trans-mutated, in the fame grim ... Object-encrypted memories-that is, the script's process of writing and filmmaking in the modern era - past blockbuster paintings There were fewer than mash-ups in the past. That is, what is fay grim in a philosophical sense. That object, perhaps, shock is now clich√© and dull (as indicated in the opening sequences in the publisher's office). <br /> As you say, Henry's role is not understood and looked for the importance of memories. <br /> <br /> Henry is a thin veiled ghost who first visited Simone as a modern Faust. Harey missed the quality and story of Fay Grimm's story without hurting Henry's role. Enough of the 'detail' sound past - knowing Henry Fool's story is not enough to 'feel' the quality of the characters as Henry Foo did, and 10 minutes for the film entering the movie <br /> <br /> Henry Phool Henry Fool, Henry Fool, Henry Fool, Henry Fool, Henry Fool, Henry Fool Confessions are bad ... just bizarre or filthy Hours, but to break away. Henry can not even be the right villain - and this is a tragic mistake that makes him feel very pleasant ... Tolkien is like Galam in the works, Henry is satisfied. <br /> It's Fay Gray, but Henry's dialogue is wonderful. The whole image is built into encryption - a sort of variant of another platform until Henry's confessions remain another bad story. It's an interesting twist, but one that's not really digesting the first picture without seeing it. First of all, what Henry showed was better than depicting the first story of the first film - the heroine is not really about the first film - perhaps a casual observer. <br /> Is part of the encryption? Hard to say ... a little disappointment even though sex maneuvers. Cheesy.
