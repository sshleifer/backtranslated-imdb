This is one of the Bollywood films I have ever seen. Family and friends feel the same way about it. This film is really romantic and dramatic at the same time. In my opinion, we need more movies or movies to keep South Asian culture alive. Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao are doing well in the film, both of whom are attracted to many movies. This is a must watch film, a family and a romantic movie. The film is also from the manufacturers of Hum Saath Saat Hain and Hum Abke Hain con. The film is their best right now ... The film's arrangement is very attractive, it is also an attraction. This is a must see film ... everyone recommends !!
