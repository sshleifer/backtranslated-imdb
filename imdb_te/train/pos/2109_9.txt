I have been looking at this many times since I was shot in some dumb, prolonged, romantic comedy. Well, it's a romantic comedy, and maybe a little bit dated. Nevertheless, it is not a state of empathy, it acts on office politics, adultery, and loneliness. You think you know exactly what arises, but there is an unforeseen element of your interest, and everything will change until you guess. But there is enough frustration and charm to touch the film with a lot of frustrations. If you meet the person who does not like this movie, you will carefully consider how well you want to know them.
