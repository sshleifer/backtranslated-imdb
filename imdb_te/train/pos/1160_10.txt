It's funny. It is Arthur Miller or T.S. No Elliot, but man is this funny. Klein and Fields are great. She called her "Toss I Did-It Line" as she climbed onto her window, "God Is Very Quickly Denied!" - Klein runs on the door after Terry Hatcher's cut) - Robert Downey Jr. and Kathy Moriardy find out who he really is ... A soap opera turn if everyone is there! <br /> <br /> <br /> The scene at the Chinese dining area has my children and I am rolling on the floor - the scene <br /> <br /> Do not solve or show any of the world's problems of daytime TV (I hope). Very fun.
