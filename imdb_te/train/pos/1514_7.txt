Hammer's all-starred, this most influential slice of British horror revolves around a house and the fortunes of the previous heroes, whose stories are told to the Scotland Yard Detective in search of a missing actor. <br /> <br /> The storyline, which impresses only four stories, is dealing with a writer and his wife, home and plans in a book he wrote in horror novels. He creates a chaotic character named Dominic, a very creepy looking stranger, and he sees himself madly as he begins to see the beast everywhere he's gone. After convincing him to seek his wife's psychiatric treatment, a sub-plot will be introduced, which clearly does not work for me. <br /> <br /> The next story (best in my opinion) was a great Peter Kushinger, Philip Grayson, who moved home for his retirement years and soon walked to the nearby wax museum (in Marcaber), as he was a woman from his past He was very scared to find a wax figure. Soon, an old friend (who had a history with this woman) was in town for business and dots to see him. <br /> <br /> The story is one of my favorite of the three stars ... Christopher Lee featuring John, two men who are discovering that this woman is more than they meet, are for a rude awakening. Reed. Upon returning home with his strange daughter, Jane, he suspected that Reid would block his daughter from her daughter. <br /> <br /> Last story is a lightweight vampire story featuring John Pertwy and Ingrid Pitt. After purchasing a clock from the mysterious trader, actor Paul Henderson goes into a lot of life that he has shot many times in his career. <br /> <br /> In total, motion and direction is very good, performances. Here and there are effective gothic touches and an effective score to complete the atmosphere. It's a keeper, and comes highly recommended.
