The film was first seen a few years ago when I was not working on a trio channel, and recently I saw again - Sans ads - in Sundance. I was impressed for the first time, and I looked at it for a second time. Yes, some sections are perfect - Amor Gottai's silly commentary is like a thumb toe - collectively taken, 11 09 01 overall victory. The best of the show: In the glorious final section of Shihi Imamura, contemporary reviewers have misunderstood Mick LaSalle, a faint intellectual, as an attack on 'terrorists', but now it is revealed postwar postwar match; Samira Makhalabh's early part of a deep sympathy with a principal concern for the children of Afghanistan for 9/11 victims; Edemy Ouarroago's amusing children's Crusade - Osama bin Laden is a hugely intense and successful hunt for Real Osama. If Yusuf Chahain's segment is a failed experiment, bin Laden and al-Qaeda are primarily American foreign policy and CIA's creations, while Sean Penn's character is not a study area, but an effective bitter piece of film making. Alive Stone's reaction to the Emergency View and Scenery of the World Trade Center.
