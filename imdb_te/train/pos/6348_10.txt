<br /> <br /> Jim Carrey is very good, and although "Jim Carry's moments" are very few, it's definitely not a "Jim Carrey movie". <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is mostly targeted at children. It was promoted in Israel as another Jim Carrey film, so those who dreamed of the superstitiousness of the top comedy were disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film has good scenes and works well as an image for kids. I can not say that I love this movie, but I am not a target audience again!
