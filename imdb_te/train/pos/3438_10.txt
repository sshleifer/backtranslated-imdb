Despite the NC-17 ratings and disturbing scenes, the film is very unusual. Of course things like this happen and that's why this movie shows it too. It all starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson in a magnificent performance), began to attend college, and she loved everything. She joins Jared (Chad Faust a wonderful acting) in the original gentleman and sweetened Frant Party. He invites her to dinner. They see the stars from a bridge and they go to his apartment. They speak and take her to the basement, they become one-on-one. She tries to end it, but he raises her. This incident kills her. She meets a Bartender / DJ Adrian (played by Marcus Patrick), she is drunk and helps her before she goes too far. They strike a friendship. He also starts using drugs and maya as well. In other words, she introduces a different world. She went to school and started working as a TA (Teaching Assistant) and reads Jarred, one of the students. Despite the students taking mid-term, she caught Jared fraud. Jared Maya tries to smooth the word, but she still decides to top up to invite him to his place. Is history repealed? Or do you have a surprise for the graz? You are watching the movie. Wonderful A. Rosario Dawson portrayed the attention and patience. Chad Faust does not want him to be a strong man, but he has done an excellent job as Jared. Marcus Patrick Maya and Kochus are very intelligent for her in a new world. This film deserves an award.
