It's really unfortunate that most people outside of Canada are snow, mountains and hockey players with only things produced by Canada. <br /> <br /> In the past few weeks (the first is "The Red Violin"), I've seen better than any of the best Hollywood attempts. <br /> <br /> Gustad Noble is that; He was a middle-aged Parsi bank employee in Bombay in the 1970s. The film manifests various things that will happen to him about his family, his friends and his work, and his impact on him. At the same time, it is an attractive one, at the time I imagine a definite description of the middle and urban life in India. <br /> <br /> However, read the Rohinton Mistry book a few years ago. As you can imagine, the complexity of the book can not be summarized, but if you read a really good book and see a good movie, see "Such a Long Journey".
