On the side of some titles and new Sherlock Holmes film, I saw every movie directed by Guy Richie. Twice. Needless to say, I was a big fan and one of the reasons why Revolver Highlighted. This film is very different from Richie, and you see it compared to lock, stock ... and snatches. Revolver set us up for a mental thriller as a jumbling con finds himself to the unpredictable enemy forces and finds a guided walk for his liberation that he does not need. Andr√© Benjamin of OutKast fame has strengthened his acting ability, while other standout acts portrayed Ray Leota Maniac Mister D / Macha and Mark Strong Sorter. <br /> <br /> Japan's chaotic casino owner, Macha, Jack uses his time alone, using it as a planner to force his hand to tear down the Macha and steal him in seven years he spent. When he earns card game victories and collects a good amount from Maca, Jake finds the end of his death and is diagnosed with a desperate disease that has left him for three days. However, a team of debt sharks has a response to him and a ticket - if he has given them all the money they have and are working for them to work, he has made himself a jacket to show how dangerous it is to show Makkah everything. Along with the wind of death loom, and with his money a pair of loan shores on the field day, Jake also has to deal with a hit on him, which introduces the Sorter - a successful man in the job of Macha. Jake finds that some of his colleagues, who have spent time with Jake's loneliness, are carrying him all because he is a well-known debt shark. Into the path. Jake (Vincent pastor) and Avi Jake look at the reality, but he is alone because he is alone, Jake is the creator of his mind and his real existence after his ego. Jake and Macha describe Hubbling's approach to both. Both hold together their inner demons. <br /> <br /> This is the top line in the style of the sand of the criminal world. Represent and have characters. Although many of Ritchie's earlier films are still present, it still has its own existence from dialogue, sets and experiments in gangster style. It's also a great trip to finding out when you're modest and you can easily accomplish what you do or you can let your ego or a preset feeling mask with the ability to overcome what you do. The characters are well painted in the film, Ritchie is real to fashion and throws a band in every aspect. <br /> <br /> I would like to go about this film and its special little things but if you do not yet see, I want to be far away from it. But when it goes through all the intricate layers, it's a great movie and should look at it. If you're fortunate and do not see the US release you've been releasing, look for a real UK version of what you can do to make a great discussion section with friends when you try in the puzzle you've taken in your UK. I initially saw it with my team around 2006 and we are still talking about the little things we have today. <br /> <br /> "The Richly box is pulled out and his chopper broke a bit." <br /> <br /> Standing: "Fear or respect me, we are unique, we share an addiction, we agree with junkies."
