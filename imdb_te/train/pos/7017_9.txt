You spent a lot of time in this two-hour movie "What's the story about the main character?" <br /> <br /> If you continue to guess Will Smith, less-key "Ben Thomas". When you find the last 20-25 minutes, it's a worse ... but it's revealed to be dramatic. Until then, Smith, it plays the mysterious, almost hunting people. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, you know that he has a good reason, but ultimately we do not guess, Rosario Dawkins ("Emily Pose") discourages some of the audience Or wants to leave this movie ... but the last long part puts all the pieces of this puzzle together. <br /> <br / It is not a two-hour movie and a distinctive action-packed macho Will Smith film. Of course, Smith's frightened and sad face in this story is very surprising. It's almost like a lot of shots like him. He looks like lost weight and sick. <br /> <br /> Like a good movie, this movie has been thinking long after the end credits.
