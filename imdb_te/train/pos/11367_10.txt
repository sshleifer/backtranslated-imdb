WARNING: Spoilers may have ... <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie 3 times and I liked it every time. After seeing again, I always remember how good I was. An HBO TV movie - Most of their movies have been well-made - I've earned Oscars for performances that were released to the general distribution instead of TV. <br /> <br /> I'm sure anyone who reads from other reviews here is a serial killer, Andre Chikitty story. He has killed 56 people in 8 years in the former Soviet Union. (3 victims were buried and 52 of his 53 killed were not convicted only). The story actually focuses on forensic analyst Victor Burekov's perfection through Stephen Rayia. A man who is tortured and obsessed with finding this killer despite the extra barriers placed by party hacks, is absolutely essential for his part. At the end of the 18 months after the stress and frustration, there is a very touching view of how America is dealing with serial killer cases. According to this oxa, Burkachov worked more than 5 years before getting his first break. Three years later, he ended the case. In this scene, his superiest, General Fetisov, played by Donald Sutherland, actually apologizes to his dedication and apologized without knowing he had given a break. <br /> <br /> RIA 's performance is great When he breaks the role of a hell of finding his killer, he finds, does not chew or do anything. He is a hobbyist, but does not typically show it as detective films. He was only occasionally disappointed that silently could survive in such circumstances. Rhea with his face and his eyes is very high, he does not need to overtake. He just * - driven to despair, at one time, despair, so long after his character, he actually said he'd rather find 3 at a time rather than a year none. What he understands is that he does not want more people to die, he just wants to catch this man with some clues. Riya will feel to this man. <br /> <br /> "In the light of the character, Jeffrey did well to him, and he did something (it was impossible but it was impossible) <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland is doing a great job as Colonel Fetisov (later promoted as General), who has been working hard to help Bourakov intercept anybody Max Von Sido is also very good to identify what kind of perception they are looking for, and he is really active in helping Baracov help. /> <br /> This film is a morbid  , వింతైన మరియు హింసాత్మక కథ, అది కిల్లర్ కన్నా కిల్లర్ని పట్టుకోవటానికి నిజంగా ఏమి జరుగుతుంది అనే దాని గురించి మరింత ఎక్కువగా ఉంది. జరిమానా ప్రదర్శనలు మరియు ఒక గొప్ప స్క్రీన్ ప్లేతో చాలా చక్కగా చేసిన చిత్రం చుట్టూ. The screenplay performs the right thing to do with what's best in this type of film: Give real moments and people * behind the facts * Keep them in a dramatic plan as you might know. <br /> <br /> From 10 stars
