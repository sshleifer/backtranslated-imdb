<br /> <br /> "Days" is a simple family drama with a small catch - you should really relate to the emotions of the character in every way possible in order to appreciate the performance. <br /> They are alert with the show <br /> <br /> This is the story of Cooper Day, Family Middle World for all those involved in the program. He records his family with his family and hopes to become a great and well-known writer one day due to his observations. His family is a mother, father, perfect sister, and intellectual-little brother. John Scott Shepard is the first episode to be a bit stupid sound since the creation of the situation, both the sister and the mother are pregnant. It is the first condition that the author hits. Then the father did not leave his job in a law firm. The younger son panic takes the attack. The middle child fights with sister's boyfriend. <br /> I admire this presentation. I do not know. It's a bit worse but I like it. At first I thought the camera worked as a ripoff but I started to like it before I got used to it. I loved quiet conversations in the dark light. I loved the show's intimate feel. I liked the low budget style. I like acting. I admire the story. Then I want the second season of The Days. 6-episode broadcasting on ABC, I became a fan of slow. It's a good show and it's nothing like the OC. Both have nothing in common. <br /> If you are involved with Abby, Jack, Natalie, Cooper or Nate, you will like this show. Too.
