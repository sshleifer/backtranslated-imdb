Lillian Helman, one of the most famous female playwrights in the United States, is a woman with mission. Her left sentiments were not well considered at that time in the country. In her history, the Soviet Union describes her visit, as she is surprised by the success achieved through this system. "Look at the Rain" will be the result of those years. <br /> <br /> In the US, Left Wing, in addition to Europe, Japan also has a problem throughout the world with fascism. <br /> <br /> "Look at the Rain" Broadway eight years before the Japanese Pearl Harbor attack. In which Hellman announced the introductions of the American World War II. This affiliation is paid to her late helmin and dashy hammettes. The film was well received when Herman Shumlin directed the film in 1943. <br /> <br /> We are acquainted with the Maller family. They are crossing the border from Mexico to the United States. They are Washington, D.C. Mrs. Muller has to stay home, where her mother, Fanny Farrelli, is a small celebrity hostess. We realized that Müllers, from Germany, flew out of Europe due to anti-monopoly violence against opponents of the totalitarian regime. <br /> <br /> In fact, in a way, Mullers defended the good of the Jews. <br /> <br /> Mr. Müller feels terribly at the local land, as well as other places, because Fosim is publicly publicly public. <br /> <br /> The little one knows that he is coming to his mother-in-law's house in one of the most deadly households in this philosophy. This is interesting because of the supporting role of Betty Davis. Kurt Müller convinced Paul Lucas to be a steep man who wants to make a good world for himself and his family, repeating his Broadway role. Mr. Lucas played the role of Kurt Muller, and he reprized a bright role on a stage in Broadway. <br /> <br /> This family is Ferrarielli, with other best acting. Geraldine Fitzgerald, a guest of Ferrellis, is married to Marty de Brancovis, married to Nazi sympathizer named Tech de Brancoquis, meditated by George Cowauris. Bellucci Bondi, Donald Woods, and the rest of the cast will give good performances led by Mr. Schumlin. <br /> <br /> The film should act as a reminder of the evils of totalitarian rule.
