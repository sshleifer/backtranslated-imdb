<br /> <br /> When my dog ​​daddy passed away, I was a kid-friendly film, so I tried to be enthusiastic. <br /> (Beware Dove, I mean spoilers) This movie is just for kids and it's very simple. It was set in New Orleans in 1939. First, the film was not featured as an additional family member, but was the older to face his own complex life. <br /> In the beginning, Charlie is not very different from his fraudulent and ruthless business partner, CarFace. He was driven out, greedy, and fled from death, he mentioned in that initially. Charlie can learn the difference between Charlie and Carface and be ready to listen to others; Anne Mary and his sidekick, Itchy. <br /> <br /> The Corrsface is trying to kill Heroes because he wants to 100% profit in their business, only 50% will not settle - the most unusual way to die for a German Shepherd Mix. Also, your life will be eaten by a prehistoric sized alligator that ends when you sing because it is very likely whether you are a dog or not. It's a cartoon, hence the reasoning is here. <br /> <br /> By the murder of the system of carpets, Charlie believes that victory is the best revenge and financial success. After his death, he started business with Carpace's financing source, the most talented girl who has the ability to communicate with animals. They win a whole bunch of races, and Charlie tells her to pay for poor - reference instructions: Charlie and Itchy live in a junkyard and thus are poor. He uses money on his casino / bar / theater, and not the other "poor". Anne Mary has the ability to speak with animals, and she cares carefully. By her gambling, lying and stealing she teaches Charlie morality. Charlie tries to do it by buying her dress. <br /> <br /> Charlie uses violence and property damage to suppress the business. Charlie loses everything and all this little girl he left. And finally she had to choose between her life and her own. He first sees self-preservation and sets it up when the girl sinks. Both the girl and the watch drowned, and he had to choose it, and he chose the girl. <br /> <br /> The great part about this movie, and the ability of the child to cope with the natural event of their pet's death, it's never dying to anyone! The watch represents his life, and the watch is shown and stopped and stopped. All deaths are also suggested to the villain. I did not cry in the film yet and I had to write about it and share it with you.
