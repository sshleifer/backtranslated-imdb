This is a great movie. It is an attractive story, an excellent main character, good acting and killer actions. It happens mostly in 2036 but shows scenes in past years to explain the stories. <br /> <br /> This story works well and there are no holes. Kurt Russell Todd, Solidar, was trained to kill since he was born and did not have normal lives for other soldiers. In the end, the military introduces new, young, fast and strong soldiers. Jason Scott Lee is one of them. As a result they do not need old soldiers like toad. They tested new soldiers by fighting with older soldiers, Russell was wounded in battle and felt dead. <br /> Military forces think his body as well as some others are dead but they do not realize that Russell is alive. <br /> <br /> Todd had discovered a civilized camp on this planet and dumped him. For a while he lived there but could not adjust to normal life. He rarely tells a word and he is sometimes very aggressive towards other people. They sent him to the desert when they thought they were in danger. <br /> When new Russians are attacked when Russell leaves. The soldiers forgot to train soldiers as smart and other older soldiers. While these new soldiers were faster and stronger than Todd, Todd easily defeated them. The army recognizes this and Todd kills their men. That's Jason Scott Lee and you'll eventually see the classic fight scene between Russell and Scott Lee. <br /> This is one of the best action films I have ever seen and I have seen a lot. It has everything that you can ask in a movie including some great lines. When Russell called the women "Sir", the writer whom she had never seen before was not even forgotten. <br /> <br /> An incredible one-man army action movie for fans of Rambo, Commando and Missing in Action. All of this is highly recommended for Kurt Russell fans and action / sci-fi fans.
