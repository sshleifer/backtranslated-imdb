I have to admit, I do not expect much of watching this film in my Japanese film class, but this film really got me away. The director is doing a great job with the title of his film, which really depicts the mad picture. The fact that I am silent in this film adds insane madness, helping the audience to experience the inner world of the characters than the world outside the mind. This film vs foreign silent pictures. My feelings about American feel are odd, overseas films work much longer to exercise your brain, and a pleasurable ending always goes for a fluffy picture and exercises less exercise.
