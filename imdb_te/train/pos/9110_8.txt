Do you know Our soul is based on that revolution, it's sleeping ... I can explain, I think !! Until April 25, 1974, our independence was not restricted, we did not have freedom, but when the revolution came, the Portuguese people seemed to have lost his opinion, our speech was liberty! That is the evolution of the revolution! I feel clear! ... about the film ... I think there are some mistakes on the role of some characters, I'm looking good to watch on Portuguese films! I liked it so much!
