I bought the DVD and I (Terry, after seeing Brazil and frightening a hatred in Las Vegas), Terry will do again. The genius of Terry Gilliam, Bruce Willis James Cole, and (probably my favorite character) Brad Pitt plays a wonderful role in this science fiction thriller, being a fan of Monte Python films, Jeffery Goins. <br /> <br /> There are suspense, drama, action, etc. <br /> The plot survives a disease that is aimed at wiping out the pre-built human species by a "twelve-year-old army" in the future of the world's population in the future. James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent back to 1996 (when the virus is eliminated) to learn about the disease, so scientists at his time can find remedies. Before I go ahead, James Cole lives in an underground society and will rule the world on the surface of animals due to the killing of humans. However, when he was sent back he was originally sent back to the 1990s, where he was sent to a mental institution because he told people of the virus. When he spent time he met Jeffery Goins (Brad Pitt), who was responsible for wiping out the human race afterwards. He retains his psychiatrist (Madeline Stowe) in the end with Bruce (who looks right in his own words), returning from his time as he spent his time and until 1996 he inquired his own intellectuals, but then to reveal the breathtaking concluding quarter And lead to a somewhat shocking climax Tundi, where he was carrying the virus from person to person (not the fact that Brad Pitt) tries to stop and, instead of being carried away by the police for the killer shoots.
