I first saw this film about 4 years ago and wish something funny like CB4. I flew away. I am very good on my butt laughing ground from this movie. CB4, characters, songs, plots, are better than everything. The top-notch independent movie given by "Both Looks Good" by Siskel and Egbert (and two older white guys know the humor in this movie, you know better).
