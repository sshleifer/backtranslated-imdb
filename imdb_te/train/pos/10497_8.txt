I thought it was wonderful and I would still do it. I am grateful that I was able to see different things from Hollywood's floods. Save Grace is smart and enjoyable - those who feel ruined by the marijuana thing go to see some sort of America's bride. <br /> <br /> Save Grace also shows that a funny picture is not to be stupid. I'm laughing at my donkey at the very least, but I also think of questions about the female role that women want to pay for her husband's mortgage. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell - witty storyline with good English humor and good acting and directing. <br /> You do not have to ask more. <br /> <br />
