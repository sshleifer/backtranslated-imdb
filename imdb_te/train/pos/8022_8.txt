Jim Henson's Muppets was my favorite since childhood. This film is again like a kid. Well, Muppets returned with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and their friends. In the campus they are trying to stay in New York City, rather than anywhere on a musical show in Broadway. You will see the characters by the then New York City Mayor Ed Koch. However, the film will change to 25 years and I will learn to congratulate the kids Muppets Gang's heartbeat today. The problem with the show is that Kermit does not go and the gang has to find him in New York City. It is worth seeing children and even sentimental adults like me.
