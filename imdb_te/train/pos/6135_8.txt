Bad Snows & Broomsticks are one of the art pieces of the disco. It is filmed with interaction with animation and animations with actors and actresses. (A similar concept was used in Mary Papins when children and Mary disappeared in the pavement art.) I'm mainly in the children's eyes because I did not see it in years. By that time it was one of my favorite films. It's my favorites of magical and spiritual, late sequences (fighting the beginning of the deadly shield of walking into battle). There is a lot of mad-stop stop-animation (i.e., people switch into rabbits), it's a little too late and might be silly. (I believe that the film starts slowly.) In the eyes of the child, this is a fun movie and puts them in film locations for children. This is an imaginary film, which is largely forgotten by sin.
