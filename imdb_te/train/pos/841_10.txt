I found this to be the most entertaining dark comedy. Brosnan intellectual; As someone has now witnessed, he will not be pigeonholed in the bond role. Kinnear's character was attractive and funny to anyone. I do not know if I was laughing in any film! What an unexpected joy! My favorite line will be 'I feel like a Bangkok hooker on a Sunday after Navy left town. Brosnan distributed this much un-bond line with such an unexpected comic maneuver. I was also impressed with the performance of Hope Davis. Like everyone else in the film, it seems to have really improved comedy from their previous work. If you like the dark and happy 'The Weather Man', you will definitely like it. <br /> I voted for 10 people.
