Interesting form in Japan before opening to the West. Perry's gunboat comes in line with the deal from diplomacy from Japan's first consul of John Wayne Perry's diplomatic mission to Japan. He is not welcome. It eventually brought the cholera epidemic introduced by an American ship after his meeting with the Shogun. Following a colorful procession for the presents of the capital for the Shogun, which contains an old Tangfu bottle. The meeting with the Shogun, the negotiations between the great Japanese people and the interesting viewpoints of the murder period during an archery performance. Overall an enjoyable movie and Duke How often do you lose half the size of a Duke?
