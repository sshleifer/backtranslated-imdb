Fay Grim is a continuation of the story that began ten years ago with Hareley's Henry Fool. I did not see the movie before, and I did not know it was a good thing or not. <br /> <br /> For most people, Hal Hart's filmmaking style is something you do not like or you do not. The combination of his actions, drama, absurdity and powder, ironic humor really resonates with me, and Fay Grimm is no exception. It is the wind of many clever parody laughing loudly at the Melbourne International Film Festival audience. For the first half of the film it was distributed with relentless and modest goodness. It's ridiculous humorous style and welcome relief in hearty teen comic films that are pumped out like pumpkins like Hollywood pancakes. <br /> <br /> In the second half of this film, an international espionage / conspiracy thriller into the comedy film Marfels. It is not clear whether Hart's intent or objectivity from his thoughts, but I think it's the first momentum of a bit film to compile or rewrite the film's fifteen minutes to cut. <br /> <br /> Performances are generally good, especially Parker Posey and Jeff Gold Blume, who have a long time screen. Saffron Burrows, James Ribianak, Carl Montgomery and Elina Lovenson played all the supporting roles. Visuals of the film are good (set in New York, Paris, Berlin and Istanbul) and music (also by Hurtley). The film is well written and I enjoyed it very much. If you like Hart's previous work, you probably prefer it.
