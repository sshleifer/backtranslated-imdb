This very interesting project is a very interesting project. Collect 11 leading international directors and allocate one of them to create a piece of their choice of 11 minutes, 9 seconds and 1 frame; Every small one that explores the echoes of the 9/11 world. Without any spoilers, the piece of Ken Loach is a jewel in the crown, and Mira Nair's short (segment "India"), based on the true story, is a complete movie. Seeing his voice, why is Alejandro Gonzalez's one of the best directors in the world? He is just a headmaster in the media and he has a lot of awareness about the subject. Unfortunately, not all 11 episodes. Youssef Chahain assumes the Arab attitude of self-motivated mass guilt in his section "Egypt", which is one of the most interesting pieces. He failed miserably. Chinese's smallest is written and poorly executed, at least in between the film's top and other chapters. Despite the imbalance in quality, I would still give it 7/10 for the concept, if not for execution.
