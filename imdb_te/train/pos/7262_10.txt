My daughter, her friends and I have literally seen dozens of movies. I bought it twice and some little friends fled with it. Later, I rented it several times. It just gets old !!! The blockbuster is no longer on their lists and I have tried, purchased and rented for over 5 years. Without a doubt, this is my most favorite movie of childhood and my daughter ... it's all there! We laughed, we cried, we discussed in real life and how hard some children have in the world. Nothing is about the film. We are related to every second and every line of bill! One million thanks to restoring our faith on human nature. Sincerely, Shelley and Kylin Wanderme. Craven, Saskatchewan. CANADA, EH !!! <br /> Update of August '07: <br /> Who should we judge if the rich man falls in love with a poor man? Or a loving person chooses to raise a child without a child. It's not my or your life. It's not reliable, it happens every day. Thanks to God! My faith in human nature is alive! Celebrate !!!!
