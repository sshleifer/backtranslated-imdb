After applying straight from the place where one of the stories is left in, the second legacy necessarily sets the stage for decline and the worst side of man's legacy. In contrast to the first distinction, both represent a transition from the deaf and fame of a revolutionary country, with a country's free-born man struggling with previous relationships. Change of the setting is not just aesthetic; The transition from the spring and autumn seasons of the spring season to this character comes from a change of tone and heart, with a cynical, damaged and wounded reality with a new retirement, replacing the optimism of the predecessor. But can he tell himself? That fight is just a fight. Part One is certainly touted by the revolutionary guerilla of the initial spontaneity into power, which takes advantage of a more tangible, insolent and bleak segment of life and passion, and it gives both a sharp, Tone off and part of the tone If you are dramatically different from the one in /> <br style. /> <br, the same documentary policy that was taken over a month ago is removing the play and the fabrication is as much as possible. Chey's story and fight This somewhat distant, cool approach does not hesitate to stop some audience; Really, have I been reserved for a person to be named? Overall, the whole story is taken over the whole story, beyond the biography and instead of a man who provides documents in the fight to help him along the way. What does not mean trying to paint a manual picture compared to what Zarubborg Hersheinel der Otergang did seven decades ago (not contradictory); <br /> <br /> The deaf is a slow moving, reserved and mediocre approach, which is a lesson to say a lesson. Bolivia's tragically and decisive backlash for Cuba's landscapes and part two, the story does not inevitably feel too chaotic from its predecessor, but takes on a tone with a clear margin that makes enough to give its own tip. Here, is the initial struggle for Part One basic structure, wars, fallen comrades and the recruitment that replaces them? Re-imposed, though we see some glimpses of man behind the movement. Furthermore, anyone who finds out with the vague idea of ​​the original history behind the symptom, is partially destined to end on the lesser and unsatisfying note. This difference, combined with similarities to Part One, make a comprehensive and memorable amount; For everything, both can be digested as their own (and variations to Soderbergh) and enjoyed as if they were, but made as a statement, doing what exactly they could achieve. <br /> <br /> In fact, Part One is a slow-building central cast of a month before, realistic constructive action scenes ?? The drama characters are still quite clear from the inherently subtle yet immersive exhibitions here that everything that is made on the screen is just obscure and ambiguous, but with this feature, Part Two will never harm a film unless there are enough plot and reflection on other items to keep the directors engaged. In fact, while writing this review I had an inequality on whether I would add a paragraph or two to my initial review for Part One, and I'd like to do the whole review title, and that's what disillusion who sits down to watch the two films in a row. /> <br /> That said, "I do not have the four-hour audience to engage in the work until it's a decree or plus runtime, but when I look at the two sections I have to be able to verify the capability of every part. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Robert Ward Review (http://www.invocus.net)
