I saw Jane Austen as a slave and I suspect the cinematic rendering of the complexity of her novels: this change is just perfect, intelligent, delicate, careful, touchable, dignified, in one word, perfect! <br /> <br /> "Emma" is one of Aston's most exhilarating and funny novels, thanks to the whole satirical situation and the characters. The film respects this subtle satire that ignores the comic element (above all of Miss Bates). I have engaged myself in my novel and this film is apparently the deepest knowledge of the human life shown by the English novelist and the modern form of women, men and their relationship, and we believe it's unbelievable that a 18th-century novelist novelist spent her almost solitary life, Such depth and truth about life as she did Incagaladu: the most and still attracts me. We can experience this modernity throughout the film: just change clothes and use more current language, but conditions, feelings, ideas are very modern. I feel that I am concerned about the unhealthy interest in other people's lives, or the relationships of women who are now obscene, and the difficulty in exposing, and the feelings of a person, especially love: every situation is universal and out-of-time value. <br /> <br /> The cast is truly talented and offers very good and very spectacular performances: this young man Gwyneth Paltrow fits specially for this character (she is probably more mature now), Toni Colt is just great. And I envy them for the amazing costumes they wear! And then, every situation takes on such a magic and dream-like size ... here is an amazing enjoyable and deserving image.
