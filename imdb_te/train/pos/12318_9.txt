I'm not the biggest fan of Warwork-based martial arts films when I walk straight for the crew, rather than in a moving battle, and I'm so much fun out there and the cinematic plot and crazy flying shenanigans. Ching Siyu Tung has made a lovely treat here with excellent performance and a lot of space beauty. The great, tragic Leslie Cheung plays the role of a tax collector who lives at night in a funny temple and is associated with an incredible fox soul and an absurd Taoist. Cheung's performance is filled with innocent but dignified appeal, and Wu has been able to keep our Taoist nun in the wall happier, performing some scissors and a musical number. Joey Wang Fox's soul is the best of all, and the joy that attracts every move and reaction is really enthusiastic. The film takes on the themes of fantasy, horror, comedy and romance, all of which are added in a continuously entertaining package. Ching Siu Tung, choreography directing and maintaining offers some cool voiceth thrillers, and fills with films, shadows and water filled forest colors, each forest scene gives an amazingly pleasant atmosphere. Although I did not make a mistake, Joey Wang's feminist foxes have a fantastic touch, with beautiful hair styling and beautiful flowing clothing of female characters. The film takes relatively little action and sometimes cheesy cheerful pop songs, which is a lovely amusing entertaining film featuring lyrical characters and plot, odd Neat character arc, visual treats and extensive dreaming atmosphere. An excellent treasure, well-recommended.
