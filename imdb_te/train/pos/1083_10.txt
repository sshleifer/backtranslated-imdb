Another example of Cary Grant's unique talent. The Oscar is worthy of consideration, and once again missed the academy. Mr. Grant runs the voice of the memory from the big city about the guy who decides to get out of the big city. <br /> <br /> The weaknesses in building a house are the most modern and modern Tom Hanks vehicle (loose) for "The Money Pit". <br /> <br /> If you have good old-fashioned comedy and inappropriate sex, this is a must-see film.
