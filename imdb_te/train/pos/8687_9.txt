This is the second entry in the regular Colombo series and this is fine. Looking closely now on the DVD and let's see how this is built, Bernard L. I was very impressed with Kowalski's direction (better Matcho Kallahnn and countless TV episodes directed) The killing of the killer's murder demonstrated a split-screen effect on his two glasses, see murder as seen in montage fashion, shot-off-view from the corporeal perspective Watch the shot. Also, the wild but impressive Avant-Garde musical score from the famous Jazzmann Gill Melley is great and has helped to create the atmosphere. And Bret Halsey's supporting performance as Golf Pro is amazing - such subtlety and complexity in a role of a dimensional cutout from ten times nine. The "principle" is not yet set when this episode is filmed, so there are still some surprising elements of Colombo's techniques. In fact, Faulk, Robert Culpa and Ray Milland were the highest quality actors and were delighted to work with them - all men and other characters were well-known and lost in their roles here. In all, this entry in the Colombo series - and many others - are well designed to be a very good movie.
