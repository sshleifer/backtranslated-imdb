Kate Beckinsale steals the show! Bravo! It is not good to see very bad nightly Jeremy North. Mark Strong has done a tremendous job. Bernard Hepton is perfect as Emmaus's father. I love the end sequence (which is novel-but well-written) when I am together with my workers and elite community friends in the harvest and nasili. Emma should now show that she accepts it. She is a converted woman. It's very quick, but okay. I'll buy it. Samantha Bond plays Emma's former colleague and trustee. She is amazing. As I imagined her. I believe the UK makes its best for a Jane Austen. American versions of English literature are made for money and are not for quality. See this one!
