I really liked this movie. Of course the idea is pretty much ... set up to establish a tracking device fitted into the jaw of a small-time thief of lure a more dangerous burger / computer hacker out of hiding the federal government. But Avin Saunders, man feds "apparatus" to be fitted to "volunteer" is the person who is very fond of and it becomes quite fun to get in his head with him for a while. Alvin finally shows that he is not easily cheated as he proves himself better than a funny, passive or single-dimensional character. A perfect watch watch.
