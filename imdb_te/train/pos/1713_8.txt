This is a kind of film that has been with you for so long. Both Soha Ali and Abhay Deol are very beautiful. Soh you remember her mother Sharmila Tagore very much. Abhay is a birthday actor and a lot of future in the future. <br /> <br /> The ending of this film is quite different from most of the movies. If you are not satisfied in a way, realistically, if you really think about it, it's just the ending of this movie. Otherwise, it was a serious injustice to everyone. <br /> <br /> The film is a professional witness looking forward to getting married in court. Her boyfriend does not appear and she has helped her. Slowly, over time, he falls in love for her. She is not clear if she has such feelings. See the image for full details. <br /> <br /> This film is truly a part of Abhay. I'm looking forward to seeing more movies from him. Soha is beautiful but does not speak in the movie too. Her eyes, she speaks a lot of innocence.
