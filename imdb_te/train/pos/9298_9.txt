One of the simplest movies was one of the films I've seen. It's parody of everything that Chicago represents in the 1930s, is the parody of crime life - This film requires less assessment because rating is less 5. A mass opinion, and mass is hypnotized. Who decide to see it - will regret it, decide not to see it - will have to regret more.
