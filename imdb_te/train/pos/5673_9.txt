<br /> <br /> Practically all episodes are fun, I personally like the episode of 'French Invasion', but with superstitions, 'MACBETH' is really fun, the way Rowan should play with is really great (English). <br /> Actors: Never play Scottish again and again; Blackdard: Oh, so you want to say Scottish play? <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of Rowan and I have a great deal of his work, /> <br /> I think Rowan will continue his great style, But I will already be working in Bean 2 movie this year, I can not wait because we think we can consider him. <br /> <br /> I give this 3rd Blackdard 10 out of 10 ratings.
