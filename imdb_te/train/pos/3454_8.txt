With a huge cast and when I talked about it I never even heard I had to watch about it. I'm not bad at Justin's performance, it's obviously the worst from the group, but it's a pretty impressive group, with Dylan McDermott being two names that Cory Elwes and did not even list the first credits. The story is basic, a journalist is boycotting the corrupt police, but I found it worked well. The character of L L Cool J is clearly controversial, but I'm honestly not sure what he will do. Morgan Freeman has always been a wise teacher figure he has done well, and I love Kevin SPACEy, he's just kind of. <br /> Surprisingly, I thought Dylan McDermott was the best performer of a homicide police. Really believable and really in the role, he twice freaked me out. <br /> I'm really honest. Horrible catchphrases, unfair action sequences, stuff like that, but it was surprisingly well done and I did not find any. <br /> <br /> Overall, the amazing cast, the good story that makes me curious, makes me curious and just take action. I do not know why this has appeared in theaters, and better than some of the worst I saw on the big screen. I'll say it is worth watching.
