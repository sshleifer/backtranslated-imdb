First of all, I loved Kanal 1, which is a lot of humor in the canoe of a cannon, he always seems to be in the wrong place, he still plays the same person but in my opinion he is not as funny as in the first film Not all of him is very noticeable. This thing is badly thought about the movie, the movie is only the race boats, they are definitely fast but the waves like big floating buildings in the first film do not do that, I'm old enough and the new canoes are one of the last cannons in Cano suddenly that little speed Avoid "big waves" from boats Then going to be fun. Really minus. You agree that in 1974 you are living in the same Sweden. The film has a little more violence than the first one. The film is great in all. I'm concentrating on some of the frustrated cons, but the rest of the film has received my expectations, so let's see! It's worth the money.
