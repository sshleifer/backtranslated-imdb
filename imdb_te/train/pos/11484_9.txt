I'm back from Zero Day's Montreal premiere ... I'm surprised to find a negative commentary on the film. In fact, undoubtedly Kokoyo is doing an easy and violent social message ... Well, Mr-I'm-a-reviewer, it's an easy and hyperbole critic of movies with a social charge. <br /> <br /> I want to expose my life here, but I have come from a small town with a similar school than these towns. Ignore menu & ignorance. Thing ... I understand how young children are driven to make such horrors. High schools become battlefields of compatibility. This is a real ugly vision. Fight your way like the others. It's hard to explain, that many people dit many people realize that schools are changing the human intellectual cemeteries. Meanwhile, parents have closed their eyes and are laughing about how perfect their life in their comfortable suburbs. <br /> <br /> The real motive for the film is not about driving them. It's like the death of the calm and everybody is trying to close their eyes and create this atmosphere of perfect town. The call was great. It's a awakening call. The drama is everywhere and takes every shape. In that case, small dramas (known as a mad for wearing Andre JC Penney shirt) became the worst nightmare in the whole town. Andre & Call took the most serious way to express their pain. <br /> <br /> I especially like the last scenes that some of the Andre & With the pain they communicate, Call and Andr√© has informed their blind passion for their team, their refusal to think of some of the causes of action. <br /> <br /> It seems to be an act of aggression, but meditating more than just listening or admiring coscio. What is Andrey & Call live is a reality ... and a scary one to get other kids. <br /> <br /> Annoying motion picture ... The most disturbing image made by home and strong feeling Ben Cocoa.
