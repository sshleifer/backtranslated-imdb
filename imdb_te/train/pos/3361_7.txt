I intend to remember the 10th anniversary of Marcello Maestroyi's passage with many unwelable films that I own in VHS; However, when the ongoing light-hearted Christmas Marathon was given, I had to do this! It happens, it has one of his best performances - and he has just nominated the Oscar (the film itself has the same respect). It is one of 14 cooperations with the most widely recognized actors originating from Italy, Sophia Loren. Two, incidentally, play against the type here - she is an unglamorous housewife and he's a homosexual! By the way, the title of the film is a double meaning: Hitler met with Mussolini in the historic day of the historic day (this incident is shown in large archive footage), but more specifically their moments of friendship, rhyme and brief, hobbies Participation represents the stars 'brief encounter' - each is their usual However, the film's sudden sweet sweets can lead to the end. It actually consists of two different characters - the whole story - in which Lorenn's gruesome and seriously patriotic husband was surprised by the opening and closing sequences only for Nassius Concierge of Apartment Block, played by John Vernon); Still, the narrow set of director Scola (for the record, this is the 7th film I have seen and 3 more in VHS) and cinematographer Pasquelino de Santiis did not prevent the resulting - crucial - unsustainable: camera allowed to promote the various sections of the larger building, irreversibly until the situation is needed Or be publicly under investigation, k You always mercilessly. <br /> <br /> The narrative is entirely dependent on two-star appearances, and both of them deliver (chemistry on their screen is unmatched); When Loren puts gifts in their home cottage, it is also a number of exorbitant man of Maestroani (this picture, some doubtful, his sexual rotation with opposite-fascism looks similar!), Which usually impresses international audiences!
