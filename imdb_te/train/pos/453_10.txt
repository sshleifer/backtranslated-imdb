I always say "Enchanted April" is no slum, no sexy, and violent adult movie. It can be thought of as "ultimate chick flick", but there are only one or two enlightened men in love. Do not invite children, though. This image is too low key. <br /> <br /> Seeing "Enchanted April" is a very healing experience. <br /> <br /> I'd say that you really are a kind of movie, but I listened to once on "Saturday Night Live" and my two favorite movies are "The Deer Hunter" and "Paradise on Enchanted".
