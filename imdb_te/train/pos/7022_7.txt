Finally !!!!!!!!!!!! I'm looking forward to getting this film for about a year, and finally in the premiere of SB. I met some of the actors, they are really good and they are great in this movie. I saw the trailer many times, but I did not know what to expect but was completely absorbed. The movie is beautiful and the music is very good. I recommend it to anyone with a Ryan donowho fan, and the dominique swine is even better. Other actors are also good. <br /> <br /> When I first came to Ryan from watching OC, I saw in a group of good Indies like Imaginary Heroes. He is the greatest in the film, and everything he did indie. I also like Dominic but did not see her much. Soon we both want to see them !!!
