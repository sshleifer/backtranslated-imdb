One of my favorite "indigenous" movies. I do not know if anyone in our country who has not seen this film! It's funny and sad in a few moments ... I do not know how people of the world (who have the opportunity to see) agree with this film, because our usual history and the role of Serbs is the first half of the 20th century to understand it! <br /> When I look here, someone from Canada has seen ... he liked it. <br /> I'm trying to keep all the good coats from the movie on this site, but to learn how to do it first <br /> <br /> Cheers.
