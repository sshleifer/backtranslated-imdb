I rented "Still Crazy" instead. When I narrated the hardcore logic to the person at the video store, he said he was rarely crazy like crazy. I rented it. I was disappointed Well, yes, the crazy yet punk band focuses on the classic rock band, but that's okay. Street Fruit, the story of a rock rock band, broke their popularity in the 70s with a large rock festival. Twenty years later, all members of the band struggle for lifestyle, giving the opportunity to play a concert during the twenty years anniversary of the festival. They have taken the offer and decided to reform on a permanent basis, traveling to Europe in this process. Some very funny hijinks occur, and all the letters go through the subtle changes. Looking at this movie, you are more concerned about the viewer's documentary that is appreciated more than the participants. And not bad at all.
