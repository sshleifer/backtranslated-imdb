Unlike a single surreal basic storyline to order a Russian bride over the internet as a lonely man, I'm not really sure what the film is going to look like. That's it and it has Nicole Kidman. <br /> <br /> Refreshing to the ground, the picture moves along nicely, with some suprises in every corner. Relationships in this film are believed as Nicole and Chaplin work together with each other. Humor is subtle, scenes like some great offices at the bank, and the thriller element can cause tension rather than Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The whole picture is real people in an unusual situation. It's about the heroics about sensitive relationships and much less about it. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
