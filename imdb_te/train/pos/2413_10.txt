Love the TV Show. I have seen the first time. I'll work with them. You want to touch the reality when you love someone, and you want to live your rest of life, then in the turn of events you've met and the person you'd like to be with. You have to choose one or the other. No one is going to hurt anyone. Deciding is very difficult, but would you like to be happy when you can stay? Why do you want to live a life that you wanted or thought you're doing the right thing and you're both happy. Another person is not going to wait for a life time waiting, they have a life well. The decision you really want is better at the end. Best of all you have is good. Money, cars, houses, etc. ... you will not be happy to have a person you really want to share with.
