After watching the film at the SF Independent Film Festival, I could not wait to hear how I got a copy. Writing as a thirty white man in the middle of the controversial issues (Teen Pregnancy, Teen Maternity, Ethnic Identity, Alliance, Philosophy, Philosophy, Single Mother Homes), and Belief in Scripture on Any Issues. Multi-rational, multi-gendered audience largely-adults wrote about the film's marvelous storyline, descriptive characters, and the amazing performance of "real teen life". But many teens have been out of the building - because there are so many adults, it has led me to think of the starting point for the debate, not the film that the kids see, "it's about them." So, how do we deliver it? The Internet (retail) is a great way - a film buried as "pops" or other radical modern teens - and McCay appeared to have responded. For his credits as a writer / director, McKay is descriptive and detailed in his work - to share and collaborate with the crown hunt surrounds the scenes - with results of disarmament realism.
