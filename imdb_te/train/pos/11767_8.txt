What a good movie! Med Men is a great action movie with lots of turns and turns. James Belushi is very good for a former hood stolen 12 million from the boss who has to escape the murder of his wife and local sheriff (Timothy Dalton) .If you do not despair, jump on the board and enjoy the ride. 10 to 8
