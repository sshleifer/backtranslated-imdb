If you know the FirstStar Galactica in this battle, it is not necessary. The story is more reliable than the BSG, which is not far from the future. It is such a depth that it is surprising to be released in theaters. Leeds was a good choice in such experience & very talented actors. Although Eric Stoltz is the father, whatever his father is to be reintegrated, his daughter is neither real nor irrespective of her cost. Paula Malkamson of "Deadwood" fame is also excellent as his wife. His intentions are not sure whether you love or money or both, but this pilot makes it even more secretive. I'm a relative unknown to Alessandra Torressen & Joe's production for her performance. Esai Morales is amazing in his longing to see his loved ones again & how wrong he is to consider what he wants more than his ethical objections. I did not think this was a good idea when it was announced, but I'm thrilled to see how I came from the pilot only to the BSG State Story. It's great to see Adaama's Infected & Infected Children's variety of robots to expand their life at this stage. I hope they can continue with the stories, so they can find more about how to get homoide type robots. This is almost perfect pilot & I hope they keep awesome storytelling. Visual effects are much better than the worst you see on the big screen. If you do not get into the BSG, try this at least & I'll wager you become a fan & BSG want to see how the story came.
