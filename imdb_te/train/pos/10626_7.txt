It's a good little film made in Michigan, past his thugs (Gunner Hansen), chasing her past, and not quite adjusting. In fact, he strictly seeks bonkers, but not very clear. He also earned an entourage, the angel that revolves around his own little supposedly & around. The devil has never said a word but it is not really, and he is Max Scratch-creepy. Eric is busy doing things that make him feel good, which he likes to be the ones he wants, especially the beautiful young girls, the angel is pretty much spinning his wheels. This is a good character of madness, and some of you know what is going to be your own kind of at some point, but overall, I watched this from start to finish the movie so much attention because I definitely had my interest. This is a bit less in some areas, but I can not do anything with my finger. If I like serial killer flicks I value better and worth seeing.
