Although the term 'classic' is now quite simplified, the film deserves a very impressive role. Neil Simon, combined with Walter Mathau (perhaps the best living comedian in the world), and eventually lamented that George Burns made a comic work. This is interesting because Jack Benny's refusal to play George Burns's role is that this film will not die. The reunion scene in Matthew's apartment is unlikely to be a fortnight away. Definitely one of my desert islands. <br /> "Enter !!!!!!!!!!!"
