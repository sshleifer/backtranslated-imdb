As its title comedy duo, "Sunshine Boys" became a forgotten classic 30-odd years later. It is rarely mentioned along with other great comedy films in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> Walter Marthow plays Willy Clarke once in half as Lewis and Clarke, known as Lewis and Clark. 73-year-old Solo Act that can not get a job in a potato chip trade. Willy is sure that his nephew and agent Ben (Richard Benjamin) can work if he agrees to see his business partner Al Lewis (George Burns) returns for the ABC-TV festival of show business nostalgia. <br /> <br /> Nostalgia is the "Sunshine Boys" which is what happens in the glorious past of the 1920s film clips from the beginning, long ago with the co-coil Porter's "Be A Clown" . There are present-day settings of the film in Manhattan, where skins and wide polyester ties are present. These periods took place in Willy's marvelous mess of Manhattan's apartment, exposed by many dead celebrities and cartoon walls from Lady Tabloid headlines and empty jabber grocery bags. <br /> If you live in the 1970s with me and you feel that you are in that apartment. <br /> <br /> Willy clearly lives there for a long time. On the front of the television when he was sleeping in the other room while sleeping. <br /> <br /> "Hello, who's this?" A pause. <br /> <br /> Old people living alone are tragic in other hands, but Simon's 1972 stage comedy gold is unmistakable for the intellectual intellect and character of Simon. The amazing thing about "The Sunshine Boys" is that Willy sank almost any of your nests in your survival. Willy, an old songwriter friend, says, "89 years old and he is dead," the man dies while writing a song written "Lady" with "baby". Barnes is sensitive but firmly Lewis won an Oscar for his poor performance, but it is his make-up and proudly but ragged bearing that he brings this home to a house he is 73 he has thought you are selling. Willie is seriously entitled "Silly Freakine's Old Man" in Ben's description of the absolutely deserving bench, but you will distinguish him completely while enjoying his short trips when it comes to the cost of others' patience. <br /> "Who is a bad idea for TV Reunion?" And his lines will kill you when trying to kill Lewis. Willie once spoke to Lewis. <br /> <br /> "I'm still demanding, I'm still hot!" <br /> <br /> "If this room is in the fire, you're not hot," Lewis replied. <br /> <br /> Director Herbert Ross shoots everything in a very casual and poor manner, leaving room for comedy in emotional moments, with low lighting and mid-range shots, and leaving the entire zen message of the film through silent acceptance. You do not always feel the feeling of watching a movie, "The Sunshine Boys" are many mantras, and Ross's directors, such as three principal actors, are far from achieving that end. While comedy is difficult, especially when people who see things, "The Sunshine Boys" is a joy to all because we see it.
