Steve Karel once again stars in a light porn movie about choices, family and stress. I'm looking forward to a flat-out comedy, laughing and dirty thing by judging the storyline and facial painting of the film, but I think it's wrong. Certainly the movie had some comedy, but I felt more of a light play and Steve Carel once again gave a great performance. This film really solved true observations and was a strong element I found. But, the end rushed a little and felt predictable. Moreover, cinematography is great, acting is very great and the delivery message is clear but still very important. However, it came to an old, flat and predictable conclusion. At the end of the cinema, there have been various choices (probably bad, perhaps even), this film is well known. It's still a fun movie.
