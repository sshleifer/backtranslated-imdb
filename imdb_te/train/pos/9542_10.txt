Do not be fooled by the crazy title, it's a sweet ride! Tetsuo is the real descendant of The Iron Man and Ichi The Killers, the gem starts with a bang and the grooves on the thick of the credits roll. Foreigners are taking people's bodies and going into war machines, then their species are used to fight each other in a distorted game for entertainment. The winner of the war kills the defeat alive. It's mostly for the plot, but the gore cares when this is good? I do not know how many buckets are used in muddy, but it's unpleasant to see. The take-outs of the stop-motion has an interesting and efficient use of progress, and all of the loving care and creatine effects are lid. CGI is a bit limited, but in fact the whole quality does not remove it from a bit, at least for me. It is a very fun and stomach-film film that deserves a lot of praise, and has gained its place in the stock of cult clocks. Find and see it, you will not be disappointed!
