Adding some suggestions to Orson Wales is generally the best way to hurt me in the film. But here's the science fiction comedy Wards of the Worlds ... it's gold! Little dresses are a little embarrassing, passionate and stupid aliens are doing wrong as children in Halloween costumes. It's like a kid's image because it's not cheated by the feeling of being absurd - it's not a hidden treasure ... a gem!
