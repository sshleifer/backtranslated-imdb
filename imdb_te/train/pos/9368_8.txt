I returned from a screening two hours ago, and I was very happy with the movie when I left. It's very intense, and I'm crying in a movie for a while. It is credited to Adam Sandler, who offers a spectacular performance at several levels, and not anticipates that year, and deserves an Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Damon Cheadle gives Adam ' <br /> <br /> There is some humor in there, but most of it is only funny and funny, Don is trying hard to help him. Adam plays two levels better ... He is funny and fond when he is mentally stable, but when he is, he is very strong and stable, he is powerful and dark. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to someone who is seriously concerned about the psychological drama about friendship and loss.
