He has glorified himself as a great assistant actor in 'Glory', who has proved to be a mediocre actor 'middle malcolm' in 'malkom xx', showing his brother's love for him to play in Philadelphia, he pulled a slam dunk and said 'he's gotta game' Pulled punches and rocked us like a hurricane in 'hurricane', he provided us with effective education in 'training day', and now He has proven that he is also directed! Denzel Washington's 'Anthony Fisher' is the film's most feature film. This tearzker 'Fish'r story is not related to the defeat of the Miami Dolphins in the 4th quarter of the New England Patriots last season. Unlike that dolphin tragedy, 'Antwon Fisher' has an emotional joyous end. The film is based on a true story of a young naval officer who has a problem of anger management due to the intolerance he suffers as a pediatrician. Denzel plays the role of the naval psychologist who helps him overcome his terror and persuades him to recognize his natural mother. Darwick Luke was the first to be an antwine for the first time that I've seen a new actor for quite some time now. I saw some of the detailed eccentricities in Luke's acting as I actually saw in Washington's past shows. It's like saying to Washington Luke - 'La La La Luke I'm your acting father.' As well! I will lay off the Star Wars jokes before my readers send me a galaxy away. Speaking of the great Denzel, his performance as a psychologist is master. But what do you expect from 'Master D' acting? Anthon Fisher has not been written by other writings other than himself. The emotional discretions he embedded in the screenplay of his story is "Fisher King" material. I will tell the Chief Washington in 'catching the right bait in Antwerp Fischer. ***** Excellent
