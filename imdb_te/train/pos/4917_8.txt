Director Elia Kazan, such as Reed's' The Third Man (1949) 'and Daskins' Knight and the City (1950), chose the place for a fresh and aggressive deterioration of the New Orleans slums. In a decisive decision taken from the owners of Italian neorealism, he employed many professional actors for minor characters that are credible to the urban scene.

However, there is still a strong sense of urgency when the infected person's killers and underground street-rats are polluting their slugs with slums. In the medieval period, Black Death (now widely believed to be the bubonic plague) spread throughout the civilized world, killing one third of the European population, many believe that the devil's work was the work of the devil. The character of the Jack Fruce is effective as a human, in the form of a blanket, humanoid: angular-jaw exploit is occasionally fascinating and attractive, but always responsible for the explosion as a violent; His two spots (Guy Tomas and Zero Monstel), were more confusing at his feet, through terror than the rest. An actor with a fever, a relative of the blacksmith, had "brought something with him" (an unattended satire to his end), so he tries to find out what this valuable thing is. He summarizes the dying Flood in his hands, a grim appearance of fox and unhappy Fox love. Black / Satan finally stopped ?? Not the bosses, but the burden of his own infection / evil ?? When he was traveling on a cargo fleet, Pleig was the primary character throughout Europe.
