Since the film is based on the true story of a woman who has two children and is very good, it's scary to see how true it is! <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton has played a major role, and Patzie McCartell has two sons. Her acting real life story came to life on a television screen. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most romantic parents of all parents. , But true. <br /> <br /> I think it is very nice to remember what I remember in this film. This is what happened to the woman. But it did well. <br /> <br /> I appreciated the director for saying this. <br /> As I know anyone.
