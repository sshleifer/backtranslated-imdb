I did this movie well and feel real. I use you to watch Hollywood "action" movies and use it as standard to rate this movie, you will be disappointed. The film is much closer to real life than 95% of those produced in Hollywood, and it looks more like an average action film. I do not have any experience with the Swedish Army, so no mistakes can be made to work. But I'm convinced that I've seen the "making" extra and I have done a lot to avoid any mistakes. This is the feature I recommend to see others. High-quality realistic story and movie.
