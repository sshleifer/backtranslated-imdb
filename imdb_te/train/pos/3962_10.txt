Marvelous James Stewart, Vera Miles vehicle. The historic film deal with FBI is that it is good for a family member in Stewart's 35-year career. <br /> <br /> The film shows the history of the great investigating agency. It deals with fleet bomb plots, killing Indians in Oklahoma for the benefit of real estate, organized crime, the Nazis and Communists. The human element is much lagging behind the Stewart Vera Miles. <br /> <br /> Watch out for a brief but memorable performance by Murray Hamilton. A few years later, he appeared in "The Graduate" in 1967 as Mr. Robinson. <br /> <br /> J. Edgar Hoover has only been praised for the film. <br /> Granted, Stewart's real-life Republican views, particularly historically, were well documented in the family.
