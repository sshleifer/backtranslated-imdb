Aditya (Kumar) is a millionaire, Ishawar (bachchan), whose son Aditya can not make a mistake in the eyes of Ishwar, Aditya's mother Sumitra (Shefli Shaw) married to Ishwara lung cancer patient and her son Mithali (Chopra) At the age of one, Ishvara forgot Aditya, but happy Aditya and Mitali from a honeymoon Mitali was pregnant, and the two forced Aditya to take Ishwari to take him more responsibility, knowing that Aditya was suffering from her lung cancer, and he also knocked him from the hose to make her father more responsible, and the god told him that he would die with a hungry and pregnant wife. Take herself Uraledu. Aditya is able to prove herself to her father, but when Aditya gets a big time in her film, her father tells her that she will die. <br /> <p> It is a flaw in Indian films that require the Bollywood industry, and Shah is directed to be almost flawed, but there are no errors for which film? If this film is related to father-in-law, it is best. Jokes jokes between Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav are very long and a bit they are annoying, but overall this is a brilliant movie, I'm going to go without any other reviews to anyone else This review reading advice to watch. 9/10
