I always wanted to go with David Dachowny into the film business, and finally he did, and he made me proud. This film lived on what I had hoped for. Duchovny maintained his character well, managing to be like something similar, playing the agent's agent instead. Therefore, I give extra credit for his role, because I can not see anyone playing that particular role. David is great, but there is nothing compared to the masculine Timothy Hutan. You have never been surprised because you are an excellent showcase of tired throughout the movie. He has weaknesses, and strengths, makes the story more believable. I also enjoyed the story, which was added to a good deal for the story, and I had the most memorable quotes that I have used all the time. The film also has an injured score. I reiterate this to anyone who loves the play and does not ignore the blood.
