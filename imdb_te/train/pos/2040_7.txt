Creep is a horrific film that is confusing in real time that he wants more than 20 minutes to disguise himself in an empty subway platform. And it will do that. Nothing, nothing less. The director Christopher Smith has dramatically demonstrated the drama, by introducing a series of characters that actually have a reason to be on the subway after being locked. He also deliberately leaves the roots of the vague creep of the most vulnerable (60 illegal underground trafficking in the underground) and most part of the mystery. Sadly, he holds back from a twist that will show genetic disabilities and eventually suppresses himself. (As they are indicated). Yes, you heard me - I ended the twist to the clich√©!
