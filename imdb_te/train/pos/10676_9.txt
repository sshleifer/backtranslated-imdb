The film was filmed in Gerard Gardens in Liverpool and the UK's answer to films like 'Blackboard Jungle'. The film has time to test for a lot of time, and today's moral stories are still (or more) relevant. The film has some good performances from leading British actors such as David McCullum, Stanley Baker, Peter Cushing and Anne Heywood. <br /> <br /> If baker is caught by children at a young age, they will end up becoming responsible adults. Freddy Starr (Freddie Starr) Fred Fowell) and Melvin Hays (Gloria). Sai Chin and Michael Chou are brothers and sisters (they are brother and sister in real life). <br /> <br /> Violent playground has a gunfire with a school that is not shown on TV later. <br /> <br /> In the Gerard Gardens I lived (though not born at that time), I have the fond memories of the area. I recently completed the documentary at Gerard Gardens, which extract from the 'Violent Playground' and the Little Coast Coast Coast featuring Lenny Henry and Pete Postlivevites. <br /> <br /> In 1987, these steps were demolished and some of the ways to protect the memory. <br /> When the film was released, some complaints were received from residents. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> '
