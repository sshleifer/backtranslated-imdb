Acidic, uninterrupted and beautiful, John Schellinger's masterpiece is less effective than 35 years ago, when American life is more frustrating. In the late 1960s there were many revolutions: the Great American West's final abandonment, the intensity of the war in Vietnam and the social ideals clash <br /> <br /> 'Midnight Cowboy' is widely known as an Academy Award-winning film, an 'x' rating Fame is back; This exceeds the rule of art as work. The film (from the novel by James Leo Herrlhey) has a lot to say about the repression of American life, which involves the familiar aspects of all aspects of all aspects of the 60s, looking as friends of the allies. <br /> <br /> The early vision of 'Midnight Cowboy' is at the age of 28, the two main characters are authentic hairstyle. Joe Buck, a physically provincial Texas local character played by Jon Voight. In the opening sequences, we follow Joe's bus journey to New York City, where he uses one of his real talents - the ability of the women to be - and earns his fortune as a hustler. We will find that Joe is a bad boy in sex trading. Cowboy is hanged in the doods and announces himself a hell of a stud, young texas through his initial tricks, Enrico 'Rathore' Rizzzo (Dustin Hoffman), from Bronx who is a unhealthy man and a small thief. With low cost, thin, thin, and limp, Joe's proven financial aid. They quickly move out of cash, and life in the winter months increases, while Zo and Rutso treachery rarely have a dollar or square meal with their names in the Manhattan apartment building. In recent years there has been a strong friendship between them and the two men rely on each other to face immense disparities. <br /> <br /> Throughout this film, Joe has his grandmother Sally (Ruth White), who is the guardian; His marriage with a crazy local girl, 'Crazy' Annie (Jennifer Salt); And Joe and Annie's affair was a traumatic event that attacked the town folk who wanted to break down. Many of its time, the 'Midnight Cowboy' strings combine the main sequence of scratches, dream sequences, and psychedelic films, bringing light on the main characters and distorting their backgrounds. For every moment of Joe's and Russo's understanding, more questions arise about their lives. There are no two men in the tatters; They have no definite clear understanding until the night of the illness dies, and eventually the sense of Joe's intent to be alive. <br /> <br /> Although Joe and Raršos needed some luck, John Schlesinger's direction was clearly explained and the atmosphere of the screenplay of Waldo Salt in allowing Watto and Hoffman to grow sand. Their interaction is quite intuitive and the cast of Sylvia Miles, Brenda Wacaro and the members of the Andy Warhol team, is also an important part of the hero. <br /> <br /> Flashback sequences associated with Vote, Ruth White, and Jennifer Salt are particularly impressed with the time-lost Heartbreak. <br /> <br /> The young man who is thinking about the psychedelic era will be grateful to see the film. Adam Holgender's amazing cinematography ('The Boy Who Can Fly,' 'Smoke') and Hugh Robertson ('Shaft'). The scenes of the 'Midnight Cowboy' will first see music videos for the past two decades, sometimes working as a cohesive division with Soundtrack (by John Barry). Everybody Talking is sung by nilson, which was used temporarily during the editing phase. <br /> <br /> 'Midnight Cowboy' is released on two discs collector edition by MGM / UA, which includes extended features and commentary. Also available is the 1998 DVD release (which is used for this review), which offers dual widescreen and standard format 5.1 Dolby Digital Sound Improvement; Three-language subtitles and closed captions; French 'Dubbing'; A theatrical re-release trailer (not as 'original' as the campaign); And an eight-page product booklet. Two DVD versions have a 25th Anniversary Renewal version of the film, with its original illusion. Its three Oscars (Best Picture, Schlesinger, Waldo Salt) are well-deserved and additional nominations (Voit, Hoffman, Sylvia Miles, Hugh Robertson), 'Midnight Cowboy' is sure to keep the immortal classics on the list. br> <br /> *** ½ out of 4
