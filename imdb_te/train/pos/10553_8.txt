... what if this film works together with Terry Gilliam and Douglas Adams? The film starts with the touch of Brazil ... At a certain point, the story moves directly into the Twilight zone ... nothing new does not bring, but nothing ... And nothing is great fun! When Dave and Andrew begin to explore their new environment, this film is really enjoyable ... jumps head? Well ... yeah ;-) <br /> <br /> This film, imho, is the biggest surprise of this year's FantasyFilm Fest ... <br /> <br /> Cube and cipher actress this is a small, unnatural but very special Design offered, makes it difficult to detect the story or its time ... something timeless ...
