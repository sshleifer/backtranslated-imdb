In August 1980, the child Azer Chamberlain suffered a furious country after the disappearance of her parents, Lindy and Michael in connection with the disappearance of the children's parents. The media and the people have already tried and the accused have been baying for a couple of sentences and blood. <br /> <br /> Michael and Linda Chamberlain Speak at the barbecue area that while camping near Iier's Rock in central Australia, they took their ten-week-old daughter from their tent when Dingo was taken out of their tent. No one believed them. Lindy was murdered by his baby, and Michael actually was charged with an affair afterwards. The whole country was concerned with the chaos of karma karma. <br /> <br /> Lindsey did not prove his innocence, so she found guilt. She never had any evidence to punish her, and the jury escaped public and media pressure. How can we even sit in judgment as a nation? Where can we find out, how can we learn? <br /> <br /> Fred Schapepe's film is undoubtedly and wholeheartedly backing the argument of John Bryson's novel, allegations that Chamberlains were absolutely innocent. <br /> <br /> Shepcyy's blood has taken a brilliant take on the mood of a drunken country, and in fact brought to light the truth. He shows Australia in the luminous light, rather than people, that he is completely obsessed by the Chamberlain! <br /> <br /> His writing, written with Robert Coswell, has stirred up emotionally and angers the audience with sadness. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep performed a brilliant performance and blamed the worst acts of the woman. She is the most trusted and tough little acee of her life, who is ready to stand up for allegations and created the world directly. Even her accent is almost there, but very, spot. That business owner is a very good effort. Every bit as Sam Neal Streep is good, but Michael, who was the first believer but later disillusioned, understands why their world is falling, he begins to question his Christianity. His, is Streep's, a show with great emotional strength which you can move great. <br /> Technically, the film is excellent, photography director Ian Baker is a great land especially (especially rock). <br /> <br /> Editor Jill Billkack's entire film is very long and very moody, Bruce Smithon offers a say score. <br /> <br /> For all Aussies, if you look at a miraculous look in the mirror, our country has made it a country for the family that wanted to do justice, and that the truth is known. <br /> <br /> Michael Chamberlain said: "Nobody wants to know any innocence for innocent people. <br /> Saturday, May 20, 1995 - Video Fraud Schepisi's account of the liberty of justice bearer Azaria lost baby Azaria at the Rock, still moving mentally vibrant and honest. <br /> <br /> Schepisi and Robert Caswell deftly Michael and Lundy Chamberlain , Her newly born daughter, Azari, set the tint of John Bryson with the simplicity of a holiday horror story for Miss and Lendy Chamberlain, as the family set up the tent with just a few moments. The baby was murdered, and Michael was actually an affiliate Later there was a little more than the trial and the Australian people decided to remove her, and she was found guilty and sentenced to life with a hard labor, although there was no intention of prosecution prosecuting evidence. br> <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep is ranked as the top man in the Australian head to prove his innocence. She is really awesome, and the only thing she failed is the true blue Aussie slang, although she makes her the best for O'Chere. You can feel why you did not star in the top Australian actress, but Star Power probably answered. Along with Merrill is the equally impressive Sam Neil, the unusual like the husband who sees his world falling apart in front of his eyes, he feels he is not powerless about it. <br /> <br /> Editing from Jill Blowcock is very timely, Ian Baker's cinematography and other harsh places of rock and is perfect for Bruce Smetton's music piece. Of course, Australians must have all conscience. <br /> Sunday, June 15, 1996 - Video
