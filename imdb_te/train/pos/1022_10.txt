Stargate best performance. All actors are perfectly fit for the characters there. I love the connection between the characters. If you do not see this presentation, I would highly recommend it. Although this program is comparable to the Star Trek, it is not entirely possible because it is completely different. I'm a Star Trek fan but I definitely rate this show on top of any of the Star Trekes. Unfortunately I live in New Zealand and I have to buy DVDs and Season 10 if I want to see that Stargate is not on our TV and I can not see a bit more time). But this program is very good and it must be seen, but be warned that it is highly addictive. So in the summer I Love Stargate (and Amanda Tapping).
