Four stories written by Robert Bloch are about a number of people who live in a beautiful, old mansion and what they do. The first mention was Denhel Eliot as the novelist, who wrote about his future killer. Eventually some horror movements and twist are good. The second was Peter Cushing, who was engaged to a waxed man who was like his dead wife. The third person is Christopher Lee (Chloe Franks) and scares her. This can lead to a very pretty horror ending (although the story ends in the worst). The last one out with Jon Peteve and Ingrid Pitt is to get out and out comedy (chewing two scenes) and making people vampires! <br /> <br /> This is a good horror anthology - nothing terrifying but the first and third end gives me some fun little chiles. And the fourth is actually very funny and the pit is very sexy vampire! Even the house is also beautiful ... and very creepy. It is well directed by some nice weather. Very good and unusual image score too. All the better in all a good little horror version. Try to see on DVD - The Lions Gate looks amazing with a striking colors and great sound.
