DER TODESKING My favorite George Buttgereit is not one of the movie - but it is still an interesting film dealing with suicide and it has a number of reasons and tracts. Those looking for a gore-fest, or plunder in NEKROMANTIK movies or SCHRAMM style, are probably disappointed. DER TODESKING is certainly an "art-house" style film, so it does not apply to linear and detailed descriptions </ span> <br /> <br /> The basic concept of Der Todding is "Episode" <br /> Everyday, a strange chain revolves around the letter, which causes the suicide of the slowly buried corpse. Including the one who talked about "problems" with his wife and the talk of the concert massacre (which is unfortunately laughing in the visual band on the stage so I'm laughing too lazy because it's unfortunately some of my "power" lost). But seriously - it shows different angles of the beautiful bridge - especially if you understand the importance of the scene, and the names of the people who committed suicide from the bridge ...), sometimes confusing, sometimes confusing (the SS's Tear Off WOLF off is pretty fun Is), sometimes harrowing (I'm about the guy his wife The scenery of the person talking to the girl in the park is particularly effective) The only part of the "art" movies is just "entertainment", not just entertainment. Still, I found DER TODESKING to be as strong as NEKROMANTIK or SCHRAMM, and maybe my personally stand out relatively even with NEKROMANTIK in terms of "Expert Level". Any Boutique or "Art" is definitely worth a movie fan. If you remove this type of movie - SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY - the best arts / horror film I have ever seen in my opinion. 7/10 for DER TODESKING
