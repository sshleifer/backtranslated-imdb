It is out of the left field, and you really do not expect it. But I love that. If you ask me the most surprising film experiences come from the surprise. <br /> You are not aware of the mysterious "thing" that these brothers make odd. <br /> You're in for the cast. <br /> <br /> The cast is wonderful, but most of it is not touching. Special effects do not come out of nowhere (seriously, they are like an extraordinary dark romantic comedy - then Wow) and they are great. The overall cinematography is light in the eyes of, editing and sound is very good, and without the twisted story clich√©s. If each of these things are blockbuster one by one, "What the hell?" That will make a film treasure. <br /> <br /> People who are suffering from this film do not understand. <br /> <br /> When you are one of the 90-year-old flax that you've never heard of, or you love a lot of love when you mention its title. <br /> I'm in the next group.
