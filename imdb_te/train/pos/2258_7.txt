I have Sarapina Vupi Goldberg's immense effort. In addition to her, there are no other stars in the film, her role is smaller than Sarafini. I think this is an important film to show South African history of apartheid, as I work in high school with urban children. Sarafina is a film about education and her student, Sarafina is a teacher's relationship. I bought a video for practically nothing at a video store. I saw it and forwarded it through musical numbers. But I strongly recommend this picture to educators and their students. I do not know about other actors and actresses in this movie but I think they are very popular in South Africa and I'm happy to have shot with South Africa cast and crew, except for a small role except Goldberg. If the audience is attracted to the movie, Hoop will appeal worldwide.
