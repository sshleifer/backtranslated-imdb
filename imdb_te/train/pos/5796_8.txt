Moon Walker is a fantasy music film featuring Michael Jackson in separate sections. I would rate each segment one by one. <br /> <br /> Segment 1 opens the movie with music video. Music video "Man in the Mirror" is a musical concert by Michael Jackson, a music video that also exhibits montages of historic figures such as Gandhi, Martin Luther King JR and John Lennon. The first section also liked the option of opening the film I liked the song and the montage of historical people. I also liked the message in the song. I will give the first segment to 9/10. <br /> <br /> Sections 2 Jackson Five from Michael Jackson initially shows a montage for his solo career. The montage I thought was good, I liked the animation they liked and I loved the songs as their choices as "I wish you back, it's the beat, the thriller, the way you can feel and feel me". I wish they were "the whole world" if they could make one of the songs in Montage. Why you look at the rain fall and the dots are the pictures of Michael Jackson's films and celebrities, but the chorus is very hard to see. Besides this section is good. <br /> <br /> Segment 3 is the song Baad. You probably are bad Michael Jackson's music video, yes, what's not. This section is music video but it is rendering Kids. This section is not as good but as good as other sections. <br /> <br /> Segment 4 is the small Clamation Music Film followed by the bad version of Kid called "Speed ​​Demon". While Michael Jackson follows his beloved fans and press, he turns himself into a hobby and drives a motorcycle to try to stay away from them. Clamation is good in the Chase Sequence, but some parts of the film seem to be a little fake when interacting with real people. Even now Michael Jackson comes out of life at the end of the clip out of the rabbit dresses and he dances on it. I liked that dance, but it was not anywhere. <br /> <br /> Segment 5 is a Grammy Award-winning music video by Michael Jackson "Leave me alone." Music video media is about knocking their nose in Michael Jackson's personal life and Michael Jackson feels they will not leave him no matter how much he has proven innocent. Music video really speaks (but it should happen before child abuse about the rumors in the 80s) but it must be in the film because it's a movie movie and I do not think that a child will understand what he's singing about. I give this music video 8/10 <br /> Segment 6 leads us to the whole story of the main story "Smoot Criminal." Michael Jackson plays the role of a gangster who uses his powers as a criminal to protect the children (including John Lennon's son Sean Lennon) from an Evil thug (Mr. Joe Pass), Mr. Bigg. I thought I really brought the film out, especially when he sang and played "Smooth Criminal" with a group of criminals. I also thought I had special effects. The unusual thing about the segment is why children are executed with adult humans. There are talks about the role of Joe Pesche about drugs and what he wants to do with them. I understand why a child will talk about drugs in the picture. Other knowledge is good. My rating for this section is 8/10. <br /> Segment 7 is the last part of the whole movie. The ending of the film is singing with the cover version of Michael Jackson Beatles Song "Come Together" and during the credit we sing with Michael Jackson Ladsmith Black Mombasa. Michael has done a good face of "Come Together" and I think it's a good idea, including his talented musician, including a good vocalist. My rating is 9/10 <br /> <br /> This film is a good Michael Jackson movie, which really brings the imagination of the child. If Michael Jackson wants it, the film will be Imaginative like the Beatles animated film "Yellow Submarine" and you have a movie with creativity. My overall rating for this image is 8/10
