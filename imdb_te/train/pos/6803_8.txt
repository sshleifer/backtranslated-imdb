One of her earliest films, Roma Shinidar shines as the British princess Victoria, when she suddenly enters the throne at the age of 18, despite the machinations of politicians, eventually marrying and loving Saxony Prince Albert. Kitchi and campie (despite the surprise of the real events), this romantic piece is irresistible. The film is about the British Royals spoken in German and adds its glamorous attraction. Before that, it was a wonder why the Austrian film was about an English queen; But in 1954, it was a sign that Austria was still occupied by annexed troops, including the British. Perhaps this is one of the reasons for the film's existence.
