** Warning! <br /> <br /> The small part of the story describes how Murphyus describes the brief part of "The Matrix". The plot is not surprising because we already learned about this story; And the short information is not quite entertaining. But how is it being presented as a file in the historical archives. The scenes are much better than the average, and generally the cool colors help small intentions. <br /> A couple problems. Tale of the story is a little grateful and, with political occasion, occasionally emerges from the linear narrative of the short, combined with the dose (UN scenes). <br /> <br /> The animatrix feeling is good, and faced with some problems, this small advantage still fulfills. It is not fit in the original image in style, content, or stream. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: Good information. It's a little better, but it's solid 7 in 10.
