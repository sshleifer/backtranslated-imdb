I got this film a month ago and I'm now Drew Barrymore's favorite fan. I love the happy ending and this film will give you a wonderful one with the facts of Red Sox! It is about a mathematics teacher who takes some good children on a mathematical tour where a successful Lindsay (Drew) shows some information on them. This leads to Ben (teacher) and Lindsay dating. But he admits that he is a big red socks fan and that's not easy. <br /> The first one is good, but his baseball gets in the life of Lindsay. It finally took a shot to get all the fine and drew running on the ground !! I'm happy because it came for two songs in Blackbusters. If you like movies like this you suggest Charlie's Angels and 50 first dates or some more of Drew's work as her new movie with Hugh Grant in music and literature called.
