I would love to be a fan of the movie Noir, and Otto Premining made this film easier! The crime film 'Laura' was born from Therney and Dana Andrews, and reunited two stars. Lara relies on love, and the film is based around hatred; We are already in police detective Mark Dickson, suffering from scrutiny from his officers for his heavy hand strategies, accidentally kill a suspect and try to pin the murder on a known crime; Tommy is a man named scholar. The plot works brighter, and Primerer is amazingly balanced with many plot points; But it returns to the main moral formula around our main character. The fact that the film was set in the criminal underground was given an excellent base to work from the plot, and director Otto Preminger deftly shot the other (and their women), capturing another (and their women), capturing the sleazier side of life by showing gambling of the main characters - and this is also set in upper class society This helps to offset the image from 'Lara' very early. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Marc Dickson ' Here, he has a character who likes to be very cold - but the fact that his intentions can be understood is that he can be sympathetic and give the audience the chance to be at his disadvantage. It is time for the development of this character, and because we follow this role and his impulses throughout the film; Everything makes sense. His co-star Gita Terney, in her Lara, did not do much in the film; Tearney is a film made by its lynchpin. However, what she has got, and the main duo's chemistry is amazing and Terni helps her to finish each scene in. I can not say that this is a better film than Lara before; This is a hard act to follow, but this film is perfectly suited to the film Noir Formula than the film of Preminger. This film makes a good match for Laura; Almost everything in this film is against the 1944 film, yet it all sounds strange. All highly recommended!
