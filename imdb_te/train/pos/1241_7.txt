The film is very entertaining and any criticism depends on personal preference - not the quality of the movies. Unlike the most common disorder in some scenes by Murphy, the film is a great vehicle for his kind of humor. <br /> <br /> As a lost child explorer, Murphy's character has gone through a missing girl, which leads others to believe that he believes in others "-" to protect the Golden Child. The young boy was born with an enlightened intellectual purpose to protect the world from evil forces, but with Murphy's help, his life is very dangerous for his fascinating and spiritual assistant / guide / protector. There are moments of philosophical lessons to challenge the audience who are interested in thinking deep thoughts. One of such scenes is a Golden Child requests to protect Murphy's character, tested by the monks of the mountain temple. <br /> <br /> An elderly monk displays decorated necklaces for the child, and the child is tested on his choice. <br /> <br /> In both of these there is a good fantasy / comedy and many of the evil forces in our world are completely unaware. When we accept this mantle of plot, let's touch our touch with the daily reality that we perceive, and the earth and walls must be prepared for the crumbling and the evil of what is waiting for us to destroy. <This is a good plot, fine acting, and pretty much a good deal of good dialogue martial art fighting, and Eddie Murphy combining humor.
