I do not expect much and I do not know much about it. I liked it. Very good, tight plot, ugly, fat, deaf girl and a secret hook in the form of a former con, and the speed that keeps the flow of things that do not accelerate. <br /> <br /> This is a much better film than the same Directors de Boeten Mon cure s'est array. It's boring and unbelievable. <br /> <br /> The only thing that does not work very much is that the ugly, fat girl is not ugly or fat: she is not majestic, absolutely, and traditionally beautiful, but when she was on her face with a lot of character on her face. Excellent. She wants more movies, and she has better ones than usual. I've seen a bit of a Gilles wife and a bit of mustache, and they both looked rubbish, and I've seen all the de Batterer Mo Curr's s'est arret√©, and that's definitely the worst. She has some upcoming, I'll keep my fingers crossed.
