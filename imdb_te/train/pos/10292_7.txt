Start by telling me that I am a big fan. I'll admit that all of his movies did not see * cough * magsteree * cough *. Bruce Almighty is enjoyable. Other reviews have gone into the cheesy of no one really gets in the end, I dont know what the authors are thinking. <br /> In a positive note, Steve Carrell of The Daily Show is Helios and the other cast. See Bruce Almighty If you're a big gym curry fan, or you want to see a lightweight (cue soft piano music) somewhat funny comedy.
