When I got it on video tape, I rented this movie and really enjoyed it. I had a chance to buy on DVD a few weeks ago and it was watched many times. I agree with others when I say the Indian summer is the optimum film. I think again 10-14 when I see. I think some people love the movie. We at all times wish that we would relive our lives with knowledge / knowledge of the adults. Is it not good for all your friends / parents to have the youth again? A parent, etc. Do not worry about your job ... ??? I want to go to a de lauren and go back in time. Meatballs with Bill Murray while my all-time favorite camp movie though I enjoyed the film a lot. I wish they could make that Indian summer version.
