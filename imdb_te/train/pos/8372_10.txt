No master piece. To fight for the cold war conflict and the future. The film is the highest order sarcastic. In my humble opinion it surpassed Dr. Stranzlov. <br /> The brilliant name of two superpowers, like the federal and the market. Cases and market consoles, west! Fabulous. The brilliant use of Gen Joxs is before its time. We are seeing only the dangers of genetic engineering. <br /> <br /> The message of the film can overcome the humble man's fellowship and the government's greetings. These films will shout you all together. </ P> <br /> Exciting 10/10
