Page 3 is a great image. The story is very refreshing and interesting. I did not seem to be in the middle of the film before. Konkan Sen has done a good job in this film, yet I feel more glamorous or enthusiastic, but she has done a great job. All supporting actors were good and helped the film. Boman Irani has done a great job. One thing that stands out in this film is that it's great, and very realistic, it's not straight around the bush to send its message. I think I should make more film like this, I'm sick watching the same candy floss movies over and over, they are now getting hard to digest. Everyone should see page 3, which is a great image. -Just my 2 cents :)
