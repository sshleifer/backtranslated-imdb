Two best sequels of all time period were released in 1991: Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Bill and Teddy Bogus Journey. Out of the two, I always liked a bit better with Bill & Ted 'BOGUS Journey. Terminator 2: Judgment Day is good, but there is nothing like Bill and Ted. Along with Chris Furry and David Slade in Timmy Boy, it's hard to think about a more funny duo than Bill and Ted. <br /> <br /> The National Lampoon's O.C. And Stiges, Bill and Ted El Solomon and Chris Matheson, both created by many skilled writers, L.A. They found this duo when they performed at a local theater. Both of them soon began to write screenplays about both the bill and Ted's exciting adventure birth. Filmed in 1987 and released in 1989, the box office success and became an instant classic classic. The work in the sequel began not long before. Inspirational director Stephen Herrck was not interested in directing the sequel because Peter Hewitt directed his first film. Sequel. Not a good director for the job. The Bogas Journey of Bill and Ted is superbly directed. <br /> <br /> 'Bogus Journey' makes one of the best sequels original, even though it is darker than the original. It does not change the characters as many sequels. Bill and Ted are the same characters as they are in the first film. Because it was written by original writers. Many sequels were not originally written by the same authors, but since 'BOGUS Journey' has the same screenwriters, this is not a good idea. Just the first one, 'BOGUS Journey' is completely hilarious, well written, fun, and above all, original. It is filled with Alex Winter, Keanu Reeves and William Sadler with amazing special effects and amazing comedy. This is an unforgettable 'journey'. 10/10
