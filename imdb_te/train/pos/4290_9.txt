I'm one of the best performers in the world of Charlotte Gainsborg. I can not understand why some are not her. Boring .... ??? Perhaps someone who said she was boring because he was boring. She is a great actress and the film is amazing. It has amazing ideas and a lot of good performers. The direction is great. I painted the Impression and Perfume, Flowers, Churches, and Problems in the French environment. It's just wonderful when her sister went to the store. Everything is great. For us a very good actress, there is a wonderful time. Alain Chabat and Bernadette LaFont are sure. I like him more than in his next film LA SCIENCE DES RVVES. <br /> <br /> Eric Lategau did a very good job. <br /> Ana
