Wow! I LOVE this movie and LOVE JUDY MARTE !! This girl is not just an amazing face, she is funny and really really talented !! She laughs many times with Victor, who has been a naturally hard time. We'll see her a lot in the coming years ... There are many from director Peter Sollet and co-star Victor Rasco. <br /> <br /> The best film I've ever seen raising Victor Vargas is very sexy! Very refreshing! <br /> <br /> Good story, good actors, good movie directors: true, good, girl from Kevin Smith, you'll love Victor Vargas! It's better!
