Girlfight is a story about a teen named Diana Guzman (Michel Rodriguez). Diana is the victim of her mother's suicide and the sexiest father in a sexist community. A little restraint and plenty of things to stop a fire, shes about to expel from the school to fight. Her brother, Tiny (Ray Santiago), trained with Hector (Jaime Tyrley) in the boxer. Diana was told by her father, Sandro (Paul Calderon) to pay for weeks of short training. While walking through the Diana Gymnasium, she learns what she wants to do. She wants the box. Diana asks her father for money, but he declines to her because she wants a girl and more 'giral' tasks. There is no other person who treats all Diana as therapy. Because she is a woman does not look down because. <br /> <br /> She steals money from her father and started training. Genius, pure 'erfing' genius. Recommend anyone to see a good clean movie with no 'monkey business'.
