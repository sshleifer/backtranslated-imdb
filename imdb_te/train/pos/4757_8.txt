Rod Serling, of course, is a genius and his superb, funky, creatively mindless, abandoning the examples of television and the development in which he lived. <br /> <br /> Previously there were no such shows, but our hi-tech screens in the "housewife" wave Eva Longoria or Terry Hatcher, or humor and witty ridicule, were the gallbladder. <br /> <br /> With such acting with Jack Elam episode and with his usual craziness I can not help but think that Rod Serling would be performing a long time ago around Elam, even though he was a helper of the story flow. This episode ends with a twist as always, but the shock and humor are particularly combined with the "serlingsque" ability. <br /> <br /> Rex Lewis Field
