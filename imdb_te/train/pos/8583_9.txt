The Korean War is known as the Forgotten War of the Americans. Several unanswered questions were buried with 50,000 dead people. Occasionally, we treat the distance or the soul-free drama or the cinema dealing with. Here's probably the best. This is called "Sergeant Ricker". This story belongs to an American soldier named Sgt. Paul Ryker (Lee Marvin) is selected for a secret secret mission through his commanding officer. His work deficit to North Korea and serve his services against the United Nations troops. His cover succeeded, the invincibility of the enemy and the Major status. Nevertheless, he is captured by the Americans, and is prosecuted as a prosecutor and a spy. When he said he ordered defective, he was killed by his commanding officer and sings that there was no evidence or evidence for his innocence. He was convicted and punished to hang. However, his prosecutor suspected Cape Young (Bradford Dillman), his conviction. General Amos Bailey (Lloyd Nolan) commands his suspicions on the suspicion that he will grant a new trial and be found guilty of execution. The court drama, like Peter Graves, Murray Hamilton and Norman Fell, played the top line. Max Winkler. Korea was very far away, but the Communist was punished and hanging him in the 1950s. Due to its superior script and powerful message, the play has become a courtroom classic. Excellent view and recommend all. ****
