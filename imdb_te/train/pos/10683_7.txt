It's better than average silent film and it's still valuable if you're a staunch fan. However, if you are not yet a fan of the artist, I suggest you try to find some other pictures before you see this picture. Because the plot just seems pretty hard to believe in old fashion and scars. But, this is still a good film and I have kept my interest. <br /> <br /> A nice lady unfortunately stuck to the wrong man and fled to marry him. The movie begins five years after she realized that she was a really thief. Nevertheless, she tries to do her best and spends a better life before turning this way into her life. However, the reason for rent and there is no money, so the lady is forced to look for work. Her husband becomes a personal cobbler for the wealthy person trying to receive a business contract. Unfortunately, the woman who is trying to hook a potential client for a dinner can not do it and the cutter is well paid for the date of the person. Well, like Cinderella, she cleans very well and man is passionate with her! What to do now - she really wanted to marry and the new Fero marry her? Well, let's see how this has been resolved. I do not like how they treat the husband, it's very imaginative and cliche. Nevertheless, when he went out, I admire that the film itself has failed, and with some loose ends left the picture. <br /> <br /> Very good movie is worth seeing, but certainly not great.
