I have not really been a big fan of Star Trek until the last 2-3 years. Thanks to the innovation in delivering Netflix and post 2000 video technology, I can embark into the past of all the great Star Trek episodes. The general public - "I love the next generation" is the best thing to do, without looking at each episode and really not through the TNG, DS9, Voyager etc. Captain Picard and his team were up to date when they first appeared on the Star Trek victims decades later. But to be honestly silent, I appreciate Voizer's episodes more than TNG. Voyager's episodes also increase the time rather than the TNG. The grant data from TNG is good but it is finally old but Voyager's physician - now is creativity! Instead of making artificial intelligence difficult and jerky, give yourself the freedom beyond what you have imagined. Picardo is such a great actor but as a physician in the premise for his varied, self-growth, self-comprehension is the best science fiction it is now! Endgage marries him "organic", inventing the nervous-implant transceiver for the human-machine interface, and - in the front end of the game, does not follow the command of the captain and make "human" mistakes. Apart from the DS9, it's good with 2 beautiful girls from 2 Emphysos, Voyager 3 years without Zero Ryan and I believe Picardo has maintained his personality. Virtually the Voyager's cast chemistry flows effortlessly, Harry Kim and Tom Paris - very natural. I love towock occasionally humor, despite a Vulcan. Finally, I'm so glad that the original woman's captain got rid of - oh, if you watch the rare footage - thank God for Kate! She has been the most confident, incredible and respected woman captain for 7 years. What a great work! Thanks to Star Trek for Voyager, I enjoy each episode, creative search, possibilities, ethics, and our cosmic expanse of possibilities.
