It's a double experience interesting. For some reason the greatest scientific mind of the 20th century has never been the main character of a movie. I can imagine that I'm close to those of Einstein's movies, where a great guy is a champagne for a CAESAR (like a "deuce ex-china") describes an explanation on a radio quiz show, so Ronald Coleman has proven to be the right answer, and the greatest Albert Dozen Physicists and scientists are drug addicts with winner cannabis One of those who had a partner, intended to steal some of their machines. In both cases, and in IQ, we're dealing with comic. Einstein's life, such as John Huston's attempt to do one of the FREUD with the Montgomery Cliff, has not done so hard to date. I'm very hard to get the mysteries of the world of mathematical equations or the mysteries of the electromagnetic field theory as an exciting dialogue. But three years ago, Russell Crowe and Christopher Plummer made a beautiful mind. <br /> After that, after the writing, I remembered the successful comedy YOUNG EINSTEIN ten years ago with YAHYA SERIES, but it was an exception and it was a spoof.) <surprise the great Albert play actor. This is Walter Mottow, who takes away from a range of films that have been made with Jack Lemmon in the last decade of their career. Matthew is the most influential and most talented actor in comedy and drama, but his comic figures are usually different from his "Whiplash Willie" Givingch from The Fortune Cookie. They are followers and goofs. Then they read their charges, because we grew up with them, but they were the types of rumors. But his Albert Einstein is actually sweet. <br /> <br /> He played Albert as the good old uncle, Albert. Matthew Einstein of Matthew seems to be living in Princeton with his niece Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan), and she is looking for a professor named James Morland (Stephen Fry). But Fry's car needs to be repaired and they are taken to the auto store where Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) works. Robins falls for Ryan, who fascinates him - but finds out that he does not have a mental appliance. Albert, a good old uncle who has helped his three friends (Lou Zacobi, Joseph Maher, and Jean Sax), decides to give their help to Robbins and makes him an unidentified physicist. <br /> <br /> Matthew and his chairs rig-like atmosphere is sweet, opening the love doors between Rhine and Ryan, Ryan impresses and Fry spoils things. They help a super-physical quiz to deceive Robbins (by changing their bodies). <br /> <br /> The plot is ultimately intelligent Robbins built by a nuclear powered racket that leads to the country's interests in President Eisenhower (Keane Curtis). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
