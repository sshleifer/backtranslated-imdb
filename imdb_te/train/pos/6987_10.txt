Putting UFO "Subject" next to it. This is the best documentary I have ever seen. Really Reporting by Neal and Buzz ... See a must-see. Interviews and reporting Most information was stamped in 1969 and was released only in 2006. The date documentary has such brief 47 minutes of detail or accuracy ... the facts are away from you, and you are left with the astonishment of the first ever losses on the moon ... Nail and Buzz are the biggest hero of our time. Do you want to save someone's own life? Not Bet. Neil will save his life when millie-seconds are separated from him. Amazing to see. All the details including the courage that men face when landing on the moon and the death of some people is not known as a mocking people, from a failed computer ... 10 stars!
