I was delighted that Othello himself did not have dark skin and desdemona almost always white hair like this in the film. The cast was also very good, and I was very loyal to the script after Shakespeare's original text. But I've acted very sexually for some scenes like Desdemona. I always thought she was very modest, and it was not right to show me with Cassius in bed - it was only in the fiction of Othello. First, I was surprised that the love scene between Othello and Dessemmon was public. But overall, I am crying in the film and especially the desomona dead scene.
