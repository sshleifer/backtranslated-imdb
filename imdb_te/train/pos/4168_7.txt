The film is not just one of the great films, it is participated by 70 child actors Ike Essenman and Kim Richards's third team. I'm reminded that the film will be aired on Hollywood week, '78 going to Stranger in our home against Linda Blair. I missed it on the first run to see the other movie. Then, repeating, I have the right choice. The picture is not really bad, but it's not really any chills or surprises. Nevertheless, I liked the scene that Richard Kreena's family could not use the dog.
