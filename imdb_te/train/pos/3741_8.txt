The Battle of Louisiana in 1971 This follows a group of basic training and later by Tigerland - a definite description of Vietnam on the American ground, before they are shipped. It's a surprise that Booz (Colin Farrell) and Paxton (Matthew Davis) ... are how they met, became friends, and interacted with a mutual squadron leader (Clifton Collins Jr.) and boundary (Shia Wingham) by Joel Schumacher Non-commercial film. He uses a hand-held camera throughout the film and uses digital video for combat scenes. It works very well - the image appears to be sandy (it must) and looks uncomfortably realistic. <br /> <br /> Farrell successfully covers his Irish brochure and receives a beautifully stimulating South African accent. His appearance is just amazing - he is a very talented young man. Davis, unfortunately, is not good. He is tall, muscular, very beautiful - and very corny. The rest of the cast is just great. <br /> <br /> This film was thrown away by the studio. It is not a stellar story, it is considered "another war film". It played for only a week in Boston! <br /> Also, Farrell and Davis have a long naked scene.
