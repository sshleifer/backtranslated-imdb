I really saw this classic picture of the original classics but could not remember some details. This film is not very dark and white color than I am a cartoon. I especially liked how Grinch did such a complete role and gave him the reason why he was so great, but the villain in this movie was not a real grin but Major, quite different from the original cartoon. Jim Carey is perfectly suited for all the great films made by both children and adults.
