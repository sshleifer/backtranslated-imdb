This image is great! Brad Pitt never starved in the film. Dobowney is top notch like Forbes and Louise. 4 main characters The 1960s model Lincoln Continental, one of the coolest cars ever made, has historic murders in a lovely road trip. Early Grace has a taste for dry toothbrushes and carnage. He should not curse or smoke his women, and PWT wears. A pair of artists in Ducchany and Forbes City, Parker's trailer on the outskirts of Earl and Louis. Although the majority of tone is dark in the film, there are plenty of funny scenes. Writing, directing, and acting are good. If you like highway movies, murder, humor, and narrative, watch this movie. Everybody is delivered, and you need more when credits roll. One of my favorite of all time. "Hey ... dr to teach dog!"
