"Spaz Invaders" is one of the funniest films, so far I have not seen. I can not understand why this film did not get much criticism, it was funny, dangerous and sweet. I saw the first time at the age of 11 and I really fell in love ... After 2 days, I came up with VHS :-P till today, I showed many friends and they all liked it, but no one knows before the movie. I think, no problem, no one knows, so nobody likes it ... This film is not realistic, it is sad, "SI" really has the likelihood of humor "Monsters Inc." or "Spaceballs". Okay, enough discontent - I really want what you want, if you ever want to laugh off your head, see it! Even if you're not mad about it, it's worth watching! -> laughter, prepare the ground scum!
