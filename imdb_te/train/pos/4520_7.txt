Somewhat too long and ultimately goes to the top, it's funny, not always worried or ridiculous in relation to the problems of a "power man" who love to wear clothes. <br /> Julie Walters is always lovely, but Adrian Padar is absolutely reliable and steals the film. He (she) is totally gorgeous with high heels and silk stockings.
