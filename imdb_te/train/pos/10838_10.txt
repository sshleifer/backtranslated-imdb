I agree with the "veinbreaker" written in relation to the concept of "Ahhhh" to get you to the end of this film. I'm totally interested in the movies I've selected, the lyrics are well written and interesting, especially the psychedelic sound track which is sung by Hans Matheson. It's trippy. The Nile was proven in his role, nail it "waisted", Bina put together a regular drummer and Rhea. Bruce Robinson is awesome. Helena is a lovely friend. But I thought Juliet Aubrey's performance was beautiful. The scenes between Aubrey and Robinson killed me! The whole game is played and the scene behind the scene is in the spot spot! Not too bad Many musicians have checked this movie! They must! I told all my musicians. Great quote by Jimmy Nail's character: "It's not necessary to be rock and roll, not the phantom of the f ***** g opera!"
