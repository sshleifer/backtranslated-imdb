Gray Gardens is attractive and silly and you really can not see it away. It is very strange, and funny and sad and ill and can really describe any words. The Gray Gardens of the move is beyond grotesque. I learned from the bathroom readers institute about this film which read my uncle's big bathroom reader and it's worth renting and bumping on the top of my movie watching. The film is about the most extraordinary people who danced to date. They should watch it for their favorite Edie outfit, which I definitely have curtains. When I was young, I thought I would be like Big ADi, planting my nose in general and society.
