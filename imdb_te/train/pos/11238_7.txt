Star Fierre Performance by Star Fear in the World The story takes place after returning from Voyager Delta-Quadrant. There are some characters from official Star Trek performances, but most of them are in the show. The show is based on Star Base Deep Space 12 and several space shuttles, which do not provide opportunities for official performances. The characters have a chance to grow in a hierarchical range, which are only sparring on displays with one ship. This show has good computer animation spaceships, but acting takes place at the green-screen and it gives a green glow around the actors. All actors are equally good but many are good. Episodes are being played and characters develop in episodes. It is more than most official Star Trek performances, as in Babylon 5. Hidden Frontier is also prohibited from using the official range. All I enjoyed watching it all.
