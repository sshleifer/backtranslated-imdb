As the first Lion King fan, I am definitely looking forward to this film, but I know it's not really good. <br /> <br /> When you look at Lion King 1½, there is a view about my own film. I'm going to be very devoted to the Lion King that is nitpick at some scenes, or am I going to accept another look at this movie The Lion King story? <br /> <br /> <br /> Lion King 1½ certainly has its beautiful and funny moments. Timon and Pumba stole the show in the first film and a movie centered around them is perfectly appropriate. People love these roles! <br /> <br /> My favorite parts of the film are surprising conclusions of Timon & Pumba's young Simba's tribute and some great comas. <br /> <br /> I think most babies are really all about the young set of those types of jokes (after which the target audience I think most kids really live about Disney's profit margin < <br /> <br /> However, when they portray the film directly from the original movie, I will say that I have made some disturbance. <br /> <br /> For music, it's not too bad, but do not expect any classics to come from this movie, at least LK2 has a dance word, "Love Find a Way." For the voice work, the film is well-received.Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella have done a great job as ever, and new cast members, Actor Jerry Stiller and Julie kaurvar (called Marge Simpson) also did a great job. The disc 2 of the DVD by clicking on the Virtual Safari only enjoy the great voice talent more. <br /> All in all, The Lion King 1½ is not a perfect image, but it is beautiful and entertaining. <br /> <br /> My IMDB rating: 7/10. I enjoyed a lot of Lion King fans and appreciated it. My Yahoo! Grade: B (Good)
