The film is believed to be the seventh art of cinematography, not entertainment business. Lars von Trier creates the warmer Germany's noir atmosphere more attractive. You will be absorbed into the dream and go only to the ultimate credits. This plot is a second time, but it is still an enthusiastic story. Just amazing.
