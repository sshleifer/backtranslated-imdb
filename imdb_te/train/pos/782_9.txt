In this small town of England, there are about 3 forty-something good friends. A piano coach finds a bleak love and a new beginning, when tragic events and hearts are forever changed. Definitely a picture you have a box of tissue! A powerful piece of work. This is definitely one of my favorite films. <br /> * Spoiler! Spoiler warning !! <br /> <br /> The main character is her young, cute piano coach and a passionate love blossom. Her two enviable "friends" play an immature prank that quickly leads to sharpness. Her love and her friends lose a foul fraud. Eventually the unexpected surprise pulls them back. (In my opinion she does not promise to forgive)
