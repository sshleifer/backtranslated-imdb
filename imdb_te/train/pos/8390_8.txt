My first Fassbinder is an amazing experience. The film and the alternative film (the short hall with uncomfortable seats, the wait for the people when filmoros change) are the best. <br /> <br /> There are many sounds in this movie, but the fuzzbinder has made them very clever and really fun. The sound is also amazing (sometimes louder than the conversation). <br /> All seemed to be in the right place. How did I submit after the war? <br /> <br />
