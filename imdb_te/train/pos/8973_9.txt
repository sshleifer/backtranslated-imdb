I saw this movie when I was a little boy on television (thanks to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) and a few years later about it. <br /> <br /> Canada's Bratislava Pozar, National Film Board Best Animator. Pozzer is a teacher and collaborator for the great Drouin. If you want Trnka you should see "Night Angel". <br /> <br /> The marks are obvious, but deftly used. Opinions of beauty and life (plant) are opposed by Gloved Hand's illness. <br /> <br /> The poor puppet hero denied having a political agenda. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br The whole room of the little room character to take action. The besieged hand is the complete breach of the world. <br /> <br /> Beautiful and haunting picture. I found this and other amazing shorts Trnka in the public library and showed my own children. Must see.
