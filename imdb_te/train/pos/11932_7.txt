Many years ago I saw the film on TV and I saw this film when I got the film on the tape. I thought it was good. It's not the best of all the movies, but it's fine. The film has enough skill to stimulate many people, especially young children. Acting was good, leading to Danny Glover's cast. The series of plot is not very believable, but the script is well written. The film also has an interest in avid baseball fans. It does not directly apply to action-packed sports movies. This is a good picture that can be viewed directly with your family and learn some hidden messages in the picture. Overall, the picture is good, but not great. I give 7/10 to this film.
