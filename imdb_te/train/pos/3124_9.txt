Jason Bourne sat in the dirt room with blood on his hands and tries to find out what he is doing. Meanwhile, a CIA chief in NYC outlines the company's response to what just happened on the screen. An American flag is proud of his desk at the forefront of the shot, but when he speaks, his plan separates the morally suspicious landscape, which should not be associated with the course of the national security interests. <br /> <br /> This shot effectively binds the mood of the film. As the role played in Bourne's search to find out how he was Jason Bourne, ultimatum is also a test of human costs of actions taken to protect us for the benefits of stability and security. <br /> <br /> Maybe in this movie you will be the best film of the year. <br /> It's too intense. Bourne tells Simon Ross (Considine), "It's not some newspaper story, it's real" and the audience is almost sure of him. The camera shakes up, but the good, well-acted well-written characters are doing so because these guys seem to see everything as they look and feel like he's with Bourne, and shows that they are the characters they're portraying. The action sequences are much more aggressive and thoroughly choreographed, they seem to be natural rather than subtle motion; Stunt-work is not amazing. <br /> <br /> Pacing is just awesome. It keeps driving forward towards its end, but it's not so fast that the leaves you're struggling to piece together; The next step of the script is to provide the information you need quickly and accurately as you go to the set-piece. While they are very simple (a waterloo sequence is a person on a phone that can watch a man on the phone) they charge the dramatic intensity of your choice. <br /> <br /> The national security name for its set of extreme acts, bright storyline and wise decision-making reviews, the Bourne series is certainly one that captures the opacity of our age. Ultimatum is its peak.
