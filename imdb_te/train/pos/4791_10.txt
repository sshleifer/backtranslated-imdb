Who would have thought that the film depicting a man who had driven two hundred miles long to see his brother would probably be a good movie? I did not. One of the most boring experiences in my life: I know what I hoped for. <br /> I'm wrong because I'm never wrong, because one of the best, most realistic and honest Hollywood films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> "The Straight Story" giving a small resume is not very difficult. It steps on his lawn mower about an old and stubborn man and goes off to another state to pay his brother's visit he heard his brother has a serious stroke. It is already unique, but it is true that in the ten years his brother was missing because of some particular argument. During this time he has misfortune and troubles, but his philosophical policies in his life are somehow influenced by his life. <br /> <br /> If you look at his brother before much deadline, you can not know why despite weeks of difficulties he goes on. <br /> <br /> And why do I think these people have things like a heart or that? No reason ... You do not have any sleek action sequences, because it is slow as the mower mower man is driving and you do not have any, either for a nice soundtrack Udataniki not. But why do you see it? Well, the simple answer story. The Disney studio's (which is right, from the same studios moving from sugar snacks - I do not even see such a touching story from Hollywood and actually a very powerful story) makes it more special. I did not admit that I had seen tears twice as I looked at me, because it was very real to me that some years ago I did not see a very intelligent argument. Some argue that the story is very unpleasant, but I do not really agree with it. This is probably because they only do not like the older man driving on his lawn mower and think of any more. If you look closer than you know this man, he learns that he once made a mistake, and he wants to see his brother again and see others, so they can not make the same mistake. If it is not so deep then how deep is the story for you? <br /> <br /> I also want this film to be true. An American film at the end of the skyline of New York, Chicago or other big city), Richard Franzworth, Sisi Sposk, and the most delicious way is David Lynch. I know now that I'm totally wrong guessing that this film is not my taste. This is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. The film was my heart and hit the bull's eye. I'll give you 10/10 full.
