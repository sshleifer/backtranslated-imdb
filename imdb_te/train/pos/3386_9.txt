Is this the future for us? <br /> <br /> The film puts the issue of doubling since 1973 when it was re-released. <br /> <br /> Sailent Green is a wild picture that I enjoyed so much. It is the favorite characters, semi-apocalyptic arrangement, compelling and contemplative-inspiring storyline and Macho-Mach Mac Man Out there: Charleston Heston. Richard Fleischer gave the film a very unpleasant, dirty feel. You are almost exhilarated by the stink from the city and its slums. <br /> <br /> The characters are terrific. Charleston Heston, one of my favorite actors, is the IS thorn. The man created the character of Badass and the tough guy who likes it. I could definitely put myself in the shoes of the thorn. He sees that something is not right, but everyone around him can not hear (will not hear). Edward G. Robinson (in his final film, R.I.P) plays the romantic old soul character in this evil space. For everyone else, specifically league Taylor-Young Shir, a "Furniture" comes with an apartment in which she lives. <br /> <br /> Special effects are also excellent, in 1973. Soyland Green Factory, Futuristic Apartments, and especially "Scoop" (Bulldogers get rid of people) are excellent. The contaminated air outside can be frustrating and very nasty. <br /> <br /> When a final note is over, it's even surprising me now. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you feel like you do not know,
