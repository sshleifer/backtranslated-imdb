Cipher is a brilliant, efficient and stupid image. Its good in the premises is good and its content is distributed efficiently, as well as the genre demands. If the film is printed immediately with a science fiction, it will be a bit too much. This has obviously the science fiction features, but it is more similar to the noir / detective feel than anything else that actually adds to the story. <br /> <br /> This film is a bit like a nightmare. So build and maintain good atmosphere. Although we are not sure exactly what's going to happen, do not know why some things are really going on and some people are not sure to dream, do you know that there is a dream like that? Ambiguity over us all over? I also do not see that there is a hero in the film before Brazil's Terry Gilliam's Brazilian. As mentioned earlier, together with the elements of cipher horror, Detective, Noir and science fiction make everyone feel that something is there and merges its contents. <br /> <br /> The movie that helps towards the detective of the story is also a spying concept. The surrounding mystery is about to worry about every one and I can see the role of Rita Foster (Liu), similar to a Femme Fatale, and the risk of reaction. Around the hero: People who do not appear to be friends are actually saying that they are helping and they see what appears to be dangerous, killing what they see. The platform has been repeated several times to make the world end if they are not organized and the following directions are beyond the scope of the above; One thing that seems most dangerous Lucy Liu's character has any romantic link or connection ?? And trying to help her (!) Film maintains the concept of both sides, its spying, intimidation, and one of its employees and opponents. The whole thing plays like some sort of cold cold war; USA And the term USRR is similar to that of the heyday of their heritage, and is actually given a black, warm, often cigarette screen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> How he works more and more on Foster's own inspiration, disappears in this order because he says he lives, repeats, recuperates, restricted, and breaks. <br /> <br /> Cipher is a content that is consistent with its content and contains all aspects of a good image. This does not reduce enough slack compared to the first Jason Bourne film to be set in a sci-fi genre, but you can see the similarities; Both were released in the same year. As it was previously said, everyone seems to have something in the film and if you can see the end of the disappointment that some can successfully assess, you will enjoy this movie.
