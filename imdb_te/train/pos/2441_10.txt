I am amazed by the evil predicted in world history with the name of religion and it is terrified, and it seems right up there in the twentieth century the top of the Catholic Church's machinations in Ireland. . <br /> The story of a family of a true family with discreet intolerance and disgust is entitled Divided Church Theory. At the beginning of the film, we give the impression of Bookauic life in a small Irish village where Sheila and Sean Clooney are happy to marry two children. Sean Catholic and Sheila Protestant, but she is satisfied with their children being Catholic. There is no sign of enmity between Catholics and Protestants in the village. Peace and love relations are immediately damaged when Sheila expresses the desire to attend their big child Protestant school. The local priest takes herself to bury this "sin", and soon the whole Catholic population of Sheila's husband and the village has become her father, a local dairy farmer. <br /> <br /> Sheela should have a special note to Orla Brady, who played Sheila. She gives a very powerful performance, in which the viewer is emotionally wounded, in which she decides to deny her husband's desires to express her passionate desire to establish herself independently from the pressure of her establishment. Leon Cunningham Scene plays an equal footing, giving him a more realistic figure as his wife and his wife, who is torn between the church and society's influence. <br /> <br /> If fiction, the film would be a perfect and interesting play. If it is true, it turns into horror tragedy. In real life, people and villages were not fully recovered from the events that took place there. The church took almost half a century to recognize its negative role and while Sheila and Sean spent their lives in the area, they were religious leaders and their fellow villagers <br /> <br /> It denounced fundamental rights to education, crashed flights to buildings, To be subdued, condemning the whole species, or slashing on violence and murders , We humans have a powerful negative force in our society and certainly religion.
