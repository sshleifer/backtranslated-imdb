Philo Vance in the 1933 film "Kennel Murder Case" starring William Powell Marie Astor, Paul Cavanagh, Eugene Palette, Helen Vyson and Ralph Morgan. Philo acts as a backdrop for Lock Room Mystery with many suspects with a dog show entering his Scottish Terrier. Mystery is very intelligent and both complex and interesting. Because the Talkies are still very young, the camera work is very small, but Michael Curtis is directing this work. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is terrific; The whole cast image brings up a notch. Many actors, including Paul Lucas, Basil Rathbone, Wilford Hyde-White, Edmund Lowe, James Stephenson, Alan Curtis, Warren William, and others played the role of Philo Vance. Pavel played it several times (five times) and was well suited for the role - at the same time very relaxed but serious. "The Thin Man" put him before the big stardom - he started his career at the age of 20 in 1912 at the age of 20, at the age of 20. A great man, a great screen presence and actor who has lived for nearly 92 years. We are very fortunate that his movies are available on DVD and on TCM today. "Kennel Murder Case" is a great story and a fun movie - do not miss it.
