Red Eye is a good little thriller to watch on a Saturday night. Extreme acting, great villain and unexpected action. <br /> <br /> The film reaches almost 85 mm and 88% of the movie is in the movie and is not just talking. <br /> <br /> They enjoy the best of smart and witty dialogue. <br /> <br /> Wes Craven, a PG-13 film director, looks like a new ground. <br /> <br /> In this thriller, he probably fits a lot of violence. The film needs good actors to provide dialog and thrillers. If they did not have those actors, the film was lost and bored. We have Rachel McAdams from Mean Girls and Wedding Crushers. From the Batman Begins to Cullian Murphy and 28 days later. This cast is from Brian Cox from X-Men 2. <br /> <br /> The film is good in the movie. They throw a twist at you when your mindset is going to get boring. Fortunately it's not a long movie and it does not feel like that. <br /> <br /> Here is my flight plan: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-578 <br /> <br /> I would recommend it. Not too long and not too tired. <br /> <br />
