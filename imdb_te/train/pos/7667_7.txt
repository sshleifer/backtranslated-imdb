New York City has a man above all other people, perhaps immortal doctor Anton Morritide. Modrardid, using his magical powers to keep his brother and rival, Kabbal, a humane's sworn protector, may not be human slave. Well, do not you know? A prophecy is real and Kabbal breaks out and begins to collect items (including platinum and uranium) for his alchemical experiments. With the help of a woman named Mardriard, can Mardridid ​​lose his bad brother? "Dr. Mordrid" comes with the courtesy of Charles Band in the Full Moon Archive Collection. I gave a big fan of Jeffrey Combs (Mordidrid) and did not hear it a bit oddly that the film was not old. But now it's mine and I can enjoy it again and again. The film is definitely fun in classic full moon style. Richard Band offers music (it is not different from his other scores) and Brian Thompson plays the role of the evil cobbler. We also have animated dinosaur bones! What do you want However, the cheese factor is high. I'm very much in the rig-off film of Dr. Strange Comics. And the blue pantsuit is crazy. And the plot holes are everywhere (I could not list at least five, but why trouble). And why looks like a hammer and sickle suspicious of the ancient symbol of mordrid and cabal? Combs has never been a strong actor, he fits right with cheese. These are not complaints. Full Moon fans have come to anticipate these things and devour them like gray nuts. <br /> If you're not a full moon fan or if Jeffrey Kumble is a fan ... you might want to see it elsewhere. But if you like the style and haircuts style of the early 1990s, you can eat it. Stallone and Schwarzenegger fans might like to see Brian Thompson as a villain, a never-ending and unmatched English language beyond the third level. I did. I wish there was a "Mordrid II", but practically everything that makes a sequel to the company ("Gingerdead Man 3" really need?) This one has passed.
