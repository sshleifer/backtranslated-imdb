I think this movie is good, this time it adds to my "classical collection". I still believe seeing other posters to remind some of the pickier people that are a movie. Perhaps more intricate points have some "logic", but many great religious things that have been accepted "on faith" fail to pass the odds. If you agree with any belief that you are subscribe to, you can definitely accept the movie. It's just that someone or Ez-yi Dagger has found that there is a lot of trouble getting the same knife knife Lamont Craneston "The Shadow". The movie (IMDB) does not mention it in the trivia section, but I would bet a dollar for a donut that was the same campaign.
