This film is my first touch on Mr Sica so I do not really guess what to do. <br /> <br /> The storyline is not complicated and his connections in the community of poor people, especially the poor people, built a hood of ordinary metal plate houses. In another city, this small city spends his own life and things happen. But one day there is a water source and the rich man gets an interest in buying this place. But the title of the film is the title - there is a miracle happening there. Our character will get a wonderful pigeon from his dead mother. <br /> <br /> What would he do to protect his friends and all the city that he built? <br /> This is just a natural comedy. The behavior of the poor people and the money and property are talking to people and how to play. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous moments and scenes were included - the sun was shining and most people started out in space. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you feel like you are not a comedian,
