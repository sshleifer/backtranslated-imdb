I first saw it on UK TV in the early 90s but I liked it but I missed it for a long time, but the film was always stuck with me and I lost hope of watching TV again, the main thing stuck with me, the hole was really touching me Easily looking, there's a great story, great music, list and its of me correctly BADA is good but it's all there is once the best bits with them, yes animation is top notch and beautiful to watch, but it's a part of the beauty, I'm so glad I came out of it as one of my top ten films of all time . Buy it or rent it, so that you can only watch overnight drink and food, so you can not stop that movie. <br /> Enjoy
