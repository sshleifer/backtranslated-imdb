I first saw this first documentary release in 2001 and this has had a lot of effect on me, and I saw my friends again and again with me. Bottom line: None of my friends left desperate (never!). This stellar film creates art into slightly more beautiful pieces of art using Scottish conceptual artist Andy Goldsworthy, using natural ingredients (wood, water, flowers, rocks, etc.). Everything is temporary?). We create a variety of works of temporary art as Golds Worth, as well as some of his long-term provinces in major galleries around the world, as well as some parts of the natural world. This meditation directs the music rendition of the movie Reidelheimer, the real treat for both eye & ear, (music score composed of music score, music by Fred Frit, music is usually a combination of experimental experimental / sound surface guitars, as well as musicians). If the film is available on DVD for a few years now, restore the movie by restoring the movie, search for everything (a film that is composed for the big screen, a skill sound system that really is the right way to experience this movie). No MPAA ratings, but have nothing to do (unless the direct birth of the lamb on the screen is intended to offend or disturb)
