Hey guys I'm in fact in this movie! I did not even know this site until I was a few years ago and was surprised! I played the role of the main character's son Pete. It was a great experience and I loved every minute. During the filming they had to be in two places at once, so they used my twin sister as a double! The finger pushes the radio button in the car is not her. I'll still work and do some TV, but not so much. <br /> <br /> Review: I thought this film was fine but if I was not in it, it was not my favorites. I thought acting was good, but the story line was just the same.
