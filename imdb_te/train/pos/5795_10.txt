This movie, you really need to see, if you're not an MJ fan, Captain EO, E.T. And a bit of ghosts, film and music history !! This amazing picture, from Michael's feather, is a must !! And: Smooth Criminal, the most exciting, exciting and exciting song I've ever heard in my life !! Thanks to Michael for this film and I will love you !!! MJ is the best musician who plays on this planet, he is a good guy and he always brings sparkles in your eyes, you listen to his music! Please, if you do not know this movie, do not see it and do not see it, because if you want to miss it will be very bad for you! -The most recommended movie, each film lover-
