The term comes from the term "classic film". It's an amazing story of woman's courage, courage and serious loyalty. Poor Olon was sold to her compassionate husband, who spent years to congratulate her. <br /> <br /> Lewis Rainier is the best actor ever to win an Oscar for Best Actress, and "The Great Zigfield" before her little role. It really does not show any other, no, talent other than her exotic beauty. But it shows that she can really act in "Good Earth"! She removes the beauty and does not have great clothes. People say people do not show real emotions in this film. Like hell. Her character Olan is a shy and cowardly woman, with the inner strength. She is silent in films containing only her eyes and body to express her emotions. Example: Those scenes when the city's fall and looters fired. If you say she does not perform well in the film, you can not see! <br /> <br /> Paul shows that he can act as well. I do not like his role. He never saw her until the story ends. A sweet-loving and dedicated wife and mother, with her special beauty. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance to watch this movie, watch it. You will find one of the best films that Hollywood's golden age has created.
