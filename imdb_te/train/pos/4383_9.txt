** Attention spoilers ** <br /> First, let's say Rob Roy is one of the best films in the 90s. This was especially successful for all those involved, particularly Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, John Hurt, Brian Cox, and Tim Roth. Michael Cantona Jones painted the spectacular images of dignity and obscenity, and men can represent themselves. <br /> <br /> It is constantly and unjustly compared with "Braveheart". These are two different images for both Scotts in historical Scotland. However, this comparison has hurt me a lot, because "Braveheart" is considered a better film than "Rob Roy". I'm very fond of "Braveheart", but the idea of ​​comparing it to "Rob Roy" is a disgrace for me. To be fairly simple, I love "Braveheart", but I love "Rob Roy" which is a light shadow. <br /> <br /> "Rob Roy" is real people. <br /> <br /> "Let's face it," William Wallace is not a real man in "Braveheart", he is an elder, martyr, and loyal to life, because he is a perfect man, He basically showed his promise to the land that he promised to his countrymen, but when he failed, it was not his fault. + Like Jesus, he trusted many and deceived many. <br /> <br /> Wallace's drawing is very neat and effective, but really does not stimulate or conspire me, and human dilemma is more appealing than human perfection, and hence "The Last Temptation Off Christ "is a better movie than" Kings of Kings ", and it is" Rob Roy "" Bravehear "Rai Roy is heroic and courageous but he is not perfect and he makes a lot of mistakes that affect many of his beloved loved ones. Centered action. He did not think he was told that he was driven to homeless by the end of the film's film. <br /> Rob's wife Marie is also a simple, vague person. Let's see how she looks in this film. Sure, she is beautiful, but she does not wear makeup and she mainly allows to show her natural beauty. Compare two of William Wallace's two lovers (or your opinion) in "Braveheart". Now these two women are hot, but it is rarely suggested that women see how much time (specifically the people). <br /> <br /> Throughout the "Rob Roy", Mary had to live with Dastdley Carrine Cunningham with her own rape rape. . She was forced to say Rob in the fight, but Rob knew that she should take revenge for her rape. Such a revenge is the death of Rob, and Mary did not prepare for this sort of sacrifice. <br /> <br /> The villains in "Rob Roy" are equally compelling. Although the enemies in "Braveheart" are well written, they are original. Robert the Bruce, a brave and cowardly man suffers from moral decisions known to everyone in the fictional kingdom. Should he promise to take his argument as a king of Scotland, or would he promise to provide Wallace with his family? Bruce is the most vague role in "Braveheart", but in the "Julius Caesar" Freudo from Brutus "The Godfather Part II", these characters are rarely original. Longshanks, though very compelling villain in his own right, is very dimensional. He is the epidemic of evil, and his cruel ways are directly contrary to Wallace's heroism. <br /> <br /> "Rob Roy" has three fantastic three villains in their darkest. First, start with the Marquis of Marquis. He was very much obsessed with his self-image, because he was ready because he suffered an innocent man. "See that I'm not joking" his favorite words to his "factor". He is considered to be the most accomplished person, the man who is the most powerful man in the hands of the Duke of Argyle. He is a disgraceful and unprotected insult. <br /> <br /> Cunningham and the mischief are the plotters of "Rob Roy", and Roy's live thugs. Callarn was very fraudulent in his cowardly, he was almost ridiculous. He does anything to keep Marquis's good will, which involves backstabling and trickery. Cunningham is a steady character, and he seems to have nothing to do with the level and Marquis's affection. He needs a father, knows little about Marquis as his true father. Therefore, when it comes from the caller to get wealth, it also holds it without question. He is a naked man of evil because he does not care about the consequences of his actions against others. <br /> <br /> Many have criticized Tim Roth for his performance in the film. Hogwash I said. Cunningham is not just bad, but also the psychopath. Is there a lot of unbelievable character in Cunningham's world that goes around shooting a man and his stepmother entertainment for fun? We are living in a society that reduces the value of human society. "Rob Roy" teaches us that only the conditions of this reduced value have changed. The problem throughout human history does not permit the pride of man's heart. <br /> <br /> We believe that Rob Roy and Mary give us goodness, but snakes have always existed in our world. <br /> <br /> Another character is called the Duke of Argyle. He is a true nobleman, and his honesty and virtue are directly contrary to Marquis. He praised Rob Roy and Mary's courage and had direct anger for Marquis and his factor. He gives world hopes for the people of power. <br /> <br /> The last dual battle of "Rob Roy" is more than 10 in the battle scenes in "Braveheart". <br /> <p> One thing I'm frustrated is to tell people that the scenes of war are a good movie because people are "sunshine". First of all, war scenes are rarely the original. "Gladiator" from "Spartacus", has a long tradition of Hollywood's historic European bottle sequences. "Braveheart" has the best war scenes in the film, but they suffer from an important problem. <br /> <br /> Now, do not get me down, duels are not original. In fact, there are about 10 times many times with duels because of the action sequences. But there is a beauty to see dual context between Cunningham and Rob Rai. It is one of the greatest scenes in cinema history. <br /> <br /> First of all, fighting style and construction of these two characters perfectly describe the characters. Cunningham is vulnerable and dangerous, Rob Roy is strong and courageous. Cunningham uses a fencing knife, but Rob uses a broader set. Cunningham is quickly struggling with tricky moves, and Roy's fighting style is more evident. <br /> <br /> The intentional slowly from the first half to the exciting half of the whole movie leads to this moment. It is powerful matter, and it is clear that Rob will eradicate this terrible evil that is suffering from his whole world. When Rob finally gets up (literally and figuratively) it is one of the greatest moments in film history. Rob wins because he can live a long time, and his honor is stronger than 10 cunningham. The use of music is scratched in this scene. He is a good anti-evil against a real evil "Freedom!" It's more powerful for me than just seeing yell yikes getting yells. <br /> <br /> "Rob Roy" is much more realistic than "Braveheart" <br /> <br /> I think people in the upper class or Scotmen people are "Rob Roy", but clearly trying to capture their dialogue. I think many people are bored by "Rob Roy" because they do not understand what the characters are saying. If this is the case, then read some Shakespeare, or close-headers. "Rob Roy" is actually one of the greatest works of the 90s. Many dialogues are very intuitive in this movie, but you need to see the movie two times. <br /> <br /> In contrast, the conversation in "Braveheart" is very interesting. But what do you expect when the main character plays an Australian player? It is an epic, and the attempt to capture the speech is not clear. The film takes place several centuries before "Rob Roy", and they speak to people today. So many people like it. Innovations have become increasingly lazy today, and they do not want time or patience to understand complicated things. Therefore, with many legendary films, they would like to hear the famous English pronunciation of the villagers, but the heroes are not far from our American language. Obviously, Wallace is evident as Scottish, but in hierarchy of Star Trek as the Scotty and the "Iyes" receipts, the film is well suited to the Hollywood tradition that the Scots Scott believes sound. br> <br /> <br /> "Rob Roy" Did this explanation be a better movie than "Braveheart"? Original. But if it proves a thing, it shows that "Braveheart" is a much better feature than "Rob Roy". To keep it simpler, "Rob Roy" is a movie with a very long time background in today's world. "Braveheart" is a movie about an epic, which is inspiring but rarely realistic. <br /> <br /> Grade - A score - 9
