This is a hard-boiled Warner Bros. starring Barbara Stanwick very hard. MacIvelellian is a technologist who played the Stranvich Lily Powers in Billy Wilder's "Double Indemnity", eleven years after the cold, well-worn daughter of a violent lecturer in an emotional steel-town. She was given stubbornness and numb in the years that she had sexually promised her father's customers. If her father dies in the distillery explosion, she packs a freight train to New York and literally sleeps on the bank's corporate ladder. <br /> <br /> It's not as insulting as Stanwick's blazing work here. It's easy to see how men get used to her tender compassion by opening her dead eyes and using innocent seduction techniques. One of the wisest young men on her way is the latest John Wayne, a client named Jimmy McCock. Lily has been heavily drawn to Hollywood suicide, a hush-hush job in Paris, for the last third of the film, a new bank president who is lazy to Lilly when he lends the company's luxury. The end of a tacked-on is somewhat frustrating but Stanwyck is not before the screen sees. The film features interesting tactics like Lilly's cohesive friendship with an African-American woman named Chica, and immigrants to Germany teach blue philosophy about Lilly.
