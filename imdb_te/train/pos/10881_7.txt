"Cut" is a full-fledged spoof of the slasher genre and basically what it wants to do. There are a lot of standard slasher cliches; The old creepy house, forests, anonymously destroyed serial killer, buckets of gore, and the killer interrupted when they are sexually abused (not a spoiler). <br /> <br /> There is also simplicity: Film school intellectuals have gone out to complete an unfinished gray "masterpiece" due to the murders of a cast couple. It's also neatly - okay, messy - the first reels of Kylie Minogue. They join one of the survivors of the opening film by Molly Ringwald because she steals the film because she gets all the good lyrics. The rest of the cast cast their roles well, especially to the lovely Jessica Napier, who surrounds her with riots and gore. <br /> There are too many red herring and fake curiosities, and there is little time for a killer to work, because the film moves at a faster pace. It has a valid low-budget appearance, possibly intended to include some clumsy editing. Good soundtrack too. If the film has difficulties, it determines whether it is sent to Slasher style or a tribute. Probably two bit.
