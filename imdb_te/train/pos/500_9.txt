I have regretted the ending of "deep space nine", many die hard hard trekkers (or Trekkies, I do not care! 1999. Prayers answered, "Enterprise" is fantastic, with fresh perspective, radically different characters, awesome new visuals, Pop song (I was amazed!) I can not think of anything that I do not like. Make-up. "Star Trek" is back - "Voyager," one not to miss! <br /> <br /> Put on trekin!
