Vertigo co-stars Stewart (in a romantic lead role in his last turn) and Novak's other "Christmas film," is the film above the mid-level entertainment. The chemistry between the two stars makes for a more moving experience and witchcraft can get more revelation from the movie if it appears to be a metaphor for private pain that can harm people's relationships. All in all, a nice diversion of the epic stars, 7/10.
