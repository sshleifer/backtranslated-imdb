Some spoilers say that if you're a big fiery movie fan, Halloween has led you to many films. <br /> <br /> When I saw the rest of the films in this film, I saw this movie. Why not ask me). Honestly seeing other 7 movies before seeing this one, it's just how it works. But I have to rid myself of all this one and all others. It's really scary, and Michael pops out of the back of a bush or walks around in the dark and sends the chill down your spine. My favorite part of this film is when Michael kills a man and brings his head to one side. <br /> <br /> The 13th film Friday slashers were fun and less intense than the film. I'm better than the F13 series than the Halloween Series, but this film is better than all F13 movies. Michael Myers is such a horrific villain because he is real and you can imagine a crazed person as he killed people who killed him. <br /> <br /> In this regard, the movie will not be based on gore or comedy to entertain the audience. It's just pure fear. This is bad because the next films coming from this series are very rare because it's good for an example of a wonderful movie when it comes to.
