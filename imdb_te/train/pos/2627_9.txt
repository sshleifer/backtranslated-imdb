Finally, Timon and Pumbaa are in their own image ... <br /> <br /> 'The Lion King 1 1/2: Hakana Mataatta' is a new story in a classic story. What a traditional story, you ask? <br /> Do not be surprised. <br /> <br /> "In the course of a lecture, when I look at this and think of you heart "Oh my god is this very lame ..." and on another level I have a ball too much humor is predictable - that is, two pumas for Pumbaa, a little for Timon And a little one for Timon, we all know that Timon is going to take a big one inside the first nanosecond but it does not stop hilarious, it's IMO, Are you looking for something else in the movie Pumba Center Stage? But fart off the jokes <br /> <br /> I am surprised that some actors are willing to come back, most of them only have two or three lines (if they are lucky ). Wope Goldberg is particularly welcome. <br /> <br /> Music is also good. From the beginning 'Digga Tunnah', 'The That's All I Need is', a song of 'Newsgap Rhapsody' (which was cut from 'The Lion King' and was clearly well developed in this avatar) <br /> <br / > Finally, Timon and Pumbaa are very fantastic characters, and 'Hakuna Matata' is not just an excuse to see them in various fun and classy compromises Claim continues. Be that way. <br /> <br /> What is 'The Lion King 1 1/2'? You can see 'The Lion King' many times. If you're thinking right now, "Do not be fooled, The Lion King is not watching many times!"
