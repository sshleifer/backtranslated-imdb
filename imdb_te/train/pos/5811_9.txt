Only 9/10 from me, if the plot had more than ten times the plot, but Moonwalker has been a fun, fun and entertaining day for today. Starting with video clips Montage from Jackson's long life, he often reminds the viewer of what he has called 'The King of the Pop'. We have won multiple Awards volunteer record for purpose in Africa. Although the Oscar winner was relatively in the script, this kind of short film later gave spectators a spectacular and entertaining play. The ending with the perfect (sexy!) Edition of 'Come Together'. Something to see the whole family and have fun.
