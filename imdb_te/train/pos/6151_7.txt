I have always tried to recreate a smooth spot for this Disney movie, "Mary Papins" success and will be another of the live action / part animation entries as part of their ever-made. When I was in grade school, every day we had a movie day, where the whole school entered the cafeteria, and an image was an old-style way, multiple reels and everything. <br /> When it came to this day, it seemed a very important occasion. "Badnobs and Broomsticks" is one of the most memorable films I've ever seen. . Angela Lansbury never put her name on her name at least for the least, and she is a wizard as a magician (man, misunderstood, and not doing it?) She and young couple are children on magic adventures for far-reaching. Come, what kid did not like bed like that? <br /> Grade: A.
