I saw this 8 hour flight and (perhaps because of stress and altitude) I actually found it to be slightly entertaining ("lightweight"). <br /> <br /> The original idea behind the film is good: a woman dies, her fianc√©e falls in love with another, deciding to make sure that she may not be together, but in the end she will do them. Sin is not as good as the original film. Well, some laughs and actors all worked well. But from the beginning the plot is my journey to the destination. I feel that the whole-gay-not-gay friend's part of the story worked very well. Talking parrot is a good idea but to be honest: It's not really funny. <br /> <br /> In summary, call this movie is more interesting than watching in front of my predecessor.
