This is the best Muppet Movie I have ever seen! I happen to learn mixed piggy fantasy like the infant as the cause of the Muppet Babies. The songs will always be in my head. The stupid Nickelodeon show says that Hey Dude is still in my head. Sorry, there is something short. But what I like is the animal after "credits by the bye By By By By By Bye Bye Bye Bye!" It laughs very hard for me. The play at the end of my absolute favorite. I was surprised at the wedding of Sesame Street characters. This film is very entertaining. I have received from the library and now I have purchased it because I can not keep the library's copy permanently. At the end, this is the best film I have ever seen! In my case, my favorite movie is even better than Austin Powers in Goldmember!
