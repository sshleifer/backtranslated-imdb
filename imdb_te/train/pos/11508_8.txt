I like to give Kolkata a higher rating, but the show quickly ran away from scary / suspense to crazy. The ABC's mistake. They performed that presentation on Friday night at 8:00 p.m. , Then known as the "Family Bell". Fridays should never be in the first place. I'm studying second in high school and I loved the first episodes! This was the first time on NBC Police Woman. ABC Friday night has huge problems. Barney Miller, Barretta and the Bad Season for the whole season until SWAT started in '75 until January. Kolchak should have been a hit. Darren McGavin asked him to get out of his contract to finish the show. Richard Matheson's original TV movies are not very much written. Nevertheless, McGavin played his own role in a collage, as the actors could do. Jackie Gleeson reminiscent of Archie Bunker such as Ralph Kranten and Carroll O'Connor. The ISS today, which combines manual typewriters and telephones, is the oldest and oldest, but this is part of the appeal. They are lucky to repeat "Vincenzo" from Simon Oakland TV movies.
