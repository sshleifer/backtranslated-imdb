When I saw the world at the Toronto Film Festival, I saw this series. I liked the idea behind the film, and the two men together told the director from each country to direct a movie in 911. Never before have these directors met, and how it has seen everything. Warning: Spayler's Oops !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All the pieces are very powerful, and some are controversial. If you're an American, you may not like this as some pieces may be anti-American. However, I know some Americans who enjoy this series. I realized that India is the best. There are 2 sons in a Muslim family living in the States, one of them missing. Americans gave them a cool shoulder and thought he was linked to a terrorist bomb. The frustration and humiliation of the mother of these accusations meets very well, which brings tears to my eyes. Finally, many of the victims were seen trying to save the Towers from the crash and that her son was dead. This is a true story, and that's what it's made of real. There are a lot of emotional and powerful pieces, and the African piece is one of the best. It is much stronger compared to others. Let's see for everyone, and hopefully America does not ban this, and let it play in their country.
