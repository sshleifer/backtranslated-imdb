I saw this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival. Shot off in a true qualifying match for the 2006 World Cup, Offside works great with both a comedy and a tragedy. The film follows the luck of a group of young women who tried to break into a football match at Tejran's Azadi Stadium. The Islamic religious leaders of the country declare that men may not sit with men, and they do not sit on sporting events, and they will be subjected to evil and other ethical questionable behavior. It does not stop the fans of the country's youth, they continue to infiltrate the use of many dreams. But Panahi was trapped in a small group and was detained for severe action. They protect bored soldiers to save them or let them see at least one player. Soldiers could see the game at home on TV, tell them they should not have tried to get out. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Since there are no female restrooms in the stadiums, any men's room is cleared before he allows her to go, plus she masks her face, so no one can see her. <br /> <br /> This is possible by using the Iranian soccer star Ali Daii poster as a mask. <br /> <br /> Soldiers are also blocked by prohibition, and their orders will speed up the end of their compulsory military service. A soldier complained that he would care for his livestock belonging to rural areas and that he needed to be on vacation. A little less, girls and soldiers speak with each other, and there are many smaller tasks on either side of these radicals who live in terrible situations. <br /> <br /> Many of us do not know what kinds of penalties they are facing, like the Iranian films, "the main" is well known for their strong visuals, the off side is painted in realistic style with any artwork. In fact, the film was held on June 5, 2005 in a qualifying match against Bahrain. As a result of the pitch, "plots" are determined in many ways. If they win the Iran match, they will qualify. If they lost, they would not. Since the World Cup has come, I do not think it's a spoiler to say that Iran won the match. The scenes that were fun at the end of the film were realistic and abrupt, giving the movie true authenticity. <br /> <br /> One of the young ladies at the end of the film is the seven fans who have died during the Iran-Japan match. March 25, a few weeks earlier. They were killed when police started spraying the audience to move them in a certain direction. <br /> <br /> I do not like to leave this long term political tangent, but this film gives me real hopes. I am hoping for a change in Iran. Iran is a youth of the youth, and it is time for their adolescent position in the political field. These images of Ivan show the proud spirit, despite the current difficulties of the Iranian people, and my sincere hope that there is a bright future for them.
