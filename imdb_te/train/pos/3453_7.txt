Although the first actor's list of best actors in the film, special effects and astonishing story line, it was not selected for the studio distribution and went directly to the DVD. Perhaps it contains a lot of 'anti-police force' information, or maybe it releases a lot of action in jets, but big screens have lost this opportunity, luckily the new concept released live on DVD <br /> <br /> The theme is old: the rookie reporter Reveals the internal circle of corrupt cops - in this case the FRAT (First Response Assault and Talk Tickel) team, a well trained police team designed to clean mythical city Edison from its low point crime, drugs and prostitution. The secret to attempting to steal goods and steal the money. 15 years later, the FRAT is scared of its murder, drug trafficking and innocent people. The main dog Lazarus (Dylan McDermott, who makes a terrific realistic gangster!) And his partner, Robert Dee (LL) Cool J, is more bull than usual and he is a sensitive actor). Reporter Pollock (Justin Timberlake) catches the air of a 'bad mistake' and reports the theory of fraud and corruption to his paper boss Ashford (always trustworthy Morgan Freeman). Polycky gradually convinces Ashford, and then Wallace (Kevin Spacey, an uninterrupted good actor) and helps in the field of investigative reporting. Satyam Pollock's truth occurs in more surprising and bad events and the story drives the pell mall for unexpected results. <br /> <br /> Timberlake plays the lead role, especially seasoned actors. But LL Cool J, Freeman, Spacey, and McDermott put a well-oiled machine of a very closed film. No, it's not a great movie, but it's one for the edge of the movie action movie. Grady Harp
