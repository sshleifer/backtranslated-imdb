<br /> It is one of the best films of all time. It has a timeless value, you can get the most out of it. <br /> <br /> The spot and plot of the story are perfect on all topics, each detail is 100% real and small Irish subtleties are covered. <br /> <br /> The use of low and high strokes gives two great views on Christie. <br /> <br /> Daniel Day-Lewis's performance is terrific. I never saw the actor ever. <br /> <br /> It's really awesome. It looks good to see, it flows well, which yo yo real life experience. <br /> If you do not see it, you should see. There are no doubts about it, there is something there for everyone.
