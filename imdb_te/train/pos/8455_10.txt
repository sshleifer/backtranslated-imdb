When enjoying the first time Gundam Wing series, when looking back at this range, I rebuilt my belief that this series was beautifully animated, but the story, gundam design, character design and character depth were executed. When it first looks like a boy band, the characteristic attraction of the characters can be credited to partially great art with individual personalities that create clear and lovely variations between the characters. Consequently, it is easy to switch to any particular role. Personally, I liked Heroro because his brave personality. While I show bias with the sentiment attachment of this show for my childhood, the Gundam Wing can usually address the deep questions of war and life (how can you get the answer?), Which, at best, say, is excellent when delivering struggles struggling in big robot suits.
