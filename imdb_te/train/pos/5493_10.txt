This rarely brings you an internal perspective on media betrayal, which is widely reported as official "truth" and attracted many "news" agencies with their pants. In my view, the movie deserves every cost in journalism - this is the goal (yes!), Courageous and true "scoop". This can be done without commentary, duplicate scenes or popular questions - everyone is ignoring themselves in their own words, including Chavez. Motion picture producers "only" to keep track of events and keep rolling their cameras <br /> <br /> Venezuela Elite teaches us "how to sell a president's deputy and democracy victory". In the end they finally lost. From what I know, the largest TV station is only canceled by its geographical license and they are still being broadcast by cable and satellite. I doubt so much that George W. or Barack Obama can resist after a coup attempt. <br /> <br /> The fact that "Chavez supporters are innocent citizens" has been repeatedly repudiated in the world is "free" established), the media has really become, or is always, only more. <br /> <br /> A popular "impartial" challenge always occurs when journalists are daring to oppose the mainstream viewpoint, or openly revealing the undesirable facts. Tell us about 60,000 Afghans (in 2003), which is now 1,3 million Iraqis, according to Johns Hopkins - the "us" - the secret bureaucracy or the effects of the Iraq war of "democracy" around the globe. To be aimed, Saddam Hussein was less damaging to his people than the US. <br /> <br /> I am very curious about the upcoming trial of some Khmer Rouge leaders before the International Tribunal in The Hague, mentioning "our" involvement in supporting and training Pol Pot's guerrillas in the 80s, which they lost largely in Vietnam. <br /> <br /> For all reasons, for Independent Media for Balance, the Fraud is not disclosed.
