When I first saw this animation (I'm 15 years old) I'm really impressed! It has a completely different style compared to Japan animation and I like it more. The overall impression of the film is more nasty and dark ... colors are not that colorful .... The characters do not talk much, these are long and boring conversations (and in Ghost in the Shell). Its dark pictures, the strange beast's views and the concept of magic, the ancient Scandinavian stories, torture and horror creators, enchanted forests and deep caves, dragons, throats, orks ... and a mysterious hero to stop evil ...
