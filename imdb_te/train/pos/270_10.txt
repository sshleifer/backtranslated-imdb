Seventeen and Missing is better than I expected. <br /> <br /> Daddy Feifler Emily, a mother who emphasizes her daughter, Lori (Tegan Moss), does not attend a graduation party a week at night, but Lori ignores her mother's wishes and takes off for the party anyway. If Lory does not come home, Emily feels something is wrong and she starts to begin with her daughter's visions and events that led to her disappearance. <br /> <br /> Seventeen & Missing is better than most other TV movies, this is not very predictable. Pfeiffer is the reason to watch this film, and comes off as incredibly believable. This LMN original movie was last night. 10/10
