Two years before I was born, this Oscar-winning film - luxurious technicolor sets and costumes, breathtaking cinematography, gorgeous music from the wall, gorgeous choreography, ease of air screenplay and great performances Kelly, Levant, Foch, Guitar, and Caran. Hollywood is not like this now. Sure, this is my favorite movie of all time, a standard which I will judge all other movies. Have fun, have fun, have fun!
