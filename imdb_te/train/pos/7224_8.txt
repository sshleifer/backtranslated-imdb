When DEATHTRAP is first released, a graphic adaptation to the poster - reproduction - Rubik's Cube on the cover of this DVD is sufficient. Written by authors Written by Rasmari's Baby and Stepford Winters in the Step by Step Lee, the play is one of Broadway's most celebrated twisters, and is well written on the screen by Sidney Lewett. <br /> <br /> Deathtrap is a lot One of the most debatable films, is the story that refers to it anyway Anything is given. But the opening maze is very intuitive: Sydney Br√ºll (Michael Caine) is a well-known writer of mystery drama, but nowadays he seems to have lost his touch. After a particularly cruel opening night, an old student named Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) sends a script for his play. It is called "Deathtrap" and Sydney certainly is definitely a hit. Just sort of hit to restore his career ... In fact, a hit to die for. <br /> <br /> Anthony Shaffer's equivalent Twisty SLEUTH, DEATHTRAP, is more than just a story-live stream at home on the stage than it comes to full force. However, under the guidance of director Sydney Lumet's expert guidance, it makes the screen more respectable. Most of these are due to the cast, it's great. Michael Caine is truly a wonderful performance, Diane Cannon is a generous and ecstatic wife of Sydney, and Christopher Reeve gives the best performance of a small acting career with his sadness. If you can not see in a first-rate theatrical production, it is more than one. <br /> Gary F. Taylor, GLAD, Azan Reviewer
