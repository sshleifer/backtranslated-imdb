The day I came out last year saw this movie. I thought it was fun. Okay, it's in the video now and I've seen it again. I love this movie! The things they do are sometimes dumb, but it will make my third favorite movie from time to time. Special effects are ok, but the witty dialog will be rolling on you. I am inspired by this film, if you like dramas and other items, avoid it. But all the others, have fun! Acting is amazing. Ben Stiller (I'm not okay, I'm not sick) and then Honey Azarraya's best (he's not a kami or a fruit) and then William H. Mackie has praised everyone with garafalo from Mackie for his best performance (Forgo Outsourcing), but I think it's pretty good as Kell Mitchell invisible boy. Two issues: the movie's most boring episode of the romance between Stiller and Claire Fours and Casanova's Pearl Hearing. Some scenes did not fully bring the story forward, but they were a blast. Kinka and especially the writers repulsed a scene, which was pleasing, but the bum they were going and you were ready to go. After watching I will make the oath, tired from the explosion climax (think it's pretty cool). The camera is very good, angry with the actors. Also, Tom Wates offers a wonderful performance (this is a slightly cooler evil hero coolness for him) and the best parts are when the characters show some humanness, as somebody says. Captain Amazing is pretty funny, (especially I'm mentioning Casanova's absolute plan) and as cool as Casanova. A beef: Always ridiculous comedian (Eddie izard) is almost wasted, but his heart is in the right place. So all in all, a wonderful picture. I give twenty stars and someday, everyone will see the film's best parody, the brightness of the Six Million Dollar Man One. I'm laughing as I think about it now. 20/10
