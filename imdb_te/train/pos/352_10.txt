I see "Valentine" and say that it is the best slazer film I have seen over the years. Unlike the recent trend in the 90s horror flicks, this movie is more concerned with being more strange than with self-grinders. For those who hate "Scream", the film does not have a reference to "horrendous rules" (although the old slasher film rules are here). <br /> It is the perfect blend of 80s and 90s horror. You'll get the 90's style of movies, cinematography, good performance and the stalking-slaser madness of the 80s movie. I guess in 2001, and finally the horror fans give the kind of movies they wanted. It's definitely a move in the right direction. <br /> <br /> Denise Richards plays a fun role here. Tell her if you like her role, and she will stand out. I loved her in this film.
