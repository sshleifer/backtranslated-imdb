I have enjoyed every episode pushing daisies this season, and I hope the writers strike is not too bad for the start of a very bad start. Ned has a restaurant in the center of town and is a pie manufacturer with a secret talent. Emerson is his personal special investigator. Charlotte (Chuck) is once a dead-but-no-child friend and sunny spot in the life of Ned. Olive is jealous, good-loving servant. Oh, and add the dog. Jim Dale came together with his amazing story, along with all the amazing characters. Chuck, Ned, and Emmerson Olive and occasionally multiple murderous secrets with Ned's special gift of bringing back the dead dog back to life. The show is funny, pure and romantic, very pretty and good-hearted and I would recommend to anyone.
