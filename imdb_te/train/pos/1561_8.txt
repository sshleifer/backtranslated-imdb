I really enjoyed this episode. My eyes expanded to see flash, cyborg, green arrow, and aquamon (even swim of everything he did). I look forward to many of the founders of the Justice League trying to reduce Lex Luthor. This sounds a bit off the bit, but making a live action Justice League show definitely makes me a reason to shove everything I normally do during the week down the drain to see an episode. The thrill I received from watching this episode. I think this episode has been a two-hour special for me because I think the hour of the Justice League is not enough. I'd like to say before it's too short before you (Smallville is cool again). When Lana started focusing on the show, it had lost its kind of touch. But I'm sure the authors certainly come into that loop hole. :( Enjoy this episode Who knows when another good guy is coming out, this Thursday, February.
