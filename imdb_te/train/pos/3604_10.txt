I think it's a great movie. Let's see how Diana's life at home. She got too aggressive, and she wants to prove to fight a lot of girls. I think she and Adrian are great actors. I am also in boxing. It really impressed me. The only negative part I think of. End. This is fine between Diana and Adrian. But it does not see how it looks at home. And I did not really like you and you do not even see what her father is doing, and her brother. But I feel like a great movie and I'm going to see a lot too :) Even when I do not like boxing, you can box someone, you can see much more than boxing. I have a great time watching.
