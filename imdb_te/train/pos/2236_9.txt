I remember most about this movie, which was broadcast on local KTLA TV (ch. 5), every Christmas season in the mid 70's, especially Christmas Eve. It is a bit disturbing to see hell as this girl goes to a lonely survivor in a flight accident in the Peruvian jungle. This young girl's graphic scene was very influential on this young audience when she pulled out of her infected legs. Not for a long time christmas cheer, I was used when I saw that. Not sure Rankin-bass is produced.
