I think Dark Angel is great! The first season is amazing, and has a good plot. Max (Jessica Alba) escaped as X-5, the creation of the mintor, while trying to comply with a normal life, "protect the world". The season is being hunted overly over the season, which gives the series extra extra spice. <br /> <br /> The second season was suddenly a bit odd. The plot has been wiped out, and it is very small because of the fascinating "creatures" of the series. The second season is great, but little "manticores" can not get me wrong a little bit. <br /> <br /> They have been able to regain a new expectation plot in the ending seasons of Season 2, in which I have a lot of hopes to see more. Components. It's not wrong with James Cameron behind this. So one conclusion I would say a great series, but I'm still hoping for the third season!
