Tony Scott can make good pictures and bad, personally feel he's a little more elegant and worse, and his writing may have trouble comparing his famous brother, but it's his best film. <br /> <br /> The film is so great that Scott Dengel (better than training day) and Dakota warmth is the time to develop the relationship of real warmth and sensitivity. It takes time, but it certainly is not boring - it takes part in it, and takes us on a little journey into the characters - including a wonderful character for Radha Michel. All of this can be done to make the actions more effective, because we have invested in spells for all their weaknesses. <br /> <br /> This film is not without Washington. I often wonder why he seems to be the most Duff characters when he is very clear that he is very clear there is almost any celebrity figure (I can only think of Daniel Day Lewis, one who really only has more power over the screen nowadays). The film should be heavy, given the strength and image quality of his status and performance. If it does not return to a studio helmet, it goes straight to the video. I thought I had the opportunity to see this big screen.
