Vince Lombardy High School is a new major - bad Ms. Togar (Mary Woronov). She is all set to ban rock and roll music together. Her Butts head with Ruff Randall (P.J. Souls) who loves Romance. Even the head of the school football team (Vincent van Patten) can not seem to connect with any girl - beautiful Kate Rambeau (Dee Young) not in love with him. <br /> <br /> An indirect midnight image. It was put in a simple release and almost immediately bombarded - but it was a massive hit and midnight film, playing all of the 1980s. I remember to be more than some of my colleagues in college - it's a party! <br /> <br /> These songs are singing, singing, laughing in every joke, usually enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Now I see why I loved it so much. The script is childhood and I can not believe what I heard. The characters change randomly and jumping across the movie. This is what some really funny lines and soles and Woronov saves amazing performances by Woronov (who she really is enjoying). Even everyone is full of power and top playing their roles in the top (as they should be). For Ramones ... I'm never a fan. I like the title tune but the rest of the songs do not really impress me. If you are a Ramones fan, you give this high rating. <br /> The spoiler warning !!!! It is mostly in children (it has a PG rating) who will probably find it crazy but fun. I think they'll like the end when I'm blown up high school especially! <br /> If you're in the mood for the silly midnight movie since the 1980s, you might like it. Otherwise avoid it. I will give 7.
