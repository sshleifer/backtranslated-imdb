Love is a love for purple life's struggles and helps those who do not strongly influence the struggles in life. Each character has an element of color purple. The image of love, losing, hope, hatred and success will touch. She lives in Jelly, loses her sister and enters her life to show her love again, all the time she ignores her father, and finally Sophia and she finally accepts him. Her toughness is good and bad, and even nitty, they have their voices and hardships through the movie, but eventually surpassed and it's a good movie. Good job for all cast and crew.
