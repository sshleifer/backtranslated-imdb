After a slow start, the BRUCE ALMIGHTY is a very funny picture that has something to say. It is not one of Jim Carrey's best performances, but he's still right. Morgan Freeman is right as God. Jennifer Aniston has some good moments. <br /> <br /> I would like the options of films director Tom Shadyak. He is also Liar Lear, Patch ADAMS, and The Nutty Propasar. In those three and Bruce Almighty, he takes a big comedian and tells him a human story. <br /> <br /> A comer, known to comedy, is able to get the talent he has acquired and telling a meaningful and intelligent story. <br /> <br /> My big complaint is that they should use more biblical instructions. I remember only three specific biblical instructions and they are the three comic parts of the whole movie. In my opinion, the first few drafts of the screenplay had more biblical instructions, but the producers were afraid of violating people because they were cut. <br /> <br /> I do not know what to do
