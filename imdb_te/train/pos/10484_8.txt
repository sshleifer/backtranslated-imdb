It is absolutely irresistible that the lovely do not even begin to describe "Save Grace"! <br /> <br /> Grace Trevatine (Brenda Blethin) has lost her husband, but her problems are going to be a lot worse. She did not give her the money and the best borrowed money she left. Faced with everything lost, she has to find a way to get a lot of cash ... faster! She came up with an idea when her gardener, Matthew (Craig Ferguson) asked the city's leading horticulturalist to give him advice on a growing mysterious plant. Grace soon realizes that her plant is marijuana, so they decide to grow her gardening skills with the highest quality weed, then sell it to pay off her best loan. <br /> <br /> The most important quality about "Save Grace" is its liking. Each character is very sympathetic, and, save the first 20 or minutes, the film is a good cheer of non stop. <br /> Everyone wants everyone to have a happy ending. Brenda Blethin is one of Britain's finest actresses, and why it is here. She may have satiric and breathing to a personal person. She is a good woman, but she's not stupid. Craig Ferguson is just as fun as Matthew. He's a deadbeat loser, but he's so kind that he does not matter. The remaining ensemble cast is also in this category, but must go to the ticket to specifically tweet. <br /> <br /> The French actor always has a disaster about himself, and is well suited to him, but he has great comedy skills. <br /> <br /> Nigel Cole finds the perfect voice for "Save Grace". It's all about it. One of the problems with British humor is that I have the power to come out of the film. Not here. The film is highly appreciated and is always fun. It's not just a smile and a good feeling to save "Grace" is not a preferred image that you leave. The film is not out and out comedy, it does not have two or three sequences less silly. <br /> <br /> If there is any problem with this film, the climax is a little confusing. Questions will be answered for answers and the end will have an unexpected twist. <br /> You see the "bad grace", especially when you are facing bad days.
