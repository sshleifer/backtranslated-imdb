It's hard to describe the bug in words, it is one of those movies that can really be seen. It follows a fluid and interesting story that I've seen recently in a Hollywood release. Its roles react to the chain of events in different ways, and the events characterize different paths for the characters, and the audience is just an observer. Almost all of the idea of ​​Proustine commentary flow of thought, waiting in an awkward way to see how the freelance in the script will be glued to you, it all works at the end. Moreover the background elements ... a particular scene in the case of the movie, with regret, bright and beautiful, and all the tragedies within a minute interval. It works. <br /> <br /> This film is pure magic. It reminds us why the independent film is currently the brightest star in the film industry. Perhaps with the quality of bugs, people start taking notice.
