If the style of the film is my "guilty pleasure", I'd say this is a simple fantasy type. While I'm pretty proud that the offense is an avian from time to time, guilty is the wrong word for it. "Stardust" is a good stock fantasy, Neil Gaiman (or Gaiman adaptation, like it). It's not a visual mix of Mirrormask, it's not the adult act of Pan's Labyrinth, and it's not the fun-loving classic The Princess Bride, but the fantasy-lover is adequately introduced to be completely comfortable during the entire viewing. Fantasy lovers should rejoice - Special effects work has finally become good enough and these items are now in the regular product. The wall goes to an adventure to return to a fallen star, love and approval of the most beautiful girl in their small town. To make things harder, however, Tristan's fallen star is actually a woman named Yvaine, and he's not only looking for her ... Some witches have their greedy eyes on immortality that can give the heart of the star, and a brother's fighting. From there it's all pretty imaginable, but it's some attractive fantasy elements, a warm warm up on the nature of love And the best part anam, Robert deniro as a gay pirate. In that note, Deno's performance spot-on ... It is not a high lip that many actors use to describe homosexuals, but one is surprisingly effective joke around his character, which resembles his character's role in the hard and hard character character Dorro's acting alternative forms. <br /> <br /> Starbust is a kind of film, perhaps for a long time in children and fantasy-loving shelves. . I can not say anything new, but it's not really there. <br /> It really is very happy, it is very enjoyable. <br /> - PolarisDiB
