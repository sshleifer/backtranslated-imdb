IQ is a beautiful romantic comedy with two great actors who seem to be very well on screen. A simple guy for the plot girl, the guy gets the girl's format, but with a heart that makes a solid point to be not in love and mind. The combination of Albert Einstein and his band team provides a wonderful comic relief. Overall, a good picture. Not great, but good
