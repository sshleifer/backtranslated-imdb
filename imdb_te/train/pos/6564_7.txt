Jake Speed ​​(1986) is an entertaining simulator of Indiana Jones and other stunts of popularity during the eighties. Wayne Crawford stars as Jane Speed, an adventurer who always struggles with evil wherever he goes. They are looking for some of the actions (and some good lines of lines) with his assistant Desmond Floyd (Dennis Christopher). They meet a young man named Margaret (Karen Copins), whose sister is kidnapped by a bad white Slider trader (John Hurt). <br /> <br /> Can Jake and Desmond get together to help her save her siblings? <br /> <br /> She is a rare and cheesy movie starring herself. I have to give this one a recommendation. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy movies that are fun and do not take everything at face value.
