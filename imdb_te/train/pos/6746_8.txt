This is a great example of Oto Premingen, as well as some lovely acting performances thanks to the spectacular direction - a rarely well-managed simple film noir story. Dana Andrews has acted as a hot-head detective who uses her fist instead of her brain. Soon after the film was launched, Andrews was seriously criticized for this and warned he would lose power if it persisted. Shortly after, when investigating a crime he attacks a suspect and Andrews has to fight to save himself. At this time he does not use high power but the assailant is killed. <br /> <br /> Andrews is a Phoenix and hopes they can not trust him, so he tries to conceal death - instead an innocent man is finally blamed for the crime. <br /> There is a lot more than this film - a plot inspired by a slimy villain (Gary Merrill) and Andrews (Jean Tarney). All in all, one of the best examples of this genre - with great gritty dialogue, excellent lighting and a simple yet very effective story. Noir is meant as this.
