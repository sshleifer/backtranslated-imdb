There are a number of reasons why I rated Sopranos so high, one of the biggest achievements of cast and character building. Each character separates each series further. Various 'short time letters' in each line are the same. Compassive gambler made by Robert Patrick is a good example of a character you feel for David (played only three episodes). Every little detail produced a perfect TV series. Round mob boss Tony Soprano (James Gondolphini) revolves around this event, trying to assimilate his criminal life with his character as his father. The program is not afraid to be bold and powerful with its dialogue and images and this is what makes it believable. Tony Coffee Paulie (Tony Sirico) and Silvio (Steve Van Zent) nephew Christopher (Michael Epielli) is looking for a promotion. In each episode Tony's other family also includes his children and wife Carmela Soprano (Eddie Falco). On these issues his uncle Junior Soprano (Dominic Chianese) is trying to get out of Tony's businesses out there despite being in house arrest. All acting are powerful and complex characters, but both who stand out too; Tony soprano 'James Gondolphini'. Michael Imperioli, who played Christopher, represents a criminal (20-30) generation of criminals. The modern artistic TV dramas of this work may not have been The Wire and Dexter if David Chase did not create. So Sopranos is definitely Godfather, Goodfellas and Pulp Fiction TV
