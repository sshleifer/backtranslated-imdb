For my Humanities Quarter Project for school, I chose to do human trafficking. After some research on the Internet, I found this DVD and ordered it. I finished watching and I'm still thinking about it. I say "wow". This is a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl named Holly, and a compelling story of the American man named Patrick, who tried to save her. The conclusion is that you are breathtaking leaves, and it is not quite after a happy-when-end, it is very realistic. It's amazing and I recommend it to anyone! You're really connected with Holy and Patrick, and your heart is broken up for her and what happens to her. I loved it and now I want to know what's next!
