There are chances, you'll feel very stupid to watch this movie for the first time. But, if possible, you'll see the second and third and fourth and fifth time (I'm now well into hundreds), you will spit a line from here and there and find yourself cracking! As they say, "If my friends and I want to know more about our friends and our friends, I threw the threats of a black hat."
