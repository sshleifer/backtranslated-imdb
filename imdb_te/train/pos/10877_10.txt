I saw this movie with a group of friends and went out of the movie to think how good it was in the two films, others laughed and commented on how stupid was. It is better because it does not need to take too seriously, mainly is the AA film that mocks the horror flicks and makes a damn good job .. is another movie emerging as much, umm ... scary movie ?? Well this is Aussie, and the original !!! Jessica Napier is a surperb show and Sarah Cons of acting is a definite bright future! I'll see them. Molly Ringwald is a good move, and Kylie is a good move. Queen of the Impossible Princess Screen I would recommend this film as you guessed until the end of the connection with Rafee, Hilary and the film that did not complete 20 years ago.
