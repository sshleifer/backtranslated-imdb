First, I said I made a mistake by looking at the order of election films. Unfortunately I said, because after the first election, the election was disappointed. Two pictures are in the form of gangster epic. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br <br /> <br /> In the first election, Big D and Lock. After some debates of "Uncle's" to the chairman of the chairman, they (almost unanimously) determine the head of the Lok (Simon Yama) Triads. BidD Big D is kidnapped by two of the pediatricians to freeze the electoral board next to the contender that the contestant is not competing with Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai) and influencing take-over. It has a disastrous outcome and trials can lead to all wars. Although the chairman of the chairman decided that the chairman would not officially change until the "Dragon Head Baton", the physical representation of the power. The current chairman, Whistle (Chung Wang), hid the transit somewhere in mainland China and the race continues to see who can get it back first. <br /> <br /> Most image is dedicated to the restoration of Baton. They are dodge the cops and opposite sides by looking for both amateur and heroes, leading to one of the scenes in the elections, a jet named Jett (Nick Cheung), Machete and many bad guys. To care for the existence of Nick Cheung at least ... I am surprised at the time of the second election when delivering the jet role in this influential director Joanie Sequel. If Nick Chung stole a scene, I should not fail because of the other actors. The election has a great ensemble cast with great ideas that are both subtle and effective. Simon Yum has his typical inspiration and the film is Lewis Co, Tony Lee Ka Ka Fai and Heavy Weight H. Actually, there are no weak links in acting and it is easy to believe that they are looking for real gangsters. <br /> <br /> While the performances are awesome, one of the most impressive about the election is for the Johnny Two-camera. There are some really amazing shots in the picture and it is unconsciously, as the cinematic innovator and very clever camera treat a series of placings and angles, knowing that he knows how to frame his shots. More than anything, a movie that looks bigger than all. <br /> <br /> My problems in the film have largely evolved from the cutting of characters involved in electoral activity. It is very difficult because these heroes have full length of characters that are not perfect. While the sequel focuses more on the two candidates, the first election gathers the whole electoral process throughout, tons, and police officers to the heroes. Perhaps the film may have a long time dedicated to the inner workings of the tride, or director Johny is to close the essentials and tell them more details about it. <br /> <br /> Bottom line - All in all, the awesome cruel film with the great cast, the wonderful direction, and the punctuation that packs a punch. It is a bit more complicated than it needs.
