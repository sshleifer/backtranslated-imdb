I liked the movie. Action sequences are very interesting, long and well done. I especially liked the opening scene with a semi-truck. <br /> <br /> Some scenes of scenes are filmed in interesting ways such as photography, outstanding colors, or interesting angles. Also funny parts are very many parts. I also liked how bad guy was shot too. Give this image to 8 to 8.
