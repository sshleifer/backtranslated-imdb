The classic concept of four humor (which is not unique to the concept of comic or entertainment), Altman's "H.E.L.T.H." All of the humor treats, and in fact the most funny, entertaining ways. Lauren Baccal is a slow, defenseless, and defensive character, plugged in by Esther Brill, whose mission is to show all the shows to protect the secrets of his age and beauty than all of them. Paul Duley's Choleric Dr. Gil Caner smoked around a fish in the water (perhaps a seal) and mobilized around the barking and reproach to subscribe to his water madness. Glade Jackson's Isabella Garnel's melancholy smokes Shakespeare's troubled and self-righteous hamlet - also improves a self or both. And do not forget that Henry Gibson's Biley character, Bobby Hammer ("the breast of the world for the baby"). The characters are then relatively delicate characters to obtain some kind of balance between Harry Wolfe and Gloria Burbank (James Garner and Carol Burnett, respectively), all the colleagues and serious comedies for H.E.L.T.H. - A type of World Trade Organization specializing in H.E.L.T.H, to say anything but health. This is Altman at his classic best.
