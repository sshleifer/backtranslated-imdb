This is an amazing film from 1936. The first hour is not very interesting (for modern audiences), a beautiful view of 2036. However, all the conversations - sound quality and tones (which America - but "the 1930s" American) make it harder. </ P> <p> In fact, this story is a 100-year-old look in a fictional US town known as a sweeping "ewantown". Since 1936, when a war horizon is over, until 2036, technology goes forward and creates its own problems. <br /> <br /> The first one hour is slow - think back. Events, suspense and visuals are pretty low in terms of today. However, when it gets in the future, it is just plain fun to watch. <br /> If you have great listening skills, the film is very difficult to hear. I understand only 80% of the dialogue. <br /> If you're a sci-fi fan, it's one of the genres and (at least the first hour after the first hour). Wait for the average viewer to have a closed title version there and see if you are comfortable with movies in this period of time.
