In areas where they overlap the year's good film outside of Innocence in 2004, it gives the feeling of a young man's eyes and heavy breathing. The effect here is very realistic, and the three leaders are in their way through the adolescent who are really weak. Three principals, I do not know all the most precisely-footed performances, kind of, in fact, I'm not quite surprised, so it's natural that they are hard to reflect this quality acting in other films if they do not hear again. If it's staying away from Art Houses and just outside of the Multiplex it is not intended to be a bubble group, it's good to talk.
