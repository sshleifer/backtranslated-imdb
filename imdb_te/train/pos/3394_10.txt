I purchased The Omega Man DVD on BD and accidentally saw this movie. Omega Man initially inspired 28 days, except for the rest of the TV movies. But Solent Green is in the other league. I'm betting one of these Tarantino's favorites. I have never seen at least 3 scenes in the film. Coming into bed with "furniture" when Heston talks about how totally unrelated! A whole group of people have been taken by a harbor of mechanical diggers! A priest was confessed and killed by a sin offering. Okay it is probably done - but there are not many films that are consistently like this. What the heck is between Heston and Edward G. Robinson? This is rarely a gay couple ever, or what? Fortunately, I do not know the ending of this film - it's obviously rare. I saw it again, and enjoyed all the small credentials of long-term scenes. Very good script - and some great sets too. When you want to see everything. . .
