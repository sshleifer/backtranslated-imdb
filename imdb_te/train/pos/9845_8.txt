I'm lying, it's a great movie. I saw my local theater 4 months ago. I have seen a second time, and I'm a bit frustrated in the slow scenes. Sid (sloth) does not praise all, but Diego (mountain lion, I think) is very good in the film. The animation is the best, and the story is a touching end. It's worth taking kids under 10 and under, but teens will probably find it a tad bit boring. Moreover, the uniqueness of the characters is very interesting. As I said, this is a good movie, but I rate "Toy Story 2" or "Shrek" high. 8/10
