Most people here I grew up with Scooby-Doo. Unlike many people who are here, I love this show! I think I've done very well and think of it. Everything about it is indicated as a spin-off which is not intended to take seriously. The formula is simple - it is a simulator of other cartoons with the same bad guy trying to get good man good. Using the familiar Shaggy and Scooby-Doo characters, it's easy to keep the viewer with ridiculous humor from the beginning of every 30 minute episode. <br /> <br /> Scooby-Doo spin-offs make it irritating fans. Scooby-shaggy-scrap shorts from classic 80s. These spin-offs were replaced by: they created new fans to sell new content, and put Scooby-Doo traders on the shelves. I agree "Shaggy & Scooby-Doo: Get a clue!" I do not want to be in this traditional role, but I would say that it wants to have Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy shorts, perhaps whatever it is: an action pack show that focuses on the best / ridiculous Scooby-Doo characters! Good features of the show: "Best Friend" relationship between animation, voices, attention to detail, bad guys, shaggy and Scooby-Doo, steady humor! Bad features: Remastered Mystery Machine is very close to time. <br /> <br /> Well, Warner Bros. Animation! One of the cleavest cartoons for a long time!
