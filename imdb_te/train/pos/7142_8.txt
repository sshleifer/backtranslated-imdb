The Holes, originally a novel by Luis Sachar, was successfully changed as an entertaining and well-made film. Starter Sigorny as Weaver Warden, Shia LaBeouf Stanley, and Clov Thomas as Zero, which were well-known by cast and actors. <br /> <br /> The film has led to the end of the storyline storyline. The main storyline about Stanley Elnotes and Camp Greenleak was a year and a half. The second storyline is about Sam and Kate Bar. This plot deals with racism and is a deep storyline for the film. The third is about Elia Yelnats and Madame Seroni, a 100-year curse of the Elnets family. In my opinion, these storylines are all very well. <br /> <br /> In contrast to many people's beliefs, you do not need to read the book to understand this movie. <br /> <br /> Acting in the film is good, especially Shia LaBouf (Stanley), Khalo Thomas (Zero), Sigourney Weaver (The Warden) and Jon Voitte Sir. Other members of the film have improved the comic relief of the film, such as D-Tent, Jake Smith (Squid), Max Cash (Zig-jag), Miguel Castro (Magnet), Byron Cotton (Armpit) and Brendan Jefferson (X-Ray). <br /> <br /> Though holes is a Disney movie, it deals with some serious issues like racism, shooting and violence. <br /> <br /> If I read or read the book, I have suggested this film for all ages. You should not lose it.
