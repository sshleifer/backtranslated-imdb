I understand that in the good way, believe me. Life is true, it is not. The whole Oirish thing is much thicker, but you enjoy the cast here-Flynn, Smith, Bond, Watson, Froyle, etc. All good. He's a boxer in the course of Mike Mazur, what else? <br /> <br /> Flinlin Gentleman is the best Jim, you can never get a dimensional look at him or the rest, I think, but it's OK, it's a cartoon and please. Boxing scenes were good, Ward Bond's Voiceville Logging Allar Act, and as you saw, the Billyclub armor Bobby came in two sequences into the scene. <br /> Really allotta fun, Flynn is a roll at the time and it's obvious to see why the audience loves him. <br /> <br /> *** Out * **
