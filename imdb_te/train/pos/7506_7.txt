I can not lie. Despite the interest, I saw The Notarius Betty Page because I heard (and it was very clear by looking at the film or looking at anything), Gretchen Mole was naked in it. I've never seen a mole fan, but I can not see the attractive lady who takes her clothes. Yes, it's dissonant, but it's one of the best and most prominent centers of the film and the film helps to stay strong. <br /> <br /> The film Betty Page (Mol) was a high school in high school at the time of her physical and sexual abuse, and in her new life in New York as a child. She wants to be an actress, but she also has to pay bills. After taking some innocent innocent shots on the local beach, the page is slowly changing modeling and quickly switching from suggestive photos to sexually provocative pin-up photographs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ On the one hand, the film never overstays its welcome. You will find the page in a few moments, and it will not come back to his modeling career properly. But it curses the movie, because we do not have the opportunity to comprehend all of the things happening. Modeling shoots and she's just kind of in the picture between the disputes they create before they are jumping in the last Senate investigation. You just sit there and try to enjoy everything, and you'll get more. Motion picture producers wanted to capture many of the materials in a movie too little. It prays for long sequences and prays for more explanations. It did not go quickly; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are a little more than a curiosity, use the color throughout the film. The majority are black and white, but often, splashes and sequences of color have emerged. But it started as an early symbolic symbol, but when it is constantly popping before black and white colors are cut, it becomes a distraction. It becomes confusing, and when the movie moves, it is more tedious than anything else. <br /> When it stops with actions, the film is dead with its background. Page, I know nothing about that, will play off innocently, and her world is exactly the same. Save her for some dark characters in her teenage years, and everyone she meets is an innocence, and everything she has done is innocence. I thought I would see full finesse nudity as something that was nothing other than vulgar and hateful, but here, it is something that really surprises at. It is beautiful and innocent at once. The most sexually-distorted movements in the film (although compared to today's standards) have a sense of both innocent and angelic. Mole's naked body was shot in a different chord than the naked body in other films. <br /> <br /> If there is any reason to see this film, it's very natural to look at the wonderful images of Mole's body while playing Bettie Page. <br /> <br /> The other reason is Mole she. As a page, she cites the 1950s southern southern belle (or can not imagine). Despite her career, she is still a normal person, and still sees her religiously. Molly is exactly the right amount of Sivek-Kleinovs needed to play this role since the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the supporting cast has fewer moments shining, and is completely covered by mole miraculous performance. None of them can do anything special, and they do not have the same strength in their role as mole in any of them. This is not actually the fault of the actors, but it does not work much with them. Oscar-nominee David Strathairn (in the role of one of his best performances), Sarah Palson (the recent Golden Globe nominee for the studio in Sunset Strip) and the character actress Lily Taylor, but you really have to set hard to keep their appearance being anything other than OK. <br /> <br /> None of these characters have really evolved, and they are just standing as character cutouts. She is trapping around the mole by choosing steam in her excellent performance. <br /> Really, this film is worthy nudity for its filming, and Gretchen Mole's Betty Page's best performance. Everything else is a bit too difficult and it is a bit worse than it is. The more work was done to develop supporting characters and not exactly the explosion through the story, the film was a better biography. <br /> <br /> It is a vehicle that is really grown into a stratosphere that is popular for Molal as an actress. <br /> <br />
