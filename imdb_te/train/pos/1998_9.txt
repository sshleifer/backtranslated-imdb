In the film Retro Magazine # 2, Mark Lester's voice is actually dubbed by 20-year-old female Katie Green. Though Leste feels perfect for the title role, director Carol Reid does not enjoy his singing abilities. The secret was revealed in the 2004 UK documentary "Oliver! Then they were fame". Green paid 400 pounds for her work and she had to confess to keep her shared secret, like Mark Lester. They kept the word and revealed the fact as part of the TV show for decades after the release of the film. For the record, Mark Lester left the acting and osteopath who studied in England.
