It's a movie I've read about my life's growing, but it's never seen until some years ago. This reputation really went forward. I knew about Michael Myers, saw the mask and saw commercials for all the next sequels. But I did not ever think of the Halloween franchise as I grew up in the decade that Jason and Freddie Horror had a gripping grip on the game. Boy, I was cheated by cheap knock offs. <br /> Halloween is a real horror movie. Now, according to today's standards, this is not graphic and visceral, but the film will provide many other horror films that fail to achieve today. The atmosphere created by John Carpenter is very creepy, and the fact that it is set in a clown, mid-west town is evidence of his ability. The lighting effects are right down to the horror, the "shape" looks seemingly visible and disappearing into the shadows. <br /> <br /> Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pilsons are all players perform well with special players. Ms. Curtis is a good lorry Strode because she is very fond of and hurt. <br /> <br /> Michael Myers is more intimidating when she is more intimidated because she directed, because we want her to survive and stay away from the director and the viewer investing in her. <br /> <br /> Donald Pleasan's Dr. Loomis is a man in a mission, and it works well. <br /> <br /> Overall, Hollywood is not only a great horror film but also a great movie. It functions at many levels and attracts audiences and never allows. This really scary movie should have a standard view of anyone wanting to feel. And for more terrible time, try looking at it alone with lights off. Do not be surprised if you look at the "shade" in the shade!
