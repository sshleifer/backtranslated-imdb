If you have any kind of heart and kindness to people, it's a tough image to watch, at least in the second half. <br /> <br /> This is what we see as a retarded (mentally challenged) man in a deep end after killing a young child and witnessing this ruthless action for the kid. It's not fun. <br /> <br /> This is good movie and acting is good. <br /> <br /> "Dominic" is mentally disabled and played by Tom Hughes. I thought it was Hulse's best. <br /> <br /> He made a med student "Eugene," by Ray Leota, who starred next year with Kevin Costner's "Field of Dreams". <br /> Dominic loves a good-hearted "Hulk" comic books and wrestlers. He's kind of "slow" guy but can not help but love and live a happy life. When he freaks, it is for many good reasons and ... well, look at the picture for the whole story. It's worth your time but ready to go on real emotional roller coaster and maybe upsetting some things that you see.
