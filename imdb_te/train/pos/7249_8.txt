In this movie, I would be very difficult to allocate the "fair" stars, but I settled in the 8 years due to its high production values ​​and an innovative approach to the war film in 1968. <br /> <br /> Long Days Dying is one of the most explicit anti-war films ever made. This is achieved by realizing some soldiers' actions in Northwest Europe in 1944-45. Prior to the film, the film has shown a war with inferior details of infantry, and is undoubtedly contrary to all actions permitting themselves to talk. <br /> There is no evil, no sensitive. Partially because of their condition - trying to stay alive - the characters come across the flat, familiar cliché. As "entertainment", the film does not make it, although it is not explicitly meant for "fun". It is intended to slug you on the illusions of World War II and the horrors of war and the war in general in modern warfare. It was twenty years before the platoon and private rayon savings thirty years ago, both were "very watchable" movies. Here are flat and generally disagreeable characters, lack of a real plot, and realistically unpleasant pictures (including Vanette on the first screen in theater history), although the film is 95 minutes, it's hard to sit. <br /> <br /> When it comes to 10 stars for production and realism, 4 stars is it, you will be a bonus star for the heartbeat in the right place. Average: 8. <br /> <br /> The horror, but more interesting and thought-provoking film, The Long Days Dying DVD, is similar to Karl Forman's lesser "The Victors". Why not? There are two movies cable several times.
