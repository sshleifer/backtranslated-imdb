This is an adorable movie. Feel good when you need a good image. This story is light (it's not Gant with the Wind) but sometimes, this kind of plot is needed. Funny and warm characters, fairy acting and beautiful dresses / wardrobe. <br /> <br /> Parminder K. Nagra (also from the TV show ER) is amazing in this role. She is definitely a new shining star for Hollywood. She should keep her eye on her, she will be big in future. <br /> <br /> There is also soundtrack for this film. A good combination of modern and Indian voices. I'm dancing in the movie too. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you have a fun movie you want.
