The film was not well received, though it was one of the best ensemble cast and one of the most realistic stories I have seen on the screen. Apparently true V.A. Filmed in a small budget. Hospital, the center of the story is Joel, which is well driven by Eric Stolts. Joel suffered a motorcycle accident and was hospitalized to the ward with other men with spine injuries. <br /> <br /> Although Joel-Anna's relationship is the primary perspective, Joel is in love with Anna, who played Hannah Hunt. Ward has many other well-developed characters. Wesley Snipes is a rotten raymond. More attractive William Forsyth is a bitter and racist blues. He then has two best sequences of Forsyth, and then, when he feels frustrated at the square dancers, and, after he feels empathetic for a young Korean man who was depicted in an alcohol store. <br /> <br /> Chemistry between stolts and hunters is very strong and they do not have the most intimate but absurd and romantic scenes. Emotions in the ward is sexy and amusing. There is also another memorable scene taken by Joel and Blows and the Korean boy a specially arranged van. <br /> <br /> The protagonist Neil Jimenez, director, Neil Jimenez, poet, is paralyzed in real life. This is basically his story. This film is not slow or elegant. It is amazing to have the amount of talent in such a small budget film. I recommend this picture to everyone I see because it also improves in the second film. It is ill that such a great work is ignored, but by video, perhaps it deserves a great deal.
