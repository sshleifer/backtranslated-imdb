In the future HG If scientists have believed that Wells is confident, history has not changed much in the future. 80 years ago Wells created this picture and explains in some ways near the world, first time. Famous players such as Raymond Massey, Ralph Richardson and Cedric Hardwick are in the cast, more sarcastic than real characters. This is a major weakness of the film, which solves all the problems devoted to the philosophy of science of science and the rest of us behind the backside fools. <br /> <br /> Massey characters and two generations of families have a positive outlook. Cedric hardwick man is a skeptic who seems to be running forward. And Ralph Richardson is a fighter who emerged from fighting another modern weapons of war for another thirty years. <br /> <br /> By the way the atomic bomb is not found, poison gas is considered a weapon that destroys humanity. <br /> <br /> According to Wells, science and win never get combined. As a group scientists are very much in politics in the world, participating in such things. Wells's lifelong scientists fled from Fascist governments on the right hand of Hitler and Mussolini. Anyone can defeat them and suppress them with modesty and create nuclear weapons introduced in the modern era. If they think they will like Wales, such as Albert Einstein would be the leader of the scientists who formed a new order after World War II. <br /> <br /> It was wrong in Wells' time and development. He never expected computer and nuclear power. Computer programmers are now our rulers in a brave new world than scientists. Somethings and Comes, directed by William Cameron Menzies, provided an interesting glimpse into the mind of Hay G. Wells, though he was certainly a respected thinker of his time, but he could not get the correct shape of the upcoming Things.
