Another fun, witty, rugged RKO musical, featuring Fleet, a beautiful picture with Astier and Rogers. Although it is not the stand-out teens of SWNG TIME ("Face the Music and Dancing" is the best in the team and is exactly the same), it's very pleasant, in the 1930s. Once again the plot is light and forgetting, but Fred and Ginger are seen together in dancing together in heaven. These two films are more romantic in dance and magic dancing. Despite the good fred and ginger music, it is absolutely necessary.
