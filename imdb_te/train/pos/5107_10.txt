80 soundtrack was not checked. I imagine that some of John Travolta songs were singing but in the movie watching it seemed to reflect everything that was 80 cheese. Mechanical bulls, bartenders and intimate movies are based on clear movies. Best is his lousy Texas accent. Compare to Friday Night Lights. Looking at cocktail and stair crazy I really suggested to start getting into the dumbing down of the film. Also, a side note in Made in America with Ted Danson and Hoopie Goldberg is an awesomely bad movie. I realized that I did not see it. Another strange film of this genre is the Cadillac Man with Robin Williams. Remember these BIG stars that have played big roles in these CHEESY movies. Tom Cruise, Richard Pierre, Robin Williams and John Travolta
