Mamet's "The House of House" was written plenty; Very good. After 17 years I decided to see that film again and see how happy I was to see it again. Movie success and durability are probably the most fun to do with two main materials. Good story and good scandal. Mummett marks his signature sentiment and clear hosternics for the film, the audience and the one at once. Then he recounts the art of cutting back and builds the story. "The House of the House" is now a look for a freebie, first timers in the cab and a return to the mammoth fans. (B +)
