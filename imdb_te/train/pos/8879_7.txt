<br /> <br /> The film is always very spectacular, until I remember that my college campus was a Nazi racist-killer-then-committed-suicide. <br /> <br /> His name is Benjamin Nathaniel Smith. <br /> You see him in Wikipedia - I've added some photos to their story about him. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of Omer Epips or Ice Cube, but Larry Fishburn, Christie Swanson, Jennifer Connelly & Mike Rapaport are good.
