It's great fun! I never read that Chester-Gould-Comics but I do not need to know them. Perhaps I did not get joked when I did not come in but did not get the heart out of the eye? It has a nice, colorful movie and good humor for all of the actors. In the setting of Batman, it appears in movies, but not dark and gray. Well, the story is very original but a storyline (which is not clear) and more or less surprising. <br /> <br /> See the friends with this movie. Do not look at credits in the beginning, and see who's faster to see who's next.
