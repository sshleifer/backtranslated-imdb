18th century luxury production values ​​and solid performances in this simplistic simulator of Jane Austen's satirical classics in the class and marriages of England. Norm and Paltrow are jealous and a silent blend of friends who go through lies to learn that they love each other. Good humor is a continuous virtue, which describes the accessability of the old source material (which is a bit reduced in its hard skepticism). I liked the look of the film and how the shots were formed, and the head shots like other movies in the 80s and 90s did not succeed. Very good results.
