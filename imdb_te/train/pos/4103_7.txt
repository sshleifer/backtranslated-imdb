The main characters in the film are divided into two categories: smart and stupid. Simple enough. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> Staita is honest (but majestic) stupid, and his friend Ondrage is a tired idiot and every time it is misinterpreted and done. With Andrejz, it's possible to go through life with some modest series of stinta success. <br /> <br /> Evan Trojan Zdenek plays a nasty intellectual character who has fallen into a Hitler-Esquire delusional cranium. Zdenek and his followers try to kill Standa to keep Zdenek's secrets safe <br /> <br /> I am impressed with high quality and imagination of check images. For a relatively small country, the Czech Republic has produced more than stocks of absolutely spectacular entertainment. The best Czech films I have ever seen: 1) Explosion and 2) Tamovodry Svet (Dark Blue World). If you see these two films, you have seen the perfect good of check movie.
