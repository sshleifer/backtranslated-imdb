This is a very difficult movie, almost impossible to get the handle on what is going on. First it requires an apartment and instead of a person (Trekovsky), rather than the current tenant (a woman) who committed suicide rather than a suicide pedestrian image. Then start the turns and turns. Are there neighbors trying to kill him? And why the dead renter's clothes turn up in the apartment? A wonders, finally, Trelkovksy _is_ if before the tenant. <br /> <br /> Spooler Spoiler Spoiler Spoiler Spoiler <br /> <br /> We are pulling us to Palinky. When we look at things from a character's perspective, we can assume that the role we see is the distortion of reality and reality. We imagine when we look at the facts from the viewpoint of the camera of its users - but Polanski's camera is lying to us.
