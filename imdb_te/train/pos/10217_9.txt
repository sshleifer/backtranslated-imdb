Unleash a hurricane in the fluttering Pacific of the butterfly wing in the Atlantic. According to this theory (something about Chaos Theory, I'm not sure), every action, no matter how small or small, the chain reaction that leads to larger events begins. This little jewel of this movie shows us the sequence of characters that are not seemingly-unrelated, many in Paris affect their lives. (A six-degree-off-separation theory can also be applied.) Each story is a jewel of the film. The performance is properly tuned and (Audrey Tatou is bright), stories are mesh correctly, humor is right, and the viewer dances in the theater contract.
