The prime example of its time choreography and more graphic pictures of the '60s is the prime example of a landslide landscape, by establishing friendship based primarily on survival skills by the innocent Hustler (JON VOIGT) and his loony con-man Sidekick (DUSTIN Hofmann). <br /> <br /> The symbolic of the "end of innocence" in American films, it is the best movie Oscar-winning X-rated film. <br /> <br /> Jon Waigt is the easiest way to earn money when women fight on the body of the big city, but soon the city is no cool destination for her home. He isfriended with a lame canman (DUSTIN Hofmann), who goes through serio-comedy adventures, which is disappointing and bitter, cooling cold water to the promised sunshine in Florida. <br /> <br /> In the final quest, both of them lost. John Schlesinger Waldo has directed the manuscript from Wonderful Witch through Salt and John Barry's haunting "Midnight Cowboy" theme adds sharp movements in search and despair. <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p>
