I criticized the film's announcement, "If you can get morality ..." The courtesy is in the conscience of others, as is. This is a good movie with a classic murder mystery, but a typical twist on the surface by the midway. The viewer is surprised by the viewer, "what am I doing in this place?" And I have to believe what exactly the intent of the filmmaker is. Finally, and the film will succeed in making the audience entertaining. I was not always on the stage of violence, but just turned off the camera. We know what has happened now. It can not be served before us, it rubbed in our faces, it will be today with contemporary blood and gore dressing. Furthermore, violence is not obscure. The moral chaos of this scholar, even though it was clever and confused, was fixed.
