I remember this presentation from Swedish television. <br /> <br /> Remember, I visited the series again and suspected my doubts and doubts. br> <br /> <br /> Although it was released before the alien and other places thrillers, I suspect I have a source of scary films from the political atmosphere of 50: s and 70s. When I think of it, this is a picture of real science fiction, trying to talk about scientific and political questions about what we are and what we do. The word psy-fi has since become dark and the word is derived from any of the space-ships.
