Some of these clicches and some of the above, moms like Dawson's creek (talking about talking to a 16-year-old when life is in sense), but overall it seems like a good show. The characters seem to be very real, and the story seemed to move along well with the pilot - in the end a good lesson ended. I'm not the first to change every episode life, it's a lot of play for that vehicle. Jeremy Contacter works as a hobbyist for a baseball, and I believe that many of us will be associated with the tunnel's perspective for a group of people who are in awe and sometimes want a part.
