This animated feature (co-production between Ireland, Belgium and France) is one of the most obscure for a film: the book of the famous bright book of the 9th century, Kell's book. In this miraculous restoration of the story, Brendan, a preeminent boy, in a monastery who is ruled by his uncle, finds the forests needed to complete a masterful illuminating book, Aten, forbidding a strict emigrant and surrounding panic that threatens to create the protection of the Abbey from the invisible Vikings. To do that, he suddenly helps with a friendly miracle called Isis. With all creative use of the medieval and traditional Celtic art, and all the geometric shapes of color and all geometric shapes, this is a relatively fantastic, but a good novelty, not different but putting off some kind of eye-opening (with some computer animations in some key passages). 9th Century Like an African monk in Ireland, beyond a few acronyms, if one is naughty? In this film, a combination of Celtic Paganism is not really a combination of Catholic spirituality. And humorous relief is sometimes quite wide. That is why I can not give them the highest rank. But these are some of the happiest and brilliantly imaginative picture issues.
