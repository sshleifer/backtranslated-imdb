I saw this last Friday at the Los Angeles Film Festival in Lavelle's Beverly. The film got a lot of applause from all the movies in the evening. The two music videos were originally opened, they did not know what I imagined when they were very fast and focused, and I'm not sure I'm ready for a short time soon. But my surprise I really enjoyed this. I thought the main actor was really good at the devil. I was impressed with his performance that I had checked his name. I was surprised that it was Witch Blade Guy. He has gotten really good since then! That or he has given lousy roles or have been pushed to the director really difficult for this little. The girl did okay job. I strongly guess this because it is her first appearance and very young. Father did well. There is a lot of really nice cg work for a short, and even less acting for these two "Mexican Hat" is also good, but I enjoyed it very much because it had so much depth and emotion and I actually cared about the characters. Other very simple story. The story is very illustrative and dark! Dealing with real things using more fantasy like the approach to keep me add as it is of interest. We can not talk about the last film in the block I left. My only complaint is that I only watched the demonic character and started a little less when it started, which is why I gave it from the 10. I also thought that last credits went a little slow. Otherwise it is beautifully told, directed and edited. Time is very good with a complete change from the fast MTV edition of today. In the future, the director is coming from this director as well. I do not think of him as Witch Blade as Soros Last Actor now.
