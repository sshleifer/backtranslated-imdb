In my humble opinion, this film is not well-received. Robert Redford lives near me here in Provo, Utah at Sundance. I am very happy with his work, this is my favorite. We're sorry, but most people do not appreciate it. My grandmother was an avid reader and read the book years before it came out on the big screen. She gave me this because we read this movie. The film and the book hit an emotional spot inside my heart, and I was weepy for several days after seeing the film. Love is sometimes not enough to keep our loved ones from hurting themselves. We see this in family family relationships, but our love and families and their stories are throughout the ages. Cinematography is accurate and breathtaking - I was amazed by its beauty and raised the words of the author of the author of the writer Norman Macleen. "But I'm alone in half light, all the existence of my soul, my memories, and memories, and the sounds of the Big Black Foot River and Four calculation rhythms and a fish will grow The hope is that, in the end, all things are merged into one another, which cut through the great flood of the world and runs over rocks from the basement to the rocks are timeless raindropes on some rocks are the words under the stones, and some words are theirs I am haunted in water. " (By Robert Redford, who describes Norman Macleen), my own According to the write, the writing. Any possible disadvantages of the film are covered by the beauty and grace of the story and cinematography. It's beautiful!
