Although I was recommended by members of my family, I did not see this program first. Funny enough, my girlfriend lives in Hadfield (filming location) and when I first visited her some places suggested. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " In addition to identifying some locations, at least a bit of surprise. Once again, BBC is responsible for producing another example of the best comedy in the world. TLOG is easily the best with Red Dwarf, Fawlty Towers and Monte Python. <br /> <br /> Now it's quick to say that I've put on the program. The characters are amazing and show an unusual depth in retaining a scarily realistic edge. <br /> <br /> The look and feel of the show is perfect and reflects North's sad feeling (Hadfield is disrespectful, I find a very welcoming and warm place). Everything in its run is realistic (which is based on the 2nd series recurring last night in the UK, which is perfect). <br /> <br /> Finish the BBC well!
