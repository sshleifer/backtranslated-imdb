After watching mixed reviews and watching mixed reviews, I thought the movie was fantastic, not only of visual beauty, writing, music score, acting and directing, but throughout Joseph Smith's story and the road he felt his way and for the belief that God considers The road that traveled through the hardships and persecution life. I am very happy to tell the story of this great man. I would recommend every one of us to give this opportunity to any of us, whether we or her to walk, and to make it a better way to live our life with a more determined and loving life.
