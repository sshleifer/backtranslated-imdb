Well you O.J. All American soldier Simpson turned out to be an American bus driver who decides to save his own passengers, no one does not go there and Art Johnson does not know what to do entirely in the role of a tour guide, they agree in trouble and leave a busload of people who die on dessert and you turn the action, plot turns Face three infants intended not to have Lorenzo Lamas is one of the bad guys want to combine it with strength and a lot of drama. Everybody would be fine, but LAMOS looked like a victim of the slave and really left my mind. He was kidnapped heiress but very sexy bad guy who wanted to intimidate women and attempted to hinder the man who tried to stop him. It's a long time before he cultivated his good man's film. And I really do not miss you in a 20 year old Lorenzo hard jeans!
