Batman: The Mystery of Batman is the latest animated Batman, released directly to the video / DVD movie. (Small spoilers ahead) The plot revolves around a new arsenal, Batwoman, seems to be involved individually, for no reason, stopping a major arms transportation. <br /> <br /> While the film is interesting enough, it is 'masque of phantas,' 'sub-zero,' or 'return of the joker.' The main reason is not giving off the emotional appeal made by other movies. At the end of the film, we can not be forgiven as much as 'sub-zero', as we do in others. There is no real tragedy made by us other animated films. Bathmoon is not really a 'tragic' character (such as Mr Freeze or Fanasus). Not only that, but Baathuman's Alter Ago is so incredibly 'hard' and dull, it is not really masked to the audience or what is happening to her and the main reason why we can not get this particular emotional appeal. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, the movie is very happy. It has moments when audiences are really looking for Batman and looking back at an older villain that appeared in the original old Batman: The Animated series. <br /> <br /> If the bathroom background is more interesting, the film will be better than the 'Return of the Joker' in my book, but now for the <br /> <br /> Animation, from the mid-1990s The New Batman Adventures of Cartoon It's one of the last. <br /> <br /> The score is not reminiscent of previous 3 animated Batman films, but it still looks good. <br /> <br /> I recommend buying this DVD because, despite its flaws, it is fun. <br /> <br /> Other Batman animated films are not as good. <br /> <br />
