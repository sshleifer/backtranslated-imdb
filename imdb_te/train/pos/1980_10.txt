One of the last great musicals of the late 60s. I first saw this film at the age of 7 and it's always been my favorite. Musical numbers are all memorable. Participants in musicians in the 60s actually had musical talent (unlike a certified academy award, the current musical nomination was proposed in a major Midwest city). All the main characters are beautifully cast ... Ron Moody is shining as Fagin, as Shani Vallis as Nancy. Oliver Reed is a frightening Bill Six (fortunately no musical numbers, lol), and Mark Lester Oliver and Jack Wild. Mark Lester appears to be an innocent voiced, which Dickens intended when he wrote! Then, dozens of dancers participate, "think of yourself," "I will do anything" "who will buy" and "stay soon", there are a lot of kids! This is a great show for the entire family.
