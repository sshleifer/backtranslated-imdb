There are many illnesses in the mind of a man who gave life in modern times. Constant vigilance or gained information in the realm of Pyschosis, kept them busy psychologists, counselors and psychiatrists with enough work for decades. Occasionally, this psychological phenomenon is invented by some who do not know about their compensation or their existence. The premise of the film entitled "The Night Listener". It tells the story of a popular radio host story called Gabriel Noon (Robin Williams), promoting his audience to his amazing audience on gay evenings. Perhaps because he lost his authentic layer, he admitted he was helpless. He tries to live in his deep frustration and loneliness, thinking that he left his lover Jess (Bobby Cannawale) and his friend and best friend (Joe Morton). It is here, and the mystery of the night asks him for help. Noon needs to feel useful and comes to the upset voice of a 14-year-old boy named Peter (Rory Culkin). When reading the boy's tough manuscript of his brutal parent's early life and sex abuse, Noon is attracted and wants to help. However, they do not appear and Nuane soon surrounded him in a vague and extravagant story that is crumbling right from medical nightmare. The film is pure Robin Williams and Tony Colelt, who plays pop as Danny de lagand, Sandra Oh Anna and John Callum, may be a joke. Instead, it has proven to be one of William's more serious performances. ***
