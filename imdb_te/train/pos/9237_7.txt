This film is great. Half a year ago, I bought on DVD. But first I thought it was the original film. I've seen the series and it's a good movie, but here, they have put together "Living Legend, part1 and 2", and "Fire in Space". That's the same they've done in the first movie, but with other parts. But still, it's a good movie. The end is only strange (you do not see what is going on in Pegasus). But I still think that it is good. Actors and special effects are good. If you do not see it, look at it. Featuring: Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict, Lorn Green, Herb. Jefferson Jr., Tony Swartz, Terry Carter, Lloyd Bridges, Jack Staufer.
