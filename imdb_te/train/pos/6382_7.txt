Absolutely good idea, the screenplay was perfect. If you're adventurous, if you're new to thinking about the lost world of Atlantis, you will feel personally. It's much more efficient than this idea.It should have ended with a better adventure than this.It's not bad but some more runtime.It was so enjoyable though it's so boring or not so good.The adventure of Sindbad like El Dorado road Animations are good for those who like it. This movie is also recommended for those who are looking for a nice little adventure that is very happy.
