It took a long time until I can find the title in a separate video form in Berlin, and I'm fortunately hollandish titles to find the English version. I think this is one of the best horror films. It seems strange that some people call this film a black comedy. I saw for the first time (and for the second time!) Trekovsky looks good in his Siri behaviors and I can not laugh when it looks beautiful, but on the other hand, he does not have this boy in the playground. But the most unpleasant thing in Simon Chowley and in fact, he does not really know, is not actually his transformation. His postures in the film are terrifying. Of course it's in his mind, but it is also before this flat brings out this male side or even before he's moved - I think it's an interesting question. His shauzofranic behavior is hard to understand and it is terrible to see its two sides or fighting identities against each other. The result is that he cuts his hand first and then jumps out of his / her window. But this terrible cry - understand, that all over again and again ... that his soul is in a cage or something? And what about these Egyptian hieroglyphs and other Egyptians? He / she looks like a mummy in the hospital - this is not an incident, but a clue in my eyes.
