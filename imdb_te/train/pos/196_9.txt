This is a wonderful introduction to the Marian Davis talent and beauty of me. She is gorgeous but not happy with the film. (I believe that she has modeled her career in the style of Lucille Ball Davis), which is called "Beauty of Beauty.") Vidore's direction is light-hearted, but the story is chestnut but acting is contemporary, and the star-moving element , With many guest roles, adds a whole fun. It combines slapstick elements with adult play and good old timeless romance. For fans of all fans who have knee-jerk reaction to watch silent movies, your attitude can change and change. <br /> <br />
