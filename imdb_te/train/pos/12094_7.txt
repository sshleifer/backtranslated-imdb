Fortress of the blood of quality work in the style of horror in Italy in the 60s is a good example. Old dark house, atmosphere, a good story, and Barbara Steel - the film has all the right things. <br /> The story refers to a haunted castle. People visited, but no one came back. Our hero will spend the night in the castle and make him wager to collect his winnings. However, a special night that he visits at night. It is every night when the dead is dead. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's almost padded. There is a lot of the first act that literally does not happen. Our hero stumbles around the dark to find nothing of interest. <br /> If he finds something, the film is so sweet. <br /> <br /> Blood Castle is typically a must for Stei fans and fans of Italian Gothic horror.
