Who do you hear of all the miserable people who did not complain from the conversation, budget, complaint, complaints? The point of this outside-beautiful image is your loss if you've lost it. Those who love this movie do not care what you think. I was a thirthysomething person who saw thousands of movies in my life, and this is in my book, its own company. This is not a documentary, or a completely genuine account of what happened that night. This is the most amazing love story ever tried. I know it's a 90-year-old and a millennium everybody is a strong one, but I do not. Someone has complained that someone has made a lot of money in this comment board! How lame? It made things of money for every civilized country on the planet, and the highest grossing film on the planet. I am happy with the majority at this time. Well, cynics, time to crawl under your rock, I finished.
