"Dr. Kaligari's Cabinet" is the father of all horror films (and German Expressionist Cinema), the predecessor of the WWI film grandfather. A nominal student, who is hungry in an empty space, makes a deal with the devil - the devil gives him gold bars instead of "anything in this room". The devil chose a student image in his mirror. He walks with student Doppelganger, who is accused of a student's alleged offense. <br /> <br /> The cinematography of the 1913 is technically a portrait of some of the limits set in the former state; The plot for the Chirroscuro effects is telling, but the film is essentially filmed in daylight that is not completely shady. But the scene that goes out of the mirror mirror still carries a tape. </ Sp> <br /> The Prague Student of Prague is still worthwhile.
