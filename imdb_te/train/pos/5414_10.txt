This happy-go-lucky 1939 military Swashbuckler relied on his novel "Soldiers Three", along with Rudyard Kipling's memorable poem, as the first-rate entertainment of the British Imperial Army in India in the 1880s. Carrie Grant hit him with his knuckle knuckle more than he did in all his movies. The six fistful foil, set up in remote India, was stolen by three tough British sergeants and their local water bearer Ganga Din (Sam Jaffa). Sargent Archibald Cutter (Carry Grant of "The Last Outpost"), Sergeant Mack Chesney (Oscar winning Victor McLoglain of "The Informer") and Sergeant Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. of the Dawn Patrol), Ballantine Emmy Stebbins (Jon Fontaine ) Is planning to marry and enters tea business because hard-drink Young, hard-broling, and fun-loving alpha boys are expected to create history. Obviously, the cutter and mock shine can drum for classed schemes to block Belentine's plans. When their officers retaliate with Sargent. Bertie Higginbotham (The Sheep Steps Out of Robert Coot), Cutter and Mackens Drug Higginbotham, so he could not follow them and the ballantine was to be replaced by him. Half of the fun people are trying to get to know each other without hating themselves. Directors George Stevens celebrate the spirit of adventure in our great style and range, as our heroes get caught up with Thuggees' army. Lancer Joseph H. August received an Oscar nomination for his outstanding black & white cinematography.
