I'm a big fan of Morgan Freeman. 'The Shawshank Redemption' is one of my best favorite movies. But I have to admit that I'm often thinking about the selection of his characters. Most of his titles do not have big budget clocks. <br /> <br /> Freeman refers to Freestone's return to a role that he really shows his famous performing talent. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He has been doing a research in a grocery store in a poor neighborhood in LA and has been given a part in an unspecified Indian film. After being trapped by her Flaky Driver, Freeman is offered a semi-friendly guy by checkout girl Scarlet (Pazz Vega). Before taking her home, Scarlett has a job interview she needs, and Freeman agrees to ride the bike instead of riding. <br /> <br /> Motion picture Scarlett and Freeman is a role piece for many places, but the movie really is between two interactions. Hollywood has been controversially dismissed by Freeman as not heard of the target and does not know any day of his own telephone number or week. He inspires wisdom from the Dalai Lama, who calls "an entire world non-phase" mentality and Scarlett's job interview as an 'audition'. And yet he has a way to people, influencing them to spread beyond their fame. He is a fan of humanity. He studied them, asks them for everlasting questions, and others will be happy in their quest for angry ones. In Scarlet, he was stubborn, proud; <br /> <br /> Scarlett, a part of her, shows a deep pride and sharp tongue that works to hide her own insecurities. Freakon plays a fast role in connection with the connection, which almost leads to the line between daughter's love and physical attraction, but she plays pretty well and it's no crazy with noise. Despite her connection to the growth of Freeman, Scarlett has eyesight for the reality of their different worlds and refuses to beat Freman's Hollywood bull * with sharp pragmatism. This image is fine, funny and well written, with a simple but effective dialogue. As I read an IMDb review, I thought the lines were 'frozen', and I thought it was wrong of the actual human speech. There's no big self-confidence, no deep soul moments are searched. So trick, I think, to show people how to duplicate connections with each other in normal, everyday life. And I would like to shoot Freeman and Vegas beautifully, depicting a link between two people glancing at sea, sunshine and obscure sun. When you lost it, you've lived in your memories and you know what's going on. OK, it's a bit flowered, but I really did like the shows and the movie. I would definitely recommend it.
