Best Seller Book and Smash Broadway's Outstanding Picture Version The play about the lives of Sadie and Bessie Delaney, two African-American sisters lived at the age of 100 and tell their story of a century in American history. Ruby Dee and Dianne Carroll will be performing better as Bessie and Sadie. Amy Madigan also started Amy Hill Hart, the sister of the White New York Times reporter, and so on. The most proud of the scenes and the present days are also very powerful, like in the book if not quite inspirational. This is not the only definitive element in the story, the only real disadvantage to the fact that the racial background between the sisters and the fact that their father is very tight. But other than that, very well, amazingly demonstrated, powerful image.
