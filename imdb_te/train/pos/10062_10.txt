Wow. What a wonderful image. This script seems to be the only film written by Mingloon Vai, and I hope he has more stories. <br /> Acting is amazing. Very natural talent, and Zhu Juh happy - is too old to be exhausted old conservative. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack is very effective, without it being guidance. <br /> <br /> In Hollywood or Hong Kong, more movies have taken place.
