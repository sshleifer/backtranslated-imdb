Fan of looking at more of the phenomenon that was fired at school, this film took interesting and different approach to the idea. The efforts of the movie (Codename for the Day of Attacking), which lead to zero problematic two current troubled men (I can not refer to people who kill boys or young people) present the situation from the anti-gun end. It is intended to illustrate the pain they suffer, and focuses on literary preparation. The problem is very small in terms of emotion. As expected, the only thing that has been emotionalized is out. But when it leads to this stage, it is not clear why they are guiding this plan. They mocked that fate story, but the film is also contrary. Without destroying the image, it's easy to say that it's a great effort and equally great intentions, but comes short of sloppy image making. All direction is enthusiastic, a homemade video concept, but the story and the continuity are weak. The movie is determined by the audience, but it failed to provide information for such an event. The ending is unintentional and does not feel that everything that started the film is complete.
