If this movie is together with a tad, it will be up there for the best of Astier and Rogers. <br /> <br /> It is best to have a sexy subclot with Rogers' sister Rondolph Scott, who played the role of Harriet Hollard (wife of Ozzy Nelson for Baby Boomers). <br /> The two Navy men of Scot. Scott meets for first time Scott Hullard, who looks like a stereotypical librarian, and then Ajinger Rogers has asked her friend (a non-sleek lousyl ball) glamor. Meanwhile, Astaire tries to pick up where he and his old dance partner are leaving. As a result, Astereller and Rogers, along with the band, featured some special dance numbers like "All My Goods in Basket," "Let Yourself Go", "I add Warrior the Band". Hillard is sweet but in spite of Jane becoming a glamor, she sings both songs well, "But you are you?" And "Behind Me Your Them, Satan" - a poster not for that song, but I love the title. Rogers is alive, and a teenage atmosphere is a dynamo. <br /> <br /> "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is one of the most extraordinarily beautiful songs ever written by one of the most radiant performances by Rogers and Astiors. In this, they cite '30 glamor and fantasy. It's really wealthy and looking back again.
