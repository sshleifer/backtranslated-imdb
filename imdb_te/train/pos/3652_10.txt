On Sunday afternoon, I started watching this TV movie again and thought it was another mute air disaster movie. I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> "Pandora Clock" is a brilliant political thriller that goes beyond the quality of many TV movies. <br /> <br /> The cast, including the famous actors Richard Dean Andersen, Edward Hermann, Robert Gillam and Robert Lorgia, is amazing. Daphne Juniga as a medical expert for the CIA converts one of her best performances, and Frasier's Jane Leaves is also great. <br /> <br /> This conversation is well written and compelling throughout the story. In fact, the final theme is filled with turns and silence, and you can not leave your seat for the second time. If you get the chance to watch this movie, spend time - about four hours. You will be richly rewarded!
