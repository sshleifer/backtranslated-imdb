Although I live in Minnesota, recently I was studying in France and came across this weird gem. <br /> <br /> This film is awesome, to say the least. The creative and unique movie, reflecting the different directors, gave a description of their love in the City of Light. The first nature is the effort to fit everything in these short stories to the whole storyline, which is the love of the 2003 love. This attempt, however, does not exist the magic of each segment. When faced with the face value, tell the stories of love with a small message that is made up of its own personal image. <br /> <br /> These films are often strange - chaos - and every single segment is hard to follow. However, after the short period of time, the small space lines are clear to the guardians who care about each category. The confusion is almost intriguing; It puts your seat on the edge and waits for the next. It surprises the viewer "Is it really just what happened?" But it is satisfied, in fact it happens. This is a movie that can not determine whether a loved one or a loved one is loved by the theater or they hate it. <br /> <br /> The multilanguage film adds something to the spectrum of people who make interesting decisions to make polynional. There is a relationship. It adds to the reality of the film - here, American tourists speak English, Parisian French, and so on. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The love of parental love from illness, parental love, has all the evidence of this film. Romantic storytelling. In its beautiful and quirky way, every single event comes into place to tell something a story: all types, sizes, nationalities, and love shapes.
