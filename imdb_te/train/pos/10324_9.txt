In the 30s, the confusing amusing piece, spin in the classic Cliffhanger series, has been the lowest budget, and sponsored by Michael Anderson, as "Lost Ark Riders". Opening scenes are a generous amount of Gothic Art Nouveau, two decades before Batman. Ron Ely (Tarzan) is a casting hero and beautiful Pamela Hansley does not appear as the Mona tagging native glacier, on a golden ship in the Latin American country of which Hidalgo does not exist. <br /> <br /> "Mona, you are a brick!" <br /> <br /> Paul Wexler's Ham-and-Cheese Blackhot, Captain Seas is a perfect pleasure. A little bit of "Riders ..", "Batman", a little "Lost World", a little "Lost Horizons" and campers expect a whole lot and you will get it right. Look out as a minor role for fictional favorite Michael Berryman and enjoy the camp use of John Philip Sosa's patriotic music. A major candidate for DVD release, it's seasonal. An unmissable treat for the whole family. 9/10
