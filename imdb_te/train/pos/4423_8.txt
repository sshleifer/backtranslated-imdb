GOJOE uses a little first, but the final result is very satisfying. This story tries to redeem himself about a massacre samurai, but the dangerous samurai is more valuable than the watch. From the physical survival to the wealth of the soul there is a lot of them here. <br /> <br /> The film initially appears to be similar to the other anime-inspired samurai, but it will eventually delve into the maturity / adult landscape. <br /> Do not miss. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (Return to www.nixflix.com) for more detailed review reviews of film and other foreign films)
