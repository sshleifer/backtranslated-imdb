Like all eco-friendly films from the 1970s SOYLENT GREEN, the environmental meltdown is a cheesy scene. Are there many people to feed a large population? I am concerned that the drought has been caused by wars or failed economies. In the 1930s, Stalin's policy in the Soviet Union killed millions because of drought and today Mao rural disaster in China has led to impoverished deaths of 30 million in the 1950s. And do not forget the great famines in the horns of Africa in the 1980s and 90s, which are not conflicts. There are no drought in modern times in both the most populated areas of land, Hong Kong and Macau. Similarly, the expansion of Shanti towns around cities that do not meet the demographics - is not down to the economic factors that people are moving to cities for better paying than people in rural areas (not the quality of industry progression for many generations) The streets of New York City Some people are sleeping on the stairs It's ridiculous. <br /> <br /> "It's the fruit of the sall and thorn, brandy and fresh meat, but it's not dawning <br /> <br /> Feeling ice in his whiskey, puffs and classic line on cigarette "I'll smoke these two days, maybe three days, if I can save myself."
