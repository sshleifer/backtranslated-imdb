The victim is a slow, entertaining romantic thriller with several graphic and "blasphemy" scenes that undoubtedly disrupt many audiences. However, it is difficult for them to compliment many fictional sequences of the film, or to ignore crab's first-rate performance. The visions of the hero makes sense of witch nakedness throughout the movie Vreowen. Unfortunately, in the last 5 minutes everything becomes obscure, and unsatisfying ending is not exactly as good as the rest of the film. (***)
