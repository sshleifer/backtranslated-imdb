The film is very good for the reconstruction of the two films. The last one, Heaven is great, is great, I suggest you see one. It's not so great. The third part of the film is not so bad and Chris Rock begins to show humorous entertainment where he is today. However, I do not know what the first two parts of the film are. It was a bad bad "B" movie that people sound like a somewhat bad TV sit-in. Conditions are forced and they are trying to get the story, so they can start a real picture. It's a real duplicate and editing is just bad. I do not know how to release this movie. Anyway, the last episode is not bad, so wait for the video and then look.
