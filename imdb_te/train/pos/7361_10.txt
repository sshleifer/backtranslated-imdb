This film is usually classified as a worst image product. Ever. But in my opinion it's probably ridiculous. The horror direction and screenplay makes this film invaluable. I bought the movie while sifting through bargain DVDs in my local pound shop. Me and some friends saw it, when in an injected passion. It soon turned out to be not a simple film. Instead of perhaps the priceless relic of what James Cahill will be the last film. At first we were shouting for confusion and dvd player but fortunately our unusual state could not bothered. Instead we looked at the film. In the end we realize that we will soon get some money, you can laugh at the hours of acceptable hours, but laugh at all the wrong reasons. We have shown all of our other friends soon and they also agreed, this is not the work of the static image. This is a movie you're smiling really laughing at yourself. It's a pleasure to make anyone happy. It's intellectual.
