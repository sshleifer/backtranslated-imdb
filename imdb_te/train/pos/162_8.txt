This thing rocks for a "no budget" image. I do not know if I like America, but we're laughing through all the way. Some really funny funny stuff. Not really Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The musicians and music went through. Cars and gags and even crack us less in your face stuff. <br /> <br /> I've seen some of the earlier actors, but anything like this, I think one or two of them I've seen in something somewhere in trade. It's basically rocked! Fortunately I saw a copy from one of the actors of the stars.
