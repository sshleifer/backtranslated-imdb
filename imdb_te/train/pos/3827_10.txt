I have no idea talking about the other reviewer- this amazing picture, and time travels has created a sense of era. The characters are really in youth, a strong match for Mary Byron, Claire Childhood and a Todd Hurt, Polydoris is a beaten-down artisan ... pretty, interesting, and decline ... they're not scary barricades in gothic. <br /> <br /> The Gothic shock is an independent piece of the film, and I loved it for a variety of reasons, but it is a trademark and ivory film, and it should have felt the best compilation from my readings as summer. Romantic, yes, but in the lives of Shelley and Byrne I am thinking of the film every time. One of my favorite of all time.
