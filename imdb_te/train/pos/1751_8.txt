A 40-year-old man working on an electronic shop, about 40-year-old Old Virgin, Andy Steitzer, is not much of social life and is very embarrassing around women. Some of his colleagues at the store invite him to a night and they are Andy and are virgins, so they plan to help him lose his virginity. Andy finally comes up with a woman named Trish, who gives her phone number, and Andy finally dares to go with her and they really like everybody but Andy is still quite embarrassing, and comes up with enough courage to tell her actually before she really gets embarrassed His embarrassment may be trick, if this can be achieved Said to have. The 40 Year Old Virgin, a good direction, a good script, good comedies, a good cinematography and a good movie editing by the whole cast. Filmmakers and Steve Carell co-authored, he performs a very good comedy and his work is very good. I am surprised with this picture. It's sweet, funny, fun, fun, enjoyable, clever, good-natured and a good time. This film is just as good as this year's wedding crashers, and both films are both the best comedy I have seen for a while. The 40 Year Old Virgin, displays a lot of really talent and it is good use and it acts as a comedy and a romance and it is sweet and fun. One of the best surprises of the year and one.
