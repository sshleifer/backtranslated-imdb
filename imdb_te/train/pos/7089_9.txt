Without a doubt, 12 monkeys are one of the best films of science fiction and director Terry Gilliam is not a stranger at pulling off such a movie reality. You never let up 12 monkeys with an apocalyptic image, which you have a thorough cleansing and you have to guess all the way across. <br /> <br /> The spectacular use of Philadelphia Logos and the Netherlands Sets gripped the Gothic concept of the tragedy and twice in the wrong places. <br /> <br /> Bruce Willis escapes his macho movie and all happens. He is actually sane, but people in the future (or if you are) distort the head of this person bad by the time travel, he does not wonder to unfold. As he was aware, he was sent to the First World War, when he sent the wrong Bang Bang to learn how the army of twelve monkeys would destroy the destruction of civilization. Finally, it's all right and really a wonderful screenplay for the performance, we want to see Willis, Madeleine Stowe and Cross-Reference referred to in a 6-year-old Brad Pitt. <br /> <br /> The risk-taking collapse is as sensitive and solid as it is, slowly starting to recognize that Willis is not broken as he appears. The attractive element of the relationship between her and Willis is "everyone" in front of another or time. <br /> <br /> The 12 monkeys are particularly immersed in time and insane futures and are known to be mad at the present time, killers and psychic intellectual world. <br /> <br /> Philadelphia's breeding city is a gothic backdrop for Willis's plight to protect the world against a dark and all-mission Hollywood stereotypes, not to save the world. He is collecting information. The movie also plays tricks on the viewer, putting Willy in a new setting at the drop of a pin. It is very painful, but Gilliam appears to be in hard-boiled filmmaking. He also drops memories of some great works like Time Bands, and Brazil, in some humor. The screen of this man's canvas and he knows how to paint its possible future in the main environment of the sometimes terrifying film and big budget films of the world. If you want honest mad and tragic tragedy, see 12 monkeys. <br /> <br />
