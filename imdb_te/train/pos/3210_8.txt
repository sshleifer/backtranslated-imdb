SOLDIER is not as bad as most people have done it. The film contains the sacred, cynical humor in Paul Verhoeen's Starship Troopers. Lack of conversation and top actions add comic-book environment. <br /> A unique trivia-bit stands for me - Todd has a number of space-fighter campaigns named Tattoo, one of his battles and one of these battles TANNHAUSER Gate. For lovely people out there, Rai Batty's gravity in the Tannhauser Gate Blade Runner mentioned late lines. And as anticipated to assume that the Andrelli forces like Roy have fought with Todd, it is the conscience to say the least. <br /> <br /> Written author David Peoples is a favorite.
