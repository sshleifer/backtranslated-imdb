OK - I agree. I think Kenny Dotty looks amazing in this movie -. But beyond his good looks, the film is performed with a sometimes imaginable, but reasonable plot <br /> <br /> We're introducing three main female females. One Headmistress - She was very concerned about her image and did not marry. A police officer - to go about the child and a bad former. Third -. <br /> They are almost "First Wife Club", and indeed some of the former's well-sounding bashing of the "he left the credit card" behavior with a desire of identity and a former of three. Set the characters - the image continues /> The role of McDowells <br /> <br, headmistress, a funeral coming late -. A young organist is a simple player (Dotti) where she holds her eye. What about her two friends about the upcoming riots? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A teaser or two recommended Lifting up eventually, but maybe not what you'd expect. It is seen in all great films that stand between action, special effects and current alternatives of Scakal Horror.
