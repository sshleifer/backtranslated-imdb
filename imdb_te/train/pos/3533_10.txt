Not yet available on DVD, but the value continues on TCM or VHS. A secretary takes the risk of being a murderer of his employer and takes on the most dangerous roles in an attempt to establish truth. A picture with many turns and dark alleys, nothing I say! The jazz band that wants information about our heroine killer is one of the most romantic scenes in Hollywood history, despite a very low budget and black and white during World War II. Despite the low budget - Long Island looks somewhat in the mountains - this is the original style and outstanding picture. Ella Raina appeared as a great performer by Howard Hawkes, and many of these things know, JoJohn Druy, Heppern, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Bacal, Ann Sheridan - their era. One of the many German, Hungarian and Czech film makers such as Sirk, Wilder, Ginzman, Lubitchc, Kurtz, Long, moved to Robert Siogamac - Hollywood, and brought the most fresh look. Sadly Ella Raines has never been a great part of it again, and eventually poorly produced in the Western.
