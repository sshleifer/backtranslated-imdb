I'm fortunate to get a free pass for Scoop's early screening last night. The whole house at the theater and the sudden ending of the film ends. I had two youngsters sitting next to me, but I did not speak to those who did not like the 'scoop'. <br /> <br /> 'Scoop' is a rapid murder mystery. A young female journalist attempts to loose a serial killer by means of the forces beyond the control of the student. Hip ginks are plenty with her traveling alumni and fall in love with a fairy and graceful young nobleman. <br /> <br /> 'Scoop' Woody Allen is not bad for filmmaking. It's not his best work but it's a very fun and light hearted. I'd say that it would be much better enough to be exactly the average Woody Allen film in the middle of the pack. If you're a Woody Allen fan, you'll find yourself happy. If you are different from his work, then the 'scoop' will be more interesting to you. I do not think filmmaking and acting are going to change the mind of those who do not like their style. Woody plays a similar nerve role, but we have been accustomed to, even if we are bound to the film and bound to the frontier. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen Families know what they expect. <br /> <br /> In my opinion I do not have enough good performances amazing enough and the camera almost enough Ian McShane. Hugh Jackman is a great looking great guy and I have found a new regular star to work with Woody Allen Scarlett Johansson. I 'm with the point point' this is their second pair and she 's just magic with Woody' s given thing. A beautiful relationship may begin! I have seen the movie and will definitely recommend it. Even more advanced comedy comedy than the 'Scary Movie 4' is more than just your brand, and 'Scoop' is probably not yours. On the other hand, if you look like a touch of class, sophistication and fun, 'scoop' is for you. Maybe I will introduce Woody Allen's film, but others should try it out.
