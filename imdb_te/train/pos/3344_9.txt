I have gone to see a fever pitch with my Mom, and we can say that we both love it. It's not a simple romantic comedy that calls someone else, and a blah blah ... you're not expecting the weather to be the first kiss or the end. Because it is true, because you have seen through them, the whole image will be about to get them. People are actually involved with the movie because of the actual conditions, or the impossible conditions. It's really funny, and I think Jimmy Fallon's best acting. All in all ... I would definitely recommend it!
