My kids have just been that night to stop that night and that's really my interest. I had to bowl for the bowling league, so I recorded them to record them in the DVR so that I could see them later. Well I have been watching and should be soaked after crying the buckets before my shirt. This is a fantastic picture, although I have almost experienced the pain and anguish that these girls are experiencing. And I never wondered why Alicia went from this beautiful girl to a social anti-ghost over a million years. Perhaps this is why this was soaked in my shirt because I had the same pain I experienced in Alicia. I did not even find this movie, but I saw it. Very moving, very touching. Those who love a good drama or tear-jersey.
