How it feels when most people lose loved ones. Feelings of pain, sorrow and sorrow can not afford. However, sometimes it stimulates the emotions that they leave behind and emotional emotions. The film has been filmed in a tiny film Tulip, directed by award-winning Australian actress Rachel Griffs. <br /> <br /> 'Tulip' sinks beautifully made, touchy, and heartfelt. The heartfelt story of a man's travel in relation to his wife's loss through a relationship with a particular animal 'tulip'. The film's growing dawn starts with a chirping of birds and a vast landscape that displays rural harmony throughout the film. A soft music that recognizes the access of Ruth (Jean Bain). She wears a floral dress and apron with a sun hat on her head. She gently pulled her livestock and took her back and pulled her back. The decoration of the house is impressive and the attention to the details reflects the parallel rural community, which can be seen on the table (a vase of tulip can be seen). Will (Charles 'Bud' Tingwell) comes from her bucket of milk. They pour milk and coffee together, sign of mate and teamwork. One word is not mentioned but it is clear that their relationship is close and affectionate; <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, happiness is not permanent. Ruth's tragic sin is deeply influenced. Effective scenes of Will's loneliness and weakness in the end of the funeral day. As soon as he falls into despair and everything seems disappointing and lost his surroundings will be overlooked. At Will's moment of despair, Tulip turns into Ruth's sign, which has a real connection with his long-time wife. <br /> <br /> Tulip is learned by learning to deal with the absence of Ruth and overcome the heart's feelings of loneliness. <br /> Each of the characters, in particular, is a piece of Will realistically and firmly portrayed. Charles 'Bud' TingWel brings the character of life through personal investment. Recently his own wife (Audrey Tingwell) reflects effectively in his performance. Each sage of his shoulder and every angry on his forehead will make the character with the viewer stronger. Ruth's character was superbly performed by Jean Bain. Although Ruth does not say a word throughout the film, her sweet personality and love relationships with her are clear. Louise Ramsey and Katy Edwards have been delighted with the support of Margaret and Mary's characters. <br /> <br /> The story, loss and discovery story that Griffiths has come from since childhood was caught unusually in the story "Tulip". Beautifully portrayed and superbly cast, this film is definitely a misty eye, a success or a cup of milk.
