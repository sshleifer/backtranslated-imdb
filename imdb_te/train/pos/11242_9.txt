Anyone interested in pop music, and if you do not know the British music trends of late seventies, should be sure to look at the braking glass at least once. The phenomenon occurs on a young woman's quest to create her mark in the musical world, from the rugged and thunderous punk to pop culture in pop culture in the Western culture, the open sexism, the strict economic times, the social rebellion and the dominant futurism / New Romanticism. In the late seventies, the daily music and fashion styles in Britain are still being invented and recycled (since the 1980s there is nothing new). It's a wonderful time, and both breaking glasses tell a very personal story and study cultural landscape, and both are very well done.
