Misfits at a military school? Hmmmm, funny sounds, some are probably offensive. Do not forget the person, who you burn the characters, the Arab thief, sex crazy teen, smart mouth, pot smoker, and things, things. <br /> I saw this film and it's funny because comedy actually revolves around a group of misfit students at the Weinberg Military School, because Sgt Liceman quotes, "You'll be affected by your families , And communities and humiliations. <br /> <br /> Earlier performances by Ralph McChey were also seen from Barbara Bach before the Karate Kid and my Cousin Winnaeus Itram will appeal to teens and young men. <br /> <br /> The great soundtrack moves the movie.
