At the very beginning I was a fan of daisies pushing. <br /> <br /> Brian Fuller has the most fantastic feelings in the film. <br /> <br /> There is no belief in how much TV is required for creative and original performances like TV pushing diazes. This is a great relief to see a presentation, and you will see similarities, if you compare to some of the new shows like scrubs and the house, and when it moves. <br /> <br /> Every episode has a fantastic cast, fantastic script and joy, One of the most attractive shows on television, washing daisies.
