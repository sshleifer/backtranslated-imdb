White man + progression + industrialization = BAD. First countries + nature + animals = gOOD. Simple formula. In fact, in the past days the same campaign has been used to protect the status quo; Now it is used to attack. Nevertheless, I feel that the film has succeeded in overcoming hacked politicians, because it plays themes of freedom and original nature to appeal to everyone. How the West won the rubbishy revision of the cinema you lost, not somewhere. But in the Western Grounds, horses are free to enjoy the desire for free. (The film also has no horses in the United States, and there is also a predecessor to the white-borne). Anyway, I liked it. The quality of the animation - especially the early shot - is amazing.
