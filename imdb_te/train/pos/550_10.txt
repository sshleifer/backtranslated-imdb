It's a fantastic movie, about a western film Jimmy Stewart, to Klondike, for gold. On the way, he is frustrated by the local sheriff in Alaska (John McIntyre, who has done a tremendously bad performance), who heals for them. McIntyre threatens he'll be a dead man if he comes back by his town, unfortunately, the only way to return to the States. The main part of the story is Dawson's peaceful Klondike town drowned by new residents in the town of McIntyre. For example, a saloon (formerly an Hollywood predecessor) and a restaurant in town came out of the hong-out space with a businessman with Ruth Roman, Stewart and his two colleagues (JC Flippen and Walter Brennen starring Stewart's best friend). She also leads to McIntyre and his cuffs. In 1953, Jimmy Stewart and director Anthony Mann became one of the peaks of the Western generation, The Naked Spar. Far Country is just the tiniest bit less, and it has 99.9% of what made the film without, of course, feeling like a cheap copy. Like The Naked Spur, The Far Country features beautiful, on-site cinematography. The landscape is gorgeous. Stewart was one of his best performances (1954, equal to Rear Window's biggest success). He starts a selfish loneliness and finds out how it's at the end of that kind, and I think it's a clich√©. Stewart, it's so bad that he makes this character a very human. And supporting shows are glorious around the world. In addition to what I mentioned, the adorable French actress Kareena Kelv is very good. I should do the same with Walter Brennen. He seems to be good at playing good friends. He was the first to be the only person who could bring out any humanity to a stupid man, his relationship with Stewart was very much touched. The screenplay is well written, and the directing of Man is a sinless one. A masterpiece. 10/10.
