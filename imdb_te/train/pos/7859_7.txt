This is the original 1914 version of Story's Country Tees (featuring Mary Pickford), which probably would have a higher rate, since this kind of serious play and pity is very typical for younger people. By 1922, however, the film had already begun to show its age. And many pick picture (and DADDY LONGLEGS, SPARROS, my best girl and SUDS), TESS comes with a short tad - ") Now it's not a bad movie - it's not. <br /> <br /> Very long and complicated - There are so many movies in this era that a building is built on a hill next to a great old crank river. But he can not be removed, so he tries to get them out of the ground in order to get out of the ground, which ends up in a tragedy, and his daughter's fiancée is disturbed by those who have gone to the murderer's father's beloved, yet innocent. The Witness does not speak And the dead man was pregnant with his fiancé! So, at this time, we were waiting for her to hang a young man in jail, and she was pregnant with a pregnant woman who feared to say her pregnant father. <br /> <br /> There is a ton in the film , Crank's son is to fall in love with Mary, but let's look at this film. <br /> <br /> The film is better in some ways. This plot, though very complicated, is very interesting and cinematography is top notch. The final scene is pretty beautiful. However, there is so much public pity you can open with a knife openly. Mary SO good and SO sweet and so plucky, the viewer at times can all find a bit hard to take. It did great work in 1922 (she made the world's largest star), a very long time. <br /> <br /> While some scenes are not severely degraded, the film entertainment DVD is not of good quality - the age of the most shocking film. Also, a brief filmography with only extra included.
