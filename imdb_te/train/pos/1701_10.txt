It is a thought man's crazy image. If you expect Star Wars and do not enjoy British humor it would turn out to be a cult classic for my wife and I - the overwhelming general population from Martyrs like Carrie Grant and Jack Nicholson casting "Voice" <br /> It's not for everyone, but you Having a quick mind to watch humor is easy to relax and relax. You will enjoy this movie.
