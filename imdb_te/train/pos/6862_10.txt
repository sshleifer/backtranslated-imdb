When people asked me why I liked movies, I usually responded, "Did you see the art gallery sequence in de Palma's dressing film?" That scene alone, pretty much refers to everything I want to see in a movie. If I were a director, the type of thing I'd like to do. "Pure Cinema" is a way of describing the scene, and it's really exciting to see how D. Palma's full movie works in the same artistic frequency of the scene. It's a dream-like movie, brilliant like hell, and with more hobbies and intelligence than a dozen films. I think the film will always make a big debate an important topic: an image can be fully dependent on technology and still considered a artistic success? There is no message to talk about in this movie, acting is very good but is in the style of the style and the script is small on logic. De Palma's film makes a good case, when the style is properly executed, the length of a feature film can continue. Certainly, Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson, Nancy Allen and Keith Gordon have done the best performances, but it's all the way to the director's film fame. This is a sensational performance of the cinema medium. I enjoy the movie of Hitachak (I do not spoil any surprises), but de Palma is beyond the arc of the story and to portray his entire career as a very nice compilation. Not for heart rate!
