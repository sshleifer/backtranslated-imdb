The scene that goes to Mall to restore souls with the flag of Sally Field and Wopi Goldberg Sally is enough to enjoy this movie, but wait! Is still there! It's nice with TV, movie stars, and (and upward) and love panic in the daytime. Robert Downey Jr shows the light side of his genius, and Cathy Morrisy is amazing. The dialogue is witty, and physical humor is done with complete skill. It is a film that appeals to those who really enjoy the art of acting, directing and writing.
