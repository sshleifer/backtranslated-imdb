Adam Jones has an amazing sense of humor. I do not like anything about this film. Cross Eyed was beautifully portrayed. Adam develops the main characters, but only small letters, does a great job. <br /> <br /> Cross Eyed Each low budget image gives hope. You do not have to spend too much to create something worth looking at. Everybody has a favorite thing. If you have a terrible sister. If you ever choose a door in high school. If you've ever parked anywhere in the city. If you have any kind of funny feelings, you will like this movie. It will last a long time and it is the film that comes back to the film after Adam's big name. I look forward to future plans of Adam.
