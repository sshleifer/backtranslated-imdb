Wondering where to come when ideas come back for romance novels and other papers? According to 'Jake Speed', they rely on real people, and they will survive the adventures they write and publish. The film is a quality family entertainment, moderate violence, and garbage. The language itself is not a problem, and the jokes are funny at all levels. Without Michael's Myers' Over the Top Antiques, it is' Austin Powers' look in 'Indian Jones'. I highly recommend children in this range from 10 to 15.
