Well, in fact, women are overly sensitive and average, which is interestingly depicted from mother to prostitute, but not fake-artistically, extravagant, or overly resident. Apart from most of you I have seen only Lamanman et la Putin. Many good movies, I saw my view of development after a second view. All I know is that I have seen and has yet to delve into further exploits until I've bought the DVD. I have yet to figure out why this film is so enjoyable, but really, why do not I care? I'm sure and some amazing explanations. All right, so you may disagree, maybe it's a bit boring, I'm not an expert. The blonde reminds me of a lovely grushenka.
