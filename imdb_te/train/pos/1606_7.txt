"Adults targeted movie" is rare nowadays, but the Moon Struck works well and is better than average cinema, well aged. Although the comic moments are less than its rest, the film has tremendous specialty (the Italians in Brooklyn) who are not used to cut characters or viewers. (Ie, the masks do not appear in aslipping, which makes my Big Fat Greek wedding a novelty), the second stories allow financially the short sequences that allow a break from the main thread. They do not attract their immediate value over scenes, producers and older ones that are not present in contemporary movies. I miss these scenes. It will also be pretty old characters. The film takes its own short, quiet path. Some Executive Stylinter does not have a poorly written scene to relax. <br /> <br /> Moon Struck is an old school, race, workday than New York.
