I will give 10 to 10 of this film as my uncle is once a crime screen writer. Rodolofo Sango wrote screenplays for 50 years in Italy. He was a great storyteller and suggested that someone write his stories. So Rhodolpho Son√©go did. If you check his biography, the number of films made in Italy can be seen. Alberto Sordi is the lead actor in his stories. My uncle visited Australia and my town, checking the locations of "A Girl in Australia" in 1968, and after World War II Proxy created a great film about the bride. In his movies all his humor can be seen. I recently found a copy of this DVD on DVD. GREAT
