This film is a great idea. A mix of Shakespeare, pop, jazz and fairy tales. This film is an imaginative twist on Cinderella's theme. Certainly casting a strong cast led by Kathleen Turner, this film is going for everything. The product values ​​but everything. I almost never think an image requires special effects or big budgets, but over the top product like this, it comes with the same seedy quality of each other made for TV movie. <br /> <br /> The film is almost perfect along with better cinematography. <br /> <br />
