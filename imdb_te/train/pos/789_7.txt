Crush provides a combination of sarcasm that I found to be good in English in terms of drama, humor and heart. John MacKay is very famous for directing, writing about this for the forty-four friends in a small town in England. Three professional women down the fortunes of men set up a nightly collection of ladies nightmare with gin, endless chatter of erroneous behavior of their dates or fags and sweets that are included with their libido needs. Andy McDowell is once again weary of British surroundings (I see her more), the prestigious school's head mistress is associated with a young man. The small town gossip and denying jealousy friends (the great support cast) conflicts with her relationship. Showing a lot of difficulties for us when a series of cruel misfortunes and a real pleasure pursuit. Keep in mind that friendships and conclusions in the main premise of this film will certainly show us. This is a type of movie you like or hate, which I believe in a lot of mix reviews and did not achieve great success when the film was released. I'm absolutely sure that I'm undoubtedly. I have enjoyed this movie too and highly recommend for films such as "Love Asclepi", and "Three Weddings and Funerals". The soundtrack does not explicitly mention that capturing those crucial moments is unusual.
