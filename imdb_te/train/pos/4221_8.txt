I liked the episode but I wanted to give a tip to the trainer to be the next partner of the secretary. I like when the episode of Colombo was an unexpected twist, and its resolution should be part of the killer murderer along the end of the episode. <br /> <br /> Peter Faulk and Ruth Gordon are great. At one point, some commented that Gordon was an eminent writer who was excited by the famous Lieutenant Columbo, making a tongue-in-cheek full of detective's real life reputation. This is one of the best Colombo installments.
