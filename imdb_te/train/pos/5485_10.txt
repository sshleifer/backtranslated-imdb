One of the most timely and immersive documentaries, you'll ever see. The story takes place in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, which provides a closer look for the expanded political dynamism across the western dynamism. Another chapter in the "U.S.-backed, Latin American Rebellion" story, what happens when the film wears weapons in real time with chronicles, poor people, unity, political awareness and courage! <br /> <br /> Political ideas presented by this film are valuable. Massive fraud and campaign are a clear media outlet of a private media. We see the poor people in Karachi with the brutal realities in "American politics." Suddenly, if people fail to resolve the sudden violence, they are suddenly fallen on their own by the plotters, and there comes a clearer understanding of the coming misconception. We have also seen the pride and fascism of the CIA supporter, private media, plutocracy and generals conspired to bring Venezuela back under Washington's domination. Despite President Hugo Chavez's leadership, the Caracas people were detained without him, after Chavez was forced to kidnap rebels' generals. Their response is the focal point of the film. If the government of the US government, Hugo Chavez, and Revolutionary Venezuela want to do a fantastic picture, this is the movie!
