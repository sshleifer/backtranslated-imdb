This is one of the funniest and informative shows I have ever seen. Nobody can see anyone at this age. This program laughs out loudly from me and my 2 boys. I do not know if everything in the program is true but Mr Wuhl presented little doubt that he was not very knowledgeable but he also had an explosion presenting this information to the most lucky college children who attended. If Mr. Wuhl decides to make this format anytime, let's rent the size of Georgia Dome to capture all who want to see them. I agree with this idea of ​​making an HBO series. It has a fantastic adaptation
