In this phase of the series, Edmund Blackdard is stuck in Britain during the Regency time (in the later part of George III's rule). At this time, Blackdard's chances are very low - instead of Royalty, he is a very thick, servant of George IV (Price Regent). Apart from the historical accounts of George IV, this is bright as a tomato, and as a result, Blair is able to take advantage of his and his heart's content. The only major difference in style between this and earlier is that the array ends in a very different note - you have to look to believe it. Notwithstanding, all the common story elements are present and the show is hilarious. The only reservation I have (as always) this program is not suitable for children due to its crude language and adult conditions.
