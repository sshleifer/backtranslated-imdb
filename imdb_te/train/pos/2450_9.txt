I'm looking at this show since I was 14 years old and I've been here since then. I love this show because it is plain funny! It shows something new and funniest every day and Benny always shows my favorite part of his fat giant head when he has his last comments in George after each punchline, because you enjoy this show too. * Laughs * I laugh and I want to see it as my friends at home We'd be a funny movie but looking small. Love George Lopez. Funny, talented, funny, wonderful. An enjoyable all this is a cool-funny-family comedy series and you'll definitely enjoy - I did! And if you still do not see me, I'm starting to see you do not stop watching. Even though there are no new brand episodes, I'm still going back. Still funny. Never wear. <br /> <br />
