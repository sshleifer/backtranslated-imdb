Bugs Bunny's rabbit-breeding is one of the inaccurate short films, the famous shopkeeper * working in a department story display case, owner Guilderlove steals him. As bugs clearly know the store better than Gildersleeve (and when cross-dress knows), however, it is almost impossible to prove. As always, they keep coming to all of the speed, so be surprised at how this cartoon is the first time when it starts! Among other things, "Hare Conditioned" is a good example of how Territe Terrace viewed the audience before improving the Looney Tunes 40s. <br /> Anyway, this is great. <br /> * Lepberries rabbits and rabbits.
