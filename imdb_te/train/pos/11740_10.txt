I do not doubt that critics have panned fartsys in this film, especially the arts that need a laxative. This is a great vehicle image in Abbot & Costello or recently Don Knots tradition. It does not shake the world or change the movies forever. It's fun what it's doing. This is the most important thing all but when it says. Look at this picture and forget your problems. It also has a simple & kind of ethical message at an extra fee. I always liked the TV program of Elvira TV when I lived in LA. She has never really stolen her steam from Vampira anymore than Vampira from Wampia's real Thada Bara. This sort of epic character makes it a good thing; & Cassandra Pietersen makes it better. Living in Elvira; We need more in these films. Never enough. The villain, William Morgan Sheppard, is also amazing. He exudes an excellent refined scamp. I could not find technical errors. Implementation is as close to flawless as the artistic form gets. Director, James Signner, and my appreciation of all of his team.
