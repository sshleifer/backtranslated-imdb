This presentation has come up to date. First of all in the cast of Ferr from Eric, they are all new actors and actresses, fresh faces, and see what they have achieved. They stayed on the show and it was a success. This is one of the best performances I have ever done and it's the ridiculous sitcom I've ever seen in my life. It will be sad to see the end but if they are out of this show, I hope the series goes out one of the big bangs that have never ended the end of the season. I do not care if the whole season sucks because they save all the fuel for the whole episode. Go down swinging, get one last punch. The show deserves it, the fans deserve it, if they go, let everyone end up like his friends, and be ultimately bigger. I've married Donna and Eric, and I'm fighting Hyde and Calozo and I want to be friends again, and I'm saying that it's interesting between Fess and Jackie because Fez has been trying for a long time, but it did not work for him. <br /> That 70th show is always the best in my eyes. Eric, Kelso, Donna, Jackie, Fazz, Hyde, I wish you had friends you. <br /> <br />
