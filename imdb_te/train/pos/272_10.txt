It's loved but still has nightmares over the hotel manager. The film was written well, with the selection of actors carrying their roles in the writing reality. Several scenes caught in the imagination and created a nail outlet. The progress of the situation is cleverly written, and I want to redirect the story to a path, only to find a new twist on what I think is obvious. There should be very bad statements. I saw a lot of friends for more concerts and I'll watch again. I enjoyed the scene of the film and thought it was attached to the plot and plot. Have talks with husband and wife (or do I say fights?) Were very real. The initial condition is a common but not fortunate story. I am grateful to all those involved in this great entertainment film. Thank you! Looking forward to the next films --- When?
