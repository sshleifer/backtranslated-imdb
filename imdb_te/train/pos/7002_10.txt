Smith also touches his shoulders and his murders right even more in a film about his rituals man with the weight of the world. Author Grant Nichoport and Italian director Gabrielle Mousino come together and I always recommend that you never buy a movie that you will never get tired or tired. He holds the most up-to-date material for Will Smith, he is only a wonderful actor, but he has a true love for people and life without any doubt that he has played the role of the film (IRS Agent Ben Thomas). You will find his pain and anger, Emily feel irritating over his love, who is Rosario Dawson, who is Fantastic by the way. I'm falling in love with their love. Woody Harrelson also starred in this top nach film. It's very hard to write this review without giving key plot points ... I can say, make sure that there is nothing to disturb you, pulling the phone from the hook, and trying to unravel the mystery of life and the IRS agent Ben Thomas ... for another great movie Thanks to Smith Will!
