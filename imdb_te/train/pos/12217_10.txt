I saw Ashura as the Fantasia Festival kickoff 2005. Man, it's a cool kick off. The director wanted to stay in Montreal for the Canadian premiere, but for health reasons, he is still in Japan ... Oh Lord I hope he makes me better and makes plenty of other movies. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty simple, but some original ... Devils in Edo in Edo in Japan and swordsmans called "Demon Warden" kill them and fear that the rebirth of Ashura is terrified, the sleeping demon goddess and the most kick-ass . /> <br /> It brings us to Izumo ... that the elite swordsman's "Demon Slayer" and his friend jack the usual violent jealous donkey ... <br /> <br /> Is boring? <br /> <br /> When Ismo was killed by a young boy in the "seal" he was taken to retire without killing demons, he never knew, but he killed her. So Ismo continued his life and recycled himself at the Kabuki Theater. In a boat of joy in a nice night, Izumo turns a girl in a bridge and changes his life and restart to kill the demons ... The reason for love, the cause of love ... and damn ... the guy knows how to handle the knife and drag it to an entertaining massacre. <br /> When Emma goes to the movies as long as he goes ... he knows the whole package ... he knows how to fight (Hell he knows), he's witty, he's clever and he's grit. You never yell: "No IZUMO, It's a TRAP" Guy already knows he has that common sense. He's really perfect hero. <br /> <br /> If cinematography goes, the aesthetics are very interesting. For the most part, a picture that looks like manga. It creates special effects and nothing done Complete, this movie will look realistic at all costs ... It is pretty amazing. More than "colorful" photography than the color palette ... it's pretty straightforward ... But as I mentioned, the main character is a movie-bearing,
