I have seen this movie many times and I can not see it every time, I can not help but get fun. Gang Din is one of the classic films made in Hollywood's Golden Years when prominent actors are promoting a spectacular special effects for filmmaking and inspiration as a film without making "monster" to make a monster on a man. Carey Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. performed onscreen charissa and Camden's subbab and are very entertaining. The three actors use the tongue and cheek attitude that their roles play, and it works flawlessly. Some people may think this is "applause", but I think it's a "classic" film and it looks good. Europe took part in the war with Germany and audiences to escape from the horrors of warfare and take them to a place where it is fun and fun for people's life and will always do good deeds and conquer the evil. Ganga Dean achieved this entirely by laughing at their performance while laughing to the audience. In short, it does not take a classic image too seriously and does not like the audience.
