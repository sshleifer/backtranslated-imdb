The continuity of the popular Cinderella story reminded me of what they did to beauty and the beast films. <br /> <br /> The mice are adorable (I love Gus! He is so beautiful!), and Lucifer miracle (as always). I like some of the new characters (the Pom Pom is adorable and I'm like the Prudence.). Still, the storyline is somewhat limited, but still pretty. So, I vote 7/10.
