Audience is generally seen in a white, educated, and urban civilization theater. The presentation I attended was sprinkled by African-Americans, and it was a spectacular social commentary on the state of racial relations in the country in the audience response between the two countries. Generally, white folks are fun or laugh at AFRAID at fun bits - and there are many! - Whites can not laugh at themselves because black people are also pretty silent. <br /> <br /> I, on the other hand, have a great time to see this satirical culture of rap culture and its friends / values ​​/ pseudo-philosophies in Asia (and therefore not any group). The cast makes the characters painted at a talented and great job. <br /> <br /> The film is one of the best fake documentaries, including "A Mighty Wind"
