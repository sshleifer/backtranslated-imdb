The biggest surprise in the film is Daryl Hannah's performance. She is generally more like a street-smart, intelligent, world-tired character than the simplest of the original tempered characters play. She does not have a huge role, but as a tired lady who portrayed Louis Harlan, she watched alertness for her employer.
