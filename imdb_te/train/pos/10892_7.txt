What do you like about this movie? Every year you know that Christmas is going to take one or two years of table films and most of them are terrible. The film has definitely pulled out a new idea. A great young man who takes a family to consume him a real Christmas takes him very funny. If you can not have fun with it, it's good like money. This is a situation that has succeeded. A normal family gets six numbers and a great guy gets to experience Christmas as he dreamed. <br /> <br /> Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) is very difficult to deal with and is just a riot to look after his absurd demands for family. It's a fun and funny picture.
