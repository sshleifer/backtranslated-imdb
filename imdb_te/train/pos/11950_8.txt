I did not know anything about it and went into the film and really enjoyed it. It's reliable and loyal-what the characters say and are totally hideous, and it's a lot of people (which is probably not typical of Woody Allen's? I ignore my ignorance) but the whole audience is laughing very hard at the theater. It's not just jokes in the movie, but also in the whole movie. Acting reminded me of Seinfeld's performance, where he tries to laugh his own jokes - they are fluffy, but if you do not take the film seriously, you can really appreciate the heroes' humor, not the characters. If you are looking for a random image, and you like Woody Allen, I would definitely recommend it!
