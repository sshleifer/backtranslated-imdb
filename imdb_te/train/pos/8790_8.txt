Happy picture. I saw this movie at the 2002 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Grass Film Festival and laughed from the beginning to the end. Acting is subtle but very funny. I'm not sure about the "real world" effect, where we can not get it, but the film has been incorporated without the understanding of the show. Heather B sees her every scene, especially when she plays with her rarely co-star with her. Highly recommended. I would like to see the release of the future in this video / DVD.
