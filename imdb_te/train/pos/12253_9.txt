It was one of my favorite adaptations of the Austen novel long ago. Although it is not in the same section as the excellent "pride and prejudice", "Emma" is a lush and relatively trusted TV version of Austin's novel - especially its small length. The biggest change between the novel and the movies is good because Aston's performances at the end of the story have been removed by unnecessary snabibishanas, and the rest of the book has become more and more paradoxical to the Emma's character. I thought that the selected characters were well-chosen to play the role of characters. Kate Beckinsale completely disappears in '96 version of Gleneath Paltrow, runs a fine way between miscarriage and social snob. Samantha Morton's worthy beauties lose her role in the predecessors, in accordance with her attitude and role, replacing Harry with what we know in the book. Mr. Knightley's role is much better in my opinion; In this novel the intensity and gentleness of the hero's hero is in a very discarded, luxurious movie.
