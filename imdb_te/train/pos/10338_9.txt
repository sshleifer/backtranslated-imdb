Norman, do not you? In accordance with an African American family from a Jew (which takes all the third hand and salt grain), it is transitioning on stage and on the screen. Moreover, one of those films was originally filmed in the video, so prints from the theater are not great. However, Redd Foxx and others' performances are pretty good. <br /> <br /> I would like to tell you all about this movie PERIOD PIECE: It reflects the attitude of the 70s when you realize that you have your own son or daughter in your family. Because of that alone, it is pretty interesting - if not a small "Hollywood". Do not trust me Check the lines about curtains, etc. are very stereotypical. Not too deep. <br /> <br /> But this film really shines in some areas. Redd Fox has a split sequence while trying to find his wife fleeing with his brother (!) Eenenda in Pino souped. The phone conversation in the border is really memorable. <br /> <br /> But ... Wales Flowers and Madam are the best scenes in homosexuals and nightclubs in his gay / romantic gates. The best of my knowledge is the only time that the routine is filmed. And, it's a little clean and a very low version, I'm told. Still, it can not be vintage, and missed. People still stole lines from Wayland; The man is really great. Enjoy the movie!
