A famous conductor decides to go to a village where he lives to live a quiet life after a heart attack. <br /> He is in the local church choir in the Dutch church, which changes his life. <br /> I do not have any expectations when I see the film for the first time yesterday. I like watching foreign films that do not have English, and I've already seen a couple of Swedish movies in my life, but this is by far the best <br /> <br /> Where to start? In my opinion, this film is a jewelry, thanks to many things, one of which is unusual acting. Pay attention to Michael Nyqvist, is almost as shy and dedicated conductor Daniel Dar√©us is perfect. Beautiful Frida Halgren is enchanting with her pretty smile and her obsessive actress. <br /> <br /> The film tells a story about a story, a beautiful story, music, love, pain, memories, and death. He dedicated his life to music and tries to create a calm presence in the village where he was born, trying to establish peace with him in the past and spent his life. The poet Pollock shows us that Swedish is the best film producers. Look Sam is an image that makes me think about you, life and love, and even in some way, even tricked.
