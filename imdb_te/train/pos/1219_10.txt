The second care Bears movie is much better than its predecessor. It's a deep story, good character development, and tunes (especially the end of the song) are both impressive and warm-hearted. Certainly the film will be over the film but it's sure to come on, it's a care Bears movie. Friendship, love, and attention are a great film to show children in this film. Beware of Bears to be very adorable!
