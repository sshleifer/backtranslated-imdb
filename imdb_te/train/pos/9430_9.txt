I am a Canoning Club member and I tell you that the calmness and tranquility of experience is contemporary with redemption. When we place our boats in water, the banjois will be in the back of the conscious mind. The film is timeless, as it affects the technology of man's relationship with the philosophy and nature of the human space in nature. We see in bow fishing. The tent is made in the house. In "rural forests", "cracker" is also the urban man's grotesque and dominant sense. The fact that the banker has "bad teeth" from Atlanta (Ned Beatty) is intended to keep him at the same level in the bad wooded forest. Ultimately, life and death struggle over "the law" overcame the "civilized man's" testimony. This canoe trip ends up with the viewer very quickly, but oh is not enough.
