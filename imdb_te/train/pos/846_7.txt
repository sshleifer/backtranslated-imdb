Two years ago I saw the film "The Metador" and I loved everything about this film. Apparently, I was totally impressed by Pierce Brasson's fantastic character. Yesterday, I looked a bit deeper so I caught this film again on TV. Now, I can say that this film is not unique, but you thought you loved one man. <br /> <br /> Brosnan Julian Noble has been in my opinion, with a spectacular performance of a friend-hated hitman. In Mexico City, Dean Wright (Greg Kinnear) is upset. An Unfortunate Person: His son died in the accident, his job was not good and he was not sure that he could not continue his wife Bean (Hope Davies). br> <br /> <br /> I've always loved these pictures. The crime movie with a big touch of humor. Jokes about big smashes with big cinema or one of my favorite lines in the film: "After the navy's left town, on Sunday morning I look like the Bangkok Hooker." Brosnan reveals his charm at the time he drinks his affection generally. <br /> <br /> I'm also like Greg 's typical American face, because there are many people like Danny Wright because Kinnear is the most loser of the losers. <br /> <br /> I've always been Brosnan. He will smile and admire him at the same time. Great Brosnan is not an equally great movie.
