Cure is an amazing film ... so suspense and just REAL! I was lucky enough to catch a screening of 'Cure' at the New York premiere and it blew me away completely! I have also won an award from that particular festival, which is definitely worthy. The first thing to do is cinematography. Eric Giovann has done a fantastic job. The shooting style is amazing in the scene in the movie. The film needed a romantic scene, and Geoffrey had a point across, but the scene was tasteful. Giovon and Jafri make an incredible creative team and they should definitely work together with future projects. The story of Judy Meyer is very surreal, but simultaneously a heartfelt character, it seems to me what the main character is. I am a very critical critic but I want to say that Cure is one of my favorite films. If you do not see it yet, check it out!
