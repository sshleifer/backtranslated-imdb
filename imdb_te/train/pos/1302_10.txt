So they often can not get together because a band is back together for a concert. Not here. From the beginning of this concert is just a cutting illusion. These three musicians initially worked together and planned what was needed to confirm that it was not just a memory bash to satisfy one's Ego. It's obvious before they step on stage. Many of the viewers were not even born when these guys first performed. From the first song they grab the cream, 3 men, 3 instruments, the old magic of any fuss. Clapton, by his own entrance, said he wanted to lift himself up for this concert because we saw him better, as there were keyboards and synthesizers. Why the Ginger Baker demonstrates why many drummers are, as Gore's drumming mentor. Jack Bruce is great. They are really put together a piece of magic that stops time test for years to come. It's up to 10 km.
