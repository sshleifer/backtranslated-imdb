PERIOD is one of my favorite movies of all time. I can not think of another movie that combines very nice image features like this. Action, adventure, sci-fi, good versus bad and some romance (even without an innocent "peck" on the lamb between Paz and Sheeta). I love some of Manajakhi's other movies (I do not know about you, but I have to watch a movie to take a break from it). It's a flat out-of-the-face image that everyone likes, so be positive and buy it. American dubbing is only a sour note. Wonder-Geek I'm sad. But all is not lost, the original Japanese version has two disc sets and rocks! Who cares if you can not understand Japanese speaking? If you can read the second grade level, the original Japanese recording can be seen with English subtitles. You will not regret it.
