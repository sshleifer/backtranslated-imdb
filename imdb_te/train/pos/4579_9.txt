I think this movie is good. It's odd that this is now Olsen's twins 13 and the boyfriends and everything. I enjoyed them alot when they had little kids in the full house. However, casting is good and the film is somewhat funny. I've mixed some kind of switching places and their names. This is the kind of old version of the two.
