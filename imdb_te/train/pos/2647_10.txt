The film is commented at several levels. Listen to other comments bashing the image and it does not say that it's a story or w / e and it's about drugs. It has a very open surface about drugs; However, the rest of the movie (and I think it's made individually) is not really about it. This is really the conditioning of psychology and society. It shows the brother of the main character is watching online for those sick videos, the split second. Why? My comment makes it easy for us to be a mechanical to all people of all people to replace people. It is confusing and disappointing for people who are in a 1% smart class, as the community is in a macroscopic level of predictability and mathematical and logical. You must leave Heisenberg's uncertain principle (along with all other laws and uncertainty principles) to change your life and your plans, not just physics, but also to adjust the way. One of the best films I've seen. It can just go the way above your head; It's not for you who have trouble with those who have trouble struggling with life can not work as a mathematical issue for them. When you analyze a movie critically or read the first rehearsal while writing your critical review (by marketers and psychologists)
