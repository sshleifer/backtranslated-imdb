<br /> <br /> If you are interested in pirates, pirate movies, New Orleans / 19th Century American History, or Youle Brainer, see this movie and make your own mind about it. Do not remove through various poor reviews. My reaction is that it is fun, well played (for the most part), has some very witty conversation, and it does an excellent job of filming the attraction, appeal and the epic fascination of private Jean Lafitte. Not all events in the film are historically accurate. (You can show me any historic film that has been successful in the film), I think it is accurate in the role played by Laughiti in the history of New Orleans and the hate-out relationship between love-neo-Orleans "honorable" citizens and the city's favorite sons. Do not worry about what the film did not do, but look for what to do, i.e. for a study of New Orleans and America's most intriguing historical figures.
