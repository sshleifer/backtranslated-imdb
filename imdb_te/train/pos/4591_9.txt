It was disappointing to see where Jackie Chan was there. He uses an unstoppable hurricane with punches, kicks and spectacular stunts. To be fun, he is now in his fifty and some expect a decline. But with 'Rush Hour 3', he takes a back seat to Chris Tucker (for all people!), Then 'Kung Fu Panda', where he is in full voice, but his character has just any conversation. <br /> <br /> Let's say Jackie Chan has a massive description that he has seen better days. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Jackie Chan plays the role of Car-Kui, a policeman who preserves the witness before a major trial. <br /> <br /> The two are facing hunger strike from the discouraged witnesses. He faces many hitmen in a group of two silence. <br /> But who is the other side? We can not see Jackie Chan's images for the story. <br /> <br /> Watch Jackie Chan's eye-popping maneuvers to show and hitting and abandoning less than the one he is. <br /> At that level, the 'Police Story' is all disappointing. Eventually there is a wonderful showdown in the shopping mall, crossing a large, high voltage chandelier in Jackie. <br /> If this carriage is more difficult, men do not always need cocks to go shopping for men. <br /> <br /> There is also a comedy, most of which is Cure-Kui accidentally May (Maggie Cheung), his everlasting suffering and a clear and unforgiving friend. Overall the humor is pretty unsubtle, but it works so I do not complain. <br /> Acting is not very subtle. In fact, I do not know anything about the 'Police Story'. Director Jackie Chan (yes, he is also doing) clearly has a deep understanding of why our films are to be seen and when we look forward to the next fight, the last thing we want is nuance and depth and inner meaning. <br /> <br /> 'Police Story' is a blast. For most of his movies, Jackie is actually what you see on the screen, it keeps the head and shoulders above the competition. I mean, when Jackie Chan really hung from a bus fast by an umbrella, the whole new "Wow!" Factor added to action.
