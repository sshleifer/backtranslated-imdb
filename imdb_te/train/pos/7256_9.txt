When I first appeared in the film, I saw that I was dying, and I thought this film gave a good soldier's perspective. The storyline moves with a nice pace, showing the group of men behind the enemy lines and trying to get back into their own ways with the enemy prisoner. <br /> <br /> David Hemmings is a very good actor, Alan Dobby (German Helmut), and I am amazed to find this movie on VHS or DVD and it's a forgotten film, it's very sad, It is superior to war films.
