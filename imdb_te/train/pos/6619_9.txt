<br /> <br /> The City of Lost Children (Extended Senses, or used and abused, and much more, well, just give us less than we dream of), and <br /> <br /> Dark City: <br /> These really need to be added. <br /> <br /> For a while, I look forward to an animated film that can affect me. <br /> <br /> "Daddy, do not leave, it's mostly love and right? <br /> <br /> Most sci-fi and noir themes in the film are completely drowned, it's just amazing to watch. <br /> <br /> These people have done an amazing job!
