In the early part of Gert Garbo's American film, it is similar to how our lives will be wiped out by destiny and through our actions, making us part of our way, as in the way. <br /> <br /> Greta plays Leonara, the role of Richardo cartage Don Rafael, a poor farmer girl who is in love with an estate owner. Riccardo is in love with her, but her dominant mother is very easily influenced. Leonara suffers from homeless and passes to Paris, where she became a famous opera singer, becoming a loose woman. <br /> <br /> She visits her family and eventually returns home with Rafael. Surprisingly, nobody knows she is La Bruno, and Garbo really pretends to play her role and she has such confusion in later films. <br /> <br /> Ricardo Cortez recounts a lot in this part of Valentino, and he made Valentino clone by MGM, although he never actually realized he was right. He is believable as a unsympathetic part of a weaker mama boy, and the film realistically realistically but comically he allows. <br /> <br /> When she returns home she fails to win Leonara, and when she comes after her, her courage is suppressed. <br /> <br /> This film looks awesome storm sequences. Old Timers Lusain Littlefield, Tully Marshall, and Mac Swine also have some good secondary shows. <br /> <br /> Although this is the story of lost love and invisible possibilities, Leonara and Rafael are happy together, that he needs a more traditional wife and she is a very career lady, and I do not think she was happy in a small village. <br /> <br /> Enter the American film industry entry of Gabbou and look at the precursor of the upcoming items
