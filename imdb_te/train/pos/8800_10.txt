First of all, I do not understand why some people have found this movie as an anti-American. There are moments when the US has been directly accused of similar sections like Yusuf Chahain, Ken Loach and some other Mira Nair. But come, they are not innocent allegations; Instead, they are based on real and documentary facts and all documents released about the CIA about Chile, for example. <br /> <br /> But I'm very fond of returning to the film. Different moods we found. We educate the children for the honor of all the people who died in this program. We find a happy couple who have changed with the tragedy of that day; We recognize the common people who have their feelings in the shadow of events of September 11, and treat it with respect, dignity, or frustration; <br /> These scenes and others - all the more powerful or the more - make a consistent mixture and help. There is a glimpse of how the audience react to the events of September 11 about different people around the world. So, the white whites we see are more complicated than whites and blacks, and this makes some people angry; <br /> <br /> Previously, presidents or priests told us that this is the world we live in, and there is no place for man's theories. <br /> Finally, the release date for this film in the United States is also included. Many Americans are asking why this disaster happened, because it's a shame, and the film can give them some evidence. The film is very clear - what some people in this forum think - today we all confirm our future and the past times will affect how we live today.
