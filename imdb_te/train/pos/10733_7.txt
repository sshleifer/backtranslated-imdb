Seeing this movie again brought back great childhood memories. I'm now 34 years old, I have not seen it since 12-14 years. I almost forgot about this film, but recently I saw again, some scenes literally brought my eyes to my eyes! The little robot "jinx" (forever friends). It was my childhood reunion. This is a wonderful experience for me. I will always save this film for this film. I would expect some of you to think about the experience of my readers, not for this particular movie, but for a long time you will not expect any movie you have not seen. <br /> Thanks for reading
