There is something impressive and nostalgic about me very little budget science fiction. That's all a 50s that's all a kid. In 1957, I saw "The First Man Into Space" at a movie theater with my father. It stars Marshall Thompson and has some other poor slab title role. It's about a space mission of evil where the astronaut turns into a gray killer. I'm very good & very right scared. The memory of Heyby-Jebis still lives in me. The Incredible Melting Man is made almost back in full glareier color ... well lit in the scenes. Just gotta love it for what it does ...... little darker lit scenes one hour, noisy sounds, and that strange music. Bravo!
