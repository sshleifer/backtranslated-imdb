Being a person who does not like boxing movies in general, they only focus on boxing and the characters are not really, this film really moved me. I loved the main character Diana (Michelle Rodriguez) was able to go through so many things for such a short time, it was wonderful for me. Michelle (Rodr√≠guez) did an amazing job with Diana, which was her first acting experience, which she performed a real emotion, and Diana was a brilliant actress. All actors have a chemistry on the screen, and the film is even more awesome. I also recommend this film to those who have not seen boxing films. 10/10
