Made by a community as a monster, and after reading the play about a man with a supernatural gift, I went into this film. Enough to say that I was expecting something completely different from what I got. But it is a joyous surprise. My friend and I are both very romantic (the fact that the male leader did not necessarily help), and enough plot development, action and humor (until it is part of the film until the 3rd of the movie is still laughing Movietier is laughing) to entertain and invest in the story. So briefly: I'm not expecting it, but very good surprise indeed. I'll definitely buy this movie when it comes on DVD.
