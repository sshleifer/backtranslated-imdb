The horse is actually a good animal. The lovely depictions of wild horses and their grace were more serious in the animated film. <br /> The animation is just gorgeous. Fine animation forms the spine of the beauty that the horses wearing in this dance. Also, the malabari interferes with different terrains, jumps over the peaks and brave waters. <br /> Soundtrack is very good. Fantastic instrumental music will help you to appreciate the film. <br /> <br /> "The story of the west is written from a horse hare," they said. Huh? <br /> <br /> All in all, this film is clearly outstanding. I watched one of the best animation flicks. A lone night is a very good choice. Easy 9/10.
