I saw this in the 1970s - then I recently took part of episodes from our public library. <br /> <br /> Almost 30 years after the break, I have come to another end. Some of the headmasters interviewed by Trudl Jung (Hitler's Secretary), Karl Doynitz (Germany's Navy Leader) Anthony Eden (UK) were some of the principals interviewed, but their first hand accounts lived. Generals and Admirals, who are survivors of Saracens, Russian citizens, concentration camp survivors, are all recorded here. <br /> I can remember the Lord Mountbatten interview (killed in the 1970s). <br /> <br /> It is really gem and I believe that this series was made by Queen Elizabeth for this work <br /> <br /> Looking at these few episodes from the library makes me want to buy a set. <br /> <br /> This review was only found to be the only "10" wine fine bottle given, which is a little more time appreciated ...
