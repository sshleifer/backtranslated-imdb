New York never looked good! And no one else in this film. But if the script is a bit lightweight you like this movie or any of it's characters. The people you love are really in existence. Actors' appeal is what really put it (John Ritter, Colleen Camp and Dorothy Stratten at the end are particularly good). You'll be glad to go ahead, buy or buy this movie.
