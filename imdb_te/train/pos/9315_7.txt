Prominent lawyer Walter Piddson has taken a murder case to Pro Boone and acquits guilty and finds that his client (Kefee Brzele) is flawed, but the part of the faulty ring reaches the highest escalation in the city. He is involved in his own complicity and is prosecuted and slapped on the identity of the "unknown man" who leads the syndicate. <br /> <br /> Brzezie should preserve him by pointing to this second murder and the presence of another "unknown man" - himself. The urban grit is short, and although the rhetoric is long, anonymous person is less likely to be aware of the corruption in American municipal politics that emerged in postwar years, even though the mouth was less or less by style.
