For some people, the movie is much better than actual vampires. I found that the picture was very misogynistic. As a woman and a horror fan, I use the fact that women at risk are the mainstay of the genre. But they're just going to take a look at Sheryl Lee. In this movie, Natasha Wagner is more fully absorbed character, and a bad guy is a gas! Arly Jower (played by a sidekick vampire in the blade) is very different and worse. Jon Bon Jovi ... okay, yes, what a great actor, but he does ok. At least he can not begin to sing. You catch on cable cable. Encore is in action this month.
