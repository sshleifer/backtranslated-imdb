This is not a remake, but it's a completely different approach to the idea. It's not an epic like the original, it's more of a popcorn thriller. Visually, it's amazing. All else is ok. <br /> <br /> That's what I think the movie will look great, but I love everything Burton did. People need to reduce and stop acting like the end of this film's world b / c. It's not that remake, it's not. <br /> <br /> The end is cool. . I took the parallel universe.
