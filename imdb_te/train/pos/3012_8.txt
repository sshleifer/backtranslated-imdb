It's one of the movies you've never seen before - so you can see it "the first time". Van Dine's books are still enjoyable - but most are known by many as floristry. The film is thus far the best film adaptation of his work. William Powell William Powell - do not say anything. The plot is complex. This story moves all the way, because you need the last one. Enjoy.
