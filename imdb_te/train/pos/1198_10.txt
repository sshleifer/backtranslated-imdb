Like many critics I have seen for the first time (on TV, on the big screen), when I was young. My dad always considered the film a great honor and recommended it to me, I said he was not right, but since the first time, the film has stayed with me for 2 decades. Since then I have seen two or three times (just a few days ago I gave another watch) and did not lose anything. It's still great to see the movie and well worth it! The first of the first and best Western films to have realistic perspectives in life in the Old West finds the peak of Mann Peckinpai's ride, but it is rarely known that the last actress is a good film and has been half a dozen years ago. <br /> <br /> "I love this genre (I love this genre), I've seen Westerns 100. There is a lot of frustration and frustration in the matter, partly with the two men adherents, some have no other options, Pazed, coral aged and young Ian surrounding them, until the buffalo-killers lead to one of them </ P> <p> Anyone who has seen this movie can not forget the ending and end frames of this gemstone when a camera from Mister Taylor moves into a white buffalo on the skin (on a tree) and the echoes of the past, all the hates appear again. Taylor got his buffalo, but eventually the buffalo came to him. <br /> <br /> "<br> /> <br /> Director Bruce the truth Â£ is a wonderful writer. Moreover, from the directors directed by Anthony Mann, all shot correctly. Master craftsmanship! He has really made a couple of great movies and has succeeded in almost every imaginative genre, but in this fruitful career as a one, the last hunt still shines, if not his best. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </
