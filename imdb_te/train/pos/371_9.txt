When the film was up for the Academy Awards, no category won. For my life, I can not remember what it opposed, but one thing I can say: this is one of the best films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The fact that Steven Spielberg was directing the film did not convince me a bit. <br /> <br /> She is a black woman's efforts and difficulties when she grows girl from a girl. There are a lot of insinuations that are disturbing and horrific, but all of them need to see how much this woman is set up with. Also, we see other women who have put their hardships and walk them out of liberation. Vupi Goldberg has been the best performer in the film. Danny Glover needs to be nominated for his role in the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> The best part of the film is to be considered humanly, unlike some of the similarities, such as "beloved" recently. I encourage any race to see this film. 9/10
