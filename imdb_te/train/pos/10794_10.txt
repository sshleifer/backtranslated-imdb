I always enjoyed Chuck Norris. While acting is not amazing, fighting sequences are excellent. I also enjoyed seeing the performance along side by Jodson Mills. In my opinion, Norris brothers proved themselves to be a good entertainer and this was another good product! I hope you take the time to view this movie!
