As the title is in English and IMDb is the primary language of the show, English I would like to review the English version of Gundam Wing (2000) as provided on the bond release DVD set. <br /> <br /> "Do you really see this duet?" The Purists are committed to all Japan they want, but I recommend "English Track" from all the characters except Hero Yue, not Japanese (most of them Caucasians are non-Japanese non-Japanese) For, the cost of the characters <br /> <br /> Contrary to the characters, <br /> <br /> The pilot of the Wing Ground, Heero Yu, is a trained soldier who learns to crush his emotions but slowly learn the value of his humanity.Mark Hildreth's worst delivery is "bad Acting "that fits most of Heero's personality Iii Duo Maxwell of the furnace is always happy to increase the value of life and friends. He was probably the best starring role in the show, expertly played by Scott McNeil. <br /> <br /> Troy, the pilot of the Heavy Housewife, is the only lonely soul lost so far for the purpose, he may sound too small for his age but the duo's English voice is easily one of his irritating nasal Japanese. In the fight; Despite his inner desire to make connections with people around him, he knows how to be friendly and kill. <br /> <br /> Quattrer rebel winner Brad Swaille voices fear when he frightens the character of the character and the brining of his innocence, the first hand of war and death. A huge plus point Quater is no longer a girl (and yes he sounds like a female performer in the Japanese version) but the sound sounds like a normal 15-year-old man. <br /> <br /> Suddenly but decided by Ted Cole Wufei Chang seems a little over the top but is different from those of Hero and Troy's more custodians. <br /> <br /> Rela Darylian is the oldest in English, Lisa on Bailey. It initially did not adapt her youthful personality, but as her character was later matured in the story, she followed the voice claim and ending with character advancement very well. <br /> <br /> Zach Merquis is one of the more radically voiced voices compared to the Japanese version. Both voices brought different sides to the same character. His Japanese voice is proud, respect for authority and commands, keeping in line with its high status and attractive nature. <br /> <br /> Brian Drummond is more vulnerable to his English voice, a more violent and "snake-like" sound, emphasizing Jake's secrets about his hidden events and secret beliefs in his ideals. <br /> <br /> OZ members are a mixed bag really. Crushana Tree, voiced by David Cai, gave him more realistic and down-to-earth performance, compared with Japanese style that he spoke more than his bigger. Nevertheless, Lady Unnie did not contrast her split personality in Japanese version and Lukrunsia Naine just embellished. <br /> <br /> I would appreciate if they take the time to distribute different characters in different ways to reflect their ethnic backgrounds. The notes of Maganac Corp are generally uninteresting but may be more interesting if given by Middle East tones. <br /> <br /> The Romfeller Foundation also speaks well with some classy European voice that reflects the status of their elite. <br /> <br /> While performing well from side characters, the main cast was managed and its results were in the over-the-top and more realistic version of Gundam Wing's script. The original Japanese script is very believable, putting ideas and ideas on all ideas about politics, war and human nature. Sadly, it also contains the errors of the original Japanese script.
