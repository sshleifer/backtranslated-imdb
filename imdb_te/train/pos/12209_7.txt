I'm very impressed with this small, independent image. The story about a pair of social enthusiasts who met has become friends, and one lacks children with one support system, sometimes at times joyful, sometimes sad, but always provocative. Experimenting with camera angles, filters, and slow or fast motion techniques, most of the music underground bands have been used as a great influence. The performances (the film authors and directors played by Leeds) are the best I have seen in the past few years. If you feel like a square peg forced into a round slot, I really believe you'll appreciate "by hook or crook".
