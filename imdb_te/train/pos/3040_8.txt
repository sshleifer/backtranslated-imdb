At the beginning of the Pacific War, Gregory Peck's fantastic role from Douglas MacArthur from the Battle of Koryligadar in the Philippines largely leads to belief in the above three possibilities by eliminating it as a UN commander during the Korean War. The most controversial American general of the Second World War (and possibly at any time) MacArthur is a man of great contradictions. He tells soldiers that there are soldiers for peace, but he honestly in the war; He refuses any political goals, however, almost everything he is doing is intentionally used to raise himself as presidential candidate; He believes that the soldiers in his possession must follow his orders to the letter, but he will issue orders from the United States president. He shows great respect for other cultures (particularly in the Philippines and Japan) and is totally unrelated to his own country. All of these films are in full balance, and ultimately the viewer is left to make his own decisions, but MacArthur is his heartfelt and passionate country, especially the army. Peck's performance, as I mentioned, is amazing - and everyone Overhead (in fact he portrayed it !), With the exception of Ed Flanders. Her attitude to Harry Truman and MacArthur: (irritably referring to MacArthur as "his Majesty") was angry and disappointing that he did not fully respect his authority as president. Marjou Dussay was also worn by her husband (though Macherrh's wife Jean, whom she called "General", though their relationship was very happy)) The film was so happy that MacArthur learned more about early life. MacArthur has always chuckled in the reaction of McArthur ("he'll be a good president - I'm the best tactic ever" - MacArthur, for his military commanders during the war). 8/10
