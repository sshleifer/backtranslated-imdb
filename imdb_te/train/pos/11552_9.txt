Another image that does not really need much is not recommended. It's a classic comedy, very funny and entertaining, and it finally inspired the successful television series, which is very good (I personally enjoyed it). <br /> <br /> Jacques Lemone and Walter Mautau are fools hot as Felix Unger and Oscar Madison when some are being excluded from the TV show starring Tokyo Randall and Jack Clogman (or perhaps similarly). But in two instances what we did were four good actors, in real life they thought they liked their image, these characters played their own role. It's Neil Simon's ridiculous thing, that's where it really came from laughing. <br /> <br /> If you have never heard of ODD COUPLE, it's a nerve and fussy neat-fake (Lemmon) who was thrown out of his 12-year-old marriage by his longest wife and his manipulative and completely irresponsible Buddy (Mataou) in the Manhattan apartment He took a residence. These two chance roommates together within the same four walls make for some of the most funny predicaments.
