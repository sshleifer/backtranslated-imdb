I did not expect John Holmes to persuade Wall Kimmer, but I forgot that it was not an obscene myth. <br /> As previously mentioned, look for two disc sets and see the "Wad" documentary first; It gives you a lot of background in the story that is useful in complimenting the movie. <br /> <br /> Some people are happy about the LAPD crime scene included in the DVD. There have been several reasons included, one of which is the use of the Holmes murders by the prosecution for the first time in the United States. If you do not want to see it, it's easy to avoid; This is clearly marked as "LAPD Crime Scene Footage" in the menu!
