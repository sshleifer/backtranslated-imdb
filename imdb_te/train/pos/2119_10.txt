"The Car Shop a Corner" is one of the greatest films directed by Ernest Lubitchc. In addition to the work of James Stewart and Margaret Salvann, it is fraught with fantastic actors of top character actors such as Frank Morgan and Felix Bessescott. They are the type of characters that act as Hollywood playback actors. In fact, the film is also the kind of film that Hollywood is no longer doing. (The makers of "You've Got Mail" claim that their film is a remake, but it's just a lot of self praise). However, if you have a romantic comedy of 1940, the "shop around the corner" is not spectacular. Good with repeat views. Have fun!
