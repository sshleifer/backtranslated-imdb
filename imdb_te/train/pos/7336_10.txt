This is another fictional favorite from Ralph Bakshi; After watching it on YouTube. After the Ice Age was built in the distant past, it is a prehistoric sword and hypnosis exploration between good and evil. Nekron, Lord of the Realm of Ice and his mother Queen Juliana, has created their vision to conquer the world known. When the village of a Glacier's Lorn is destroyed, he (Larn) vows to take revenge on his people and promise to kill the Lord Lord. Meanwhile, Necron and Julianna's sub-human servants were Prince Tegra, daughter of firefight king Jerole's comrade; But she tries to escape and eventually meets Lauren, promising her to go back to Firekip; <br /> <br /> The film has made small box office offices (as did most of Ralph Bakshi films), but it became a cult classic, with the art, Ralph Bakshi and the famous fictional artist Frank Frauetta. Also, I heard Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas screening two men who made the Cannon comic book stories and the screenwriter James Garney of the Dinopian novels; Yet I never read Conan or Dinoppian. And painter Thomas Kinkade, as well as his paintings for music-boxes for illustrations for the Bradford Exchange Company, as well as paintings. <br /> <br /> Baker films such as The Lord of the Rings and American Pop are rotoscoped, but this film works better than ever before. <br /> <br /> Overall, I have an awesome contribution between the best animated fiction films, and both great minds of Ralph Bakshi and Frank Frazetta. Plenty of fantasy, sexual fantasy, and thrilling adventure.
