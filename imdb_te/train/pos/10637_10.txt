Harem Suarer was the best film I have seen in 2000. Bravo Fergon Ozzeptek. Hermann Sueer is a bold film that plays such unwelcome interracial love in Hollywood. All shapes, sizes, and women of color, image populate. Cut out from outside, women entertain each other by telling stories about conspiracy, competition and jealousy within their ranks.
