Bad Chuck De Nomollos has been sending threats to Bill and Ted's future as a continuation of the spectacular Bill and Ted's fantastic adventure, sending two evil robots, Bill and Ted to land to kill human Bill and Ted. <br /> <br /> In a great comedy pair, Winter and Reeves provide an entertaining sequel to the audience with delicious humor excel. Despite the first sharpness, the Bogus Journey still has great coachframes and dialogues from the prominent couple, bringing a humorous piece of reaction to the deepest person, without a delightful performance by Willie Saddler. <br /> <br /> There is a more dramatic picture of the film though it is filled with humor, with the bet being more intense and more dangerous. <br /> <br /> The film gives a great size and another lovely feature. The creators expanded the boundaries of the fantasy genre and realistic use, as hell and heaven are heavily symbolized and plotted. The fantasy genre will be back with the use of an incredible time traveling machine, although there may be some time shocking time and before the current events and conditions are kept, because the last couple of scenes. <br /> <br /> The first watch I hated this sequel, but the second time I enjoy the jokes and story is a real pleasure, and jokes and the plot is not as strong as its predecessors, the Bogus Journey has enough good intentions, jokes and a good-looking family image It has a very consistent plot to make.
