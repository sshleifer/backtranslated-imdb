Edith was good, a bouqu√© was born, married, had many wonderful relationships and she became a singer when she was in the Forties. Her daughter Edy had a debut, a fashion model and a lot of insurance. She never married and she came home to get back at some point in her thirties. She has some kind of nervous disorder.

When the cat urine is excreted behind the portrait of Ewit, "someone wants at least anyone"!
