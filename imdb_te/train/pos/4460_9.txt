Ah, a Kelley / Sinatra sailor-suit music. Well known, right? Yes, but this is not what you normally hear. The-a-way of the town. If you stick around, you can learn something. Well, maybe not. However, two sailors tell the story of Anchors Aweigh three sailors' vacation. Joe "Sea Wolf" and Clarence, the book type, begs Joe to get "Dame". Now, after they capture capers, they get a little Donald home. The temptress, the jesbell where they meet Susie. Something fun! Clarence falls in love with her. At least he thinks. Is he right? Or is he a moron? Or is he misinterpreting society? <br /> Get to know all. You will see trumpet fans. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Catherine Grayson, but try Miss Kate (1953).
