I'm a very big Jim Cherry fan. I laughed my ASS during Lear Lear and Ace Venture. I also liked his serious films, especially the Truman Show. This one is the cross between his very funny side, and his serious side. He is so much fun in the film, but there are very serious episodes and he can easily pull it out. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the cast, I'm happy with Jennifer Aniston's performance. I feel more than just a couple of nice tits and great ass. Morgan Freeman is very good. For Steven Carel, his limited scenes are very funny, especially in the Anchor Scene. <br /> <br /> Overall, I rated it a 9. Good acting, funny script and some very serious conditions are very good picture.
