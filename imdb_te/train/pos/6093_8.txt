I saw this movie at a sneak preview and all I could say was ... "What did I see ???? <br /> <br /> "Stiller and Black Play friends / neighbors." Stiller's vision, hard worker, black is a dreamer. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned, the plot is quite simple: all is odd, odd, in the direction of a strange rotation. Shot with somewhere in the top of the threshold shot.Dupupuse and acting are very odd.The odd in a sortable sort of way and the sound track is the odd thing in the movie from the whimsical "Envy" song, which keeps you looking back on the scene that you're going to hear a classic 80 song Suddenly it was in Japanese. <br /> This way, the real question is this ... is odd funny? I was cracking up at the film's unparalleled odds.After screening I heard people call it terribly unfunny and happy that it was free.And amazingly, I understand their point. If you do not have any hassles, you hate this movie. <br /> <br /> The film is intended to make a lot of money at the box office and become a DVD cult classic. If you can laugh in the movie with real jokes like a cable guy or a punch drunk love, I'm suggesting to see it. If you do not, run away from this movie. It will make you mad.
