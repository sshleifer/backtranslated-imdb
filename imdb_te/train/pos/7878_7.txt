As the story in my family goes, my father, Milton Raskin, played the piano for the Dorsey band. After joining the Sinatra band, my father spent hours with him. Then, at one time, it would be good for my father to sit on a small group (band) to Sinatra, and he said he would make his own attempt. At that point, Sinatra had enough credits under his belt! Darcy did not forgive my father, but the rest were in history. <br /> I have some pictures and records, as well as Berkeley University in California. <br /> <br /> I have seen more than every Sinatra film more than what I want to say, and his movies are never old. . .
