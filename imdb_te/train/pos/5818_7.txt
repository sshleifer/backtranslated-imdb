In fact, the movie is in the claymotion episode and the silly moments in Joe Pesci and the children's episode, and it is the worst in other MJ movies such as "The Wiz", "Captain Eao" and "Ghosts". But after nearly eleven years as a die hard Michael Jackson fan, (yes, half my life, you guys!), I can not complain too much about it. A journey to heaven for me to hear his wonderful music by watching this lovely man. But one film, it's not good, and my beloved Mike will be afraid of it will get me a very low grade if it's not one that's starring. But since there is no one but Mike is moonwalker, it is to get 10 to 7 from me.
