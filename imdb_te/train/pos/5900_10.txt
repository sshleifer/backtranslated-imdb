This lovely and whimsical film (I've seen it as soon as it was first released in the first 50s) has recently received such a poor response. In my opinion it is much underestimated - but maybe the American comedy more humor than the American appeal: Maybe in Europe we understand and appreciate its subtleties and conditions, because we are close to some real life! A special but memorable song "It's Good, the Best Night", which was issued separately on the HMV 78rpm record (10 inch plum label, i think!) In the fifties. If you get the chance, I wish those who say I try: you have a pleasurable surprise.
