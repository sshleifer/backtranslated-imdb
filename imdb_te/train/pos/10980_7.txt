I saw this movie a few weeks ago, which was hard on my head ever since. It unfortunately has two spellbitten characters in a regular documentary. To get the true story of Bealees, I had to use the DVD's bonus material and commentaries and search the web. <br /> <br /> Miles and their fans (not addressing Edith and Edis themselves) advise the film to be exploitative, which exploits the true sense of the term. Very little effort was explained by Bealez or how they came to be - the Miles Scheme seems to just wait for the camera, waiting to say something bad about Edith and Eddie. The sound, even the release of the Criterion is poor and is hard to follow. Although I appreciate the film opened somewhat in documentary film history, it is contrary to a very high level of Geraldo Rivera's (!) Over the sexual abuse of mentally retarded patients at Willowbrook State School in Staten Island since 1972. <br /> <br /> Four years Review review, Edith and Eddie in their lives There are many things that need to, which is not a documentary. <br /> For Edith and Edie, looking at the movie is the thing I kept thinking "Where is Hell their family"? They live in dangerous, unhealthy, insecure conditions. How Jackie, the richest men on earth (or the wealthy Bowie family themselves) married, can not get a good home with Etihad and Eddie? Or at least a part time to meet the house keeper or caregiver and watch over them? <br /> If this review is negative, I strongly recommend Gray Gardens to anybody who loves documentaries. One day someone would come up with a documentary about this documentary - the rich backstory of the Beals (and post-apocalyptic) and in the 1970s Hampton brought the entire subdivision of society.
