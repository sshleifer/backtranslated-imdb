The film recommends my friend to play a major role in my drama and dramatic similarities with the movie Des Houl. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine that this is good, and maybe a little more likely to be imaginable, and it is not quite sure whether it is in that admirable scene. <br /> <br /> This is not for the most beautiful work, content or style of filming or dialogue (whale music is just too much, well relaxed.), but they both refer to modern love stories. <br /> In general, I am a big fan of Canadian films about music and musicians (for example I would recommend the Hardcore logo) and most importantly this movie. It has an innocent charm, Des is not always the most beloved person, but something about him is a sterling sort of empathy.
