After playing a Namphomaniac in WINDROWENEN, Dorothy Maloon finally thanked his beloved sister / wife's characters and demonstrated their ability to play Montr√©ps best. She and Gloria Graham have played similar tramps - and Maloney has won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for making many efforts here. <br /> <br /> She has Oscar standards in this movie, but it is a strong enough play in Douglas Circus's powerful hands. The opening scene of the explosion has an almost noir look and it sets the tone on the rest of the Sudisy fireworks in a story entitled Rock Hudson, Lauren Balal, Robert Stock and Doroth Mallon. The residents of a wealthy family residing in an oil setting are the primary center of the Domestic Squabbles play, with strong supporters Stack and Malo. The two managed to take advantage of hands and stock, and the weaker, alcoholic brother would give his sterling job of desperation through his own jungle. <br /> <br /> Nominal stars are less Hudson and Baqual - performing impressive performance with their performance and confidence. They play their more sympathetic characters with quiet power and awareness. <br /> <br /> The color usage is especially hitting (which is usually in a cirque) and it does not exclude me from thinking of the movie <br /> <br /> It is good to see some interesting shows from the whole cast.
