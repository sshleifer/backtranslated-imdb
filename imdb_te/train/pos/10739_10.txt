Excellent documentary. The original airline and saw it in a few times on DVD in the past few years. I was surprised that it was not nominated for the best documentary Oscar award in 2002. <br /> <br /> It was on TV at the 5th anniversary, but at the end I missed the section "Where Are You Now", the Hajmat Unit. <br /> <br /> I have seen criticisms of making some documentary films from this list. I can not see any different work. This equation is less than 6 months and get in the air. The DVD has more material and background. <br /> According to IMDb.com, the brother has no plans in four years. What are they doing?
