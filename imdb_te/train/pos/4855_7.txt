<br /> <br /> The only thing that relies on the question of whether or not the movie version of "The Ghost Train" is the same thing: Your response to Arthur Aske's performance. <br /> He is almost in every scene, and is not always in good way. In some cases he may want to retain a little bit of the character's character and development (as they do to some extent), or to retreat. But somehow everything keeps showing Osiki's Tommy Gander role. <br /> <br /> I personally like this film and I like to have a favor of Oscie. I will always plonk into vcr at those odd hours of the morning and I can not sleep and really can not find the power to see anything. First there was something about watching old b / w movies in Don's silent darkness, I seemed attractive ...
