Steve McQueen wants to become an icon of the Queen and I'd imagine if he knew that this film had the same year of launching "Wanted: Alive Dead", or seven or two years later, that he would start it off. But he did, and we are richer for that. <br /> It's definitely a camp classic. Horror is the way it is for the drive-in theater. <br /> <br /> Lt. Dave: At least we have stopped. Steve Andrews: Yes, as long as the Arctic is cool. <br /> <br /> 52 years ago did not expect Arctic noise. Blob will soon be back.
