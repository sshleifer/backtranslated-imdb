I never saw a Barbara Stylie movie that I never liked and was always a sucker (especially "Hell House of the Legend" and "The Hunting" and "House on the Hundred") for a good haunted house story, so "Blood Castle" And the boy, it's always! This is the French-Italian composition, the first horror film of the stylist "Black Sunday" But the spook style has a lot of atmospheric and chilling adaptations, and it is actually a cinematic journalist named Lord Blackwood and Ergar Allen Poe who is concerned about the journalist's death, The souls are their own While repeating, it can be done to spend night in Blackwood's castle in the night of All Saints Day, the viewer gets to see these deaths, and they are pretty terrible.This film really delivers the backbone of the audience and thanks to the pencil at Synapse - A scene without a surprise and a Lesbiyanvadam has some soft! And Barbara is amazing in this film; Her other worldly beauty has gained a great benefit as a sympathetic spectator. She just turns into a creepy ghost story of something really memorable. Nothing is called her "The Queen of Horror".
