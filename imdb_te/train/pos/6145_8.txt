Mary Papins is definitely better, but it's a lovely movie. Angela Lansbury is a very valuable entryline price, and David Tomlinson is very pleased with Mr. Brown. Their chemistry is good. The kids are not shining the same, even though Paul is very funny and beautiful. Some of the most notable songs are not really bad, "Beautiful Brain Sea" is the best, in fact the songs are the best. Special effects are awesome, it's magical in plenty, and the story is real enough. Highlights such as Mary Papins are animated scenes. The underwater sequence is beautiful, but my favorite football match, it's totally fun. I have seen for the first time, I can not end it. All in all, rarely ever a lovely image. 8/10 Bethany Cox
