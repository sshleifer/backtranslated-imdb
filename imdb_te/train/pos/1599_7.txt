"Moon Struck" is a striking short film directed by an amazing storyteller by Norman Jason (The Heat of the Night, The Fidelberg on the Roof, The Hurricane). The picture is very high. It's a good slice of Italian culture, a touching romance and a lively comedy all the best. <br /> One thing I like about this film is the relativistic nature of the actors. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a fun movie, and easy to recommend. </ P> <p> 7,4 in 10
