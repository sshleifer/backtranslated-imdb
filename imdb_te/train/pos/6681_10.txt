The film is great, it's very fun, some wonderful jokes and vision goggles, some of the things we have for "geeks" (and we can know who), and the effects are effective. Across the winner of the Academy Award winner Paul Rubens is worth the price of the entrance alone looking at the fart. I did not read the comics series before seeing the movie, but from then on. They are good, I still recommend MM movie. (Although Fleming Carrot was also cool as a character) Greg Kinnear Captain Amazing, and any One Ills are William H. Can you be a shoveller than a masi? "We've got a blind date with Destiny and it looks like she ordered the crab." See this movie. Buy this movie! It's just 5 bucks at your local Wal-Mart and a bit of change. You say thank you. Really you. Oh, and Ms. Garafolo is it. That makes it worth-to-date
