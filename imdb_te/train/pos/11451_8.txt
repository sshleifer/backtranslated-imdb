The most memorable documentary about Scottish artist Andy Goldwaldi, whose work is characterized by more ephemeral sculptures made from elements of nature. His work is made of rocks, leaves, grass, ice, etc. so that when the beach or wind blows at the shore will fly away. Thus, most of the works of Golds Worthy are unlike photos or movies. Now, the works of Golds Worthy are a reflection of the deaths, or that the words are words, but it is not easy to say what he's doing is just beautiful art. They are mostly bitter and morbid when simultaneously about artists, often in the mood of unstable urban settings, opposite Golds Worthy: a stable, unmatched, family-oriented person in nature, a small village in Scotland (of course, Or the art world who found the surface I'm sure the same reasons why he shunned people).
