Such joyful world has created us in Pixar's A Bug's Life; We drown in a universe, which is recorded only with enjoyment in the film, but it is definitely the universe only registered through the animation world. For those who forgot to offer an enormous and exuberant world animation? Bugs Life is a warm reminder when it's in the right hand. We are going out of the movie with an equally warm feeling, and high-caliber film productions are producing. <br /> <br /> It is Pixar's second animated feature. Disney's sub-group was their first film to date with their movie Toy Story in 1995 three years before their film debut and totally unpredictable. It rejected the convention, re-invented and absorbed a new life in animation, defining a whole new level of excellence. <br /> Now that they come back to their honesty, it will bring us hateful feeling before we get to the picture. <br /> <br /> After all, it is a movie about ants. Well, the insects and bugs are covered in the world of all walks of life in A Bugs Life, but it is the centerpiece of the film because the human being is the center of plays, romance and so on. What kind of a rare species of animal, like an ant act as a movie hero, can only provide a complete campus of a movie? They will certainly escape. Nevertheless, in Toy Story, a group of toy-box items became animated heroes and villains a fictional, most exciting and romantic bunch. <br /> <br /> Guys at the pixels of the pixel can remove the same feat and you may encounter a group of dirty and miscular errors. Are they totally forgiving and loved? There is no unpleasant role in the view; Even the villains are riveting characters ?? But they are colorful, they are eclectic, and they are weird. And the range of characters is also big for a lack of a good word, adding only the distinctive layers that are already plastered in the bug's life from the beginning. We must begin with our main character, and our hero. His name is Flick (David Foley), and his character is the most common to say the least. Lush, the thousands of loyal and loyal rulers who live in the beautiful Aunt Island, is considered to be the 'black sheep' of his pedigree as he appears in the early motion of the film, accidentally destroying the season's harvest <br /> <br /> The ant harvest and lamb They are disappointed in their hearts. Small ants; They look to the Antill Island for their annual dinner and see their offering has gone, they go mad, in the absence of a good word. Hopper proposes a proposal to save the ants from the total extinction in his pack hands; However, this is simply impossible to fulfill. Flick's minds watches and watches are now fully evaporated despite his guilt and shame, and he will come to the colony's protectorate and leave Antill Island in search of some powerful bug warriors who can defeat Hopper and the grasshoppers. > If you think about it, a bugs life has some huge similarities to the heroes of Akira Kurosawa's Classic Seven Samurai or American Remake the Magnificent Seven, in which the weird but well-famed folk village is threatened by the evil and the wicked enemies ?? A large village resident goes in search for help in the big city, to find and return the colony to drive from evil. In A Bug's Life, this help flick comes in the form of a down and out circus crew that appears as a warrior in a bar-room confrontation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of them is an experimental stick worm (David Hyde Pierce), a side-splitting obese labeled German caterpillar hemilich and a sand-and-maiden ladybug (Dennis Hopper), a partial-Femme Fale Lady Lady. <br /> As I said, it is very fun and enjoyable. Their characters and happiest lines, one of the magically enthusiastic and inspired scenarios and overall a delightful image that gives way to a horde, which is a delightful interaction with one another. What bugs life is good, many children are more fun in the film, is not this film just enough for many to see it? Clich√© Kid-friendly conditions are a bit wider than what we like. <br /> <br /> A Bugs Life is still an amazing picture, even if it does not reach the dizzying and milestone standards set by its ancestors, and here's something to promising. The Pixar has proved that they are not just a hit wonder, but instead filmmakers in Hollywood are a great and talented group. They can endlessly raise the bar, and someone always maintains the top of their standards, it's only by themselves. There is still something to say about a bug life: see it; It's not the best we've seen them at Emeryville, California, but this beats out most of its year? <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
