This dazzling music is much more than the star of its star, the prince musical intellect. The movie is posing 90 or minutes but the truth is easy to see why it's a cult classic. <br /> <br /> Like other films that center around a struggling young musician trying to be too big, there is a drama's suggestion in which to add a dimension to these musical numbers. Although the film is not as good as 8 miles as a recent example, this is not the lowest and soundtrack is very good. The dramatic side of things is the story around Kid (Prince) centers around a young artist and general spot at a club. Kid knows that the owner of the club is bored with Kid's pride and he will soon be eliminated and the opponent can replace it. Kid's parents are in trouble, his father abuse his violent behavior. During the movie Kid finds some lessons in life, and finds his friends more appreciate. It's all the stuff we've seen in the course's age plays, but it's a musical, very stylized music. <br /> The cast is good. Prince Drama side is really very good when he is not hitting a pose. He seems human and relatable. Clarence Williams is very good as abusive father. Apollonia Cotore Princess plays a good role as Sexy Love Interest. <br /> <br /> The film's main strength is an excellent soundtrack. Musical numbers are well performed and electrified. Although Prince is very unusual, a musician. He is great when he's inspired, but he only makes songs for his own flavor on the flip side, and occasionally his experiments can be miss-fire, but it also fits many musical critics. While this film is good for soundtrack, just with a weak point of Sexshooter. Purple rain's show-stopping performance is a standout though. This is one of my favorite songs. <br /> <br />
