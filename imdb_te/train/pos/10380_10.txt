Like all of us here, I have not forgotten the remnants of these stories, and the fragile magic that I call pictures of this story, and I'll see it again someday. I'm checking. I would also wish anyone would make Shirley Wheel's film 'another side of Venus'. It is also some of the same delicious and persistent poignancy ...
