Claire Denis's first two brave and self-guarantees. In this description of life at the end of French colonial cameroon, she is looking for relationships between black and white, men and women. <br /> <br /> The blacksmith 'Protai' as the primary object of the image of desire and repression enters the prohibited territory from the beginning of the film. Denis built a biopic through a series of role relationships that keeps the information viewer on the screen. <br /> <br /> The mood of the film is camera-working and lack of light (absence). <br /> Great conversation.
