I've always loved this great baseball movie! It's a great cast including two wonderful actors and my favorite Danny Glover and Christopher Lloyd! Also in the film is Ben Johnson, Brenda Fricker, Big Tony Longgo, Tony Danza and Matthew Maconougay! Even Jay O. Sanders and Dermot Mulrini! The film has great special effects and acting from all actors acting! Baseball scenes are all realistic! Composer Randy Edelman's music is great and fits the film very well! Some actors who recall genuine baseball personalities. The remake of Stony Jackson's Ry Mitchell character Mi Reis Clayton recalled that McConnay's character was reminiscent of Steve Finley's memory, and in my opinion reflected how Joe Sanders's commentator Al Habraski looks. This is a fantastic movie for non fans and baseball fans and I strongly recommend this movie!
