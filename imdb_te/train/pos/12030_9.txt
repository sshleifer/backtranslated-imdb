hi, im scott (A.K.A woody7739) I love the movie Twisted Desire, I love watching Melissa Jon Heart on t.v she thinks it's fine. I was also a true fan of Sabrina Teenage Witch, so this helped me to watch my watch (do not ask it). I love the way the nicole pulls her trigger on the bottles and pulls the techniques on her parents, so she wont give her fingerprints (a very well thought-up idea), love her way too carfully think of murder, come back along with her old boyfriend and a secret camera under her shirt Puts it on all the nicole that she got caught. I gave the film to nine of the ten films and put them on my first 10 films list. Last or not, if anyone saw this film in stores, I can say it on TV and did not record it. By
