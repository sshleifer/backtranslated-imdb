Thanks again from the darkness. The 18 lights of the city in the lights are 18 directors that do not seem to be unrelated. An exceptional design that takes some sections to adjust as a viewer. We have become accustomed to the development of the character in a 2 hour film, which is a bit disappointing in an 8-minute episode. <br /> The intention is that 18 love / related stories are an amazing city with 18 different environments. In fact, some are better than others and some go for comedy, others are focused on dramatic emotion. Some famous directors, including Ken Brothers, Wes Craven, Alfonso Carrone, Alexander Payne, Gus Van Sant and Gundi Chad. Many familiar faces are also seen: Steve Bassemy, Barbet Schroeder, Catalina Sandino Moreno, Ben Gazzara, Zena Rowlands, Gerard Dapardu, Juliet Binohe, Willem Dafoe, Nick Nolte, Maggie Gyllenhall and Bob Hoskins. One of the best sections is Mimim, then another Mimi and attractive, and two Mummy happy young son. There are also red trench coat to play key roles, cancer, divorce, sexual fantasy, a child's death and many other things. Do not miss Alexander Pane (Director of "Sideways") Oscar Wilde. <br /> <br /> The diversity of these sections is interesting, but not as great as a movie. Pace is still a very good change and often a good change for the film walk.
