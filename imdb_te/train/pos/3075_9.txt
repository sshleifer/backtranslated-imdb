A wonderful picture about the family, guilt, sacrifice, betrayal, and love. Maki is such a great actor. It is almost an insult to see the same scenes with Campbell, who appears as a part of a sexually explicit object but does not have a script to have a script to work with. But he's a good actor, he played down to his level to work on the scenes. As a neglected wife, I highly appreciated Tracey Ulman's actors. Who knows? Sutherland is also good. The way he moves is his character's length (even in some scenes). <br /> <br /> The only condition that can not be taken care of is not less of a full skill in Mackay's role.
