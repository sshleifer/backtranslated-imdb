Other reviews of this film will really distance the stars and the movie on this date. I usually like to read user comments to give me an idea of ​​what I expect from a movie I do not know much about. Unfortunately, there are not many comments for a single tile, because when it's the same review and it's unclear about the film and the cast, you do not know anything about what you expect. I read the review before watching this title and I do not know when this movie and the stars come from all poison. Douglas and Blondell are very talented and attractive people. I was enjoying and enjoying the film and shows. It's not one of the great all-time chapters, but a fun and funny diversion-more than you would expect in most new movies. If you're a fan of these stars, you will not be disappointed.
