Since my first film came up, my family, Arthur Bach, made mistakes and stuttering. We have remembered so many lines. I watched two weeks ago and still played the role of Dudley Moore in general humor and view-at-life. Liza Min√©lie did an excellent job as a side kick - I'm not her biggest fan. The film will make me enjoy watching movies. My favorite scenery is when Arthur visits his fiance home. His conversation with Butler and Susan's father is spitting on the side. The line from Butler "Do you wait in the library?" The answer given by Arthur, "Yes I get out of the bathroom question", my new mail notification on my computer. "Arthur is really" funny stuff "!
