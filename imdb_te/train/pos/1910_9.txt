Ya. I mean. <br /> <br /> It is still a great show with John but I personally feel that it is a good way without it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When I was young, I was really laughing. (I do not think ...) because I love to see some new things. <br /> <br /> My favorite character must be Rory. Poor Rory is almost always outside. It's always about Bridget or Carrie. What about Rory ??? Honestly it's a great show and it's not seen by anyone who wants to go and see you. I promise I'm almost laughing. Well Chuckley.
