Fans of the new BSG original series would not have expected, but the new BSG's fans expected (most of) may not be capable of delivering. It is very interesting, somewhat self-participating program or at least pilot. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for bigger CGI thrillers of BSG (new), it is very disappointing. <br /> If you like the play, you may like it and maybe even find it. <br /> <br /> The protagonist examines how the cylans are developed, why Adam hates them and the roots of a monotheistic society. The writers also managed to play humans' play (s) and tackle creation or reconstruction of 'human' life. <br /> <br /> It's a little bit better in some areas, but I find that it is a lot of other people. The small part of me (or hopes) may have some small inches of BSG in there (except the story behind it), but it's a lot more turbulent. <br /> <br /> Like BSG, I have to wait and see if Capriia will rise to me, but it will be too soon to say. <br /> If you compare it to the previous series, but I'm ready to give you a chance. Overall, I was very curious to see how much I saw in the original series' massive towel.
