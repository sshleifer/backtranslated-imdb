The title of the film does not work much for you, until it is seen in the operation, as when he manages his imaginary trolley, it makes it a bad young man who works all day. <br /> <br /> He is one of the most odd roles in the rare tragedies of a group of slums in Japan. <br /> <br /> There are two drugs who trade wives, an architect, and his youngest son to send food for food. There is a brilliant old man who has all the ingenious foundation inside him going around him, and a businessman with some serious nervous tics to have a wife who treats him (and everyone) like dust. <br /> This is certainly a specific plot, really, it is a bunch of stories that sometimes sometimes funny, sometimes dull and drift back and forth between each other. All in all I thought was working pretty well, & I have been dying to see this for a long time based on its description. I am not disappointed at least, and I definitely recommend this. 9 out of 10
