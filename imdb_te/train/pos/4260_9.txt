Fatish Auckins first starred in "Im Julie", which is very good, he created a truly epic family epic. Unfortunately, a bad advance German film, we rarely produce more than normal movies;). But this film then makes some good snapshots. Italian immigrant "Solino" who arrived in the "Ruhr" area of ​​Germany over 60 years. The immigrant and his family started the first pizza restaurant in the area. The characters are excellent draw. Especially gigi, the main actor. You live in every second, every feeling he does. His brother, Moritz Blebritre, is not good. Well, you dont believe him character. But the character is well established and perfectly fits into this script. I needed an emergency to compare the style with "The Godfather" style. Many people hate this movie, tell its boring. Not too stressed? - Yes, but a deadly picture. 9 out of 10
