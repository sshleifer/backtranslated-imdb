This film is not about entertainment, nor is it the picture you want to see beyond time. This movie is a true show of true love, which can only come from God. Watching this movie can not help but touches deeply. There are many dimensions of love that contribute to the value of the film. Godly love is Godly love. God's love is beyond the hearts and minds and is eternal. There is love in marriage. While the main character is suffering from his wife's illness, he learns from his wife the love of God that he loves most than he can imagine. He and his wife knew one and never separated. Finally, you have a child and a parent's love. Children come together in the family and know nothing else except that love exclusion fears. Dear friends, if it comes from God, love is not love, because God is love and love comes from God. Talk to someone and tell them that you love them. If love is not given, love is not good. I pray this picture to pray and change the lives of everyone who sees it. Amen !!
