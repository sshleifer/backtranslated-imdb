<br /> <br /> She has acted in films since Anne Shirley (like Don O'Dee) has been a toddler. By 1933 she played Anv Dvork as a child in "Flower Girl" in "On Three On Man" (1932) and "The Side of Heaven" and "The Key" in 1934. George Nicholas Jnr remembered Anne's work from the previous movie and she came up with this part. She also adopted Anne Shirley as her stage name. There are memorable stories - the shale lady in a leaky boat, the "stolen" brochure, the "red hair" incident. Anne Chatty is very good for the role of the Heart orphan. She moved her heart in her intensity, she was interested in her and her fiery temper. O.P. Heggy is a good company as a good company for Matthew Cuthbert and Helen Wesley. Tom Brown is a wonderful Gilbert Blighthe. Gertrude Messinger is a good kid as Derna Barry as a child. Sarah Hadden has proven that she can play more than Andy Hardy in the series, Mrs. Barry.
