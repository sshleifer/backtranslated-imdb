One of my favorite movies to date starts with an adventure by a group of four men from Atlanta. The idea of ​​living in the Chulawasse River came from Louis of Burt Reynolds before it turned into a lake, who unconsciously sink his fellas into their worst nightmare. But if the first half of the film looks like an action movie, the second half brings the viewer into a completely different story, and our men are forced to make a decision (they) forever change their lives. In very bad ways. At the end of the film, each person is forced to deal with the scars at the end of the week on the river, but silence in the fight for survival. The film is well directed (except for some pretty clearly Goofy) and beautifully steals your breath and instinctively shot into a paradise. The photography is fantastic as well. Wright, Reynolds, Cox and Beatty are all terrific when showing how they are different from the same mistake in the same way.
