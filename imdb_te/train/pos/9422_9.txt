When I learned about Sir Alec Guinness's death, I was the first of many of his paintings for seeing me back. These amazing films commentary has been provided even after years. And Guinness helps charm weave each frame. His eyes are bright as the white suit wearing the face. He and the film should be considered lifelong favorites.
