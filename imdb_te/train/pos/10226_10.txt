When I saw the first film, I was about 7 years old. It was not very special, but a few years later I saw again and it was a lot of fun at the time. <br /> <br /> The best parts of this film are: Body language of the Yeti and <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, do not wait for a Hollywood blockbuster, this picture is made around. <br /> I have a copy of it. There are also movie and video versions (but I do not think it's always shown in the movies) <br /> <br /> Enjoy it !!! Never Yeti !!!
