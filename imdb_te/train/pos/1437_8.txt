We often watch movies about the undesirable things happening in politics, but I still recommend "City Hall". He was born to play in a role, and All Pacino stars as Mayor of New York, who act as a boy's shooting. But nothing he does does not really do. In this movie, the characters are gritty as we suspect anyone involved in the political scandal. <br /> <br /> When you watch this movie you may have your doubts. <br /> <br /> I understand that I can not say anything special about what this movie looks like, not the point. If the people at the top have the idealistic effects, the film will tears such ideas. Definitely one that I encourage you to see. John Cusack, Bridget Fonda, Danny Eyo, Anthony Francisas and David Paymer.
