If you were born at the end of the film, I had a liberal / open minded house that I had in the early 80s for the first time you were dirty movies or serious dirty movies in your parents. You know that you are not an alchemical blend of 100% non-realistic non-realistic play and profanity, or in a large duplicate machine called a VHS to insert into their collection and pop in a plastic rectangular representation of such a film. You have to be very quiet and ninja, but small heart failure when large pop sounds are made when the tablet-like buttons are pressed with the fear that is still being recognized. However, such films are awaiting your mind back and waiting, waiting to meet with such visual "art". No need to say, this image matches "T" in the above description. Many people comment on the extreme sexual nature of the film, but perhaps because I'm stuttering, I'm feeling more sensitive to sensitive things.

In socialism in 18th century France, the socially oppressed sexual nature of women? Who can say, but I would say that despite the flavor of Mr Bourovitz's sensitive, raw sexuality for his work, "the film is really about a great deal of respect for the best corner of the viewer. Once I learned it, the story is far more interesting than the giddiness of the shock value and, beyond that, it is very valuable.
