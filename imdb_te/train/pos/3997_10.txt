No moving image. I told her that she is a dear friend who is in the sixties and can not see her for the past 15 years, and she is longevity for her companionship. Being in my late 40s I am beginning to see what her complaint is. You're no longer young, beautiful or touching. May say "... the lump of this body ..." Wow. How our bodies are changing and how we are told is no longer beautiful. <br /> What she wore is that she changes the colorful scarf. <br /> <br /> It is simultaneously ludicrous and incredible. In that mourning that mourned her daughter's trust ... She chose to find herself beautiful, and ultimately to find herself through her beautiful affair. <br /> <br /> Most likely, I love this movie because it eventually displays the complex nature of relationships, family or not. We see Paula's weakness, and she has what she wants to do ... (Darren also had a baby for Darren if she wanted a baby and asked her if she wanted it). Mark hits on how film relationships can change, and is continuous, continuous. May erased his own creativity to increase a family. She is a family that she really wants, but she is "what you did in her childhood". When Darren called her an old tart, I loved the scene, and she smiled and said, "I did not call it before." It's really a film's gem. <br /> Daniel Craig. Well, I love him. I was pleasantly surprised. He is not pleasant to the eyes, he has a real talent. What a nice role. He is definitely more than any 007 and I look forward to seeing more characters of this nature. He is pleasing to me and the scene that she gives here is that he has no such control over this woman, and she is a sort of a sort of joy of being able to give this. He really enjoyed giving her pleasure. A spectacular view. By contrast, Bruce has a love scene. Bruce completely realized with his own pleasure ... two completely different men. <br /> Whoops? I wonder where my Darren is?
