This is a good picture, but it is considered to be imaginable. Change Kung Fu to Pakistani football and turkey families and you will see almost the sight of Bend It Like Beckham (2002). A good feature of the film's backbone, the progress of battles with the mysterious ninja under the road, begins with bad losses, and the Kung Fu Master has emphasized several times in the final fight, and the last fight progresses slowly against him. At a different level, the Danish life was much different than the film: Danish Citizenship, a large number of Graffiti's large number (in fact, the majority) in the Copenhagen suburb of indigenous immigrants, immigrant girl in the film's begging. When all you hear the word Danish you can paint a different picture than it is in mind.
